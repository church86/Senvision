College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Dividend Stocks That Thrive in Market Crashes These generous dividends come with an unusual immunity to weak, or unpredictable, market economies. Anders Bylund, Jordan Wathen, and Keith Noonan (TMFZahrim) Jun 10, 2017 at 3:00PM Dividend investors tend to prefer stocks with stable business platforms. In fact, many investors will flock to strong dividend payers when the market, as a whole, starts to look fragile. Strong dividends, plus resistance to a weak economy, equals a safe port in any storm. We asked three of our top contributors to share their best dividend ideas for times when the economy is weak or unpredictable. They came up with Oaktree Capital (NYSE:OAK), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). Read on to see why these three tickers are particularly well suited for income investors during difficult markets. Image source: Getty Images. A winner in cost-conscious environments Keith Noonan (McDonald's): Selecting stocks that will perform well during a market crash is a tricky proposition because it often relies on using past performance to predict future results, and the conditions that contribute to economic downturns are variable. With that caveat out of the way, it's possible to look for businesses that have characteristics that put them in positions to continue running at a high level when finances tighten, and McDonald's looks to be one such company. The fast-food giant's focus on delivering value-focused food and beverage offerings suggests that its model will continue to function, and perhaps even benefit, if consumer spending habits tighten.  While overall spending on going out to eat can be expected to decline during a recessionary period, it's not as though people will stop going out, or getting food on the run entirely, and the company's inexpensive food and drink options put The Golden Arches in position to attract a more cost-conscious public. These qualities helped McDonald's grow sales during the last recession, and its resilience propelled the company's stock up roughly 42% from 2007 to 2009, while the S&P 500 lost 36% over the same stretch. Again, these results don't guarantee that Mickey D's will outperform the market during the next market crash, but it's not hard to imagine that worsening economic conditions could see the company soak up coffee business from Starbucks, or win back customers who have drifted to fast-casual chains. With a 2.5% yield and a 40-year history of delivering annual payout increases, McDonald's looks like a solid stock for weathering a potential market downturn.  The retailer that loves penny-pinching consumers Anders Bylund (Wal-Mart Stores): When the economy is going down the tubes, consumers tend to flock to low-cost solutions for everyday problems. That's why the king of discount retail shopping is more or less immune to market crashes. Wal-Mart Stores did just fine in the 2008 panic, for example. Starting from the prices seen at the beginning of 2008, the S&P 500 market tracker plunged more than 50% over the next 15 months, while Wal-Mart stayed afloat. Five years later, when the overall market had recovered to its early 2008 levels, Sam Walton's retail empire had marched on to 42% gains: WMT data by YCharts. During the same period, Wal-Mart also increased its annual sales by 22% along a smooth growth curve. Free cash flows raced 165% higher. Oh, and its dividend kept rising every year to the tune of a 67% five-year boost. Dividend yields rose to the highest levels in the company's history, and then kept on increasing when the economic pressure lifted. Walmart is sensitive to changes in the economy, but often completely backwards compared to higher-priced retailers. This is the dividend stock I would choose if I saw dark clouds gathering on the economic horizon. Wal-Mart takes a kicking and keeps on trucking. A counter-cyclical asset manager Jordan Wathen (Oaktree Capital Group): Few financial companies get better as the world turns for the worse, but Oaktree Capital Group isn't your average financial stock. The mostly distressed-debt fund manager profits from panics, deploying billions of dollars in distressed assets to collect handsome incentive fees as markets recover. Owners of Oaktree Capital Group own more than just its eponymous asset management firm. The company has cash in excess of debt, fees it has earned but yet to receive in cash, and a stake in fixed-income manager Doubleline that I collectively value at about $22 per share. Backing these assets out of Oaktree's recent trading price of $46 per share, Oaktree's actual money-management operation only has to be worth about $24 per share. I think the operating businesses are worth about $32 per share, for a grand total of $54. The consensus view seems to be pricing in a world where Oaktree has little opportunity to deploy all the funds it has raised into distressed opportunities. With just over $100 billion in assets under management (AUM), about $21 billion is "shadow AUM" that hasn't been deployed. Every year that the calendar turns without a significant downturn is a year in which its forward earnings power declines. Of course, markets don't go up in a nearly straight line forever. The only question is when Oaktree can put its clients' assets to work. I think it'll happen sooner rather than later, and its current 6% yield makes it an attractive stock to own.

Rumors holding that Jelly Sandals vended by Walmart contain unsafe levels of lead are based on unofficial Facebook posts. 99 CLAIM Jelly Sandals sold by Walmart contain unsafe amounts of lead. UNPROVEN RATING UNPROVEN ORIGIN A series of Facebook posts claiming that Jelly Sandals (or Jellies) sold at Walmart stores contain a dangerous amount of lead circulated in June 2017, such as the following post: BEWARE PARENTS! I took Adelynn to her well checkup the other day and her routine lead screen came back positive. They took a capillary sample from her toe and the first test resulted in a 14.3 and on repeat it was 8.6 (a normal result is less 3.3) of course I was shocked and began racking my brain for what could be the cause. After a google search I saw some people talking about their kids having a positive lead screen from wearing Walmart jellies. Adelynn was wearing these Walmart jellies the day of her screen. I bought a lead test from Lowes and sure enough the jellies tested positive for lead. We had a venous sample drawn to see if she was absorbing it systemically but the results aren’t back yet. UPDATE! The health dept called me today and said that her serum lead levels were thankfully normal! So it was obviously something her skin came into contact with. Am I 100% sure it was these shoes…no…but these $5 shoes are not worth the stress. Sadly, Walmart and jellies aren’t the only culprits here and I encourage all parents to just be aware of things they put on their kids that aren’t made in the US. Similar claims were made by other Facebook users. One, for instance, reported that her daughter, who “basically only wears” Jellies, also demonstrated elevated lead levels: None of the postings holding that Walmart’s Jellies contained lead came from or cited an official source, such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Protection Agency, or Walmart, nor did they rely upon confirmed laboratory testing. Rather, one posting was based on a home test kit and the other on speculation. While some social media users asserted that they tested Jellies and found that they contained unsafe levels of lead, others performed the same testing and found that the products were apparently safe: It should also be noted that this rumor is based on the testing of individual products, and not all Jelly sandals. Walmart has not issued a recall on any of their Jelly shoe products: We haven’t come across any recalls for jelly shoes. However, please be assured that whenever recalls are issued, we take immediate steps to comply with them. If you ever have questions about a product, you can visit http://corporate.walmart.com/recalls to check the recent recall list issued by government regulatory agencies responsible for product recalls.  Snopes Delivered to Your Inbox: Feedback Filed Under: facebook jellies jelly sandals +1 more walmart Fact Checker: Dan Evon Published: Jun 10th, 2017 Get Daily Updates From Snopes.com View All Featured Video DidLondonersChantinSupportofDonaldTrumpintheAftermathofaTerroristAttack?

You have probably seen me write about Swagbucks here on the blog. It's a site where you earn points (called SB) for things you're probably doing online already, like searching, watching videos, discovering deals, shopping online and taking surveys. Then you take those points and exchange them for gift cards to places like Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, Target, CVS, Domino's, PayPal cash and more! Unlike a lot of other rewards sites, you can cash out at any time, and they have gift cards for as little as 300 SB (The $3 Amazon gift card - every little bit helps)! This month, you can get a 500 SB bonus (worth $5 in gift cards) through this blog when you sign up! Here's how it works: 1. Sign up at Swagbucks.com HERE. Click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get a bonus. 2. Earn 300 SB points total before 7/1/17 and you'll get a $3 (300 SB) bonus! 3. If you spend at least $25 through the Swagbucks Shop section, you'll get another $2 (200 SB) bonus on top of the cash back you'll get from shopping. You must receive your shopping SB before August 1st to get the 200 SB bonus. If I am doing any online shopping, I go through the Swagbucks Shop section if the store is participating so I can earn SB points for every purchase. I've used the Swagbucks Shop section for online shopping at stores including Amazon, Kohl's, Walmart, Target, Groupon and more. I usually cash in my SB points for CVS and Sheetz gift cards which means I use my SB for free toilet paper, free bath & beauty products and free gas! New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events (which we post about here on the blog and Swagbucks posts about on their website in the Swagbucks Blog section. * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Recently, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. I used a coupon code for a percent off when I made the purchase and qualified for free shipping and got the SB points added to my account a couple weeks later. * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus. Make sure you use all caps since it is case sensitive. . . Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links and we appreciate your using them!

Got it! Share Tweet Pin ✉Email Earlier this month, a Walmart superstore in Warr Acres, Oklahoma debuted a 20-foot-by-80-foot, self-serving kiosk. It's a mighty edifice that houses freezers and fridges, operating all day, seven days a week, in the parking lot of the store. The kiosk operates something like a large vending machine. Customers approach the kiosk and enter a five-digit code they received after placing orders online. They must have purchased at least $30 worth of groceries. Within seconds, a locker containing their bagged orders opens up for retrieval. Advertisement This pilot project is the first of its kind for Walmart, though the chain has flirted with various streamlining innovations in the past three years, from online orders to home delivery services to smaller vending machines within stores. This move seems to be Walmart’s own signal that it’s trying to jostle for dominance in the quickening race to become the Redbox of American supermarkets. Walmart’s most direct competitor is Amazon, who’s recently waltzed into this space with its AmazonFresh Pickup service within Seattle. It’s somewhat similar to Walmart’s giant vending machine from the future. You can pick up your pre-bagged groceries within 15 minutes of ordering online, and they’ll be loaded into your car by Amazon employees. There’s no minimum order charge. Walmart’s been mum about when this project will expand to other cities, though expansion seems to be their aim, given the fact that they first announced their intention to debut this project in March. The only support they currently offer for customers who run into any trouble is a 24-hour phone line that’s accessible from the parking lot. Advertisement ♥ + The Grocery Store America Loves Most by Mayukh Sen Convenience is a double-edged sword: Look no further than Amazon's own cashier-free grocery store, mired with issues that result from assuming that human behavior can be automated easily. How Walmart's service works out the kinks in a service that’s so depersonalized will determine whether this great, big dispensary from the future will change the way America gets its groceries. For the time-crunched and interaction-averse, though, this certainly sounds like a dream. Tags: walmart, amazon 💬 View Comments () Share this Article Tweet this Article Want more Food52?

A man and two women purchased items from the Liberty Walmart at 200 Goldie Road using counterfeit bills, police said.

The suspects then took those items to the Boardman Walmart at 1300 Doral Drive. Police did not know whether they used counterfeit bills there. The suspects were seen driving a small green SUV.

(KTRK) KTRK Friday, June 09, 2017 08:57PM PORTER, Texas (KTRK) -- A 24-year-old Porter man accused of exposing himself to a female shopper at a local Walmart turned himself in to police after seeing his photograph on social media. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office posted surveillance photos of the flashing suspect earlier this week that were also distributed to local media. After seeing the images, Najee Harris surrendered to deputies on Friday, according to deputies. In a Facebook post, Montgomery County Sheriff Rand Henderson thanked the department's social media followers for "putting the pressure on Mr. Harris to turn himself in." "This is how we work together to solve problems in our community," Henderson said.

Wehby, who is also a government senator, said that the agreement will give the local company access to some 240 Walmart stores in Atlanta, Florida and New Jersey. “The strategy of this acquisition is very, very clear and is simple to articulate, when you look at the Hispanic market in the US which is a US$5 billion market, and the Caribbean market which is like US$200 million to US$300 million,” he told last week's annual general meeting of the the GraceKennedy Group in Kingston. He noted that the market was already being led by the Goya brand, with other brands like Iberia running second which is where GraceKennedy expects the local brand to reach when the marketing and distribution gets into full stride. The move follows a Business Observer story in April that GraceKennedy was already selling patties to in South Florida via supermarket chains, including Winn-dixie, Broward Meat and Fish, Bravo and Presidente supermarkets. GraceKennedy bought La Fe Foods Inc, through its wholly owned subsidiary, GraceKennedy Foods (USA) LLC GraceKennedy (GK) in July 2014, making it one of the Caribbean's largest and most dynamic corporate entities in the USA. “Our focus is that, with the Grace brand and La Fe, we want to break out into a clear number two in the United States, and I can assure you as owners of this company, it is going to be a game -changer. I can assure you of that, because you are talking about significant additions to our revenues,” Senator Wehby told the meeting. “It's not going to be easy. It's not going to happen overnight. But we are very focused in terms of executing the strategy, and that vision of being the number two brand in terms of the ethnic market in the United States of America, and remember the size of that market,” he added. In an earlier response to the Jamaica Observer about the expectations for the new development, Wehby had noted that there are no plans to introduce Grace patties to Jamaica. He said that the focus was on growing the product in the international markets, starting with the USA where there is a significant market of core Jamaican consumers, as well as potential mainstream consumers in developed markets. Wehby also had high praises for GraceKennedy's Canadian establishment which recently had a name change from GraceKennedy Ontario to Grace Foods Canada Inc. “This is a crown jewel. It has been a star a real star, and I think that the name change ahs gone across very well,” he said. Wehby also saluted GraceKennedy's 95 years in business, having started operating in February 1922. He noted that when the company was established it had set itself some very high level targets, including obtaining 50 per cent of its revenue from outside Jamaica, and has continued to build on its relationship with international partners and multinationals, which started with Western Union. “I think we are doing pretty well. We are on track. Revenues for 2016 are 51.4 per cent out of Jamaica. You will note that our North American market grew nicely, too. That's because of our acquisition of of what is now GraceKennedy USA. We also performed very well in the Caribbean, which has grown to 7.3 per cent, with Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana being the main drivers of that growth,” he told the meeting. In terms of Europe, he noted that there was a decrease in terms of the contribution from that geographical area, but he had an explanation for that. “When we examined it, in terms of growth in pounds (sterling), they actually grew, but because of devaluation, and this may sound funny to many Jamaicans, but the pound (sterling) actually devalued against the Jamaican dollar, and we know why: Because of Brexit, etcetera,” he explained. He said that, in terms of profits, 41 per cent was generated from outside of Jamaica and 59 per cent from inside. He however noted that there was an “exceptional gain” in the actual numbers for last year, in which the company benefited from a one-off gain of $425 million, due to a new policy of liquidating non-operating subsidiaries, which has reduced the need for costs like audit fees. He said that in the first quarter of 2017, the company has continued to perform well in relation to revenues, which grew by 7.1 per cent, or $1.6 billion increasing total revenues to $23.6 billion. He said, however, profit for the first quarter of this recorded a reduction of $27 million or 2.4 per cent. Among the reasons for this, he said, was increases in asset tax, especially relating to its banking subsidiary, First Global. But, according to Wehby, despite being slightly behind the previous first quarter figures, the company was actually ahead of targets for the quarter.       ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES 1.

Haro, 30, defeated California's Daniel Franco, 25, in a nationally televised fight on Saturday night at the WinnaVegas Casino Arena in Sloan, Iowa. The win as a decided underdog means Haro, who improved to 14-1-1 in his professional boxing career, is eligible to fight for the WBC and WBA featherweight title belts. Haro dominated almost every round of the fight on CBS Sports Network, despite Franco having a 4-inch height advantage. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Haro had Franco in trouble in several rounds, and knocked down the 5-foot-9 boxer early in the eighth round. After Franco adamantly said "yes, sir," when the referee asked him if he wanted to continue, Haro quickly moved in and attacked with several body blows. Two minutes and 43 seconds into the eighth round, Haro delivered an overhand right that caught Franco flush on the chin and dropped him to the canvas as the referee stopped the fight before even attempting to start a 10-count. "To be honest with you, I haven't fought for a whole year, so I was very nervous coming in," Haro said. It didn't show. Haro's wife, Yesenia, delivered the couple's fifth child last month and watched the fight with family members back in Utah. Haro thanked his wife for her support in the post-fight news conference, saying he wouldn't be able to pursue his boxing career and work full time as a salesman for Pepsi-Cola if it weren't for her sacrificing her career as a dental assistant to raise their children. "I would also like to thank Daniel Franco for the opportunity to fight him. It's been hard for me to get fights," Haro said.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR SPORTS Utah Jazz: UCLA forward TJ Leaf works out for the Jazz -- with one caveat NBA: Warriors' Draymond Green will be on the court for this Finals Game 5 Boxing: Hall of famer Evander Holyfield says mom wouldn't let him quit Boxing: California fighter in coma after loss to Utah's Jose Haro Utah Jazz: Karl Malone disputes his greatness, talks favorite cereals with Jimmy Kimmel Tennis: Nadal tops Wawrinka for record 10th French Open NBA: LeBron says he'd want Magic, Jordan as his 3-on-3 teammates Membership ELEVATE Five pitfalls to avoid when buying a condo or townhouse   Utah Arts Festival: Four days of music, culture...and art!   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS VIEW/POST COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks That Feel Like Wal-Mart in 1970 Companies that could follow in the footsteps of the world's largest retailer are few and far between, but our analysts see these three as having similar strategic advantages. Daniel Miller, Sean Williams, and Rich Smith (TMFTwoCoins) Jun 10, 2017 at 8:10PM Let's be honest with each other: There aren't any brick-and-mortar companies today that are similar to what Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was in 1970 -- that's just not how the world works anymore. That said, there are companies out there that have similar advantages to those Wal-Mart enjoyed in its younger days, and could provide similarly powerful long-term wealth generation to investors who buy in now. When we asked three of our analysts to suggest companies that remind them in some ways of early-era Wal-Mart, they picked Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA), Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Freshpet Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT). Allow them to explain why. Scale and convenience Daniel Miller (Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers): One company that's been high on my list for some time shares two important qualities with Wal-Mart: It has scale in a fragmented industry, and it's a one-stop shop. For those unaware, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers is the world's largest auctioneer of industrial and agricultural equipment through public auction sites and online bidding processes. RBA auction in Houston. Image source: Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. In fact, it's the largest auction company in the world, and dwarfs its competition, but the industry is so fragmented that RBA's sales account for only about 4% of the total. That gives RBA a massive advantage over its rivals and ample room for growth, both by acquisitions and by offering customers a better auction option. Another way that RBA reminds me of Wal-Mart is that it has recently become a one-stop shop for its customers. Its recent acquisition of IronPlanet -- a pure online auction platform -- has turned it into a multichannel company where consumers can sell or list equipment, how and where they want, finance purchases, and reach an audience across the globe. Those two factors create a network effect for the company and its investors. RBA is becoming the go-to option for sellers, which in turn lures in more buyers -- a virtuous cycle that should lead to years of strong top- and bottom-line growth. It could be time for a new retail paradigm Rich Smith (Etsy): When Wal-Mart went public on Oct. 1, 1970, I was all of 1 year old -- and honestly, I wasn't paying much attention to the stock market at the time. That being the case, I can't really speak from personal experience about how Walmart "felt" in 1970 -- but I can hazard a guess. You see, while I wasn't really aware of stocks (or companies, or even object permanence) in 1970 per se, I became more aware of things shortly thereafter, and I remember how retail worked back then. We had a number of stores in our small town. There was the grocery store for groceries, and the drugstore for drugs. We bought our tool, nails, and screws, at the hardware store, and got our Purina for the dogs and cats, and oats for the horse at the Grain & Supply -- a store for every product, and a separate set of products sold at every store. At the same time, and not far away, Walmart was disrupting the retail industry by putting all, or at least many, of these products under one roof. That's what people wanted, and that's what Walmart gave them. Today, it feels like times are changing once more. I get the feeling people are looking for goods that are more unusual than the mass-produced merchandise Walmart sells, and that's where Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) comes in. An online marketplace for unique, often-handmade, goods set up in 2005, Etsy has been growing rapidly. From 2012 (the first year for which data is public) through 2015 (when it IPO'ed), it grew revenues 265%. Since its IPO, Etsy's annual sales have risen 39% more. Etsy is not yet profitable, but it has generated positive free cash flow in each of the past five years, and is churning out cash at the rate of about $20 million  a year today. At 81 times free cash flow, Etsy stock is not cheap. But from this point near the start of its lifetime as a publicly traded company, there's no telling how much higher its stock could rise. Plenty of paw-tential  Sean Williams (Freshpet): Some 47 years ago, Wal-Mart went public, and no investors then could have guessed what a retail juggernaut it would become. Wal-Mart's ability to understand its consumers, to price its products so competitively, and the vastness of the retail network it has built on those foundations, have been critical components of its success. Though it could be darn near impossible to predict the next Wal-Mart, one retailer that shares some striking similarities with that company circa 1970 is natural pet food provider Freshpet. Wal-Mart's niche has always been to attract consumers with its low and competitive pricing. Freshpet isn't going to be able to undercut the pricing models of larger pet-food providers, but it's giving pet owners something else they're struggling to find with regularity: natural and organic pet food options for domestic pets. Just as the food industry has found that consumers will pay more for organic foods based on the perception that those products are better for them, Freshpet is capitalizing on consumers' desire to make a similar choice for their pets. According to the American Pet Products Association, spending on domestic pets has grown from $17 billion in 1994 to an estimated $69 billion in 2017. Some $28.2 billion of that 2017 total will be on food. That's a very steady growth opportunity that Freshpet can take advantage of.  More importantly, Freshpet is just beginning to see the benefits of increasing consumer awareness and product penetration. While there are more than 16,600 Freshpet fridges in retailers nationwide, its penetration rate is a mere 1.4%, and consumer awareness 35% --  well below its peers, but also understandable considering how small the company is. New TV and digital marketing campaigns that are rolling out this year should increase sales, improve margins, and further enhance customer loyalty. Freshpet is forecasting sales of as much as $300 million by 2020 (they were just $133 million in 2016), infrastructure expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to decline from 27% to 18%. Lastly, Freshpet is generating strong loyalty among its customers, just as  Wal-Mart has done with its core consumers throughout the past four-plus decades. Consumer repeat rates for Freshpet have grown from 58% in 2013 to 71% by 2016. These repeat customers are critical for Freshpet to grow its business. With a sustainable 15% to 20% growth rate, an adjusted gross margin expectation of approximately 52% by 2020, and free cash flow of roughly 15% of total sales (meaning perhaps $45 million in 2020 based on $300 million in sales), Freshpet looks like a niche mini-Wal-Mart in the making.  Daniel Miller has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(KTRK) KTRK Saturday, June 10, 2017 08:45AM PORTER, Texas -- A 24-year-old Texas man accused of exposing himself to a female shopper at a local Walmart turned himself in to police after seeing his photograph on social media. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office posted surveillance photos of the flashing suspect earlier this week that were also distributed to local media. After seeing the images, Najee Harris surrendered to deputies on Friday, according to deputies. In a Facebook post, Montgomery County Sheriff Rand Henderson thanked the department's social media followers for "putting the pressure on Mr. Harris to turn himself in." "This is how we work together to solve problems in our community," Henderson said.

Greg Foran, chief executive officer of Wal-Mart's U.S. stores, said last week if he were asked to write down everything that will happen over the next few years, most of it would be wrong. Foran said he's "just not that smart" at projecting what ideas will and won't stick with consumers. "What I do know is that you need to have a few things in the hopper," Foran said. "You need to be prepared to get out there to have a shot." Wal-Mart spent much of its shareholders week, which ended June 2, demonstrating its commitment to trying new things, detailing innovations that are being tested and implemented as the retailer races against competitors to meet the needs of consumers. Those ideas touch nearly every aspect of the business, from new technology aimed at helping workers perform their jobs better to services designed to let customers choose how they want to shop at the retailer, whether it's online, in the store or a combination of both. One of Wal-Mart's newest tests is a delivery service that will pay workers to drop off packages at the end of their store shifts. The service, which is voluntary for employees, was designed to tap into what Wal-Mart believes are its advantages -- 1.5 million U.S. employees and 4,700 stores -- to help lower delivery costs and get products to customers quicker. Marc Lore, Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce chief, said the concept has the potential to be a game-changer. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon took a more cautious approach. He said to expect a slow process and added employee delivery will be one piece of Wal-Mart's last-mile delivery strategy. Last week, Wal-Mart also revealed it had recently opened an automated grocery pickup kiosk in Warr Acres, Okla., that will operate 24 hours a day and allow customers to place grocery orders online and collect them in a minute or less. Wal-Mart has installed pickup towers -- giant vending machines nicknamed Rapunzel -- at some stores that quickly dispense items purchased online. The company continues to test grocery delivery in about 10 stores through a partnership with ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft, which was announced last year. "Not everything that we do will actually stick and that's the nature of the business we're in," Foran said. "But that's the nature of trying to predict the future." Executives believe the commitment to innovation has played a role in Wal-Mart's success during a challenging time for retailers. While sales have declined at other big-name chains, Wal-Mart reported same-store sales growth of 1.4 percent and traffic increases of 1.5 percent in the first quarter. U.S. e-commerce sales also increased 63 percent. Sucharita Mulpuru, an independent retail analyst, said last month companies can't expect a 100 percent success rate as they test new ideas. But the chances of developing a successful idea are much greater for a company like Wal-Mart if they're willing to make their share of calculated risks. "I think the hope is very much to do like what Google, Facebook and Amazon have done, which is kind of throw a lot of things against the wall," Mulpuru said, pointing to Wal-Mart's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. "If one of the experiments sticks and could be an engine of growth for the future, that is so worth all of the pain that may come with experiments that fail." Some ideas have taken hold at Wal-Mart the past two years, including curbside grocery pickup service. Wal-Mart is continuing to roll out the service -- in which customers order groceries online, drive to the store and have employees bring them out to their vehicles -- rapidly this year. Wal-Mart also recognized Senior Vice President Daniel Eckert on June 2 as the company's annual entrepreneur award winner for the creation and implementation of Walmart Pay, a mobile payment service. Wal-Mart initially tested the service in a few stores before rolling it out nationwide last year and the company said last week there had been 7.3 million transactions through Walmart Pay. "Hopefully one of the themes you've picked up on is we're working on culture," McMillon told investors June 2 in Fayetteville. "More creativity, more risk taking, more innovation and more speed. ... You have to work in a different way and you've got to be faster and more creative and I'm pleased that we're seeing some progress there." McMillon believes the company has moved away from a time where it was "replicating" ideas to pushing for innovation. But there is much more work to do because "it's competitive out there." That's one reason why Wal-Mart set up Store No. 8, a Silicon Valley-based innovation hub, according to Lore. He said it's challenging to think about future innovations while operating the business on a day-to-day basis. So Store No. 8 was designed to identify, invent and invest in ideas like virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It's hard to identify exactly what commerce will look like in five or 10 years, but Foran believes his time spent in stores does offer a glimpse as customers increasingly use their mobile devices to check online prices, inventory and other information as they shop. "You can assume that they're going to want as little friction in this as you can put in place," Foran said. "What that all transpires into, I'm not 100 percent sure. What I do try to do and make sure that all of us do is keep our minds as open as we can to what that may mean and what it may look like."

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz May 16, 2017: 10:55 AM ET Is the mall dead? It looks like most builders aren't buying plywood, concrete, bricks and other construction supplies from Amazon. Or even Walmart. They are doing so at Home Depot -- and that's why it is a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy time for traditional retailers. Home Depot reported earnings and revenues that topped Wall Street's forecasts Tuesday. The company also raised its profit outlook for the year. And it reported a same-store sales increase (stores open at least a year) of 5.5% overall and 6% in the US. Home Depot (HD) stock rose 2% in early trading to a new all-time high. The stock is now up nearly 20% this year, making it one of the top performers in the Dow this year -- along with Apple (AAPL, Tech30), McDonald's (MCD) and Visa (V). Home Depot is benefiting from a strong housing market. So is its rival Lowe's (LOW), which will report its latest results on May 24. Shares of Lowe's are up 20% this year as well. During a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Home Depot chief financial officer Carol Tomé said that the housing market continues to grow despite mixed forecasts for the overall economy. Housing prices have been steadily on the rise, which motivates prospective sellers to do home improvement projects to maximize the sale price for their house. Related: Retail train wreck continues as many big chains post declining sales Home Depot isn't ignoring the digital opportunities that have helped Amazon and Walmart either. Quite the contrary. Home Depot CEO Craig Menear said during the conference call that online sales rose 23% in the most recent quarter. But it clearly helps that both Home Depot and Lowe's are specialty stores that sell things that many people still want to buy at physical locations, especially professional builders and contractors. Menear added during the call that sales to its "Pro" customer segment continue to outpace that of average DIY customers looking to fix a broken closet door or leaky faucet. Still, Home Depot remains one of the exceptions in an otherwise dismal environment for many retailers. Related: Rue21 is the latest retailer to file for Chapter 11 Teen apparel retailer Rue21 announced Tuesday it was filing for bankruptcy protection, joining a long and growing list of retailers that have been forced to go the Chapter 11 route, such as Aeropostale, Wet Seal, Pacific Sunwear and The Sports Authority. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), once one of the hottest apparel chains for young adults, is looking to sell itself to a buyer as its sales continue to fall. Department stores Macy's (M), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have been struggling to compete with Amazon and Walmart as well. And two other retailers reported weak sales and gave sluggish outlooks on Tuesday -- T.J. Maxx and Marshalls owner TJX (TJX) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). Shares of TJX fell 4% on the news while Dick's stock plunged 12%. That makes the gains for Home Depot on Tuesday all the more impressive. The company's signature color is orange. But perhaps Home should change that to green instead. It's one of the few traditional retailers not in the red lately, after all.

These Apps Turn Saving Money Into a Game — Are They Worth It? By Carrie Kirby on 9 June 2017 0 comments Tweet Share on Facebook Tweet This Pin It Wise Bread Picks Travel Rewards Credit Cards Cash Back Credit Cards 0% Balance Transfer Credit Cards If you have two dollars in your hand, do you save it or buy a scratch-off lottery ticket? We all know that the sensible choice is to put that money right in the bank. But the reality is, at today's anemic interest rates, saving is boring. The chance of winning a prize is exciting. What if you could have both the long-term financial benefit of saving, and the momentary thrill of getting a chance to win a prize? Combining responsible behavior and fun is the idea behind a crop of products and services that gamify saving money. Let's look at the pros and cons of some of these prize-linked savings products, which allow users the chance to win money without risking any of their own. 1. Long Game At first, Long Game sounds like the same humdrum routine. It offers a savings account that you link to your regular checking account; money you transfer to savings earns 0.1 percent interest. But here's where it gets good: Long Game rewards you for depositing money into savings with "coins." You can use your coins to buy virtual lottery tickets, and the prizes are either real cash or more coins. One nice feature of Long Game is that it doesn't charge fees. Another aspect, which could be either a feature or a drawback, depending on your interests, is that you have to actually play games, like spinning a wheel, to win money. Personally, I don't have the time for such games and would rather get automatic entries, but for people like my grandmother who play fake online slots just for fun, this could be a plus. 2. Wal-Mart MoneyCard Walmart's MoneyCard was already a popular way for low-income, unbanked workers to store their paycheck and pay bills. Now, it's also billing itself as a savings vehicle, with a feature called Vault that allows users to set aside money that can't be spent on purchases (unless you transfer that money back out of the Vault). Recently, Wal-Mart debuted the Prize Savings program for MoneyCard, which gives card users chances to win up to $1,000 each month. The more money you keep in the Vault, the more chances you get to win. This program differs from Long Game in several notable ways: One, you don't need a separate bank account to participate — MoneyCard functions as a bank account replacement. Two, money in the Vault does not earn interest. Three, MoneyCard charges several fees: a $5 monthly fee, $3–$4.95 to put money on the card, and a $2.50 fee to get cash at an ATM. Fourth, you don't have to enter the drawing — putting the money in your Vault enters you automatically. 3. SaveUp Link your savings and debt-bearing accounts to SaveUp, and you'll be rewarded with credits not just for saving money, but also for paying down debt. The credits can be used to buy virtual lotto tickets for cash prizes, including $50 weekly drawings and a monthly chance at a $2 million "super jackpot." SaveUp is free to join. As with Long Game, you have to actively play to win; entries are not automatic. 4. Save to Win The only nonprofit on this list, Save to Win rewards credit union members with weekly and monthly prize drawings; the more you deposit, the more entries you get. Prizes vary by state but generally start at $25 and can go into the thousands. Save to Win is currently available at select credit unions in 13 states. Once you're enrolled in Save to Win, entry is automatic, so you don't need to remember to play the game. 5. Tip Yourself This one is not a prize-linked program, but another gamified approach to saving money. Tip Yourself encourages users to transfer money from their checking account into a virtual "tip jar" as a reward for performing a desirable activity. The "tip jar" is a non-interest-paying account. It's an interesting idea for combining savings and self-motivation. I can imagine using Tip Yourself to save for a trip or a small goal like a spa pedicure; every time you exercise, you could reward yourself by moving some money to the trip or spa fund. It doesn't cost money to make the transfer. However, since the tip jar doesn't pay interest, it seems like you would be better off setting up a money market account linked to your checking account for saving toward a goal; most banks offer that option. The take-away The majority of these apps share a common drawback: To use them, you have to share your bank account information, which could put your account at risk if the company gets hacked. It also calls your financial privacy into question; if you plan to use any of these, study the company's privacy policy before taking the plunge. Several of these apps encourage users to keep savings in accounts that don't pay interest. Even though current interest rates are low, that makes little sense to me. If you are a member of a credit union that offers it, using the nonprofit Save to Win is a no-brainer. It won't take you any extra time to play, and it doesn't appear that you'd sacrifice security or privacy to do so. For the rest of these apps, carefully weigh the value of your privacy, security, and any financial costs against the chance of winning before committing.

Apr 25, 2017 Asia-Pacific India Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Late last year, Morgan Stanley marked down the valuation of Indian internet “unicorn” Flipkart by 38%, taking it to a low of $5.54 billion compared to the peak $15.5 billion it stood at in 2015. This was the fourth consecutive markdown by the New York-based global financial services firm. Even as the media was full of reports of Sachin and Binny Bansal (the unrelated cofounders of Flipkart) attempting to secure funding from larger firms – Walmart was rumored to be interested – India’s leading e-commerce site sprang a surprise: In early April, it announced fresh funding at a post-transaction valuation of $11.6 billion. Executive chairman Sachin Bansal, who had described the valuation markdowns from Morgan Stanley and others including U.S.-based Vanguard, Fidelity and Valic as “a very uninformed opinion,” stood vindicated. “This deal helps Flipkart secure some strategic investors who can bring technology and operational expertise, something much needed to solidify its market leadership,” says Sandy Shen, research director at Gartner. “This is different from the previous rounds of mostly financial investors. So Flipkart is getting more than just the funding.” More than the valuation, it’s the credentials of the strategic investors who have come in that matter. The biggest slice of the $1.4 billion investment is $700 million from Chinese tech giant Tencent. EBay will invest $500 million. But it is also selling its local operations to Flipkart for $200 million. Microsoft brings up the rear with $200 million. “Today we entered into strategic agreements with three of the world’s biggest tech companies who join us as partners in our Indian e-commerce journey,” said group CEO Binny Bansal in an email to employees. Amazon vs. Flipkart The battle-lines are being drawn in India’s e-commerce arena. On one side is Amazon. During a visit to India, CEO Jeff Bezos said that the company plans to invest an additional $3 billion in its operations in the country to take its outlay in India to over $5 billion. On the other are Flipkart and its backers. Tencent is the largest company by market cap on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Last year, it overtook e-commerce rival Alibaba. The San Jose-based eBay may have given up its India dreams; it will be a part of Flipkart but operate as an independent company. It helps that eBay India will report to Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, who came to the firm from eBay Asia-Pacific. And Microsoft, which already has a deal with Flipkart for the latter to use its Azure cloud platform, is adding fertilizer for possible future growth in business. The deal comes at a time when the internet space in India — including e-commerce — is undergoing a major shakeout. EBay, which tried to add muscle after its acquisition of fellow e-tailer baazee.com in 2005, is seeing the flip side of takeovers today. Online marketplace ShopClues, which was planning a Nasdaq IPO later this year, has had to push back plans after a cofounder alleged fraud against the rest of the team. Image messaging firm Snapchat, fresh from a successful $3.4 billion IPO in the U.S., is being blackballed in India because of a reported statement by its CEO that he doesn’t “want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.” (The allegation was made in a lawsuit filed by a former employee in a U.S. court; the company has denied it.) The CEO of homestay platform Stayzilla is out on bail after nearly a month in jail on charges of fraud filed by its vendor Jigsaw Solutions. Jigsaw owner Radha Shekhar has written to New Delhi politicians – including the prime minister — saying that Stayzilla should be investigated “instead of letting them take cover behind the startup ecosystem.” “The real challenge for large Indian companies like Flipkart and Ola is that India’s capital markets aren’t as large and mature as those in the U.S.” –Kartik Hosanagar List of Casualties Then there is online marketplace Snapdeal, facing a financial crisis and being pushed by SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications and Internet company with major technology-related investments, into a merger with Flipkart. (SoftBank holds a 35% stake in Jasper Infotech, Snapdeal’s parent.) An email to employees by Snapdeal cofounders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal captures all that is wrong with e-commerce in India today: “Over the past two-three years, with all the capital coming into this market, our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes. We started growing our business much before the right economic model and market fit was figured out… [Today] we are combining teams, reducing layers, eliminating non-core projects and strengthening the focus on profitable growth. Let’s remember: GMV (gross merchandise volume) is vanity. Profit is sanity.” A third force seems to be emerging to challenge Amazon and Flipkart. The SoftBank Group is in talks to put in between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in electronics payments provider Paytm, making it one of the largest shareholders in the fintech startup. “The deal could increase Paytm’s valuation to $7 billion-$9 billion,” reports Mint business daily. “SoftBank’s potential investment in Paytm and another $1 billion bet on Flipkart is likely to make its chief Masayoshi Son the toughest competitor Bezos will ever have faced in India,” notes The Economic Times. “There are two parallel deals expected in 2017 that could define the way the Indian e-commerce sector moves for at least the next three years.” Alibaba of China is an investor in Paytm e-commerce. Sponsored Content: In this expansion and consolidation process, a lot of questions are being asked. Is it too early for e-commerce to take root in India? Is brick-and-mortar retail going to dominate for many more years to come? Does India need a different e-commerce model? Is “capital dumping” at the core of the problem? Capital Dumping Take capital dumping first. The three prominent voices against capital dumping are Flipkart’s Sachin Bansal, ride services firm Ola cofounder Bhavish Aggarwal, and Vani Kola, managing director of Kalaari Capital, a venture capital (VC) major. Their demand: the government should stop foreign funding of their rivals (like Amazon and Uber) and create a level playing field. “What we need to do is what China did [15 years ago] and tell the world we need your capital, but we don’t need your companies,” said Bansal at a meeting in Bangalore. Added Aggarwal: “The real fight is on capital, not innovation. The markets are being distorted by capital.” “We support free flow of capital that is not only good for customers, but also helps create jobs [and] develop infrastructure, aids the growth of small businesses, and facilitates India’s economic development,” says Amit Agarwal, senior vice president and country head, Amazon India. He has no comment on Flipkart’s capital harvesting. “As a company we are customer focused and not competition obsessed,” he adds. “All e-tailers are desperately trying to get out of this vicious cycle [of discounts]. This is not a sustainable business model.” –Ashis Mishra “Personally, I don’t buy the capital dumping arguments,” says Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions. “Small retailers who got crushed by venture-funded startups like Flipkart could have claimed capital dumping back then. Local companies have access to private equity markets and can technically raise lots of capital there if they can convince investors of their long-term potential. The real challenge for large Indian companies like Flipkart and Ola is that India’s capital markets aren’t as large and mature as those in the U.S. So Indian players will find it hard to raise the mammoth funds needed to compete with Western counterparts who commit billions of dollars to India. The solution isn’t to block investment by Western companies, but ask how we can address the capital market challenges faced by private companies.” Adds venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy in a post on LinkedIn: “Of course, the same level playing fields were not deemed necessary by the same VCs when Big Bazaar [a brick-and-mortar retailer] petitioned the government for them against Myntra [an online fashion store] and Flipkart, and when small shopkeepers asked for protection against Snapdeal.” Whether the dumping argument will itself be dumped, one thing is clear: The era of massive discounts in order to grow business has to come to an end. According to Mint, financial 2015-2016 (year ended March) saw Amazon record revenues of Rs2,275 crore (about $350 million) with a loss of Rs3,572 crore ($550 million). Flipkart wasn’t much better. It had revenues of Rs1,952 crore ($300 million) and a loss of Rs2,306 crore ($350 million). “As a company policy we do not comment on financials” says Agarwal. “That being said, we have seen a healthy growth in India. In 2016 we have grown over 100% year-on-year despite demonetization and other headwinds. For Amazon, India is one of the highest priority investments.” (Flipkart did not respond to Knowledge@Wharton’s queries.) “All e-tailers are desperately trying to get out of this vicious cycle,” says Ashis Mishra, professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore. “This is not a sustainable business model.” No Fundamental Problem “Does India need a different model: I don’t think so,” counters Hosanagar. “There is no fundamental problem with the e-commerce market in India. The case for e-commerce is strong. First, urban areas have traffic congestion issues and high real estate costs, making e-commerce attractive. Smaller towns don’t offer great product selection. The issue in India has been twofold. First, in their intense battle for marketshare, all companies have discounted too aggressively, and that isn’t sustainable in the long run. Second, investors like SoftBank and Tiger Global created a bit of a frenzy by over-investing at unreasonable valuations. These created the current issues and not any supply-demand fundamentals. I imagine all this will get sorted out in the next couple of years.” Others see problems that will take longer to resolve. “India’s online retail market is at an early stage and is lagging compared to many other markets in volume and maturity,” says Shen. “Given the not-so-well-established retail infrastructure, e-commerce is an efficiency channel for merchants to reach out to a wide audience and scale up quickly. As more businesses are moving to the digital channel in a way to follow their customers, e-commerce will see high growth down the road.” She lists some shortcomings of the market: “Some key challenges: User behavior takes time to establish for online shopping (currently more limited to the elite group); product/brand choice ranges are not great; logistics can be difficult in rural and remote areas; and digital payment is not widely established, though demonetization and Aadhaar (the universal biometric identity card) will move this forward quickly.” “India has a multiple economy — that of the metros and big cities, smaller towns and rural area,” says Mishra, who has worked on retail atmospherics and retail consumer behavior. “E-tail in metros and big cities may establish itself after reasonable consolidation in the next two-three years. Smaller towns are just having a taste of modern retailing. Online is catching up; still, it may take five-10 years to be a major force under favorable conditions. In the rural areas, no business model is available yet.” Is trust an issue? “The quality of brands has never been a problem with online retailing,” says Mishra. “Most customers are net savvy and they can search and figure out the quality. However, lack of trust is significant in terms of accuracy of the order, timely delivery, condition [of the goods delivered], ease of cancellation of order and ease of returns. The cash-on-delivery logistics for high-value items, even for lower-value items in smaller towns, is not developed adequately. The order cycle gets elongated unduly as a result. So, both the parties find it is difficult to trust each other.” In the U.S., Amazon was set up in 1994; it went online in 1995. It began by selling books. It took two decades to overtake Walmart in market capitalization – considered a measure of future earnings potential. But the difference between the U.S. and India is that brick-and-mortar retail has yet to come of age in India. In the U.S., stores are closing down (“Are Retailers Facing a Coming ‘Tsunami’?”). Now, in India, both those eras are overlapping. Avenue Supermarts – the owner of the D-Mart retail chain brand – had an IPO in India in March. The shares listed on March 21 at over 100% the IPO price, giving it a valuation higher than all the retail stocks in the country put together. The next player is the Future Group; the market cap of all its listed entities add up to Rs25,000 crore. D-Mart is more than double that. “This deal helps Flipkart secure some strategic investors who can bring technology and operational expertise.” –Sandy Shen D-Mart is among the most expensive global retail stocks (brick-and-mortar), with the price/earnings (P/E) ratio for fiscal 2018 and 2019 at around 56 times and 42 times respectively, according to brokerage firm JP Morgan. Walmart’s P/E ratio is about 17. “The world over, in developed markets including the U.S., physical retail commands over 93% share of modern retail,” says a Future Group spokesperson. “Even in the remaining 7%, more than half is captured through omnichannel operations of physical retailers. Physical retail continues to be the dominant and the most cost efficient channel in India by a huge margin.” Adds Binny Bansal: “E-commerce accounts for less than 2% of all retail in India, and the potential for online retail alone is about $100 billion.” That’s a $100 billion cake waiting to be cut. Small wonder that Flipkart’s Big Billion Day sale last year and Amazon’s Great Indian Festival earlier this year were so successful. “The question isn’t physical or virtual retail,” says a Future Group spokesperson. “Today, as consumers, we live a seamless life, and retailing, too, will be a seamless experience. Like major physical retailers, we have built significant digital interfaces. From conducting major sales events on Twitter, to a full-fledged digital wallet, Future Pay, from omni-channel portals to a large social media presence, we are transforming into a store-led digital organization.” Adds Amazon’s Agarwal: “We believe there is room for multiple formats, players and most importantly, for innovation.” Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "Funding Flipkart: Can India’s Internet ‘Unicorn’ Take on Amazon?."

It is the world’s largest online retailer. Amazon.com started as an online bookstore, but soon diversified, selling DVDs, VHSs, CDs, video and MP3 downloads/streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewellery. The company also produces consumer electronics—notably, Amazon Kindle e-book readers, Kindle Fire tablets, Fire TV and Fire Phone — and is a major provider of cloud computing services. Jeff Bezos incorporated the company (as Cadabra) on July 5, 1994 and the site went online as Amazon.com in 1995. Bezos changed the name cadabra.com to amazon.com because it sounded too much like cadaver. Additionally, a name beginning with “A” was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetized. Amazon has separate retail websites for United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, India and Mexico, with sites for Sri Lanka and other South East Asian countries coming soon. Amazon also offers international shipping to certain other countries for some of its products. In 2011, it had professed an intention to launch its websites in Poland, Netherlands, and Sweden, as well. ( CREDITS : Wikipedia.org) Flipkart.com is an e-commerce company founded in 2007, by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal. It is registered in Singapore, and owned by a Singapore-based holding company. It operates in India, where it is headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka. According to Alexa Internet, Flipkart’s website is one of the 10 most visited websites in India. Flipkart has launched its own product range under the name “DigiFlip”, offering camera bags, pen-drives, headphones, computer accessories, etc. Legally, Flipkart is not an Indian company since it is registered in Singapore and majority of its shareholders are foreigners. Because foreign companies are not allowed to do multi-brand e-retailing in India, Flipkart sells goods in India through a company called WS Retail. Other third-party sellers can also sell on the Flipkart platform. ( CREDITS : Wikipedia.org) Both the retailers have advantages over each other, with Flipkart enjoying a much bigger market share of Indian E-commerce and Amazon having better international presence and more investment power. Amazon investment power was shown when it announced that it will be investing 2 billion USD in Indian market to strengthen its operations. But our desi Flipkart is not far behind, with its announcement of fund raiser equal to 1 billion USD which it will use to diversify its product range and strengthen its operations and people. With both the online tycoons investing equally on their infrastructure and product lines, the edge will be gained by the one who also invests on its talent and people training. Another ground to battle will be number of sellers featuring their products on these market places Flipkart aims to increase its sellers from current number of 4,000 to 50,000 by the end of next fiscal year. And Amazon already having 8,000 + sellers, aims at improving its count.To show uniqueness in their product range both flipkart and Amazon are looking at exclusive product launches such as MOTOROLA launching its new line of phones MOTO E, MOTO G and MOTO X exclusively on Flipkart followed by CHina’s XIAOMI phones which sold out in a record breaking 5 seconds at the time of launch a few days ago. Amazon also launched Samsung phone and Swipe’s Slice tablets exclusively. Flipkart, following the foot steps of Amazon has also launched its new Tablet, though with less success it will the beginning of a new story for in-house branded products being sold at Flipkart.

According to the report, Eric Bischoff, a 62-year-old Lafayette man, died from extensive, self-inflicted burn injuries. On March 26, after citing years of FBI harassment, Bischoff doused himself and his car with gasoline in the parking lot before proceeding to ignite both. Bischoff then yelled at horrified onlookers to not interfere by extinguishing the flames. Bystanders on the scene were able to use jackets to put out the flames. After being taken to the University of Colorado Hospital with second- and third-degree burns, Bischoff succumbed to his injuries.

Police Department An 80-year-old Wells woman was knocked off a motorcycle and suffered head injuries Saturday morning in Rochester, New Hampshire, when the motorcycle she was riding on collided with a deer. She was flown by Life Flight helicopter to Maine Medical Center in Portland, where she was listed in critical condition Saturday night. Carol Delisle was a passenger on a 2010 Spyder three-wheel motorcycle operated by Clifford Wescott, 84, also of Wells, according to the Rochester Police Department. The couple were traveling north on Route 11, between Wal-Mart and Tractor Supply, just after 11:30 a.m. when a deer emerged from the side of the road just past Wal-Mart. The deer tried to leap over the motorcycle, but grazed Wescott’s helmet and struck Delisle, who was pulled off the vehicle, police said. Delisle was wearing a helmet, but it dislodged during the crash. The deer fled into the woods and was not found. Southbound traffic on Route 111 was stopped at the Farmington line by the Farmington Police Department, and northbound traffic was diverted up Little Falls Bridge Road for a short period.

Amanda Hawkins, 19, from Kerr County, Texas, allegedly left her children Brynn Hawkins, one, and Addyson Overgard-Eddy, two, in the car overnight and ignored them even as they cried for hours late Tuesday. The girls were unconscious and in 'grave condition' by the time Hawkins sent them to the hospital on Wednesday - a day after they'd been left in the car.  Hospital officials pronounced the children dead on Thursday.  Hawkins and her husband, Isaac, set up a GoFundMe last December to raise money for a new home. 'I'm trying to raise money to get us into a home,' her post on the fundraising site read. 'We are living with my grandparents. We are both working but it's still hard. Any help is greatly appreciated. We will be buying this house.'  The Hawkins' fundraising goal is $1,500, but they are yet to receive any donations, the site shows.  Since then, Isaac Hawkins has been estranged from his wife, according to My San Antonio.  Police released a statement on Friday about the case. 'This is by far the most horrific case of child endangerment that I have seen in the 37 years that I have been in law enforcement,' Kerr County Sheriff Hierholzer said. Scroll down for video  Police say Hawkins killed Brynn Hawkins, one, - pictured right - and Addyson Overgard-Eddy, two - pictured left - by purposely leaving them in a hot car for more than 15 hours Hawkins and her husband, Isaac, set up a Gofundme last December to raise money for a new home.

This image was posted to GoFundMe in December When little Brynn and Addyson cried during the night while trapped in the car, Hawkins, a Walmart employee, ignored them even when her friends alerted her, according to authorities Hawkins left her two daughters in the car on Tuesday at around 9pm while she hung out with a 16-year-old male friend and others inside a house nearby, according to a news release from the Kerr County Police Department.  When little Brynn and Addyson cried during the night, the Walmart employee ignored them even when her friends alerted her, the sheriff told KABB.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How hero school mom tried to save a woman and son who were... EXCLUSIVE: 'She told me she was 22': Convicted criminal and... Share this article Share The sheriff also said Hawkins' male friend slept for a while in the car during the night but did not take the children out. Her husband Isaac was apparently not present when she allegedly abandoned her kids.  Isaac is the father of Brynn Hawkins. Addyson Overgard-Eddy's father is Austin J. Overgard. Neither of the fathers were reached for comment.  The young mom finally took her kids out of the car at noon on Wednesday - when the temperature in Texas was as high as 92 degrees - and found them unconscious.  Believing she would get into trouble, she decided not to report it, police say. But after her male friend convinced her Brynn and Addyson needed medical attention, she finally sent them to the Peterson Regional Medical Center in Kerrsville, on Thursday.  The young mom found her kids unconscious when she finally took them out at noon on Wednesday - when the temperature in Texas was as high as 92 degrees. The one-year-old, Brynn, is pictured here Their condition was so bad they had to be transferred to the University Hospital in San Antonio, more than an hour drive away. Brynn and Addyson died at 5pm, mere hours after they had arrived in the hospital. She had initially told doctors they had suddenly become unconscious after they smelled flowers at a local park.  Police investigated and questioned Hawkins before she confessed to leaving her children in the hot car. She was arrested on Thursday and has been charged with two counts of abandoning or endangering a child, although police say these charges may be upgraded since the children died.  She is being held on $70,000 bond. If she's found guilty under the present charges, she could face up to two years in prison.  She waited 24 hours to send her kids to the hospital because she was afraid she would get into trouble. Addyson, who was two years old at the time is pictured here. A former friend of Hawkins who knew her well said this toddler was always 'helpful' 'This is by far the most horrific case of child endangerment that I have seen in the 37 years that I have been in law enforcement,' Kerr County Sheriff Hierholzer said Addyson Overgard-Eddy's father is Austin J. Overgard (seen above), who is estranged from Amanda Hawkins Austin J. Overgard could not be reached for comment. Addyson Overgard-Eddy is seen on the right A friend of Hawkins, Miriam Davis, who has known her since middle school, told KSAT 12 that she noticed Hawkins treating her children badly and regrets not calling Child Protection Services. ‘I hesitated for so long because I didn’t want her kids in the system,’ she told the station. ‘But I didn’t know they would die.'

Here’s why The Carousel Mall, built in 1972, has very few tenants as seen Tuesday June 6, 2017 in San Bernardino. Will Lester-SCNG/Inland Valley Daily Bulletin By Kevin Smith, San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: 06/10/17, 4:33 PM PDT | Updated: 15 hrs ago # Comments A sign is shown in the window of one of the few remaining businesses. Will Lester-SCNG/Inland Valley Daily Bulletin When the Central City Mall opened its doors in 1972, it was a big hit in San Bernardino. With 52 stores — including anchor tenants J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward and The Harris Co. — the retail center quickly became a vital part of the city’s downtown core. But the mall’s promise began to fade in the late 1970s due to a lack of organization and a series of management changes. It was renamed Carousel Mall in 1991, and with the addition of a carousel ride, brighter colors and a variety of other upgrades, it was hoped the revitalized center would attract families and younger shoppers. But that didn’t work, and the mall’s erosion worsened when the Inland Center mall opened up a few miles away. “People always want to go with what’s new,” said Mark Persico, the city’s director of community development. “We’re kind of trained like Pavlov’s dog. Consumers shifted from the old mall to the new one. And for whatever reason, Carousel Mall wasn’t able to reposition itself.” Decades later, the mall is a shell of its former self. A few stores remain open, but come July they’ll all be gone. The property is currently owned by the city and a plan is underway to revamp it as a mixed-use center that will incorporate housing, office space and more restaurants. But a full rollout of that plan is expected to take 10 to 12 years. Carousel Mall is not alone Scores of malls across the country have struggled in the face of changing consumer tastes and increasing competition from Amazon and other online retailers that typically sell merchandise for less, and often with free delivery. That dilemma is reflected in a new report from Credit Suisse, which says that if the current pace of retail bankruptcies, store closures and increased e-commerce buying continues, as many as 25 percent of the nation’s malls will close by 2022. That equates to roughly 275 mall closures over the next five years. The report predicts 8,640 retail stores will close this year as compared to the 2,056 that shut down last year. If the closures that have already been announced this year are any indication, that figure is probably accurate. Radio Shack said it will be closing 1,000 stores, Payless ShoeSource will be shuttering 512 and Sears and Kmart will be closing 246 locations. Credit Suisse is also forecasting that e-commerce will grow from its current share of 17 percent of industry sales to 35 percent or more by 2030. Advertisement Changing consumer tastes “Consumers have changed,” said Phil Lempert, a Santa Monica-based expert on consumer behavior and marketing trends. “With online shopping there’s no need to go to the mall. All you have to do is get on your mobile device.” There’s also the issue of perception. Many of today’s malls look old and tired, Lempert said, and people want an experience that’s uplifting — not depressing. The Panorama Mall in the San Fernando Valley is a case in point. The mall, which currently includes a Walmart and about 70 specialty stores, is looking worn. But Primestor Development Inc. acquired the property about a year ago and the company plans to expand it by 266,000 square feet. In a case filing submitted to the Los Angeles Department of City Planning in February, Primestor said the upgrades will include 132,000 square feet of new shops and restaurants, a 2,000-seat theater, a hotel with 100 to 200 rooms, landscaped plazas and open space throughout the 17-acre property. But for some shoppers, bigger isn’t necessarily better. Brenda Miles, 61, who lives in Panorama City, said she doesn’t like shopping at malls. “They’re not fascinating anymore,” she said. “It’s good for the young kids because they’ve got the energy to do that, but I get tired fast and I don’t want to walk a whole mile to go to one store.” The cost of reinvention Dave Moore, president of retail properties for The Irvine Co., said it’s all about reinvention. Irvine Co. owns and operates the Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, Fashion Island in Newport Beach and The Market Place in Tustin. All three malls are doing well, but that doesn’t mean they’re standing still. “In order to remain successful, shopping centers will need to continue to evolve as we have done and strive to do with our centers,” Moore said via email. “We attribute the success of our centers to a variety of factors, not the least of which is that we constantly strive to create lifestyle destinations for our guests.” That formula appears to be working. Irvine Spectrum Center sees about 17 million shoppers a year and Fashion Island gets about 16 million. Early last year, The Irvine Co. announced a $150-million reinvestment in Irvine Spectrum Center that will add more than 20 new stores, new landscaping, outdoor seating and shade areas, and circulation and parking-garage improvements. The upgrades are expected to be completed by the summer of 2018. “We do this through a perpetual focus on reinvestment in our properties and tenants, and an exceedingly high standard of maintenance,” Moore said. Paseo Colorado undergoing upgrades Pasadena’s iconic Paseo Colorado mall is also in the midst of a makeover that will bring in several new stores. The mall has rebranded itself as “The Paseo” and it has partnered with Ensemble Real Estate Investments to build a six-story 186-room Hyatt Place hotel at the northwest corner of Los Robles and Green Street. The hotel is scheduled to be completed in October 2018 and will cater primarily to business travelers. The changes that are planned for Carousel Mall in San Bernardino have been long in coming, but Persico envisions a success story. “We are working with a joint-venture developer on this,” he said. “Our preliminary plans will include about 750 residential units, including both condos and apartments, and about 350,000 square feet of commercial space. Some will be office space and some will be retail. There is a lot of interest in the residential development community.” The revamped center will also be tied in with a busy Regal Cinema and the historic California Theater, which are both located just across the street. The theater seats about 1,600 and features a variety of live shows as well as performances by the San Bernardino Symphony. Regardless of upgrades, the retail industry will continue to shed stores — and that doesn’t bode well for malls. “We’re in the middle of an extended retail ice age where less capable and less well-capitalized companies are financially failing or declaring liquidation,” said Burt Flickinger III, managing director for the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. “We have 400 percent more retail square footage in the U.S. than what shopper demand dictates.” Still, Persico figures Carousel Mall will succeed. “We see a very bright future for this mall,” he said. “We are social animals. People want to get out, walk around and see other people.” RETAILERS IN TROUBLE A new report predicts 8,640 retail stores will close this year, compared to 2,056 that shuttered last year. Among the expected closures: • Radio Shack will close 1,000 stores • Payless ShoeSource: 512 stores • Sears and Kmart: 246 stores • J.C. Penney: 138 stores • Macy’s: 68 stores • Guess: 60 stores • Michael Kors: 100 to 125 stores • Rue21: 400 stores • BeBe Stores: 180 stores • The Limited: 250 stores • Abercrombie & Fitch: 60 stores • Wet Seal: 171 stores • American Apparel: 110 stores • Staples: 70 stores • GameStop 150 stores • CVS: 70 stores • Crocs: 160 stores Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reach the author at Kevin.Smith@sgvn.com or follow Kevin on Twitter: @SGVNBiz.

Going forward, Cortana will help you compare prices of goods online whenever you are shopping, Microsoft has announced. The new feature being added to the digital assistance, will be rolled out by Microsoft first as a pilot test. Cortana will pop up as the best price as well as the availability of similar products to enable you enjoy savings on your purchase. When shopping the websites of select retail stores in the US, the pop up notification will appear from where you can compare prices from stores like eBay, Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon, and the likes. The new feature has been designed to work in Microsoft web browser, Edge, and have the Windows 10 Creators Update installed. How Cortana’s latest feature works: When viewing a product detail page online, the digital assistance will alert you of the presence of better deals via the Edge browser’s address bar. The goal is to help you find the best price, and this works by helping you to search across multiple online stores supported by Cortana’s new feature. It takes all the hard work off your shoulder by helping you find the best price from different supported sites—searching from one retail store to the other until it finds what’s suitable for your budget. The good thing is, Cortana’s new feature will only alert you when it finds a lower price. Credit: https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/06/09/introducing-shopping-tips-cortana-microsoft-edge/#eYcFU8QSboy5dW2v.97 The deals will appear in a pane on the right side of your window, but not until you have clicked on the Cortana icon in the address bar. Appearing with the lane will be links that take you to the product page of what you want to buy. Currently only available on Microsoft Edge, and shoppers in the US, Microsoft said the pilot test will only accommodate 14 stores at the moment, with more stores to be added soon. Here is a statement on Microsoft’s official blog announcing the new feature added to Cortana on Friday: “With Cortana and Microsoft Edge, we hope to continue offering features that will help you save time and money when shopping online using the Microsoft Edge web browser. To that end, we recently released a pilot feature that helps find the best pricing for the product you are viewing. However, Cortana will only notify you if the relevant details are available at the time of your visit. We are just beginning to roll this out to everyone on Windows 10 Creators Update to get feedback. Currently the feature supports 14 retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and eBay, within the US. We will be increasing availability and the number of retailers we support in the months ahead, so stay tuned for more updates” The feature is still being tested, and still not available to users outside the US.

(WTNH) — Waterbury police are warning residents about a possible rabies exposure to those who may have handled a kitten in May. According to police, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) is advising anyone who may have handled a 4-week-old injured kitten in the area of Wal-Mart off Route 69, between May 15th and May 29th to seek medical advice. Police say the kitten died on June 8th and tested positive for rabies on June 9th. Authorities say rabies is a viral disease primarily of animals caused by infection of the brain and spinal cord. They say people get rabies from the bite of an infected animal. According to police, rabies is a fatal disease, however it can be prevented by thorough wound cleaning and timely medical treatment that includes administration of one dose of immune globulin, i.e., antibodies, and four doses of vaccines over a two weeks. Police say for questions regarding human rabies exposures contact the DPH Epidemiology and Emerging Infections Program at 860-509-7994.

Caucasian Mother Plucks Kid’s Healthy Teeth Out On Walmart Bathroom A mother in Utah has been charged this week with felony child abuse according to People.com— for pulling out her 7-year-old son’s teeth in a Walmart bathroom. The crazy woman didn’t even use sanitizer or any anesthetics. 47-year-old Jeanine Isom alerted the store’s employess on April 2nd, when they heard the boy screaking for help. That’s when they discovered she was yanking out his teeth. Isom told police the boy’s teeth were infected, Sgt. Josh Christensen with the American Fork, Utah, police tells PEOPLE.  But “he was taken to the dentist a couple of days later and the dentist said there was no sign of an infection whatsoever,” Christensen says.

Some might assume those scams from out of the country might not ever hit a loved one, or if it does, it won't work. However, according to a recent caller to The Courier, that's not the case. The caller noted she has no idea how a J.M. Kingston from Jamaica was able to contact her mother or how long he contacted her to request money for unknown reasons. Per the request, an undisclosed amount was sent, possibly more than once, and Kingston, who would call from a blocked number, befriended the victim. Cody Lindsey, a front end service manager at the Walmart Supercenter in Russellville, said the store's Money Gram department see's a lot of scams from Jamaica where locals purchase Money Grams to send to the country. "Monthly, we probably see six or seven," Lindsey said. "Primarily, they are from older people. [Money Grams sent to] Jamaica and Nigeria are the two main ones we see. "Depending on how much money the person is trying to send, if we feel it is faulty, we will refuse the transaction." According to Public Information Officer Quinn Jones with the Russellville Police Department (RPD), multiple reports are made to police every year regarding scams. "I can guarantee she isn't the only one who has been contacted by scammers here," Jones said. "We generally receive a few reports each month in regards to scams. Not all of them come from Jamaica." To help prevent a parent or loved one from falling victim to a scam, Jones suggested talking to family members about scams and educating them. "The scams are successful because there is no foolproof way to make sure people don't fall for it," Jones said. "Tell [your] parents to always call [you] first and fill [you] in on the phone call to verify whether or not it is legit." As far as how scammers gain access to phone numbers, Jones said one way is to purchase phone lists in the same manner that call centers do. One way to help combat this is to place personal phone numbers on the National Do Not Call list by visiting www.donotcall.gov. Jones said to ensure a person doesn't fall victim to this or any phone scam, everyone should always be skeptical of unexpected phone calls asking for money. "If the number calling shows to be from Jamaica, it is a scam," Jones said. "Neither the police department nor the IRS will call you and demand money. "If the caller states that a family member is in need of money because they are in jail, it's a scam. Most of the time these scammers instruct you to purchase green dot cards or to send money via Western Union. No legitimate business operates in this manner." "The bottom line, if someone calls you claiming to be from a legitimate business and asks you for money, hang up and call that business on a known number to verify," he added.

In both cases, prosecutors say the officers didn't need to respond with deadly force. The officers both have testified they felt threatened. In Cincinnati, former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing for a second time faces charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in the July 2015 shooting of Sam DuBose, 43. Tensing has said he thought DuBose was trying to kill him with his car. A jury deadlocked last November.

The 12-year-old black boy was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled his family's lawsuit for $6 million. The officers still could be disciplined or fired by the department. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) In Minnesota, St. Anthony Officer Jeronimo Yanez is charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting last July of Philando Castile. He testified Friday he saw Castile's hand on a gun a before he fired. Castile had a permit and had told the officer he had a gun. The cases are among those across the United States in the last three years that have increased debate about race and policing. Here are some other high-profile deaths of blacks during police encounters: ___ JORDAN EDWARDS The U.S. Justice Department said in May that it's investigating the fatal shooting of the 15-year-old by a white police officer in a Dallas suburb. Edwards was shot April 29 by Balch Springs police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. Balch Springs police had originally said the vehicle was reversing "in an aggressive manner" toward officers, who had responded to a complaint about underage drinking. But Police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver is free on bond. ___ TERENCE CRUTCHER An Oklahoma jury on May 17 found Officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16, 2016, death of Terence Crutcher, 40, shot shortly after Shelby arrived on a street to find Crutcher's SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Shelby testified that she was afraid because Crutcher didn't obey her commands and appeared to reach inside his SUV. Prosecutors told jurors that Shelby overreacted, noting that videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter showed Crutcher had his hands in the air and did not have a weapon. ___ ALTON STERLING Federal prosecutors announced May 3 that they would not seek charges against two white police officers who were involved in a deadly encounter with Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last summer. Sterling, 37, was shot to death on July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking demonstrations across Baton Rouge. U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson said Sterling was armed during the confrontation and the investigation didn't find enough evidence to pursue charges. State authorities are investigating to decide whether to bring charges. ___ KEITH LAMONT SCOTT A prosecutor cleared a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer in the September 2016 fatal shooting of Scott, 43, killed while sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex as officers sought another man. A police review board decided that Officer Brentley Vinson followed proper procedure. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times Scott's family said he did not have a gun. Charlotte-Mecklenburg District Attorney Andrew Murray cited evidence that Scott was armed, including a store's surveillance video, DNA recovered from a handgun and a Facebook conversation from the man who said he sold the stolen gun to Scott. ___ JAMAR CLARK Clark's November 2015 shooting death sparked weeks of protests in Minneapolis. The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest the 24-year-old when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. Some witnesses said Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, but federal and state probes concluded that he was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark's hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Prosecutors decided not to charge either white officer, and an internal police investigation cleared them. ___ RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ball, 26. Boykin, awaiting trial, said he fired because Ball appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin, saying the officer violated policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancée to ride with him and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. Ball's family has sued Boykin, the city and other police officials for wrongful death. ___ JEREMY MCDOLE McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander's cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general's office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed "extraordinarily poor" police work. In January, a federal judge approved the city's $1.5 million settlement with McDole's family. ___ WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced last October to 2½ years in prison for fatally shooting Chapman while responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart on April 22, 2015. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed the unarmed 18-year-old "willfully, deliberately and with premeditation." Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin's stun gun. Rankin, who is white, was fired. ___ WALTER SCOTT Prosecutors are recommending decades in prison for white South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, who shot Scott in the back as the motorist fled following a traffic stop. Slager pleaded guilty on May 2 to a federal charge of violating Scott's civil rights. A judge will determine his sentence, which could range from probation to life in prison without parole. Scott's shooting in April 2015 was captured on cellphone video and seen worldwide. ___ FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man was shackled but alive when he was put in a Baltimore police van in April 2015. He came out with severe neck injuries, and his subsequent death led to rioting. Six officers were charged initially, but prosecutors in July 2016 dropped all remaining charges after acquittals and a hung jury. Gray's family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. __ ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff's deputy Robert Bates, 74, was sentenced in 2016 to four years in prison for second-degree manslaughter in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, who was unarmed and restrained. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight, and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. ___ TAMIR RICE The 12-year-old was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers' cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled Rice's family's lawsuit for $6 million. Cleveland in May fired Loehmann and suspended Garmack for 10 days. The officers' union said it will challenge the discipline, calling it politically motivated. ___ AKAI GURLEY Rookie New York City police officer Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter last year in the November 2014 death of 28-year-old Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn when a sound startled him and he fired accidentally. A bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. A judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years' probation and 800 hours of community service. The city settled with Gurley's family for $4.1 million. ___ MICHAEL BROWN The unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department opted against civil rights charges. Wilson later resigned. The death of Brown led to months of occasionally violent protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. ___ LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in November 2015, on the same day that the city, under a judge's orders, released dashcam video showing McDonald, a 17-year-old man, being shot 16 times on Oct. 20, 2014. Van Dyke, who is white, has pleaded not guilty. The video prompted local and federal investigations. The Justice Department determined in January that Chicago police have a long history of civil rights violations and excessive force. The Chicago Police Department has since released a new use-of-force policy that requires officers undergo de-escalation training and imposes stricter rules on when they can fire their weapons at fleeing suspects. ___ ERIC GARNER The 43-year-old man died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict that officer, or any others involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. ___ REKIA BOYD Chicago police officer Dante Servin resigned in May 2016 after the police superintendent said he should be fired for killing Boyd four years earlier. Servin was off-duty when he shot the 22-year-old unarmed woman. She had been walking down a street with her friends when he told them to be quiet, and he fired when he thought he saw a gun. Prosecutors charged Servin with involuntary manslaughter, a judge acquitted him in April 2016, saying he'd been improperly charged. The city settled a wrongful-death lawsuit in 2013 with Boyd's family for $4.5 million.

His death was among a series across the U.S. involving black people in recent years that spurred a national debate over race and policing.

Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. The Justice Department investigation is separate from the district attorney's prosecution, and could end in a wide variety of outcomes - some civil, some criminal. Oliver was fired three days after Edwards' death. Oliver is free on bond.

At first it was just a “gut feeling,” Toyos wrote in a Facebook post, then she noticed the people watching her. Toyos was with her mom, and had her take a photo of her and her three young children in Ikea shortly before this happened. Afterwards, Toyos wrote a lengthy post with the photo to share her experience. Facebook She remembered reading about other cases where children were targeted by human traffickers at big retail stores—moms had shared stories online about close encounters with child abductors in Target, Walmart, and so on. Not all of the cases turned out to be true, but now she was on guard. She wrote: “I read things like that, and I always think ‘wow, that’s so scary… I need to be careful’. But I also always think ‘that could never happen to me.’ But you guys, it did.“ What she noticed was that while she and the kids were looking at (and snuggling on) the couches, a middle aged man was circling the area and staring at the children. Toyos instantly put herself between the man and her children and kept a close eye on her son who wanted to play in one of the display rooms. Then she noticed another man watching and following her as well. These men weren’t shopping, she wrote, just lurking and keeping an eye on the children.  She continued to move through the store, but then noticed that one of the men was still watching her. She made her way through the maze that is Ikea and talked to some employees, used the restrooms, and circled around. Eventually, she lost them. “They weren’t waiting for anyone. Often you see men in a place like IKEA waiting for their wives, but these guys appeared to be alone. They didn’t even talk to each other. They didn’t talk to anyone,” she wrote. “The area they were hanging around had an exit right by it. IKEA is a massive confusing maze of a store. But they could have run out that exit with my child and handed them off to someone waiting outside and been gone before I could find them.” She cautioned parents to be vigilant when going out with their children. “It’s not the time to be texting or Facebooking or chatting on the phone. When you’re in a public place with your kids, please be aware and present so that you don’t become a victim.”  Having three small children and noticing something off while out in public can understandably be a scary thing. But Toyos has since deleted her original Facebook post because of the attention she received—the men were not confirmed to be abductors, and the responses she got varied widely from mothers sending emotional support to people slamming her for making things up.  Many people asked Toyos why she did not take photos of the two men, and she responded that she was too preoccupied with keeping a close eye on her children.  Editor’s Picks Colleges Funnel Millions Into On-Campus Startups The Dark Origins of Communism: Part 3 of 3 Trump’s Air Traffic Reform Looks to the Future Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

Amanda Hawkins Texas mom leaves toddler daughters in hot car overnight to die By Christopher Koulouris - June 10, 2017 SHARE Facebook Twitter Pictured the two baby toddler daughters of Texas mother, Amanda Hawkins. Pictured the two baby toddler daughters of Texas mother, Amanda Hawkins. Amanda Hawkins a Texas mother has been charged with the deaths of her two toddler daughters after intentionally leaving them in a hot car overnight.  Amanda Hawkins a 19 year old Kerr County, Texas woman has been arrested after allegedly leaving her baby toddler daughters in a hot car overnight for more than 15 hours so she could ‘have fun’ with her friends.  Having left her children, Brynn Hawkins, one, and Addyson Overgard-Eddy, two, in the car overnight, over 15 hours, as temperatures soared above, 90 fahrenheit, police say the woman ignored them even as they cried for hours. In essence leaving the children to a death sentence. By the time Hawkins eventually responded to her daughters, 15 hours after they’d been left in the car, come Wednesday noon, both girls were unconscious and in ‘grave condition’. The toddler daughters would be declared dead at a hospital the following day reported AP. Told Kerr County Sherif Hierholzer in a statement: ‘This is by far the most horrific case of child endangerment that I have seen in the 37 years that I have been in law enforcement’. Pictured, Kerr County, Texas mother, Amanda Hawkins. Images via Facebook. Matters came to the fore when Hawkins left her two daughters in the car on Tuesday at around 9pm while she hung out with a 16-year-old male friend and others inside a house nearby, noted a news release from the Kerr County Police Department.  When Brynn and Addyson cried during the night, the Walmart employee ignored them even when her friends alerted her.  Responded Hawkins allegedly at one point, ‘No, they’re fine. They’ll cry themselves to sleep’. The sheriff also said Hawkins’s male friend slept for a while in the car during the night but did not take the children out. Police said, Hawkins’ husband Isaac was apparently not present when the mother allegedly abandoned her kids.  Pictured Kerr County, Texas mother, Amanda Hawkins toddler daughters. Killed were, Addyson Overgard -Eddy, two, – pictured left and Brynn Hawkins, one, – pictured right. It wasn’t until Wednesday afternoon – when the temperature in Texas was as high as 92 degrees -,  that Hawkins went to retrieve her daughters, where she came upon both girls unconscious.  Believing she would get into trouble, Hawkins decided not to report the incident, police say. But after her male friend convinced her Brynn and Addyson needed medical attention, Hawkins finally sent them to the Peterson Regional Medical Center in Kerrsville, on Thursday. A day after they’d been found unconscious.  Their condition was so bad they had to be transferred to the University Hospital in San Antonio, more than an hour drive away. Despite best efforts, Brynn and Addyson died at 5pm, hours after they had arrived in the hospital reported Fox 29. Police say Hawkins initially told doctors the toddlers ‘suddenly becoming unconscious’ after having smelled flowers at a local park.  Pictured, Kerr County, Texas woman, Amanda Hawkins. According to KENS, prior to taking the children to hospital, Hawkins bathed and re-dressed the children in an attempt to cover up the fact that she had left them in the car for so long with no food, water or bathroom breaks. Police investigated and questioned Hawkins before she confessed to leaving her children in the hot car. The mother was arrested on Thursday and has been charged with two counts of abandoning or endangering a child, although police say charges may be upgraded since the children died.  Hawkins remains in custody on $70,000 bond. If found guilty under the present charges, Hawkins could face up to two years in prison.  A friend of Hawkins, Miriam Davis, who has known her since middle school, told KSAT 12 that she noticed Hawkins treating her children badly and regretting not calling Child Protection Services. ‘I hesitated for so long because I didn’t want her kids in the system,’ told Davis. ‘But I didn’t know they would die.’ ‘I had the two most beautiful grandbabies,’ Hawkins’ mother, Alisha Eddy told mySanAntonio.com. ‘I don’t agree with what happened, what she did, but I love my daughter. I’m there for my daughter.’ ‘We’re just bewildered and confused,’ Hawkins’ aunt said. An autopsy into the cause of deaths of the toddler girls had been set for Friday. Pictured, Kerr County, Texas mother, Amanda Hawkins. Perhaps most vexing is where was the father? Or the grandparents? Commentators have questioned why the mother declined arranging alternative ‘baby-sitting’ arrangements unless Hawkins didn’t want to own up to the fact that she was seeking to ‘play hookie’ or simply couldn’t be bothered with the welfare of her children or even worse, had calculated the children’s demise ….? According to the dailymail, Hawkins and her husband, Isaac had teen couple set up a Gofundme page last December to raise money for a new home. ‘I’m trying to raise money to get us into a home,’ her post on the fundraising site read. ‘We are living with my grandparents. We are both working but it’s still hard. Any help is greatly appreciated. We will be buying this house.’  The Hawkins’ fundraising goal was for $1500, but they are yet to receive any donations, the site shows.  Police will decide whether to upgrade charges following findings being presented to a grand jury which may choose to indict the mother on murder charges.

Now, it might help you get the most for your money too. In the latest Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft has rolled out a pilot feature in Microsoft Edge where Cortana can help you find the best price for a product you're interested in buying. Right now, this feature supports 14 retailers, which includes Amazon, Walmart and eBay, as long as they're within the US, Engadget reports. So, let's say you're on a product page for a vacuum cleaner on Walmart. Cortana can look up the price of that particular vacuum cleaner in competing stores (like Home Depot or Best Buy), while you still have that page open and it'll let you know if the vacuum cleaner is available for a cheaper price elsewhere. Think of it as a Kayak for online shopping, but built right into the browser. It might not be as full-featured as Microsoft's Personal Shopping Assistant (which lets you get notified of price changes), but at least Cortana doesn't require installing a browser extension, Engadget said.

Facebook 3 Amanda Hawkins, 19, has been taken into custody after her toddlers died having been left in a hot car The mum, a Walmart supermarket worker from Kerr County, Texas left Brynn, aged one, and Addyson, two, in the car overnight.

Jackson Police report that Eric W. Graham, 33, of 111 Lewis St., Jackson, has been charged with a felony-level charge of Theft Of Drugs after he allegedly stole a bag containing prescription drugs owned by Roger Poe of 416 South Connecticut Avenue, Wellston. Graham was not seen committing the theft at the time, but police say they made the arrest after using video surveillance evidence and following up with an immediate investigation. Poe had purchased five different prescriptions inside Walmart and had them together in one bag, but left the bag in a shopping cart when he placed other shopping items inside his vehicle before driving away from the parking lot. When he returned a short time later to retrieve the bag of prescription drugs, it was no longer there. When police and store personnel reviewed surveillance videotape, it revealed a man with a black and white umbrella appeared to remove something from the shopping cart and place it in a nearby pickup truck, in which he later drove from the scene. The man was not identified, but the pickup truck's registered owner was a person living at 111 Lewis Street, which also turned out to be Graham's residence. A truck matching the description of the one in the Walmart parking lot was seen at that residence and a similar umbrella was found inside of it. Officers later recovered the bag of Poe's discarded prescriptions in a trash can at the Apple Hill Apartments, located off East Broadway Street. The bag still contained four of the five prescriptions, but the prescription for 120 Oxycodone tablets had been removed. Police said Graham later admitted picking up an item from the shopping cart, but said he discarded it outside a convenience store when he saw it contained nothing but trash. However, there was no video or physical evidence at the convenience-store property to confirm he did this.

Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page LOS ANGELES — North Texas' Merritt Tierce became one of the most promising writers in American literature of the past decade when her debut novel, Love Me Back, was released to almost universal acclaim in 2014. Following the book's success, Tierce wrote for venerable publications such as The New York Times and The Paris Review. While it's easy to assume the life of such a visible writer must be a luxurious one, Tierce candidly fought back against that cliche. In an essay for Marie Claire, she revealed she took a job as a letter carrier in order to make ends meet. Surfing through residencies is a favorite pastime of writers and artists who find themselves underemployed. Tierce had completed four residencies, was getting ready to embark on her fifth. She had plans for a sixth when she got the news. "I was driving around Denton, and I just started screaming in my car," she said, laughing. The news was a text message from her agent, asking if she wanted to move to Los Angeles and become a staff writer for Orange Is the New Black. Laura Prepon and Taylor Schilling in a season five episode of "Orange of Is The New Black."  TNS The time between a text and the first day of a dream job can drag on.  "It took another month actually for an official offer to be made," Tierce said. "So I was just kind of sitting on it that whole time. I went ahead to my next residency, because I wasn't totally sure it was going to happen. I have two kids in Denton and I had to make sure things were OK with their dad, so there were a lot of logistics to work out." On top of all of the big unanswered questions Tierce faced as she waited for her fate to materialize, she was still recovering from the end of her second marriage late last year. "I'm not really sure how to answer that one," Tierce says when pressed on the issue. "There's some relief — as in, I may not have the relationship anymore, but at least I have this huge break in my career — and that does help me deal with the loss in a way, by at least providing some buoyancy and a whole new set of experiences to focus on. But in other ways it amplifies the loss, since I'm not sharing those new experiences with anyone the way I would have before." A chance encounter at one of Tierce's many residencies is where everything changed. She met Orange Is the New Black creator, showrunner and executive producer, Jenji Kohan, while at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, N.H. Past MacDowell fellows includes Leonard Bernstein, James Baldwin and Alice Walker. Kohan also created the series Weeds for Showtime, and her upcoming GLOW — based on the campy 1980s female wrestling show, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling — will appear on Netflix in June. Judging by Kohan's track record and the fact that O.I.T.N.B. is often said to be the highest-rated series on Netflix (the brand doesn't do traditional Nielsen ratings or give out numbers of any kind), her streak is likely to continue. "Love Me Back," by Merritt Tierce.   The offer came as a shock. "I was trying very hard to not be the person who is fawning over her," Tierce says. "It certainly didn't occur to me to ask her if I could work on her show. ... This was still a complete surprise to me. I told her I was interested in writing for television and trying to figure out how to get into that world, but I have no experience. We definitely have a lot of issue interests and kinetic interests in common." When asked what those issues are, Tierce replied: "Feminism and radicalized women. Abortion. Being a woman. Being an outsider in some ways, I guess." Tierce left Kohan a copy of her book before returning to Denton. She then started on what would be her final residency, at Willapa Bay, which is in a remote peninsula in the Pacific Northwest. The classes were small, sometimes only six people, and everyone at the residency has dinner together every night. The intimacy of such surroundings can lead to some awkward moments. "This has also happened on every residency that I've done: People will read my book while I'm there and that's always actually really strange," Tierce says. "It's strange to walk past someone who's reading your book, but it's gratifying, too, that they are taking the time, taking the time out of their own very precious residency to read my work." Tierce welcomed the chance to spend time with people who weren't writers at the residency. "I like being around visual artists and filmmakers. I feel, I guess, extra invigorated by people who are working in other media," says Tierce. "I think that's probably just because it's hard or boring for writers to talk about their work sometimes." While residencies often take place in small enclaves, that aspect is something to which Tierce is accustomed. She grew up in "little [expletive] towns all over Texas." "I grew up some in Abilene and some in Sweetwater and then I guess I spent the biggest chunk of time in this place called Gatesville, which is west of Waco," Tierce says. It was in that final location that a  twist of fate revealed itself compared to where Tierce now finds herself in life.  "There's nothing there except a prison, a state women's prison," Tierce says of Gatesville. "It's pretty close to Fort Hood, the army base. When I lived there, there was a Wal-Mart and a McDonald's, and everyone who lived there worked at the prison or was in the army." The relocation from Washington State oyster bays to the hills of Hollywood was a sudden one. "I ended up getting the offer on a Friday while I was in the Pacific Northwest and flying to L.A. on a Sunday, and starting work on a Monday. It happened very fast, and I didn't go home or anything first. So I had to leave that residency a few days early," Tierce says. "And then I had to cancel a bunch of other upcoming commitments that I had, but this is so exactly what I want to be doing right now, so there wasn't really a question about whether or not I wanted to do it." Tierce's television habit didn't start until approximately 2006.  "I didn't watch TV growing up, really," Tierce says. "I was pretty sheltered and also just not that interested in watching TV." When asked to give an example of a great television writer, Tierce instead mentions the overall writing quality of The Wire. Her new familiarity with the inner workings of how a series is written helped illuminate her opinion. "I watch a [expletive]-ton of TV, so there are a lot of shows that I'm into. But it's hard to tell when you're looking at the credits on a show; it's hard to tell exactly who wrote it," Tierce says. "There are 12 people in our writers' room, and I assume most writers' rooms are like that. I'm sure some are smaller but still, it's a collaborative effort."  When Tierce lists off the shows her fellow writers have worked on, it's enough to give any new employee pause: "Weeds, Grey's Anatomy, Narcos, Billions, Mad Men, In Treatment, Girls, 30 Rock, Community, BoJack Horseman, Degrassi, Bones and many other shows," she says. The writing-by-committee has been a shift in an often lonely profession. "We sit around a conference table, some of us in chairs and some on exercise balls, in a room with whiteboard walls, and talk about the show all day," says Tierce. "Down the middle of the table is a legit smorgasbord of adult coloring books, kinetic sand, fidget spinners, markers, Theraputty, and basically anything else a creative person might want to fiddle with while working out an idea." The process takes place at Netflix's most recent location, as well as an off-site Orange Is the New Black office. Tierce's first day of work was a Netflix binge. She watched all of season five of O.I.T.N.B, along with all the other writers and a few producers, in a screening room called The Upside Down (a nod to Netflix's original show Stranger Things). She describes her new schedule as "embarrassingly normal." It's Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Being from Texas is something of a fascination for people on the two big coasts, something Tierce acknowledges.  "It probably helps me get a spot," she said. "I think it's sort of added value in a way. Tiny added value. We've been talking a lot about how Texas is prison-crazy and also detention center-crazy. I'm aware of that."

File / News Tribune Mills Fleet Farm, the Midwest chain of sprawling stores packed with down-home goods ranging from poultry grit and PVC pipe to bib overalls and Muck Boots, is poised for a growth spurt. To date, the retailer's expansion has been gradual, adding six stores in the past 10 years — including its Hermantown location which opened last year — to bring its count to 36. But now the company — with corporate operations in Brainerd and in Appleton, Wis. — has launched an effort that could double that number in five to six years and take Mills into new territory. "Our goal and objective as a company is to grow, and we have a strong growth plan," executive vice president and chief operating officer Hugh Leasum said. Wisconsin, home to 18 Mills stores, will see a good share of that growth. The company is looking at several possible sites for new stores here, Leasum said. That, and the strong possibility that Mills will expand into Illinois, could bring the retailer into closer competition with the similarly named but separate Blain's Farm & Fleet, a Janesville, Wis.-based chain that sells some of the same types of merchandise. Historically, there has been little overlap in the territories of the two retailers. The great majority of Mills stores are in eastern and central Wisconsin, and in Minnesota. The great majority of the 38 Blain's stores are in southern and southwestern Wisconsin, and in northern Illinois, though it does have a store as far north as Rice Lake, Wis. The Mills growth effort follows the purchase of the formerly family-owned company in February 2016 by private-equity firm KKR & Co. It's not surprising that KKR wants to expand the Mills footprint, said Anne Brouwer, a senior partner with Chicago-based retail consultant McMillanDoolittle. "When you've got somebody taking something over, they're looking for growth, they're going to start adding stores," Brouwer said. "There's not a whole lot more they could pack in to the locations that they have." Further, the continuing weakness across much of brick-and-mortar retail could mean lower real estate costs for firms that are doing well enough to expand, Hart Posen, a business professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said by email. Mills doesn't disclose revenue numbers. However, Leasum said the trend over the past few years has been positive. "That's why we're building stores," he said. Those stores are big. Where the largest Blain's is 169,000 square feet, the newer Mills locations typically cover 185,000 square feet — more than the average Wal-Mart supercenter. The store in Grand Chute, near Appleton, comes in at more than 250,000 square feet. The Mills stores are also, as Brouwer suggested, piled high with merchandise — outdoor and work clothing, auto parts, animal feed, tools, building materials, hunting and fishing gear, and dozens of varieties of Fleet Farm-branded bagged nuts. The breadth and depth of Mills' assortment of merchandise was a key factor attracting KKR's attention, said Derick Prelle, managing partner at KKR Capstone. He said KKR, whose other holdings include Toys "R" Us, the 230-store Academy Sports + Outdoors chain and ride-hailing service Lyft, looks for three things in potential acquisitions: excellent management, ability to grow and an approach to business that sets it apart. KKR will look first to add stores in the four states where Mills already operates — Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and North Dakota — then expand to their neighbors, Prelle said. Asked whether she views Mills' expansion plans as a threat, Blain's public relations coordinator Dormie Roberts paused for a few seconds, then said, "I don't think so, because we are our own company, we are strong in what we do, they are strong in what they do, and I don't see them that way." Both chains date to 1955, and many people believe they once were under common ownership. That's not the case, Roberts said. Rather, she said, separate families started each firm, but both originally belonged to the same cooperative. "And they had an agreement saying that we'll be Farm & Fleet and you guys can be Fleet Farm," Roberts said. Not surprisingly, now that Mills is owned by a large investment firm, Blain's is stressing its hometown heritage. "They're the private equity company," Roberts said. "What we're trying to do is just really try to stick to our roots. We're still family-owned." Mills, meanwhile, stresses the size and range of its merchandise assortment. "There's no place that has the breadth and depth ... that Mills does," Prelle said. Coinciding with its expansion plans, Mills is building a new, $65 million distribution center in Chippewa Falls, Wis. The 1.1 million-square-foot plant, which will get $10 million in tax incremental financing from the city, is expected to employ 325 people after it opens next year. At the same time, some 150 to 200 jobs could be lost at Mills' distribution center in Appleton, the Appleton Post-Crescent reported in April.

SLOAN, Iowa (ABC4 Sports) - West Jordan's Jose Haro scored an 8th round knockout over Daniel Franco in a stunning upset to win the USBA featherweight title at WinnaVegas Casino Arena in Sloan, Iowa. Haro (14-1-1) is now expected to get a shot at the IBF world title sometime in the next few months. Franco came in as the heavy favorite with a four-inch height advantage, but Haro landed an overhand right 2 minutes and 43 seconds into the 8th round that floored Franco and caused the referee to stop the fight without even delivering a 10-count. This comes just 20 months after Haro was shot in both feet in the parking lot of a Walmart by Cole Shields, who later turned himself into to police and is currently serving time in jail. But after three surgeries, Haro was able to get back in the ring and now has won a boxing title. "It's a tough fight, but I do visualize winning this fight," Haro said before the fight. "I just want to come home, seeing my family at the airport greeting me and hugging my kids, and just telling them that daddy did it."

The 12-year-old black boy was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. CINCINNATI >> Police officers are on trial in Ohio and Minnesota for fatal shootings of black motorists during traffic stops. In both cases, prosecutors say the officers didn’t need to respond with deadly force. The officers both have testified they felt threatened. In Cincinnati, former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing for a second time faces charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in the July 2015 shooting of Sam DuBose, 43. Tensing has said he thought DuBose was trying to kill him with his car. A jury deadlocked last November. In Minnesota, St. Anthony Officer Jeronimo Yanez is charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting last July of Philando Castile. He testified Friday he saw Castile’s hand on a gun a before he fired. Castile had a permit and had told the officer he had a gun. The cases are among those across the United States in the last three years that have increased debate about race and policing. Here are some other high-profile deaths of blacks during police encounters: ——— JORDAN EDWARDS The U.S. Justice Department said in May that it’s investigating the fatal shooting of the 15-year-old by a white police officer in a Dallas suburb. Edwards was shot April 29 by Balch Springs police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. Balch Springs police had originally said the vehicle was reversing “in an aggressive manner” toward officers, who had responded to a complaint about underage drinking. But Police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver is free on bond. ——— TERENCE CRUTCHER An Oklahoma jury on May 17 found Officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16, 2016, death of Terence Crutcher, 40, shot shortly after Shelby arrived on a street to find Crutcher’s SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Shelby testified that she was afraid because Crutcher didn’t obey her commands and appeared to reach inside his SUV. Prosecutors told jurors that Shelby overreacted, noting that videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter showed Crutcher had his hands in the air and did not have a weapon. ——— ALTON STERLING Federal prosecutors announced May 3 that they would not seek charges against two white police officers who were involved in a deadly encounter with Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last summer. Sterling, 37, was shot to death on July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking demonstrations across Baton Rouge. U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson said Sterling was armed during the confrontation and the investigation didn’t find enough evidence to pursue charges. State authorities are investigating to decide whether to bring charges. ——— KEITH LAMONT SCOTT A prosecutor cleared a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer in the September 2016 fatal shooting of Scott, 43, killed while sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex as officers sought another man. A police review board decided that Officer Brentley Vinson followed proper procedure. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times Scott’s family said he did not have a gun. Charlotte-Mecklenburg District Attorney Andrew Murray cited evidence that Scott was armed, including a store’s surveillance video, DNA recovered from a handgun and a Facebook conversation from the man who said he sold the stolen gun to Scott. ——— JAMAR CLARK Clark’s November 2015 shooting death sparked weeks of protests in Minneapolis. The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest the 24-year-old when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. Some witnesses said Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, but federal and state probes concluded that he was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark’s hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Prosecutors decided not to charge either white officer, and an internal police investigation cleared them. ——— RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ball, 26. Boykin, awaiting trial, said he fired because Ball appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin, saying the officer violated policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancée to ride with him and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. Ball’s family has sued Boykin, the city and other police officials for wrongful death. ——— JEREMY MCDOLE McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander’s cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general’s office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed “extraordinarily poor” police work. In January, a federal judge approved the city’s $1.5 million settlement with McDole’s family. ——— WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced last October to 2½ years in prison for fatally shooting Chapman while responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart on April 22, 2015. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed the unarmed 18-year-old “willfully, deliberately and with premeditation.” Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin’s stun gun. Rankin, who is white, was fired. ——— WALTER SCOTT Prosecutors are recommending decades in prison for white South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, who shot Scott in the back as the motorist fled following a traffic stop. Slager pleaded guilty on May 2 to a federal charge of violating Scott’s civil rights. A judge will determine his sentence, which could range from probation to life in prison without parole. Scott’s shooting in April 2015 was captured on cellphone video and seen worldwide. ——— FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man was shackled but alive when he was put in a Baltimore police van in April 2015. He came out with severe neck injuries, and his subsequent death led to rioting. Six officers were charged initially, but prosecutors in July 2016 dropped all remaining charges after acquittals and a hung jury. Gray’s family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. —— ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff’s deputy Robert Bates, 74, was sentenced in 2016 to four years in prison for second-degree manslaughter in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, who was unarmed and restrained. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight, and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. ——— TAMIR RICE The 12-year-old was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers’ cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled Rice’s family’s lawsuit for $6 million. Cleveland in May fired Loehmann and suspended Garmack for 10 days. The officers’ union said it will challenge the discipline, calling it politically motivated. ——— AKAI GURLEY Rookie New York City police officer Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter last year in the November 2014 death of 28-year-old Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn when a sound startled him and he fired accidentally. A bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. A judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years’ probation and 800 hours of community service. The city settled with Gurley’s family for $4.1 million. ——— MICHAEL BROWN The unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department opted against civil rights charges. Wilson later resigned. The death of Brown led to months of occasionally violent protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. ——— LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in November 2015, on the same day that the city, under a judge’s orders, released dashcam video showing McDonald, a 17-year-old man, being shot 16 times on Oct. 20, 2014. Van Dyke, who is white, has pleaded not guilty. The video prompted local and federal investigations. The Justice Department determined in January that Chicago police have a long history of civil rights violations and excessive force. The Chicago Police Department has since released a new use-of-force policy that requires officers undergo de-escalation training and imposes stricter rules on when they can fire their weapons at fleeing suspects. ——— ERIC GARNER The 43-year-old man died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict that officer, or any others involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. ——— REKIA BOYD Chicago police officer Dante Servin resigned in May 2016 after the police superintendent said he should be fired for killing Boyd four years earlier. Servin was off-duty when he shot the 22-year-old unarmed woman. She had been walking down a street with her friends when he told them to be quiet, and he fired when he thought he saw a gun. Prosecutors charged Servin with involuntary manslaughter, a judge acquitted him in April 2016, saying he’d been improperly charged. The city settled a wrongful-death lawsuit in 2013 with Boyd’s family for $4.5 million.

Globalization, goodbye! 1 By JUAN T. GATBONTON on June 11, 2017 Opinion on Page One Tweet More and more states are saying ‘Stop the world…’ ‘Globalization’ is going out of fashion. The unintended consequences of the spread of industrial technologies; the intermingling of economies and cultures, and the rise of cross-border civil society are beginning to bite—and more and more countries are saying, “Stop the world; we want to get off!” Great transformation Globalization during this half-century has been “The Great Transformation.” It has speeded up not only the economic transition from artisan handicrafts to assembly-line industry and today’s cutting-edge technology. It has also embedded countries in multilateral economic, political and security networks that serve their collective purposes. This openness to cross-border influences has created new-types of jobs and livelihood opportunities and has eased global poverty. While the world’s population has doubled since 1960, the percentage living in poverty has also been cut in half. OFW and BPO For our country, the dramatic benefits from globalization have been overseas contract work and business-process outsourcing (BPO). Already, OFW remittances make up close to a tenth of GNP. Meanwhile, the BPO industry has generated nearly a million jobs, spread over every major city. Rising tide That was the good news. The problem is that the rising tide has, as usual, raised the yachts faster than the more modest craft. Sharp inequality has been the worst unintended consequence of globalization. Between 1960 and 1998—the years of East Asia’s ‘economic miracle’—the UNDP reported the richest 20 percent of the global population as consuming 86 percent of global resources—while the poorest 80 percent used up only 14 percent.“Some of the poorest countries have actually become worse off.” As Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize economist, pointed out, “inequality is self-perpetuating; and it is produced by the vast amount of political power the wealthy hold to control legislative and regulatory activity.” Shrinking middle class Already global income inequality is horrendous enough. The international charity OXFAM says the richest 1 percent controls half of all global wealth. The 80 richest individuals in the world together own $1.9 trillion—“nearly the same amount shared by the 3.5 billion people who occupy the bottom half of the world’s income scale.” In our country, labor’s share of income in total GDP has shrunk over the years, while the share of profit income has risen substantially (Cielito Habito, 2016). And this is true most everywhere in the world. The middle class— the bedrock of social stability—is shrinking, as globalization and the revolution in communication technology erode the foundation of its prosperity: the high-wage, middle-skill industrial job. Migrating jobs Of all the problems brought about by globalization, the migration of jobs from the rich countries to the poor ones has been the most wrenching. The loss of US manufacturing to Japan, China, Mexico—and more recently to East Asia—has deindustrialized the American heartland and set off the populist nationalist revolution that raised the demagogue Donald J. Trump to the White House. Global ‘pop’ culture Socially, the rise of a secular ‘pop culture’ is roiling local cultures, breaking down habits of deference and setting off local rebellions. So far its most destructive effects have been to foment anti-Western terrorism by Islamist factions, and to stir up Middle-East conflicts within the scope of the age-old Sunni-Shiite rivalry. In our country, the commercialization of agriculture has kindled successive peasant insurgencies. Until the middle 1940s, Filipino landowners had been compelled by custom to honor their rice-tenants’ right to subsistence loans during the lean months between planting and the harvest. Social cohesion Japan leads in using economic policy to preserve social cohesion. The state ensures full employment, job security, industrial peace. Not only does Japan protect its rural constituents with tariff barriers for their high-cost agriculture, it shields even its neighborhood retail stores from competition by foreign chains like the American Walmart. Globalizing politics In the Arab world, the spread to hierarchical cultures of foreign concepts of individual rights has set off popular democratic movements. But recent setbacks to this ‘Arab Spring’ dramatize the complexities of democratization, and legitimize—for influential theoreticians such as Harvard’s Samuel F. Huntington (1927-2008)—the idea of an “authoritarian interval” for the “developmental state.” During this “transition,” a strong man government would temper democratic practice, since—in the Singapore strongman Lee Kuan Yew’s view—“[t]he exuberance of democracy leads to undisciplined and disorderly conditions … inimical to development.” As their economies grew, strongmen regimes in Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia and Myanmar have yielded, with varying grace, much of their power. In China and Singapore, stern developmental states still ensure they control the ultimate source of political power: the commanding heights of the economy. No stopping the world As Stiglitz argues, the capitalist economy is not self-regulating. We need to find ways of managing globalization. We need to find an alternative to the prevailing model of a predatory kind of capitalism. We need to find an alternative to the prevailing view of the world “not as a global community but as an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage.”(Wall Street Journal, June 2017) To this hard-edged world-view famously espoused by Margaret Thatcher, East Asians might oppose their concept of the market and the state not as competing but as complementary operating systems. This economic model is not too different from the German “social market.” It has worked in China, where an anti-poverty drive has provided the impetus for growth during this last generation. The UN’s Millennium Development Goal reported that, in 1990, 61 percent of the Chinese people were in “extreme poverty.” In 2016, “just four percent are still extremely poor. Particularly for poor countries just entering the global economy, there might be merit in bringing together the best elements of both capitalism and socialism in a new applied art of governance—based on what works best for a particular society over a specific historical period. The question is far from resolved. But stopping the world won’t work; the headlong progress of technology by itself won’t allow it. The only certainty is that, for the late-industrializing country, good government is not a luxury but a necessity. Share. Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Email loading...

News ‘Manchester by the Sea’ Motivates Parents To Kill Their Son, Claims Prosecutor by admin — June 11, 2017 A New York couple has been accused of killing their adoptive son after taking inspiration from the 2016 film Manchester by the Sea. Heather Franklin, 33, and Ernest Franklin II, 35, of Mount Upton, N.Y. are charged with murdering their son, Jeffrey Franklin, 16, and burning their house down. The event happened on Feb. 28, just a few hours after Heather and Ernest Franklin II watched Manchester by the Sea. The dramatic film stars Casey Affleck as a Massachusetts native whose tragic past reveals that he accidentally burned down his house and killed his children in the process. Heather is currently being held on $125,000 or $250,000 bond while Ernest Franklin II is on $250,000 cash or $500,000 bond. Chenango County District Attorney Joseph McBride spoke to the judge at the couple’s bail review on Friday about how they may have been inspired by Manchester by the Sea. Judge, in this particular case, the defendant and her husband, co-defendant, were at home with Jeffrey on the night of February 28th. That night, according to this defendant, she watched a movie called ‘Manchester by the Sea’. And in that movie, Judge, the main character in that movie kills his children by an accidental fire and is told in the movie that you can’t be prosecuted for accidentally killing your children, and within two hours of that movie playing to this defendant and her husband, Jeffrey’s deceased. She inexplicably left the house, driving around Chenango County and Delaware County, and doesn’t return until the fire totally engulfs the house.” Parents killed teen in plot inspired by "Manchester by the Sea," District Attorney says: https://t.co/YSwfywYnH8 pic.twitter.com/22da7Ghk2X — CBS News (@CBSNews) April 12, 2017 Ernest Franklin II reportedly claimed that the fire was started by accident while Heather was out of the house shopping, and that he had “left the dogs out.” District Attorney McBride discussed how there were no animals found in the house and Jeffrey did not have evidence of smoke inhalation or traces of soot in his mouth, trachea or bronchi. The fire was reported March 1 at 1:15 a.m. ET. Jeffrey, who had special needs, was “badly burned” in the fire, according to McBride. The teen was a foster child before Heather and Ernest adopted him. “I believe in our attachments to my response to the Defendant’s Order to Show Cause, we’ve set out that there was a very big strain in the family relationship because of Jeffrey’s special needs and that this defendant was complaining on Facebook about the strain that that was putting on her,” McBride stated. Heather allegedly left the house to shop at Price Chopper in Sidney followed by Walmart in Norwich, looking for a specific drug. The 33-year-old is pregnant and her attorney said in court that her client is “innocent until proven guilty.” We will post reasonable amount of bail and she will stay in this county and she will be able to care for her child in her womb. She’s a high-risk pregnancy. She already lost one child to a miscarriage a year and a half ago. She deserves to be let free and work toward defending herself.” Both Heather Franklin and Ernest Franklin II are being held in the Chenango County Jail as of this week. Casey Affleck wins the Oscar for ‘Manchester by the Sea’ [Image by Frazier Harrison/Getty Images] was a popular film in the final months of 2016 leading into the first few months of 2017. The film was a big presence in the awards race, netting major nominations and the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Oscars. At the Oscars, which were held two days before the Franklin incident, Casey Affleck won the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance as Lee Chandler. Manchester by the Sea director and screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan also took home an Oscar, winning for Best Original Screenplay.

Fred Katayama reports. Video Transcript One visit to trucking company Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry shares have soared 70 percent in two months. Titanium is an early adapter of BlackBerry's new fleet-tracking service, Radar. Radar collects and transmits information on the movement, temperature, and content of the more than 1000 truck trailers that make up Titanium's fleet. Titanium's CEO Ted Daniel says Radar saves him money. (SOUNDBITE) TED DANIEL, CEO, TITANIUM TRANSPORTATION GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "If a driver is looking for a trailer, and it takes him five minutes to find a trailer in a big, huge Walmart, you know, thousand-trailer yard, as opposed to taking an hour, that's a big time savings." The Radar system is one way BlackBerry is trying to turn itself around. The Canadian telecom company known for its once ubiquitous pioneering smartphones is also trying to expand into self-driving technology and cyber-security software. The strategy is to steer away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products for businesses. But some analysts say the strategy carries risks. BlackBerry faces stiff competition from giants like Verizon, which last year paid more than $2 billion to buy the GPS vehicle tracking firm, Fleetmatics. more from technology   transport   Multimedia VIDEO Nadal crushes Wawrinka to win French Open VIDEO Uber board to discuss CEO absence: source VIDEO No change to climate change positions expected at G7 environment summit VIDEO Gaddafi's son walks free in Libya AUDIO Dubai's green strategy in office blocks vs residential communities AUDIO Effect of UK election on Brexit and the UAE Advertisement Most Popular Videos BlackBerry hopes to ride trucks to growth 09 Jun 2017 - Reuters Videos D3 provides hub for creative minds 01 May 2017 - Accelerate SME Protesters gather outside Hong Kong shark fin soup restaurant 2 days ago - Reuters Videos Advertisement About zawya Contact us Copyright © 2017 Zawya.

The studio, built in a barn by Jim Guercio in 1971 and used by Chicago, Elton John, U2, Michael Jackson and more, will be inducted alongside Walsh and his band Barnstorm, as well as the late singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg. Also in the music hall's Class of 2017: Denver jazz masters Dianne Reeves, Charles Burrell, Bill Frisell and Ron Miles, as well as Earth, Wind & Fire members — and classmates at Denver's East High School — Philip Bailey, Larry Dunn and Andrew Woolfolk.

(Charlie Wendt / Camera file photo) The Colorado Music Hall of Fame on Monday announced it will host an induction concert called "The Rocky Mountain Way" on Aug. 13 — Fogelberg's birthday — at Fiddler's Green Amphitheatre in Greenwood Village. Performers on the bill include Brooks, Amy Grant and Vince Gill, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Todd Park Mohr of Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Buffalo Springfield's Richie Furay, Alabama's Randy Owen, Michael Martin Murphey and more. Walsh, who played in the James Gang and the Eagles, will perform alongside Kenny Passarelli and Joe Vitale in the reunited Barnstorm. The group's 1972 album, "Barnstorm," was the first recorded at Caribou Ranch. Advertisement The evening will feature a special performance of Barnstorm's "The Rocky Mountain Way," which will be filmed by PBS for its concert series "Soundstage." Long time coming This year's class marks the seventh group of Colorado Music Hall of Fame inductees. Past years honored Boulder's Glenn Miller, Judy Collins, John Denver, concert promoter Barry Fey and Red Rocks Amphitheatre, which is home to the hall of fame's historical exhibits. The induction of Fogelberg, Walsh and Barnstorm and Caribou Ranch is years in the making. In 2013, organizers told the Daily Camera the two musicians and the studio would be inducted as members of the Class of 2014. Later press coverage references plans to induct them in 2015. Phil Lobel, a publicist for the Colorado Music Hall of Fame, said the delay in inducting Fogelberg, Walsh and Caribou Ranch was so that the event could be coordinated with the completion and release of a new Fogelberg tribute album. That collection is expected out around Thanksgiving. "Some things are worth waiting for," Lobel wrote in an email. 'The most crazy experiment' August's concert will come about three years after Guercio and his family sold the 1,600-acre Boulder County property for $32.5 million — and more than three decades after a fire ended the studio's 1970s and '80s heyday. The buyer is part of the Walton family, descendents of the founders of Walmart. In 2013, Guercio told the Camera that his first sight of the Caribou Ranch property in the Boulder County foothills "was a spiritual experience." A photo of Jim Guercio working on the soundboard during Caribou Ranch's heyday outside of Nederland. (File photo) It took three years of legal wrangling and negotiations, but, in 1971, he was able to build a studio getaway he hoped would appeal to musicians. "It was the most crazy experiment," Guercio said. "Everybody said, 'No one will come up there. What are you, nuts?'" But they did come. First, it was Walsh and his post-James Gang band Barnstorm. Then, over the next 14 years, Caribou Ranch hosted more than 150 acts ranging from Stephen Stills and Elton John to Billy Joel, the Beach Boys and Blood, Sweat & Tears. That ranch above Boulder became the first "destination" studio. John McEuen, a member of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, told the Camera in 1985 that sometimes "it was almost too nice to record." "We'd be standing around the studio asking, 'Where's the harmonica player?' — 'He's fishing.' 'What about the bass player, can you get him off that horse?' 'Will the singer be through swimming in time to do these overdubs?'" When the property was put up for sale in 2013, the hall of fame's G. Brown called the studio "certainly one of the biggest, if not the biggest, part of our music cultural history." Tickets to the 2017 Colorado Music Hall of Fame's induction concert are $25 to $125 and go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday. The Denver Post contributed to this report.

"I Have to Hold My Family Together": The Hidden Costs of Prison Visits Saturday, June 10, 2017 By Ese Olumhense, Truthout | Report font size decrease font size increase font size Print Tweet A woman and child sit in a van destined for upstate to a New York state correctional facility, as the van waits on last-minute passengers to board on May 12, 2017 in Manhattan, New York. Hundreds are visiting loved ones incarcerated in the state this weekend, Mother's Day weekend. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) This story is the seventh piece in the Truthout series, Severed Ties: The Human Toll of Prisons. This series dives deeply into the impact of incarceration on families, loved ones and communities, demonstrating how the United States' incarceration of more than 2 million people also harms many millions more -- including 2.7 million children. Most of the men in Carolyn Loveless' family are (or have been) in prison. Currently, both of her sons are behind bars, as are her five nephews. They are scattered in prisons across New York, from New York City, where most of the family is from, to Altona, a 15-minute drive from the US-Canada border, where one of Loveless' sons is currently incarcerated. Loveless, who first started visiting state prisons when she was 7, brought along by her grandmother to visit her grandfather upstate, still tries to visit almost everyone regularly, 40 years later. Hardly any visits in recent memory, however, have been as special as the visit the 47-year-old left for on the night of Friday, May 12, she said. Two days before Mother's Day, she was bound for Altona Correctional Facility to visit her son, currently incarcerated there. "This is it," Loveless told Truthout that night, as she waited for the 10 pm van picking her and about a dozen others up at 58th Street and 8th Avenue in Manhattan. "This is the Mother's Day visit." The occasion is one of the more important ones for families hoping to see relatives on the inside. During a holiday weekend when one might assume most mothers in New York City are enjoying breakfast in bed, brunch or a much-needed break, hundreds of women and children like Loveless -- almost all Black and Brown, and mostly low-income -- board commercial buses and vans from pick-up points in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx, all headed to New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) facilities upstate to see mothers, sons, daughters and other loved ones locked up hundreds of miles away. The visitor hospitality center at Altona Correctional Facility. Visitors check in here before proceeding into the facility and visit room. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) The long, taxing tours aren't cheap. In 2011, after 38 years of operation, New York ended its free bussing program to upstate correctional facilities, leaving tens of thousands who relied on the monthly service without an affordable alternative. A year later, in 2012, visits to upstate centers had fallen by more than 13,000. Moves away from free bussing programs have played out similarly in other states, too. Last year, Illinois' free bussing program was also eliminated, becoming what some criminal legal reform proponents dubbed "a victim to partisan budgetary politics." Legal services advocates there later spearheaded a massive fundraising campaign to help children visit their incarcerated parents. More and more states, advocates told Truthout, are likely to abandon similar programs in their states, especially as video-visitation and other tele-visiting technologies are increasingly adopted. Like in Illinois and elsewhere, New York State corrections officials maintained that the free buses, which up until 2011 had been funded through surcharges on prison phone calls, were not utilized enough to justify the $1.25 million annual cost. Additionally, they claimed, visitor totals fell little following the cancellation of the shuttle program, and some maximum-security prisons saw increases in visits. At the time, a spokesperson acknowledged that, "Visitation is an extremely important part of an inmate's rehabilitation and preparation for reentry." The department further pledged to do "everything" it could to facilitate visitation in the absence of the free buses. Nearly five years since that promise, however, DOCCS cannot assess whether or not those efforts have paid off. It claims it does not know whether visitors to its prisons have increased or decreased. In response to a Freedom of Information Law request seeking the number of annual visitors at all DOCCS correctional facilities, DOCCS said it "does not track the number of inmate visitors nor maintain visitation records in a format that permits practical computation of annual statistics," though state data on facility visits has been released to the public in the past. Asked multiple times about the "missing" visitation data, more than one DOCCS staffer could not provide an answer -- responses that confused some state criminal legal advocates, as well as the families and friends of some of those incarcerated in the state. Though a DOCCS spokesperson told Truthout that the department hosts a number of special visitation events for families each year (more than 600 in 2016), it still claims it does not track visitor totals, leading some to question its strategy for funding so much of this programming without collecting the data needed to assess its impact. Others have expressed skepticism, questioning whether the claim may have been put forth to frustrate efforts to reinstate the free bus program. Commercial Bussing: High Costs, High Risk At least one proposal in the state legislature intends to reintroduce the free bus program. Assemblywoman Carmen De La Rosa, a new legislator and sponsor of the bill, believes reintroducing the shuttle service will help alleviate some of the financial anxiety surrounding visits for low-income families. Visitors check in their commissary packages at Altona Correctional Facility, a medium-security facility in Altona, New York, on May 13, 2017. Each incarcerated individual in DOCCS facilities in the state is entitled to up to 35 pounds of goods each month. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) "It makes sense to have this be a free service in our state," De La Rosa, a Democrat who is also on the assembly's corrections committee, told Truthout. "It is the least that we can do for families who at times have lost lifetimes with a family member because that family member has committed a crime and is doing time. Those families are also doing the time as well." Presently though, the burden for transportation to these upstate facilities falls on the shoulders of some of the most marginalized people in the state, who now must find other ways of getting to their relatives and friends. De La Rosa says this situation leaves some of her constituents in the working-class New York City neighborhoods of Inwood, Washington Heights and Marble Hill "scraping by." "No one should be forced to pick between eating and providing their child that relationship," she said. After the bus service was cancelled, companies rushed to fill the void left in its absence. Depending on the destination, cash-only tickets can be purchased from fly-by-night operators with no listed phone number or address, for anywhere from $50 to $70 or more per person. (This expense is in addition to meals, commissary items and other goods needed for the trip.) For families now leaning on one or no source of income, the lofty price of travel is a significant deterrent, but convenience and cost are not the only issues reported by families taking the trips. Many of the companies making these long and demanding treks each weekend offer no proof of commercial driver's licenses, some riders said, which would require them to comply with specific safety guidelines set by the Department of Motor Vehicles for commercial operators. Offering cheaper prices and door-to-door pick-up, some of these companies have attracted faithful flocks of desperate riders, while flouting safety measures like car seats for young children or maximum occupancy standards. Further, buses and vans often break down, some travelers said, sometimes in the middle of the night, leaving families stranded for hours at frosty roadsides as they wait for replacement rides. A view of Altona Correctional Facility in Altona, New York. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) Just a few months ago, Loveless and her granddaughter spent a week stranded in the Albany area, after the 10 year old had an asthma attack while headed up to Altona to see her father. The driver, who works for Prison Gap, one of the oldest bus companies founded to serve New York City families with loved ones in prison, dropped them off to wait for an ambulance, Loveless says, and didn't come back to pick them up (as promised) on the way back when the girl was discharged. Instead, Loveless had to wait for a relative to come pick her up the next week. On a January trip, this time with Flamboyant Bus Service, the other leading bus company making the upstate tours, Bronx mother Gloria Castillo, 43, said the bus she and her three children were on, caught fire. Panicked, drowsy passengers rushed off, struggling to gather as many possessions as possible. Many reportedly still lost key documents, clothing, food and diapers. One woman reported losing $4,000 during the incident. No rider in either of these incidents got their money back from the bus's operators, Castillo and Loveless said. It's rare that anyone does, a few travelers said, even when delays cost families a planned visit. Loveless didn't get to see her son that weekend, and said Prison Gap refused to reimburse her for the portion of the trip she did not take. Representatives from both Flamboyant and Prison Gap maintain that although accidents do happen, both companies work diligently to ensure passenger safety. When incidents happen that interfere with trips, representatives told Truthout, refunds are not usually given, but credits for future rides are. Both also pointed to the fact that no rider on either trip mentioned was seriously hurt, something they said speaks to the professionalism of both companies. But, employees of both companies said, many of their newer competitors are operating with troubling disregard for safety. This, one employee said, is the result of "greedy" business practices. "They don't really care about the people, they just care about the money," said an employee of Prison Gap, telling Truthout that he has been working in the transportation industry for 40 years. "They're not treating people with respect, they just don't care." Fearing that complaints could prompt retaliation from a bus company, many travelers said they have not filed formal complaints with state or city officials. For most, particularly those without access to a car, these buses and vans are the only ways of getting to the prisons they need to visit, and thus dictate when many can see family and friends, and how much it will cost them. In Loveless's case, Prison Gap is the only bus company going to Altona on the weekends, so it's her only option for getting to her son. For those who huddled at the pick-up point at 58th and 8th in New York at the start of Mother's Day weekend this May, these risks and hidden expenses are the necessary costs of visiting relatives and friends in lock up. For others, the long trip, its cost and the potential hazards have slowed visits to a halt. Crumbling Support for Crucial Ties A sign hanging in the entrance to Altona's visitor center lays out the rules for drug dectection scans at the facility. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) More than four decades of research shows that regular contact with family members through visits decreases recidivism and improves post-incarceration outcomes. One of the earliest tests of this theory, a 1972 study conducted by the California Department of Corrections, found that sustained family contact was a "major correctional technique." Researchers evaluated more than 800 incarcerated people in California, finding that incarcerated individuals who did not receive visitors (dubbed "loners") were six times more likely to wind up back in prison during the first year. "Visiting is crucial," said Jack Beck, director of the Prison Visiting Project at the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit that advocates for criminal legal system reform. "It is, to me, one of the most essential elements of rehabilitation. You can't expect people to come out and do well on the outside without having support. But that support you can't expect to create itself once [the incarcerated person] leaves. It has to have been maintained while they are inside." Regular visits, Beck and other advocates agreed, are key to not only the safety and well-being of incarcerated people and the staff who regularly work with them, but also to children of incarcerated parents. The majority of people in the US's prisons are parents of minor children, experts say, yet supportive policies and programs (like free shuttle services) that would encourage healthy parent-child ties once a parent is incarcerated are lacking. "We're taxing the poorest people to stay in contact with each other, and a lot of these costs fall disproportionately on women, who are the partners of incarcerated fathers," said Lucius Couloute, policy associate at the Prison Policy Initiative. "But also, incarcerated women, who are most likely the primary caregivers in their families -- they are trying to stay in touch with their kids. What is this doing to that relationship? It can't be healthy. We know it can't be healthy."  The impact of this separation is staggering, research shows, and falls most heavily on children of color, who make up more than 70 percent of US children with incarcerated parents. Children who do not regularly visit their incarcerated parents fare worse on IQ tests and are more prone to self-esteem and behavioral issues than those who do. Shantee Holloman fears her nephew's 10-year-old son will suffer as a result of separation from his incarcerated father. This is why she brings the boy to Green Haven Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Dutchess County, to see his dad once monthly. Her nephew was present for only the first year of his son's life before being sentenced to 40 years for robbery, his first offense. Then he was 19. He's now 29. "He had just made it to [his son's] first birthday, and that was it." Holloman, 35, said, recalling the sentencing. "It's so sad. This is why I try to keep him in contact with him. I don't want him to forget him. I don't think he would know who he is without this." More than once, the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision has recognized the significance of maintaining family ties through visits. In its handbook, the department says, "Visitation by family and friends is encouraged," and calls it a "positive influence" on an incarcerated individual's time in prison. Dozens of criminal legal reform proponents have even celebrated DOCCS as a "national leader" in understanding the value of visits, particularly at maximum-security facilities. But in the six years since the free shuttle service was cancelled, some, like Holloman and Loveless, feel an already taxing visiting process has become even more complicated and arduous, effectively stunting progress toward DOCCS' own supposed visitation goals. Holding the Family Together On their recent visit, the Lovelesses and others arrived at the Altona Correctional Facility close to 6 am on Saturday. Almost all of the travelers slept for much of the nearly 300 miles of winding way to 555 Devil's Den Road, where the medium-security prison is located, save for a couple of bathroom breaks and a 4:30 am visit to a Walmart near the facility, where many of the women on board, sighing, jumped out to purchase last-minute commissary items. After their visit on May 13, passengers sleep in the van back to New York City from Altona. The ride back is expected to take up to 8 hours. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) Most have lugged swollen black garbage bags and fraying pushcarts full of favorite foods and clothes to this point, but some items are cheaper and easier to get at Walmart: a steak fajita mix popular with those locked-up at Altona, white socks and undershirts, sweet peppers. Each of their bags and carts holds 35 pounds of items, give or take: the total monthly weight DOCCS permits for any packages destined for those on the inside. Loveless, a visit veteran, says she now knows the correct weight by sight. Now inside Altona's tiny "hospitality center," just after 6 am, the women begin sign-in, checking in their packages and making impassioned cases before the site's officers as to why their cans of seasoned tuna and mesh shorts should be admitted. Most are unsuccessful, forced then to stash contraband sausage links and bath towels in lockers provided to them. Guests then prepare for visits, ducking into a pair of bathrooms to prep and prime. Sweatsuits are swapped for form-fitting (but still DOCCS-appropriate) blouses and jeans. Hair is brushed down from scarves and ponytails, make-up hastily yet carefully applied. Jewelry. Perfume. It's now 8 am, and visiting hours have begun. Before guests can access the visiting room, IDs are scanned, and visitors photographed. Photographs, taken every time, are checked in a facial recognition database, officers say, to make sure visitors are who they say they are. (Morpho, the French multinational company that created the facial recognition system DOCCS uses, has also partnered with the FBI in the past to develop its facial recognition programs.) But despite its use in DOCCS facilities, the software is not described in the copy of the department's handbook given to Truthout by a department spokesperson. Instead, prospective visitors are told their photograph will be taken for the "visitor identification system." The software works slowly on this day, delaying the first few guests, including Loveless. But after a few tries, she is cleared. The grandmother must then remove her bra to walk through a metal detector in order to prove that she's only wearing an underwire and not smuggling in any prohibited items. Only then are they allowed up to the visiting room to see Loveless's son -- a moment she calls the "highlight" of the entire process, the one thing making it all worth it. "When it's your kids, it don't even matter," Loveless said of the trip. "I walk through mountains for mine." And though some state politicians are trying legislate paths around the "mountains" Loveless describes, she is hesitant to get her hopes up. For the foreseeable future, she plans to continue to put in the time, energy and money necessary to maintain contact with incarcerated members of her family. "I have to hold my family together," Loveless said. "If I don't hold my family together, I won't have a family." Copyright, Truthout. May not be reprinted without permission.

Hundreds are visiting loved ones incarcerated in the state this weekend, Mother's Day weekend. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) This story is the seventh piece in the Truthout series, Severed Ties: The Human Toll of Prisons. This series dives deeply into the impact of incarceration on families, loved ones and communities, demonstrating how the United States' incarceration of more than 2 million people also harms many millions more -- including 2.7 million children. Most of the men in Carolyn Loveless' family are (or have been) in prison. Currently, both of her sons are behind bars, as are her five nephews. They are scattered in prisons across New York, from New York City, where most of the family is from, to Altona, a 15-minute drive from the US-Canada border, where one of Loveless' sons is currently incarcerated. Loveless, who first started visiting state prisons when she was 7, brought along by her grandmother to visit her grandfather upstate, still tries to visit almost everyone regularly, 40 years later. Hardly any visits in recent memory, however, have been as special as the visit the 47-year-old left for on the night of Friday, May 12, she said. Two days before Mother's Day, she was bound for Altona Correctional Facility to visit her son, currently incarcerated there. "This is it," Loveless told Truthout that night, as she waited for the 10 pm van picking her and about a dozen others up at 58th Street and 8th Avenue in Manhattan. "This is the Mother's Day visit." The occasion is one of the more important ones for families hoping to see relatives on the inside. During a holiday weekend when one might assume most mothers in New York City are enjoying breakfast in bed, brunch or a much-needed break, hundreds of women and children like Loveless -- almost all Black and Brown, and mostly low-income -- board commercial buses and vans from pick-up points in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx, all headed to New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) facilities upstate to see mothers, sons, daughters and other loved ones locked up hundreds of miles away. The visitor hospitality center at Altona Correctional Facility. Visitors check in here before proceeding into the facility and visit room. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) The long, taxing tours aren't cheap. In 2011, after 38 years of operation, New York ended its free bussing program to upstate correctional facilities, leaving tens of thousands who relied on the monthly service without an affordable alternative. A year later, in 2012, visits to upstate centers had fallen by more than 13,000. Moves away from free bussing programs have played out similarly in other states, too. Last year, Illinois' free bussing program was also eliminated, becoming what some criminal legal reform proponents dubbed "a victim to partisan budgetary politics." Legal services advocates there later spearheaded a massive fundraising campaign to help children visit their incarcerated parents. More and more states, advocates told Truthout, are likely to abandon similar programs in their states, especially as video-visitation and other tele-visiting technologies are increasingly adopted. Like in Illinois and elsewhere, New York State corrections officials maintained that the free buses, which up until 2011 had been funded through surcharges on prison phone calls, were not utilized enough to justify the $1.25 million annual cost. Additionally, they claimed, visitor totals fell little following the cancellation of the shuttle program, and some maximum-security prisons saw increases in visits. At the time, a spokesperson acknowledged that, "Visitation is an extremely important part of an inmate's rehabilitation and preparation for reentry." The department further pledged to do "everything" it could to facilitate visitation in the absence of the free buses. Nearly five years since that promise, however, DOCCS cannot assess whether or not those efforts have paid off. It claims it does not know whether visitors to its prisons have increased or decreased. In response to a Freedom of Information Law request seeking the number of annual visitors at all DOCCS correctional facilities, DOCCS said it "does not track the number of inmate visitors nor maintain visitation records in a format that permits practical computation of annual statistics," though state data on facility visits has been released to the public in the past. Asked multiple times about the "missing" visitation data, more than one DOCCS staffer could not provide an answer -- responses that confused some state criminal legal advocates, as well as the families and friends of some of those incarcerated in the state. Though a DOCCS spokesperson told Truthout that the department hosts a number of special visitation events for families each year (more than 600 in 2016), it still claims it does not track visitor totals, leading some to question its strategy for funding so much of this programming without collecting the data needed to assess its impact. Others have expressed skepticism, questioning whether the claim may have been put forth to frustrate efforts to reinstate the free bus program. Commercial Bussing: High Costs, High Risk At least one proposal in the state legislature intends to reintroduce the free bus program. Assemblywoman Carmen De La Rosa, a new legislator and sponsor of the bill, believes reintroducing the shuttle service will help alleviate some of the financial anxiety surrounding visits for low-income families. Visitors check in their commissary packages at Altona Correctional Facility, a medium-security facility in Altona, New York, on May 13, 2017. Each incarcerated individual in DOCCS facilities in the state is entitled to up to 35 pounds of goods each month. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) "It makes sense to have this be a free service in our state," De La Rosa, a Democrat who is also on the assembly's corrections committee, told Truthout. "It is the least that we can do for families who at times have lost lifetimes with a family member because that family member has committed a crime and is doing time. Those families are also doing the time as well." Presently though, the burden for transportation to these upstate facilities falls on the shoulders of some of the most marginalized people in the state, who now must find other ways of getting to their relatives and friends. De La Rosa says this situation leaves some of her constituents in the working-class New York City neighborhoods of Inwood, Washington Heights and Marble Hill "scraping by." "No one should be forced to pick between eating and providing their child that relationship," she said. After the bus service was cancelled, companies rushed to fill the void left in its absence. Depending on the destination, cash-only tickets can be purchased from fly-by-night operators with no listed phone number or address, for anywhere from $50 to $70 or more per person. (This expense is in addition to meals, commissary items and other goods needed for the trip.) For families now leaning on one or no source of income, the lofty price of travel is a significant deterrent, but convenience and cost are not the only issues reported by families taking the trips. Many of the companies making these long and demanding treks each weekend offer no proof of commercial driver's licenses, some riders said, which would require them to comply with specific safety guidelines set by the Department of Motor Vehicles for commercial operators. Offering cheaper prices and door-to-door pick-up, some of these companies have attracted faithful flocks of desperate riders, while flouting safety measures like car seats for young children or maximum occupancy standards. Further, buses and vans often break down, some travelers said, sometimes in the middle of the night, leaving families stranded for hours at frosty roadsides as they wait for replacement rides. A view of Altona Correctional Facility in Altona, New York. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) Just a few months ago, Loveless and her granddaughter spent a week stranded in the Albany area, after the 10 year old had an asthma attack while headed up to Altona to see her father. The driver, who works for Prison Gap, one of the oldest bus companies founded to serve New York City families with loved ones in prison, dropped them off to wait for an ambulance, Loveless says, and didn't come back to pick them up (as promised) on the way back when the girl was discharged. Instead, Loveless had to wait for a relative to come pick her up the next week. On a January trip, this time with Flamboyant Bus Service, the other leading bus company making the upstate tours, Bronx mother Gloria Castillo, 43, said the bus she and her three children were on, caught fire. Panicked, drowsy passengers rushed off, struggling to gather as many possessions as possible. Many reportedly still lost key documents, clothing, food and diapers. One woman reported losing $4,000 during the incident. No rider in either of these incidents got their money back from the bus's operators, Castillo and Loveless said. It's rare that anyone does, a few travelers said, even when delays cost families a planned visit. Loveless didn't get to see her son that weekend, and said Prison Gap refused to reimburse her for the portion of the trip she did not take. Representatives from both Flamboyant and Prison Gap maintain that although accidents do happen, both companies work diligently to ensure passenger safety. When incidents happen that interfere with trips, representatives told Truthout, refunds are not usually given, but credits for future rides are. Both also pointed to the fact that no rider on either trip mentioned was seriously hurt, something they said speaks to the professionalism of both companies. But, employees of both companies said, many of their newer competitors are operating with troubling disregard for safety. This, one employee said, is the result of "greedy" business practices. "They don't really care about the people, they just care about the money," said an employee of Prison Gap, telling Truthout that he has been working in the transportation industry for 40 years. "They're not treating people with respect, they just don't care." Fearing that complaints could prompt retaliation from a bus company, many travelers said they have not filed formal complaints with state or city officials. For most, particularly those without access to a car, these buses and vans are the only ways of getting to the prisons they need to visit, and thus dictate when many can see family and friends, and how much it will cost them. In Loveless's case, Prison Gap is the only bus company going to Altona on the weekends, so it's her only option for getting to her son. For those who huddled at the pick-up point at 58th and 8th in New York at the start of Mother's Day weekend this May, these risks and hidden expenses are the necessary costs of visiting relatives and friends in lock up. For others, the long trip, its cost and the potential hazards have slowed visits to a halt. Crumbling Support for Crucial Ties A sign hanging in the entrance to Altona's visitor center lays out the rules for drug dectection scans at the facility. (Photo: Ese Olumhense) More than four decades of research shows that regular contact with family members through visits decreases recidivism and improves post-incarceration outcomes. One of the earliest tests of this theory, a 1972 study conducted by the California Department of Corrections, found that sustained family contact was a "major correctional technique." Researchers evaluated more than 800 incarcerated people in California, finding that incarcerated individuals who did not receive visitors (dubbed "loners") were six times more likely to wind up back in prison during the first year. "Visiting is crucial," said Jack Beck, director of the Prison Visiting Project at the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit that advocates for criminal legal system reform. "It is, to me, one of the most essential elements of rehabilitation. You can't expect people to come out and do well on the outside without having support. But that support you can't expect to create itself once [the incarcerated person] leaves. It has to have been maintained while they are inside." Regular visits, Beck and other advocates agreed, are key to not only the safety and well-being of incarcerated people and the staff who regularly work with them, but also to children of incarcerated parents. The majority of people in the US's prisons are parents of minor children, experts say, yet supportive policies and programs (like free shuttle services) that would encourage healthy parent-child ties once a parent is incarcerated are lacking. "We're taxing the poorest people to stay in contact with each other, and a lot of these costs fall disproportionately on women, who are the partners of incarcerated fathers," said Lucius Couloute, policy associate at the Prison Policy Initiative. "But also, incarcerated women, who are most likely the primary caregivers in their families -- they are trying to stay in touch with their kids. What is this doing to that relationship? It can't be healthy. We know it can't be healthy."  The impact of this separation is staggering, research shows, and falls most heavily on children of color, who make up more than 70 percent of US children with incarcerated parents. Children who do not regularly visit their incarcerated parents fare worse on IQ tests and are more prone to self-esteem and behavioral issues than those who do. Shantee Holloman fears her nephew's 10-year-old son will suffer as a result of separation from his incarcerated father. This is why she brings the boy to Green Haven Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Dutchess County, to see his dad once monthly. Her nephew was present for only the first year of his son's life before being sentenced to 40 years for robbery, his first offense. Then he was 19. He's now 29. "He had just made it to [his son's] first birthday, and that was it." Holloman, 35, said, recalling the sentencing. "It's so sad. This is why I try to keep him in contact with him. I don't want him to forget him. I don't think he would know who he is without this." More than once, the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision has recognized the significance of maintaining family ties through visits. In its handbook, the department says, "Visitation by family and friends is encouraged," and calls it a "positive influence" on an incarcerated individual's time in prison. Dozens of criminal legal reform proponents have even celebrated DOCCS as a "national leader" in understanding the value of visits, particularly at maximum-security facilities.

Amarendra Dasa, 21, died at 5:09 a.m. Saturday, according to the Spartanburg County Coroner’s Office The Coroner’s Office, Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office and South Carolina Law Enforcement Division are jointly investigating the death. Neither the Sheriff’s Office nor SLED had any updates Saturday night on the cause of death. “Our work is continuing and we’ve sent two agents to the detention center,” said SLED spokesman Thom Berry. The Coroner’s Office said Dasa’s cause of death will be determined after an autopsy. Dasa was arrested in February 2015, charged with murder in the death of his younger brother, Aja Dasa. Police accused Amarendra Dasa of stabbing his brother in the abdomen on the afternoon of Feb. 11. Aja Dasa fled his Webber Way home and sought help at a neighbor’s house before he died. Amarendra Dasa also left the house after the stabbing. Police used a K-9 unit to track him down near a Wal-Mart on East Main Street. Police and family members said in 2015 that Amarendra Dasa suffered from a schizoaffective disorder. In November 2016, Dasa was found incompetent to stand trial after a mental health evaluation, and remained in jail, according to jail records. In response to an inquiry by the Herald-Journal last month about the status of Dasa’s case, 7th Circuit Solicitor’s Office spokesman Murray Glenn said in an email that the mental health evaluation process was still in progress and the Solicitor’s Office was waiting for a report to be finalized before deciding how to proceed in the case.

File photo Belleville is about to get a second Walmart Supercenter, and this one is coming without the lure of tax increment financing. File photo Editorials June 10, 2017 7:00 PM Truth in tax increment financing arrives with property tax bills By The Editorial Board LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The St. Clair County property tax bills are arriving in local mailboxes, and with them comes a little piece of truth: Tax increment financing districts grabbed $45.7 million of the $343 million collected in the county last year. That is 13.3 percent. The bills and the pie chart showing the TIF slice stand in contrast to recent arguments by Belleville City Hall leaders and attorney Kevin Vick, whose firm advises business development. Belleville leaders tell the business community that in 2015 when they issued $493,911 in incentives, they generated slightly more than $1 million in taxes. Sounds great, except that Belleville collected $18.6 million from taxpayers for TIF districts during the fiscal year ending April 2016. There is a resistance to tax increment financing for no good reason, Vick told the St. Louis Business Journal as part of a panel of experts on southwestern Illinois developments. “The only tax revenue diverted to help finance the redevelopment are the tax dollars generated by the incremental increase in the assessed valuation of the improved property,” he said. “And you can’t lose something you never had to begin with. Without the TIF, the development would not occur and the increased tax revenue, which is supposedly lost, would never materialize and the benefits of the economic activity and improvements to the community would not be realized.” If that’s true, someone needs to write St. Clair County taxpayers a refund check for $45.7 million. The problem is whether the TIF made the development happen, or whether it would have happened anyway without a gift to the business from taxpayers.   Vick and Belleville leaders say TIF dollars create business. It may be a tool, but is it worth the cost? When the East-West Gateway Council of Governments studied the issue in 2011, it found that TIF dollars created little growth that would not have happened anyway. What the districts really did was take about $6 billion from taxpayers and other taxing districts, mainly schools, and allow one community to rob their neighbor of potential businesses that would have developed regardless. Besides taxpayers, the pain fell on poorer communities unable to leverage TIF districts like their richer neighbors. For a more up-to-date example that TIF isn’t needed to drive growth, look to Belleville and the new Walmart Supercenter being planned. Walmart will build a second Supercenter in Belleville based on market opportunity, not on getting TIF dollars. TIF is the No. 2 recipient of property taxes behind schools. To believe the districts do not drive up property taxes is to believe the school costs do not increase during the 23 years — or the 35 years in the case of Belleville’s $11 million TIF 3 — that a TIF district captures a new development’s tax revenue. To its credit, Belleville has moved toward special sales tax districts in which the merchant must face the competitive disadvantage of collecting a higher sales tax to get a taxpayer benefit.

Now, the captain of the Mystic Krewe of Nyx refuses to answer our questions after a source dropped off a stack of credit card records that one CPA says may show violations of the law. Carnival krewes typically spend money on beads, floats and bands. So, when one krewe's credit card shows a $7,000 charge for a Gulf Shores vacation, it raises serious questions. "There are several in there that raise red flags to me," says CPA Patrick Lynch of Rogers, Lynch & Associates. The $7,000 charge was apparently for a condo rental at Gulf Shores, Alabama.  A few weeks after Mardi Gras in 2016, Nyx credit card records show charges at an Office Depot in Foley, Alabama, at a Walgreens in Gulf Shores and at Papa Rocco's Restaurant, also in Gulf Shores. Someone also charged $212 at The Hangout. A source gave FOX 8 News about 23 months' worth of credit card records for the Krewe of Nyx, which is a non-profit organization. A review shows dozens and dozens of charges that raise questions. "Being a nonprofit, any and all monies they expend should be furthering the mission of the nonprofit and it should not be benefiting any individuals," Lynch says. If they're not, there could be serious implications for Nyx. "Then they run afoul of 501(c)(7) [regulations for nonprofit social clubs] and they could lose their nonprofit status," Lynch says. "Moreover, if it is personal, technically that's income or compensation to the individual. They should be paying income tax, FICA tax." On April 7, 2016, the Nyx credit card was swiped at Tony Angello's Restaurant. The cost was $631. On November 1, the card has two Tony Angello's charges on the same night: one for $998, the other $114. On a Friday night in 2015, someone charged $97 at a hibachi restaurant in Slidell. We also found a $62 charge at a Japanese restaurant in Slidell the Friday before that. Krewe captain Julie Lea lives in Slidell. We spotted a Walmart charge on the North Shore, as well as $43 at a Rouses in Slidell and $196 at off Broadway shoes, again in Slidell. We found dozens of iTunes payments. In November 2015 alone, there were 12 separate iTunes charges, totaling $172. The Nyx credit card had a nearly $50,000 balance that month. The restaurant charges over the two-year stretch add up: $535 at Pascal Manale, $482 at Grand Isle, $314 at The Columns are a few more examples from a long list. "If the IRS came in here and audited this organization, they would be looking for supporting documentation for those restaurant charges," Lynch says, "the who, what, when, where, why." Mardi Gras is big business. The Krewe of Nyx has 2,951 riders. One member tells us dues cost $650. That alone brings in nearly $1.91 million every year. Julie Lea founded Nyx in 2011. The all-female krewe rolls on the Wednesday before Mardi Gras, an elaborate hand-decorated purse its prized throw. Many of the card charges do seem to relate to Mardi Gras. But Lynch says so many expenses raise a red flag with him - such as charges at Snap Fitness, Winn Dixie in Slidell and the New Orleans Yacht Club. Lynch says he's been part of Mardi Gras organizations for 30 years. If such spending were found at one of his groups, he says, "I would call the captain on the carpet. And then, if I couldn't get redress there, I'd resign." We've asked Nyx to specifically address whether all of the credit card charges were related to the nonprofit, and also to explain the Gulf Shores charges.  They told us they wouldn't respond until Monday. The attorney representing Nyx did write, "My client is extremely troubled by the fact that there has been an unauthorized and wrongful dissemination of the Krewe's credit card number and billing statements.  This account information was never authorized to be given out to anyone other than the Directors and Officers of the Krewe, and amounts to a breach of its financial security." And regarding that $7,000 charge on the Alabama Gulf Coast, the attorney writes, "The $7,000 charge was for the board of directors annual meeting in Gulf Shores. This meeting is held every year by the board." Copyright 2017 WVUE. All rights reserved.

(LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Fortunately, the local fire department has had plenty of practice rescuing cats from trees and was able to get everyone down safely.

Denmark is producing 43% of its energy from renewables, and it aims for 70% by 2020. Germany, at more than 25% now and 30% soon, is going for 40% to 45% clean power by 2025, 55% to 60% by 2035, and an incredible 80% by 2050. China, despite many challenges, is the world’s leading source of renewable investment, as well as the largest solar manufacturer. The United States, with about 13% renewable energy generation, has some catching up to do, though California (where some developers are incorporating solar into every house they build) points the way forward. The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that the solar market in the U.S. grew by 41% in 2013, and that it made up 20% of all new generating capacity in that year. Both solar and wind are making strides. A global Bloomberg survey predicted that solar will grow more than 20% internationally in 2014 (as it did between 2012 and 2013). And the Global Wind Energy Council projects that 2014 will be a very good year internationally for wind as well, with dramatic increases over 2013 and at least 47 gigawatts of wind installed around the world. Room for Growth But all this positive movement could obscure the fact that renewable energy is still a very small part of the mix both in the U.S. and globally. The big percentage increases start from a small base (even with its rapid growth, solar is still less than 1% of generation in the U.S., and the official consensus is that the world will run on fossil fuel energy for the foreseeable future). The International Energy Agency’s “World Energy Outlook 2013” reports, “Today’s share of fossil fuels in the global mix, at 82%, is the same as it was 25 years ago; the strong rise of renewables only reduces this to around 75% in 2035.” Renewable electricity generation from technologies that are commercially available today, in combination with a more flexible electric system, is more than adequate to supply 80% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2050. –National Renewable Energy Lab Business as usual is also predicted for the U.S. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) does envision a gradual emissions reduction through energy-efficiency and the use of renewables. The agency said, “Improved efficiency of energy use in the residential and transportation sectors and a shift away from more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal for electricity generation help to stabilize U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.” But the agency’s projections of electricity generation by fuel to 2040 still show overwhelming dominance by natural gas, nuclear energy and coal. At the most, renewable energy could achieve parity with nuclear power, but remain well below the agency’s projections for natural gas and coal. Today’s low oil prices are another challenge to the rise of renewables. What’s Theoretically Possible According to Sarbjit Nahal, head of thematic investing in the global strategy division of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Beijia Ma, a principal in the group, significant changes are needed to advance renewable sources of energy. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a late 2014 report, “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts.” Because of a 40% increase in demand in energy by 2035, they say, we’re “on a carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions trajectory consistent with global temperature increases of two to 4.5 degrees Centigrade, making irreversible climate change a reality.” They’re hardly alone in this assessment. “A new world energy economy is emerging,” said Lester Brown, president of Earth Policy Institute. “Our civilization needs to embrace renewable energy on a scale and at a pace we’ve never seen before.” And it’s at least theoretically possible. A study by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) concluded, “Renewable electricity generation from technologies that are commercially available today, in combination with a more flexible electric system, is more than adequate to supply 80% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2050 while meeting electricity demand on an hourly basis in every region of the country.” Under a rapid expansion program, the world could have nearly five million megawatts of wind power by 2020, Brown said. He added, “Combined with an ambitious solar and geothermal expansion, along with new hydro projects in the pipeline, this would total 7.5 million megawatts of renewable generating capacity, enabling us to back out all the coal and oil and most of the natural gas now used to generate electricity.” Mark Jacobson, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford, and Mark Delucchi, a research scientist at the University of California, Davis’s Institute of Transportation Studies, have devised an ambitious scenario for a renewable energy takeover. “Our plan calls for millions of wind turbines, water machines and solar installations,” they wrote in Scientific American. “The numbers are large, but the scale is not an insurmountable hurdle; society has achieved massive transformations before.” Specifically, their global plan imagines 3.8 million large wind turbines, 90,000 utility-scale solar plants, 490,000 tidal turbines, 5,350 geothermal installations and 900 hydroelectric plants. They estimate that the cost of generating power with this network would be less per kilowatt-hour than generating it with fossil fuels or nuclear power. Other plans concur. “It is technically possible to achieve almost 100% renewable energy sources within the next four decades,” concludes the World Wildlife Federation’s (WWF) 2011 Energy Report, which sees wind, solar, biomass and hydropower as the future major players. “Energy derived from the sun, the wind, the earth’s heat, water and the sea has the potential to meet the world’s electricity needs many times over, even allowing for fluctuations in supply and demand.” The WWF report estimates that a million onshore and 100,000 offshore wind turbines could meet a quarter of the world’s energy demand by 2050. Moving Past Coal Sponsored Content: Experts believe that to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, a goal of the Copenhagen Accord, the world’s energy emissions have to peak by 2020 and then quickly decline, reaching near-zero by approximately 2050. One of the often-cited obstacles to achieving this goal is the world’s reliance on coal for both power and jobs. According to Charles Mann in The Atlantic, coal causes 25% more emissions than oil globally, but cleaning up the sector may not be as difficult as it first appears. Forty percent of the world’s climate emissions come from just 7,000 coal plants. And coal attrition is already happening. The Energy Information Administration reports that the combination of lower-cost natural gas and strong EPA standards for power plants is taking a toll. Not a single coal plant was opened in the U.S. in the first half of the year, and coal was only 39% of U.S. electricity generation in 2013, compared to more than 50% in 2004. The EIA reports that a big flurry of coal closings is expected by 2016. Uncertainty resulting from intermittent renewables can be reduced by ramping up grid interconnections, enabling load sharing. –Abyd Karmali The ongoing decline in coal has already lowered employment in the U.S. industry, lessening fears that a low-carbon future will kill jobs. So too has increased efficiency. Due in part to widespread mountaintop removal mining, which employs far fewer workers than underground mining, U.S. coalfield employment has slipped from more than 280,000 jobs in 1978 to less than 100,000 today—even as coal production increased in the same period to nearly a billion tons. The global picture is complex. Although coal production internationally is still increasing robustly, and the International Energy Agency sees demand growth of 2.1% annually through 2019, employment — at seven million jobs worldwide — has seen some losses. According to the Worldwatch Institute’s Vital Signs, “Many hundreds of thousands of coal mining jobs have been shed in China, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa during the last couple of decades, sometimes in the face of escalating production.” Renewable power is already helping to compensate for coal industry job loss, with the Solar Foundation reporting 142,698 jobs in that industry in 2013, up nearly 20% from 2012. Global wind power could employ 2.1 million in 2030, at which time solar photovoltaics could have created another 6.3 million jobs. Worldwide renewable energy employs 2.3 million people, either directly or in feeder industries, in part, says NREL’s “Dollars and Sense” report, because the technology is labor-intensive (more jobs per dollar invested than conventional electric power). Overall, the Center for American Progress (CAP) estimates that making a 40% cut in greenhouse gas from 2005 levels by 2035 would create 4.2 million overall jobs, with 2.7 million net when “estimated contractions in fossil fuel sectors” are factored in. CAP said the overall effect would be a 1.5% reduction in the unemployment rate. Despite reductions in coal use and projected increases in clean-energy employment, China’s reliance on coal remains a formidable obstacle. Coal produces 70% of China’s energy, and almost four billion tons were burned there in 2012 — a major reason that China has become the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. From 2005 to 2011, China (with vast natural coal reserves) added the equivalent of two 600-megawatt plants every week, and from 2010 through 2013, it added coal plants roughly equal to half of all U.S. generation. (At the same time, China is committed to renewable energy — with hydropower included, it’s already at 20%, compared to 13% in the U.S. But demand is rising and so is production: China is planning to double its power-generating capacity by 2030.) Technology and regulatory hurdles persist The intermittency of wind and solar power remains a major hurdle, one that’s addressed by Jacobson and Delucchi. To tackle intermittency in renewable energy resources, Jacobson proposes interconnecting geographically dispersed wind, solar and water resources (through a smart grid), and where possible using hydro power to fill in supply gaps. He also advocates demand-response management, over-sizing peak generation (and producing hydrogen with the excess), and storing electric power on site (in batteries) or in grid-connected electric cars. Abyd Karmali, managing director, climate finance, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, agreed that uncertainty resulting from intermittent renewables can be reduced by ramping up grid interconnections, enabling load sharing. “Also having the right mix is key, such as using hydroelectric for baseline power where possible,” he said.  “And, of course, it’s also a misconception to say that only renewable energy suffers from volatility — fossil fuel plants get knocked out for various reasons, and that’s not predicted in advance.” Daniel Esty, director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, believes that better battery storage — a holy grail for scientists worldwide — is the key to solving the intermittency problem. According to Arthur van Benthem, assistant professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, current regulatory policy presents another critical obstacle to a low-carbon future. “Incentives for demand response such as real-time pricing for end users are often lacking, but would be instrumental to shift consumption from peak to off-peak hours.” In addition, says van Benthem, “The renewable industry will be at a persistent disadvantage as long as we don’t remove the elephant in the room: the fossil fuel electricity sector should pay the full social cost of their operations. In plain English, we need a carbon tax.” A Ground-level View Some countries are already working toward phasing out fossil fuels, with Germany being the most prominent example. The country, which gets 15% of its energy from nuclear power now, wants to phase it out by 2021 — with help from legislation such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act, which provides feed-in tariffs and other financial support. And its goal is to supply 80% of its electricity from renewables by 2050. In the first quarter of 2014, clean sources produced 27% of Germany’s electricity, with 40.2 billion kilowatt-hours of generation. Nearly half of all new electricity generation in Europe is wind or solar, said George Washington University’s GW Solar Institute. But among the challenges to Germany’s success are power-price surcharges that have raised utility bills for some (and led to unrest among German manufacturers), and at least short-term increases in coal use and imports of renewables are ramped up. “The easiest way to reduce our large-scale carbon footprint is to become a lot more efficient, and there is still a lot of low-hanging fruit that businesses are beginning to recognize.” –Eric Orts Germany’s renewable portfolio is about double the 13% in the U.S., and Europe’s commitment to a 40% carbon cut by 2030 will ratchet up its efforts substantially. Still, some states get a large percentage of their energy from renewables, often because of large hydro-electric resources. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects that electricity generation from renewable sources will increase to 16% in 2040. Renewable portfolio standards (which set percentage goals for renewable energy) are operating in 30 states (plus the District of Columbia), and form a significant incentive if they’re heeded. Corporations are also in the lead. Renewable energy is already providing power for 94% of Apple’s corporate operations. Walmart launched on-site solar for its American operations in 2005, and made its first major wind power agreement in Mexico the next year. By 2013, Walmart had 335 renewable energy projects worldwide, producing 2.2 billion kilowatt-hours annually and meeting nearly a quarter of the company’s energy needs. Walmart’s goal is to reach seven billion kilowatt-hours and be close to 100% renewable by the end of 2020. Smaller companies, too, are making important strides. Steve Melink of Milford, Ohio, founded Melink Corporation, originally a HVAC testing firm, in 1987. In 2004, he attended a green building conference and had a “moment of inspiration. It opened my eyes that we were not on a sustainable path.” Today, Melink has deployed more than 100 strategies to get to its current net-zero energy status. In fact, the company’s embrace of sustainability led it to create a lucrative new business in solar leasing, including installation of two three-megawatt systems in Indianapolis and the $12 million 1.56-megawatt solar canopy system it recently built over the parking lot at the Cincinnati Zoo. According to Sophia Cifuentes, the zoo’s sustainability coordinator, having the solar system has resulted in 50 days a year that are effectively off the grid.  The Challenge of Getting There Transportation is actually the fastest growing source of CO2 globally, and as such can offset the gains from installed renewable energy. The world car population topped one billion in 2011, and the International Transport Forum thinks it could reach 2.5 billion by 2050. Clearly, that’s not a sustainable number. Daniel Sperling, founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, believes that the 87 million barrels of oil produced globally each day could climb to 120 million barrels under that scenario. The transition to electric vehicles has the potential to blunt the oil consumption and climate impacts of the world’s cars, but there’s a long way to go. In the U.S. in 2014, 119,710 plug-in vehicles were sold out of 16.5 million total, and the numbers are smaller around the world. Electric cars are currently expensive, but with battery prices dropping, their momentum is likely to increase. Lower-cost (and longer range) cars, which cost much less to operate than conventional cars, will be attractive to buyers globally. Lowering emissions becomes a virtuous circle when the power running zero-emission electric cars comes from plants fueled by renewable energy. Making cars more energy-efficient, as in the U.S. goal of 54.5 mpg fleet averages by 2025, is important, as is moving away from cars altogether. Mass transit is key, but other innovative urban policy is also pointing the way forward: The U.S. remains highly auto-centric, but cities such as Helsinki and Hamburg in Europe have ambitious, technology-aided, plans to go car-free or as close to it as possible. In place of private cars will be telephone-dispatched bus services, ride sharing, municipal bicycles and multiple rail options. Virtually all the experts agree that the transition to a clean energy economy will be difficult. Carl Pope, the former executive director of the Sierra Club, points out that if clean energy investments result in a 5% reduction in global fossil fuel demand, the law of supply and demand would result in a sharp 25% to 30% drop in fossil fuel prices, increasing non-renewables’ appeal to consumers. Robert Giegengack, professor emeritus of earth and environmental science in the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees the transition won’t be easy, “but it is inevitable.” Moving to renewables could take as long as 100 years, Esty said. Eric Orts, the director of Wharton’s Initiative for Global Environmental Leadership (IGEL) and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, also sees a fairly hard road ahead, but it’s an achievable goal. “I don’t think it’s an easy transition at all,” he said. “But I do think it’s possible, and we definitely need to move in that direction.” Orts adds, “Even with wind and solar, it’s not simply zero emission — there are manufacturing costs, mining and maintenance issues. It should be said that the movement toward renewables has to be coupled with energy-efficiency efforts. The easiest way to reduce our large-scale carbon footprint is to become a lot more efficient, and there is still a lot of low-hanging fruit that businesses are beginning to recognize.” Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "Can the World Run on Renewable Energy?."

In fact, this is our only sustainable solution as fossil fuels are finite. We can look forward to a rapid transition to renewables because both wind and solar power have surpassed grid parity. Nick Tedesco http://solar-power-now.com James Henson One disadvantage with renewable energy is that it is difficult to generate the quantities of electricity that are as large as those produced by traditional fossil fuel generators. This may mean that we need to reduce the amount of energy we use or simply build more energy facilities. It also indicates that the best solution to our energy problems may be to have a balance of many different power sources. ________________ http://www.everythingauto.com.au/company/Rent-2-own-Cars-Australia Anumakonda Jagadeesh Interesting article. Renewables at best can supplement conventional energy like coal,petroleum,gas etc. especially in high energy intensive countries like US,Germany,Japan etc. The limitations of Renewables like Wind and Solar is their intermittent nature which requires storage. Storage of power is expensive. Though Solar PV cost is coming down ,its efficiency is still around 15% at field level. Dust is a big problem in developing countries for wider application of Solar PV. CSP may be a good alternative. I have had been advocating Bioenergy as the best option for Developing countries in view of vast waste land and huge man power. There is the case of Ethanol in Brazil. In the debate between Food Vs Fuel and subsidies for Ethanol production in US(Sugarcane),I am advocating Bioenergy from Care-free Growth,regenerative CAM plants like Agave and Opuntia. These can be input for Biofuel/biogaspower/biocahar in Developing countries in Africa,Latin America and Asia. What is more being CAM plants their massive plantation will act as ‘Carbon Sink’. Moreover these plants have multiple uses. Mexico is pioneer in this. The endeavor to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport is motivated by global warming, pollution and other environmental issues, as well as economic and energy security concerns. Shifting the total global primary energy supply to renewable sources requires a transition of the energy system. In 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. In 2014, renewable sources such as wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and burnt waste provided 19% of the total energy consumed worldwide, with roughly half of that coming from traditional use of biomass. The most important sector is electricity with a renewable share of 22.8%, most of it coming from hydropower with a share of 16.6%, followed by wind with 3.1%. There are many places around the world with grids that are run almost exclusively on renewable energy. At the national level, at least 30 nations already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of the energy supply. Professors S. Pacala and Robert H. Socolow of Princeton University have developed a series of “Climate stabilization wedges” that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and “renewable energy sources,” in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their “wedges.” Mark Z. Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy program, says that producing all new energy with wind power, solar power, and hydropower by 2030 is feasible, and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be “primarily social and political, not technological or economic”. Jacobson says that energy costs today with a wind, solar, and water system should be similar to today’s energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies. The main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will. Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that “sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand.” The main barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low-carbon energy strategies are political rather than technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated. Wind turbines generate 39 percent of Danish electricity, and Denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well. Together, wind and biomass provide 44% of the electricity consumed by the country’s six million inhabitants. In 2010, Portugal’s 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources. Spain’s 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewable(Wikipedia).. The first country to propose 100% renewable energy was Iceland, in 1998. Proposals have been made for Japan in 2003, and for Australia in 2011. Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal). Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower). Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet. Australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity. The road map for the United States, commitment by Denmark, and Vision 2050 for Europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100% renewable energy, later reduced to 2040 in 2011. Zero Carbon Britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in Britain by 2030 by transitioning to renewable energy. In 2015, Hawaii enacted a law that the Renewable Portfolio Standard shall be 100 percent by 2045. This is often confused with renewable energy. If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop off grid solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh. Then the RPS is 115 percent. The Fourth Revolution: Energy is a German documentary film released in 2010. It shows the vision of a global society, which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100% with renewable energies, showing a complete reconstruction of the economy, to reach this goal. In 2011, Hermann Scheer wrote the book The Energy Imperative: 100 Percent Renewable Now, published by Routledge. Reinventing Fire is a book by Amory Lovins released in October 2011. By combining reduced energy use with energy efficiency gains, Lovins says that there will be a $5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy. This can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies, through market forces, led by business. Bill Clinton says the book is a “wise, detailed and comprehensive blueprint”. The first paragraph of the preface says: Imagine fuel without fear. No climate change. No oil spills, dead coal miners, dirty air, devastated lands, lost wildlife. No energy poverty. No oil-fed wars, tyrannies, or terrorists. Nothing to run out. Nothing to cut off. Nothing to worry about. Just energy abundance, benign and affordable, for all, for ever. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.[ In 2011, the International Energy Agency has said that solar energy technologies, in its many forms, can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces: The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared. In 2011, the refereed journal Energy Policy published two articles by Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of engineering at Stanford University, and research scientist Mark A. Delucchi, about changing our energy supply mix and “Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power”. The articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power, transportation, and heating/cooling from wind, water, and sunlight (WWS), which are safe clean options. In Part I, Jacobson and Delucchi discuss WWS energy system characteristics, aspects of energy demand, WWS resource availability, WWS devices needed, and material requirements. They estimate that 3,800,000 5 MW wind turbines, 5350 100 MW geothermal power plants, and 270 new 1300 MW hydroelectric power plants will be required. In terms of solar power, an additional 49,000 300 MW concentrating solar plants, 40,000 300 MW solar photovoltaic power plants, and 1.7 billion 3 kW rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed. Such an extensive WWS infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30%.[42] In Part II, Jacobson and Delucchi address variability of supply, system economics, and energy policy initiatives associated with a WWS system. The authors advocate producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be “primarily social and political, not technological or economic”. Energy costs with a WWS system should be similar to today’s energy costs. In general, Jacobson has said wind, water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world’s energy, eliminating all fossil fuels. He advocates a “smart mix” of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand: More recently, Jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100% renewable energy produced by wind, water and sunlight, for New York, California and Washington states, by 2050. As of 2014, a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up, which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states. The 50-state plan is part of The Solutions Project, an independent outreach effort led by Jacobson, actor Mark Ruffalo, and film director Josh Fox. As of 2014, many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing, can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, hydro, ocean and geothermal energy. Debate over detailed plans remain, but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable, economically feasible, socially viable, and so realisable. This prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by Germany, one of the world’s most successful industrial economies, to undertake a major energy transition, Energiewende. In 2015 a study was published in Energy and Environmental Science that describes a pathway to 100% renewable energy in the United States by 2050 without using biomass. Implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable, as by 2050 it would save about $600 Billion Dollars health costs a year due to reduced air pollution and $3.3 Trillion global warming costs. This would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around $8300 compared to a business as usual pathway. According to that study, barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political, as most people didn’t know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs.

Live Watch A look at high-profile police-related deaths of US blacks By the associated press CINCINNATI  Jun 10, 2017, 10:56 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayThe Associated Press WATCH Protests after Officer Betty Shelby was found not guilty of manslaughter 0 Shares Email Police officers are on trial in Ohio and Minnesota for fatal shootings of black motorists during traffic stops. In both cases, prosecutors say the officers didn't need to respond with deadly force. The officers both have testified they felt threatened. In Cincinnati, former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing for a second time faces charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in the July 2015 shooting of Sam DuBose, 43. Tensing has said he thought DuBose was trying to kill him with his car. A jury deadlocked last November. In Minnesota, St. Anthony Officer Jeronimo Yanez is charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting last July of Philando Castile. He testified Friday he saw Castile's hand on a gun a before he fired. Castile had a permit and had told the officer he had a gun. The cases are among those across the United States in the last three years that have increased debate about race and policing. Here are some other high-profile deaths of blacks during police encounters: ——— JORDAN EDWARDS The U.S. Justice Department said in May that it's investigating the fatal shooting of the 15-year-old by a white police officer in a Dallas suburb. Edwards was shot April 29 by Balch Springs police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. Balch Springs police had originally said the vehicle was reversing "in an aggressive manner" toward officers, who had responded to a complaint about underage drinking. But Police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver is free on bond. ——— TERENCE CRUTCHER An Oklahoma jury on May 17 found Officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16, 2016, death of Terence Crutcher, 40, shot shortly after Shelby arrived on a street to find Crutcher's SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Shelby testified that she was afraid because Crutcher didn't obey her commands and appeared to reach inside his SUV. Prosecutors told jurors that Shelby overreacted, noting that videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter showed Crutcher had his hands in the air and did not have a weapon. ——— ALTON STERLING Federal prosecutors announced May 3 that they would not seek charges against two white police officers who were involved in a deadly encounter with Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last summer. Sterling, 37, was shot to death on July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking demonstrations across Baton Rouge. U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson said Sterling was armed during the confrontation and the investigation didn't find enough evidence to pursue charges. State authorities are investigating to decide whether to bring charges. ——— KEITH LAMONT SCOTT A prosecutor cleared a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer in the September 2016 fatal shooting of Scott, 43, killed while sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex as officers sought another man. A police review board decided that Officer Brentley Vinson followed proper procedure. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times Scott's family said he did not have a gun. Charlotte-Mecklenburg District Attorney Andrew Murray cited evidence that Scott was armed, including a store's surveillance video, DNA recovered from a handgun and a Facebook conversation from the man who said he sold the stolen gun to Scott. ——— JAMAR CLARK Clark's November 2015 shooting death sparked weeks of protests in Minneapolis. The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest the 24-year-old when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. Some witnesses said Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, but federal and state probes concluded that he was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark's hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Prosecutors decided not to charge either white officer, and an internal police investigation cleared them. ——— RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ball, 26. Boykin, awaiting trial, said he fired because Ball appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin, saying the officer violated policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fianc?e to ride with him and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. Ball's family has sued Boykin, the city and other police officials for wrongful death. ——— JEREMY MCDOLE McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander's cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general's office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed "extraordinarily poor" police work. In January, a federal judge approved the city's $1.5 million settlement with McDole's family. ——— WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced last October to 2? years in prison for fatally shooting Chapman while responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart on April 22, 2015. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed the unarmed 18-year-old "willfully, deliberately and with premeditation." Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin's stun gun. Rankin, who is white, was fired. ——— WALTER SCOTT Prosecutors are recommending decades in prison for white South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, who shot Scott in the back as the motorist fled following a traffic stop. Slager pleaded guilty on May 2 to a federal charge of violating Scott's civil rights. A judge will determine his sentence, which could range from probation to life in prison without parole. Scott's shooting in April 2015 was captured on cellphone video and seen worldwide. ——— FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man was shackled but alive when he was put in a Baltimore police van in April 2015. He came out with severe neck injuries, and his subsequent death led to rioting. Six officers were charged initially, but prosecutors in July 2016 dropped all remaining charges after acquittals and a hung jury. Gray's family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. —— ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff's deputy Robert Bates, 74, was sentenced in 2016 to four years in prison for second-degree manslaughter in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, who was unarmed and restrained. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight, and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. ——— TAMIR RICE The 12-year-old was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers' cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled Rice's family's lawsuit for $6 million. Cleveland in May fired Loehmann and suspended Garmack for 10 days. The officers' union said it will challenge the discipline, calling it politically motivated. ——— AKAI GURLEY Rookie New York City police officer Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter last year in the November 2014 death of 28-year-old Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn when a sound startled him and he fired accidentally. A bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. A judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years' probation and 800 hours of community service. The city settled with Gurley's family for $4.1 million. ——— MICHAEL BROWN The unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department opted against civil rights charges. Wilson later resigned. The death of Brown led to months of occasionally violent protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. ——— LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in November 2015, on the same day that the city, under a judge's orders, released dashcam video showing McDonald, a 17-year-old man, being shot 16 times on Oct. 20, 2014. Van Dyke, who is white, has pleaded not guilty. The video prompted local and federal investigations. The Justice Department determined in January that Chicago police have a long history of civil rights violations and excessive force. The Chicago Police Department has since released a new use-of-force policy that requires officers undergo de-escalation training and imposes stricter rules on when they can fire their weapons at fleeing suspects. ——— ERIC GARNER The 43-year-old man died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict that officer, or any others involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. ——— REKIA BOYD Chicago police officer Dante Servin resigned in May 2016 after the police superintendent said he should be fired for killing Boyd four years earlier. Servin was off-duty when he shot the 22-year-old unarmed woman. She had been walking down a street with her friends when he told them to be quiet, and he fired when he thought he saw a gun. Prosecutors charged Servin with involuntary manslaughter, a judge acquitted him in April 2016, saying he'd been improperly charged. The city settled a wrongful-death lawsuit in 2013 with Boyd's family for $4.5 million. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " A look at high-profile police-related deaths of US blacks " Puerto Rico upholds statehood demand in contentious vote " Melania and Barron Trump move to the White House " Penguins beat Preds 2-0 for Stanley Cup " Key developments in Minnesota officer's manslaughter trial " US military carries out first offensive airstrike in Somalia under Trump's new authorities " Armed protesters fear removal of Texas hero's statue " Plane lands safely in Sydney with hole in engine casing " Pope to Nigerian priests: You'll be fired if you don't obey " 11-year-old New York Yankee fan born without arms and legs to throw 1st pitch Sunday " Formerly homeless teen is accepted to Stanford University " Couple gets photo shoot arranged by granddaughter who is 'obsessed' with their love story " Disabled boy beats odds to become swimming champion " Dying dog gets 'married' on bucket list adventure " Woman donates wedding dresses to flooded bridal store " Utah boy captured on camera stopping bike to say Pledge of Allegiance " Painting found in Arizona garage may be a Jackson Pollock worth $15M " Police: Detectives still unsure if attacker had accomplices, release all suspects " Ex-NBA player Sebastian Telfair arrested on gun charges " Thousands protest in Morocco against corruption " Gadhafi's son released after more than 5 years of detention " Soccer coach Guardiola leads Catalan independence rally " Some hope California winner of $447M Powerball helps area " Polish police charge Solidarity activist, other protesters " AP Exclusive: Moonlighting police leave body cameras behind " Donald Trump Jr. appears to contradict father's account of private Comey meeting " Time to 'move on' from probe of Russia collusion, Trump obstruction: GOP senator " Trump lawyer 'not going to speculate' on whether president might fire special counsel " UK prime minister appoints Cabinet after election drubbing " Tottering Theresa May names new UK Cabinet as critics circle " 'Wonder Woman' buries 'The Mummy' at box office " Millions of children labor in India, some in sweltering heat " Macron's takeover of French politics is all but complete " Amanda Bynes reveals she's sober, ready to return to acting " Katy Perry reveals past suicidal thoughts, addresses Taylor Swift feud " Hollywood pays homage to 'Batman' icon Adam West

For that reason, the Destiny 2 Beta is very important. Bungie and Activision will use the early access to test the different systems that power the title. Destiny 2 is an online role-playing game. These titles rely on multiplayer services, servers and account systems all working together for players. When these systems fail, they break game launches. Gamers can expect the Destiny 2 Beta to arrive sometime this summer. Destiny 2 launches on September 8th and Bungie will want time to fix any issues before then. Console and PC owners that place a pre-order get access to the beta before anyone else. Read: Destiny 2 Release Date, Features & Details Bungie has revealed when we’ll learn more about the Destiny 2 Beta. We also know how gamers without a pre-order can still play. Destiny 2 Beta Start Date The start date of the Destiny 2 Beta remains unknown. That’s despite Activision and Bungie revealing the game and opening pre-orders. It could be anytime between now and the game’s September 8th release. Some reports assume Bungie will use its annual July 7th “Bungie Day” celebrations to start early access to the beta. The timetable for the first game’s launch does hint that this might be the plan. Destiny’s Beta started on July 17th, 2014. The game launched on September 9th. Publisher Activision will share the Destiny 2 Beta release date at this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo, a recent press release confirms. That press release doesn’t reveal the date and time Activision will share new details, just that it will happen during the event. E3 2017 events start on June 10th. How Long is the Destiny 2 Beta? We don’t how long the Destiny 2 Beta will last. Bungie and Activision will announce that when they reveal the start date, it seems. Gamers could enjoy the first title’s beta for a total of ten days. PlayStation users had access to the test before Xbox One owners. The game never came to the PC. How to Join the Destiny 2 Beta Bungie will open the Destiny 2 Beta up to anyone that wants to try the game on Xbox One, PS4 and PC. The company describes this as the game’s Open Beta. Gamers that place a pre-order at a participating retailer get access to the content in the Open Beta first. Amazon, GameStop, Target, Toys R Us and Wal-Mart provide their shoppers with codes printed on their receipt. Gamers enter that code on the Destiny 2 Beta website to unlock the test. Pre-ordering Destiny 2 through Xbox or PlayStation gets gamers early access without a code. Read: Destiny 2 Pre-Orders: Which Edition Should You Buy? What’s in the Destiny 2 Beta We know very little about the content in the Destiny 2 Beta. Bungie will want to keep the story and cut scenes for the final release. Because it’s a multiplayer beta, gamers can expect to get at least one map in the Crucible multiplayer mode. The testing could include the game’s character creators too. Players like to see how much they can alter their character’s look in role-playing games. Expect limits on the game’s mechanics. Bungie could keep players from ever reaching the game’s higher character levels. Testers are unlikely to get access to the game’s full line-up of gear and weapons either. Historically, progress and characters in online role-playing game betas don’t carry over to the final game. What to Expect from the Destiny 2 Beta Activision and Bungie will discuss Destiny 2 at this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo. Besides more beta details, video of a new Arcstrider Hunter player sub-class will arrive during the show. These reveals could come during Sony’s E3 2017 Press Conference on Monday, June 12th at 9 PM EST. Sony and Activision have a promotional agreement for Destiny 2.  5 New Destiny 2 Features Worth Upgrading For Destiny 2 Cinematic Story   1 / 5 The most exciting of Destiny 2’s features are what Bungie is calling its “cinematic campaign.” That’s because the original Destiny arrived with an unorthodox single-player. The story wasn’t cohesive and didn’t dive into the game’s lore much. There were times when the story that was there seemed out-of-place. Destiny 2 promises a real narrative. Nathan Fillion and Lance Reddick star in the game’s story. During the middle of a calm meeting, it slowly dawns on the command staff at Earth’s last remaining city that something is about to go wrong. Soon they’re bombarded by a huge garrison of battleships. The Red Legion wants the power of the Traveler Orb floating above the city for itself. Gamers can expect lots of cutscenes between tasks in the game’s campaign. The scenes Bungie has shown off so far feel more like a movie than a video game. They are better at conveying what’s going on than Destiny’s story.   1 / 5 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Editorials Fallout 4 VR Release: 5 Things to Know Bethesda won’t release any more Fallout 4 DLC but it still has some big plans for th… 06/11/2017 9 min read Xbox One X Games Details: Enhanced Games & Updates The new Xbox One X video game console will have tons of games when it launches this Novemb… 06/11/2017 6 min read Xbox One X Release Date, Price & Features Xbox will get visuals as good or better than PlayStation when the Xbox One X arrives later… 06/11/2017 12 min read Load More In Editorials Click To Comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Discover What the World Thinks of U.S. Home Our Team Volunteers Wanted Foreign News Sources Archives About About Us In the Media Donate Climate Accord: Donald Trump Relaunches ‘America First’ To Distract from Russiagate The chaos and suspense created around the Paris accord takes on a whole new meaning—a diversionary tactic to distract attention from infinitely more embarrassing matters. back-channel communication Donald Trump Italy James Comey Jared Kushner Michael Cohen Michael Flynn Mike Pence Paris Climate Accord Russiagate Senate Intelligence Committee Published in Il Fatto Quotidiano (Italy) on 2 June 2017 by Roberto Festa [link to original] Translated from Italian by Laurence Bouvard. Edited by Pam Willey. Posted on June 10, 2017. The president’s strategy: Distract American attention away from the inquiry into the relationship between the administration’s advisers and Russia. The investigation continues to expand: The intelligence committee has asked seven people to appear, among them Michael Flynn and Michael Cohen, the president’s personal attorney. Next week, former FBI Director James Comey could say whether the tycoon intervened to block the investigation. The unexpected: If there is one thing that everyone, friends and enemies included, are ready to concede about Donald Trump, it’s his ability to choose unexpected, unforeseen paths, creating a climate of surprise and suspense around his decisions. That’s how it was during his electoral campaign, when Trump went against his advisors’ advice to tone down and moderate. However, it has been the same during these first few months of his presidency. Trump has often preferred to follow his own instincts, choosing to act outrageously — firing FBI Director James Comey — or throwing himself into unseemly clashes, with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, for example. With the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, this unpredictability has reached hitherto unseen heights. Trump prepared the way for leaving the agreement with a stream of tweets, which announced his upcoming decision. A series of White House employees released a number of contradictory messages — “We are withdrawing from the accord;” “It has not yet been decided” — which served to muddy the waters. At the last minute, the White House has been transformed into some sort of battlefield, with the president listening to opposing opinions before making a decision, almost like a Renaissance prince. Stephen Bannon and Scott Pruitt, along with the Rust Belt Republicans, were for withdrawing. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s daughter Ivanka and most of the U.S. business world were for remaining. This time there was something different from before, however. The unpredictability was not the result of an instinctive temperament, incapable of adapting to the measured step of Washington politics but able to “sense” the passions and needs of his electorate without having to look at facts and figures. This time, the “rational side,” that of “constructing” the occasion, had the upper hand. Trump may have wanted to give the impression of making a decision after having swung from one side to the other, after having come into conflict with old and new allies (see Angela Merkel.) In reality, the script for abandoning the Paris accord was referred to minimally: tweets, news leaks, advisors who advised and a world that waits. Never in the history of his presidency has suspense been created in such a calculated and effective way. What was the script for? Most likely, to portray an image of leadership to the sectors his electorate is most fond of. Denouncing Barack Obama’s environmental policies was one of Trump’s strongest themes in his electoral campaign. On more than one occasion, his economic nationalism and his diplomatic isolationism were expressed by means of promising to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Whether in front of miners in West Virginia or Kentucky, or Pennsylvania’s factory-less workers, Trump imbued the theme “America First” with an undoubtedly aggressive tone in the face of the previous administration’s environmental strategies, accusing that administration of losing American jobs to other economies. Trump therefore needed to act, to show he was keeping his promise, especially at a time when he has failed to keep other promises, such as moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and when his ability to act in the legislative arena seems seriously compromised — not a single major reform has succeeded in passing Congress. The generally rhetorical, demonstrative and theatrical character of his announcement on the Paris agreements is highlighted by a series of other facts. In all probability, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Google and Walmart — not to mention major cities such as New York and Los Angeles — will continue their transition to renewable energies. Going back to coal will be nothing but a weak, ineffective method of creating new employment. Today, there are around 50,000 jobs in the coal sector, against 400,000 jobs between the wind and solar energy sectors; no one truly believes that America’s economy of the future will be in mining. Despite this, Trump needed to speak to his electorate and show he was in charge of the situation. However, there is something else here. The carefully stage-managed announcement, the urgently sought media spotlight, shows that right now, Trump desperately needs attention focused on a series of particular topics—the environment, employment, the United States’ relations with the rest of the world—and for that same attention to overlook other questions. It is not difficult to figure out what those other questions are; they have to do with Russia and the current inquiries into the president’s men. If current anticipations are confirmed, next week could, in fact, prove very tough for Trump. On May 31, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued seven subpoenas, summons to appear, related to the Russiagate inquiry. Among those summoned are ex-national security advisor Michael Flynn and Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Should they refuse to testify or to hand over the requested documents, they could be accused of being in contempt of Congress. The situation is not great for either of them. Cohen had refused to cooperate without a subpoena — which was then promptly issued. Flynn’s situation is much more worrying; he was forced to resign after being caught lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his ties to Russia. Flynn is also in negotiations with the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding the handing over of documents concerning his relations, past and present, with the Kremlin and private Russian subjects. The handover should occur precisely next week. The general had at first refused to hand over the documents and invoked Fifth Amendment protections involving self-incrimination. Also going ahead is the FBI inquiry into the “back-channel communications” requested by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, during a meeting in December at Trump Tower with the Russian ambassador (Kushner was then still a private citizen). Even here, the White House denies all charges. But things don’t seem so quiescent for Kushner, who has effectively disappeared off media radar in recent days and who some sources claim is ready to leave Washington and return to New York. Kushner, along with Trump, wanted White House Counsel Don McGahn — the man appointed by the president to advise on legal matters — to issue a public statement denying any suspicion over Kushner’s conduct. McGahn refused to do so, leaving it to Kushner’s personal attorney. The formal justification is that intervening in Kushner’s case would have resulted in requests for other interventions of this type in future. McGahn’s colleagues instead point to the judicial uncertainty in which the selfsame Kushner could become entangled. However, next week the true showstopper could detonate in a Senate chamber. Former FBI Director James Comey, fired by Trump in the middle of the Russiagate inquiries, will come here to testify before the intelligence committee. Senators and Robert Mueller III, the special counsel appointed to investigate the Russia case, are still discussing the legal parameters of the questions and responses with Comey. In all probability, Comey will not talk about the details of the FBI inquiries — the testimony is public and will be shown on TV. What Comey might say, however, is that Trump personally intervened to block the investigation into Flynn. It would be an explosive accusation: A president using his personal power to intervene in another government body to block an investigation which concerns him personally. This is clearly the worst-case scenario for Donald Trump, which could in fact trigger impeachment, something which frightens the president and his advisors most of all. In light of all this, the chaos and suspense created around the Paris accord takes on a whole new meaning—a diversionary tactic to distract the attention of Americans, and the world, from infinitely more embarrassing matters.

Most often the victim is elderly or vulnerable in some way and can ill afford to send money to scam artists. One of the most prevalent phone scams today is people posing as IRS agents. I'm going to tell you how to recognize the scam, but also explain how you can fight back — while having a little fun with the scammers. Usually, you'll receive a phone call with a recorded message instructing you that you've committed tax fraud and need to call right away to resolve the matter. Whether you call the phone number provided in the message or simply hit redial on the number that called you, the "IRS" will answer. At this point, the individual on the other side of the line will identify himself as IRS officer so-and-so; he'll even provide a badge number if asked. The "officer" will then inform you that the police are on their way to arrest you because you have failed to respond to their many notifications. Throwing in big words and official-sounding acronyms, the scammer speaks quickly in order to try and confuse you with a lot of information. Eventually, it will be made clear that you have failed to file past taxes correctly and owe the IRS money. The only way to halt the arrest warrant is to follow the instructions of the "officer." If you offer to pay your outstanding debt by debit or credit card, you will be informed that it's too late. Instead, the "officer" will instruct you to go to the nearest store, like a Walmart or Target, to buy gift cards. You will be instructed to stay on the phone the entire time, otherwise, this final chance to avoid prison will disappear and the police will soon arrive. The reason why the scammers ask for gift cards instead of taking money directly out of people's banks is to avoid financial trails that will get them shut down. I would imagine that this tactic produces less money in the short term, but more in the long term as it enables them to operate the scam for much longer. That's the basic IRS scam. Who is More Gullible? Millennials or Seniors? Know this — and this is important — the IRS doesn't call people. Hopefully, my writing all this down will help people recognize the scam so that they can spread the word of warning to their family and friends. I also share it for another reason: to help you prepare to have some fun while wasting the time of some scumbag scammers in the process. If you own a cell phone, chances are you are going to receive one of these phone calls. I've been eagerly awaiting mine, and today I had the immense pleasure of spending over forty-five minutes on the phone with IRS scammers (the number, in case you want to call, is 720-262-4678; the last I checked, it's still working, but probably not for long). Throughout the conversation, I had a hard time not laughing (and I'm a trained improvisational actor). By the end of the phone call, the scammers demonstrated their understanding of English profanity and suggested that I do many unnatural things to my body. Fun was had by me, and the scammers' time was wasted, meaning that they had less time to try to scam anyone else. https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/06/09/dont-fall-prey-to-this-irs-phone-scam-but-do-have-some-fun-at-their-expense/ load more facebook Share Don't Fall Prey to This IRS Phone Scam (But Do Have Some Fun at Their Expense ) twitter Tweet email Email Related: advice, consumer safety, crime, Deception, IRS, taxes Related Products The Western Story Lecture #6: The Genres of Western Learning: Novels, Plays, Poems, Essays and Treatises amazon.com History In The News Lecture #2: The 21st American Century or What Amazon or Facebook Says About America amazon.com Klavan and Whittle: Manly Men and Womanly Women amazon.com Editor's Choice Psychologist: Fidget Spinners No Better Than Pet Rocks comments Astonishing: Newborn Walks Just Minutes After Birth comments 6 Ways to Make Mom Friends When You're New in Town comments Who knew your inbox could be this informative?

Now on order: a strong second half. By Sandra Ward Biography Updated May 21, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET The year began inauspiciously for pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts. First-quarter earnings were lighter than expected as fewer claims for prescriptions were submitted, partly because Wal-Mart Stores (ticker: WMT) no longer was among Express Scripts' roster of clients. Profit as a percentage of each claim also fell short of expectations, and growth from existing health-plan sponsors and clients didn't materialize as new hires failed to offset attrition, resulting in a lack of net new members.

Edwards was shot April 29, 2017, by Balch Springs, Texas, police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. The Justice Department investigation is separate from the district attorney’s prosecution, and could end in a wide variety of outcomes — some civil, some criminal. Oliver was fired three days after Edwards’ death. Oliver is free on bond.

Servin resigned in May 2016 after the police superintendent said he should be fired for killing Boyd, 22, an unarmed black woman, four years earlier. Servin was off-duty during the incident. She had been walking down a street with her friends when he told them to be quiet, and he fired when he thought he saw a gun. Prosecutors charged Servin with involuntary manslaughter, a judge acquitted him in April 2016, saying he'd been improperly charged. The city settled a wrongful-death lawsuit in 2013 with Boyd's family for $4.5 million.

The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest Clark when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. Some witnesses said Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, but federal and state probes concluded that he was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark's hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Prosecutors decided not to charge either white officer, and an internal police investigation cleared them.

That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight, and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File) HONS FILE - This undated photo provided by the Brown family shows Michael Brown.

The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled his family's lawsuit for $6 million. The officers still could be disciplined or fired by the department.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) CINCINNATI (AP) — Police officers are on trial in Ohio and Minnesota for fatal shootings of black motorists during traffic stops. In both cases, prosecutors say the officers didn't need to respond with deadly force. The officers both have testified they felt threatened. In Cincinnati, former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing for a second time faces charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in the July 2015 shooting of Sam DuBose, 43. Tensing has said he thought DuBose was trying to kill him with his car. A jury deadlocked last November. In Minnesota, St. Anthony Officer Jeronimo Yanez is charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting last July of Philando Castile. He testified Friday he saw Castile's hand on a gun a before he fired. Castile had a permit and had told the officer he had a gun. The cases are among those across the United States in the last three years that have increased debate about race and policing. Here are some other high-profile deaths of blacks during police encounters: ___ JORDAN EDWARDS The U.S. Justice Department said in May that it's investigating the fatal shooting of the 15-year-old by a white police officer in a Dallas suburb. Edwards was shot April 29 by Balch Springs police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. Balch Springs police had originally said the vehicle was reversing "in an aggressive manner" toward officers, who had responded to a complaint about underage drinking. But Police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver is free on bond. ___ TERENCE CRUTCHER An Oklahoma jury on May 17 found Officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16, 2016, death of Terence Crutcher, 40, shot shortly after Shelby arrived on a street to find Crutcher's SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Shelby testified that she was afraid because Crutcher didn't obey her commands and appeared to reach inside his SUV. Prosecutors told jurors that Shelby overreacted, noting that videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter showed Crutcher had his hands in the air and did not have a weapon. ___ ALTON STERLING Federal prosecutors announced May 3 that they would not seek charges against two white police officers who were involved in a deadly encounter with Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last summer. Sterling, 37, was shot to death on July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking demonstrations across Baton Rouge. U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson said Sterling was armed during the confrontation and the investigation didn't find enough evidence to pursue charges. State authorities are investigating to decide whether to bring charges. ___ KEITH LAMONT SCOTT A prosecutor cleared a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer in the September 2016 fatal shooting of Scott, 43, killed while sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex as officers sought another man. A police review board decided that Officer Brentley Vinson followed proper procedure. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times Scott's family said he did not have a gun. Charlotte-Mecklenburg District Attorney Andrew Murray cited evidence that Scott was armed, including a store's surveillance video, DNA recovered from a handgun and a Facebook conversation from the man who said he sold the stolen gun to Scott. ___ JAMAR CLARK Clark's November 2015 shooting death sparked weeks of protests in Minneapolis. The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest the 24-year-old when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. Some witnesses said Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, but federal and state probes concluded that he was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark's hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Prosecutors decided not to charge either white officer, and an internal police investigation cleared them. ___ RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ball, 26. Boykin, awaiting trial, said he fired because Ball appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin, saying the officer violated policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancée to ride with him and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. Ball's family has sued Boykin, the city and other police officials for wrongful death. ___ JEREMY MCDOLE McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander's cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general's office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed "extraordinarily poor" police work. In January, a federal judge approved the city's $1.5 million settlement with McDole's family. ___ WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced last October to 2½ years in prison for fatally shooting Chapman while responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart on April 22, 2015. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed the unarmed 18-year-old "willfully, deliberately and with premeditation." Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin's stun gun. Rankin, who is white, was fired. ___ WALTER SCOTT Prosecutors are recommending decades in prison for white South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, who shot Scott in the back as the motorist fled following a traffic stop. Slager pleaded guilty on May 2 to a federal charge of violating Scott's civil rights. A judge will determine his sentence, which could range from probation to life in prison without parole. Scott's shooting in April 2015 was captured on cellphone video and seen worldwide. ___ FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man was shackled but alive when he was put in a Baltimore police van in April 2015. He came out with severe neck injuries, and his subsequent death led to rioting. Six officers were charged initially, but prosecutors in July 2016 dropped all remaining charges after acquittals and a hung jury. Gray's family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. __ ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff's deputy Robert Bates, 74, was sentenced in 2016 to four years in prison for second-degree manslaughter in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, who was unarmed and restrained. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight, and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. ___ TAMIR RICE The 12-year-old was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers' cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled Rice's family's lawsuit for $6 million. Cleveland in May fired Loehmann and suspended Garmack for 10 days. The officers' union said it will challenge the discipline, calling it politically motivated. ___ AKAI GURLEY Rookie New York City police officer Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter last year in the November 2014 death of 28-year-old Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn when a sound startled him and he fired accidentally. A bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. A judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years' probation and 800 hours of community service. The city settled with Gurley's family for $4.1 million. ___ MICHAEL BROWN The unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department opted against civil rights charges. Wilson later resigned. The death of Brown led to months of occasionally violent protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. ___ LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in November 2015, on the same day that the city, under a judge's orders, released dashcam video showing McDonald, a 17-year-old man, being shot 16 times on Oct. 20, 2014. Van Dyke, who is white, has pleaded not guilty. The video prompted local and federal investigations. The Justice Department determined in January that Chicago police have a long history of civil rights violations and excessive force. The Chicago Police Department has since released a new use-of-force policy that requires officers undergo de-escalation training and imposes stricter rules on when they can fire their weapons at fleeing suspects. ___ ERIC GARNER The 43-year-old man died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict that officer, or any others involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. ___ REKIA BOYD Chicago police officer Dante Servin resigned in May 2016 after the police superintendent said he should be fired for killing Boyd four years earlier. Servin was off-duty when he shot the 22-year-old unarmed woman. She had been walking down a street with her friends when he told them to be quiet, and he fired when he thought he saw a gun. Prosecutors charged Servin with involuntary manslaughter, a judge acquitted him in April 2016, saying he'd been improperly charged. The city settled a wrongful-death lawsuit in 2013 with Boyd's family for $4.5 million. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

In both cases, prosecutors say the officers didn't need to respond with deadly force. The officers both have testified they felt threatened. In Cincinnati, former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing for a second time faces charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in the July 2015 shooting of Sam DuBose, 43. Tensing has said he thought DuBose was trying to kill him with his car. A jury deadlocked last November. In Minnesota, St. Anthony Officer Jeronimo Yanez is charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting last July of Philando Castile. He testified Friday he saw Castile's hand on a gun a before he fired. Castile had a permit and had told the officer he had a gun. The cases are among those across the United States in the last three years that have increased debate about race and policing. Here are some other high-profile deaths of blacks during police encounters: ___ JORDAN EDWARDS The U.S. Justice Department said in May that it's investigating the fatal shooting of the 15-year-old by a white police officer in a Dallas suburb. Edwards was shot April 29 by Balch Springs police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. Balch Springs police had originally said the vehicle was reversing "in an aggressive manner" toward officers, who had responded to a complaint about underage drinking. But Police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver is free on bond. ___ TERENCE CRUTCHER An Oklahoma jury on May 17 found Officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16, 2016, death of Terence Crutcher, 40, shot shortly after Shelby arrived on a street to find Crutcher's SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Shelby testified that she was afraid because Crutcher didn't obey her commands and appeared to reach inside his SUV. Prosecutors told jurors that Shelby overreacted, noting that videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter showed Crutcher had his hands in the air and did not have a weapon. ___ ALTON STERLING Federal prosecutors announced May 3 that they would not seek charges against two white police officers who were involved in a deadly encounter with Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last summer. Sterling, 37, was shot to death on July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking demonstrations across Baton Rouge. U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson said Sterling was armed during the confrontation and the investigation didn't find enough evidence to pursue charges. State authorities are investigating to decide whether to bring charges. ___ KEITH LAMONT SCOTT A prosecutor cleared a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer in the September 2016 fatal shooting of Scott, 43, killed while sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex as officers sought another man.

(Facebook) Print Email Michael Kransz | mkransz@mlive.com By Michael Kransz | mkransz@mlive.com The Saginaw News Email the author on June 10, 2017 at 10:26 AM, updated June 10, 2017 at 10:32 AM comments BRECKENRIDGE, MI -- Police are searching for a 52-year-old woman who left home eleven days ago without medication and hasn't been heard from since by family members. While foul play is not suspected and it's not illegal to leave home, police say the woman's family is concerned and want to make sure she's OK, said Breckenridge Police Chief James Durham. Pamela Flagg left her Breckenridge home in Gratiot County on May 31, telling family she was going to visit relatives in Midland, Durham said. Flagg never made it to Midland, Durham said. She left home without her medication, only taking the clothes she was wearing and a 2002 Silver Chevy Impala with a Michigan registration of 1LU W50, the chief said. Family has been unable to reach Flagg, and they say it's out of the ordinary for this to happen, Durham said. The day Flagg left was the last time she was reported seen. After Flagg left home, a friend of hers spotted her at a Walmart in Alma and described the interaction as normal, the chief said. Flagg stands about 5-foot, 9-inches and is roughly 150 pounds, according to a missing persons report. Anyone with information about the incident can call Breckenridge police at (989) 842-5657, or Gratiot County Central Dispatch at (989) 875-7505.   Michigan's Best 198 nominations for Michigan's Best French fry 9 fast food French fries ranked from best to worst More Michigan's Best » Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Connect with MLive Subscribe to our newsletters Like us on Facebook Subscribe on YouTube Most Read Active Discussions About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

For comparison, in the four years between 2011 and 2015, Amazon loaned just $1.5 billion to the same group. The reasoning behind the loans reminds me of the old aphorism that “a rising tide raises all boats.” Except that in this case, it’s more like the biggest boat is rising the tide by itself. Why Amazon Is Loaning More Peeyush Nahar, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, was the one to talk with Reuters. The invitation-only program offers loans from $1,000 to $750,000, and has loaned to 20,000 companies, more than half of whom return for a second loan. Here’s the explanation Nahar offered, in Reuters’ words: “Boosting sales for third-party merchants is lucrative for Amazon, which takes a cut of transactions on its site. […] Rivals, including eBay Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, now are doubling down on their marketplace businesses, but loans may help keep sellers close to Amazon’s orbit.” What It Means for Small Businesses Amazon is one of the most powerful tech companies out there — even Netflix is scared of them. As a result, its relationship with third-party small businesses is very similar to that of social giant Facebook and the third-party media companies that live or die by the latest Facebook algorithm tweak: Uneasy. The loans are definitely good for now. But more recent news from Amazon hints at the speed at which great deals can vanish: The company is killing its unlimited $60-a-year cloud storage deal for Amazon Drive. Users must now chose from two tiers: store 100GB for $11.99 a year, or store up to 1TB for $60. The unlimited deal, introduced in 2015 to make Amazon competitive against storage companies like Dropbox, has now served its purpose. Will third-party merchants see their loan dry up as well? Only if it suits Amazon’s bottom line. In the meantime, enjoy the billion-dollar-deals from every retailer’s best frenemy.

Are there any GPS trackers for pets? A: Losing a pet, even for a few minutes, can be a nerve-racking experience. If you live in a close-knit neighborhood, it's likely someone will find your dog and use its license to track you down. But what if you're at work? Or you have recently moved and haven’t met your neighbors? You’ll be relieved to know there are dozens of different devices that can keep track of your dog or cat, using either radio waves or GPS. Each system has its drawbacks and benefits, but all of them work pretty darn well. Click here for the best pet trackers and GPS collars. More on this...

What apps would you recommend I put on my phone? A: I know some of my fans think I spend all my time in the studio, but the truth is that I love to travel, and I know how enriching this can be for children, whether they want to drive across the country or not. That said, there are lots of new apps to help the kids appreciate their time on the road. There are games you can play, crowd-sourced navigation tools and even cultural guides to your next freeway exit. Click here for five helpful apps for your next road adventure. Keeping a (hidden) eye on the homefront Q: I have to leave the kids with a sitter this summer. I don’t want her to know I have a camera set up in the kitchen. Are there any spy cams that would go undetected? A: Well, my first instinct is to suggest finding a babysitter you implicitly trust. After all, this person is going to take care of your kids, and he or she should be properly vetted. If you’re worried about your kids’ behavior, obviously it’s best to have a sit-down with them beforehand. But the technology does exist to monitor your household while you're away, and for more reasons than keeping your babysitter in check. It can also function as a surveillance camera to protect you against theft. And many of these cameras are very hard to detect. Click here for the best nanny cams for watching your kids. Online savings at Target Q: I really liked your tips on how to save money on Amazon. Do you have any pointers for those of us who shop at Target? A: While Amazon and Walmart have almost anything you need on their websites, I completely understand your affection for Target. This retail chain has a certain cachet that many shoppers are drawn to, and their stock is expansive enough to score a bull’s-eye most of the time. Virtual shopping has become something of an art, and the biggest chains make bargain-hunting a lot of fun, but Target has its fair share of tips and tricks for saving online. Click here for three money-saving secrets at Target. Scary Wi-Fi images of your house Q: On your radio show, you said there is a way that someone can take a picture of you inside your home. It was done using the home’s Wi-Fi. Can you tell me more? A: Pretty amazing, isn't it? I should add that this is cutting-edge research, not to mention a very recent discovery, which means that most of us will not be able to see a Wi-Fi-based image of our house for a while. This is probably a good thing, too, because it's hard to tell whether it will be more useful for first responders searching for people in trouble or for burglars casing a suburban home. But the picture and its corresponding video are pretty impressive. Click here to find out how Wi-Fi can be used to photograph a home. What questions do you have?

Yes, that’s coming from a guy who works for a holster company, but it’s still the truth. I wouldn’t exactly say “I don’t care who you get it from, just get one” because I do have a natural bias there but the idea is something like that. (You could look at us first, though. Just saying.) The reason why it’s critical that you carry with one is for two reasons: retention and trigger protection. Unsecured pistols and unsecured triggers are two of the biggest contributors to accidental shootings, along with not observing the four rules of firearm safety. Similarly, this is also why off-body carry and pocket carry should be avoided if at all possible in most cases. Granted, a lot of people have pocket carried snubnose revolvers for many years. However, it is also the case that snubbies and other double action pistols have a much heavier trigger pull than today’s pocket plastic fantastics (10 to 15 pounds for the typical revolver vs 5 to pounds for a Glock 43, Bodyguard or similar pistol) which prevents the trigger from being pulled accidentally. Or does it? A recent news article in the New Jersey Daily Record reports of a coin vendor whose PPK accidentally discharged at a coin show in Parsippany, N.J., in May 2016. It was in his pocket, and apparently being jostled around was sufficient to discharge the pistol. For those unaware, the PPK and PPK/S are double-action/single-action handguns. The vendor, one William Wetzler, Jr., is facing charges of carrying without a license and also reckless causing of injury, as a bullet fragment struck a fellow vendor. Another recent example occurred in Clinton, Tenn., according to Knoxville NBC affiliate WBIR, and to a person who should have known a lot better. An off-duty correctional officer with the Anderson County Sheriff’s Department was carrying a pistol in a pocket without a holster when it discharged while he was in a Walmart (naturally) on May 18. And so on; plenty of examples of accidental or negligent discharges whilst pocket carrying are out there. Additionally, off-body carry is likewise a bad idea. Purse carry for women, while uber-convenient, is actually not a very good idea for the exact same reasons why pocket carry (at least without a pocket holster) is not the safest way to carry a gun. For instance, USA Today reported on May 26 that one Debra McQuillen of Philadelphia, Mississippi, was at the Lakeland Family Medicine Center in Jackson, when she dropped her purse and discharged the gun she was carrying, wounding another woman in the medical center. Granted, McQuillen had stolen the firearm and was carrying illegally. She was arrested for possession of a stolen firearm, illegal concealment and simple assault. Oddly enough, that happened just one year after a similar incident occurred at a different hospital in the same city in April 2016; a woman dropped her purse while carrying a pistol at Merit Health Central Hospital, which discharged the pistol. The bullet grazed her 2-year-old’s face, according to the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. Additionally, off-body carry in a purse, messenger bag, laptop bag, briefcase or backpack poses the risk of said bag being stolen. A Miami-Dade police officer was carrying her badge and Glock duty pistol in her purse, which was stolen after she set it down while at the beach, according to NBC Miami. This isn’t a female issue, either; a Secret Service agent in Washington, D.C., lost his sidearm, badge, handcuffs and radio to a thief who stole it from the back of his car in December 2015, according to CNN. The car was parked outside Secret Service headquarters. The agent wasn’t named, but works (or at least did at the time!) on the Presidential detail. If you must pocket carry, do so with a pocket holster. Doing so guards the trigger but also ensures the sights won’t snag, making for an easy draw from concealment. However, it remains the case that the safest and best way to carry is with a holster on your person. Click here to get your 1911 Pistol Shopping Guide.

Sally Huang, leader of visual technologies for Houzz Labs, is part of a team of former video game designers who recently launched View In My Room 3D, an augmented reality feature added to the existing iPhone and iPad app. The feature will be available soon for Android devices. “The 3D version allows you to rotate 360° and to move items around a room,” says Huang. “We have more than 300,000 pieces of furniture and decorating products in 3D and we’re adding more all the time. The 3D models have extra texture and look more realistic, so it’s easier for people to see what things look like.” The View In My Room app is integrated with the Houzz site so users can send items to their idea book or shop for the products by clicking on them. Augmented reality and virtual reality have become mainstream now that consumers can buy their own goggles for less than $20 at Walmart and Target. Interior designers caught on quickly to the benefit of using these technologies to showcase architectural features, furniture and accessories and to allow consumers to get a feel for how these items will look in person. Planner 5D, an app that has been used by more than 18 million homeowners, architects and renovation experts, offers another option for people to virtually design their own space. Users enter their room dimensions into the app to create a floor plan and then choose furniture from linked catalogues such as Ikea and then virtually move the furniture around to see how it will look with 2-D and 3-D augmented reality. Virtual reality is also an option if you have VR goggles which let you virtually step inside the room and walk around. Planned 5D can be used on a browser, iPhone, iPad or Android device. The virtual reality feature is available only on its Android app. ShareTweet ShareTweet The Washington Post Story Archive Leave a Comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

This week: Hot Toys finally unleashes the Homecoming figure we really want, Overwatch gets an amazing action figure, and Anki's adorable robot gets a new coat of paint! Hot Toys' Spider-Man Homecoming Deluxe Figure The second 30cm Spider-Man: Homecoming figure from Hot Toys finally features Peter Parker in his fancy crime-fighting Underoos courtesy of Tony Stark. In addition to a new masked head sculpt and a new likeness of actor Tom Holland, the sixth-scale figure also comes with four sets of swappable eyes for recreating various expressions, magnetically attachable web-wings, and a bunch of web-slinging parts. The deluxe version also comes with a zip-up hoodie, a high school blazer, and a detailed version of the Vulture's helmet we're going to assume Spidey takes as a souvenir. Spoiler alert? [Hot Toys via Toyark] Mezco One:12 Wonder Woman Now that Wonder Woman is out, a whole wave of merchandise for DC's legendary Amazon is on the way — and if that pricey Hot Toys figure is a bit out of your range, this version of Diana from Mezco is half the size but less than half the price, while still looking pretty damn good. Complete with her sword, shield, lasso of truth, six interchangeable hands, and even an alternate head of Diana looking like she's just about ready to beat you the hell up, Mezco's latest 1:12 scale figure is expected to be available some time between November 2017 and January 2018 for $US80 ($106). [Mezco] Transformers: The Last Knight Voyager Class Optimus Prime Figure Like the original animated series, the (seemingly) endless run of Hollywood's Transformers movies mostly serve as long commercials for a new batch of robot toys. The Last Knight is no different, but this $US50 ($66) Voyager Class Optimus Prime figure, available initially at Comic-Con 2017, comes with a good reason to try and snatch one up in San Diego. A limited number of figures will include an authentic piece of truck tyre, screen-used in one of the Transformers films, authenticated by truck maker Western Star. Was it specifically used on Optimus Prime? Hasbro's a little vague about that detail, given just how many vehicles are used in each movie. Monty Python-opoly Even if you don't have room for another box on your board game shelf, it's time to make some. Who needs Scrabble when the umpteenth edition of Monopoly ($US45 [$60]) trades Rich Uncle Pennybags for Monty Python's Flying Circus' 1975 theatrical search for the Holy Grail? The entire Monopoly board and accessories have been given a facelift, with the traditional tokens replaced by the Black Knight, the Holy Grail, the Trojan Rabbit, half a coconut and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. [ThinkGeek via The Awesomer] Justice League Mattel Figures The Justice League movie might be months away, but never let that get in the way of hyping up the toyline already. Mattel has taken to the official Justice League website to tease the next wave of figures based on the movie — from 15cm scaled Multiverse figures for each member of the League (including Superman, who gets a rough deal compared to the rest of his colleagues in the likeness department), to 10cm superarticulated figures, and even a new toy version of the Batmobile with lights and sounds. Start preparing your wallets for August, DC fans, there's gonna be a lot of cool stuff to buy. [Join the League] Die Hard: The Official Colouring Book Yippie ki-yay, mothercrayon. Nearly 30 years after Bruce Willis went from Moonlighting to a bona fide action hero, Die Hard remains a near-perfect film, and an important part of many families' holiday traditions. But with this $15.42 official Die Hard colouring book, you can enjoy the film all year round through 80 pages of black and white illustrations to colour, puzzles, games, quotes from the movie, and the best connect-the-dots you've ever completed. [Firebox via The Green Head] Hot Wheels Wonder Woman Invisible Jet It isn't the first time a toy company has sold an empty package claiming a miniature version of Wonder Woman's invisible jet was inside, but Hot Wheels might be asking too much for its latest version. In addition to sending along receipts proving you've spent $US20 ($27) on Hot Wheels toys at a Walmart between now and July 15, you'll also need to include $US3.50 ($5) with your completed order form to cover shipping costs. That's more than a basic Hot Wheels car costs, and at least that gives something more than an empty blister pack to display. It isn't available in Australia, but you aren't missing out on much. [Hot Wheels Collector] Chronicle Collectibles Jurassic Park Raptor Egg Prop Replica For those who don't remember the Pet Rock fad from 1975, with clever packaging and accessories, an advertising exec found a way to sell 1.5 million rocks to people. Hoping that history will repeat itself, Chronicle Collectibles will now let you pre-order a full-size replica of the Velociraptor eggs seen in the original Jurassic Park. To reiterate, for $US200 ($266) you can get a prop replica of a prop replica, plus a lovely display stand. [Facebook: Chronicle Collectibles via Toyark] Figma Tracer Cheers love, the Cavalry's here! Overwatch fans have been waiting since the game came out just over a year ago to get awesome figures of the quirky cast of heroes, scientists and adventurers of Blizzard's team-based sci-fi FPS game. Now Good Smile are threatening to emptier your wallet faster than that lootbox-buying spree you went on during the anniversary event to get that Sentai Genji skin ever did (don't worry, we've all been there). Kicking off the line is a 14cm recreation of Overwatch's mascot, the chipper, time-hopping Tracer, who comes with her trusty SMGs, three different faceplates for a variety of expressions, a set of hands to recreate her poses from the game, and even a little pulse bomb for Tracer to eventually fling at other figures in the line. Expected to release at the end of the year, Tracer should set you back ¥6800 ($82) if you preorder her from Japan. If you take the easy option and go through Blizzard, it will be $US70 ($93). [Blizzard Gear Store] Anki Cozmo Liquid Metal Collector's Edition Available in the US for the past year now, Anki's Cozmo robot is about as close as you can get to owning one of the droids from Star Wars — despite it being just several centimetres tall. The tiny bot is finally ready to visit other countries, rolling out to Canada in July, and then available in the UK, France, Germany and Nordic countries in September, alongside a new collector's edition version of Cozmo featuring a sleek "liquid metal" finish. They're "still looking at" bring it to other countries, so fingers crossed for Australia. If Star Wars' Captain Phasma had a droid sidekick, this is what it would look like.

Diya Kohli The vinyl business in India is far from dead. There are those who love vinyl enough to trudge to dusty vintage shops and dig through crates packed with old records to find that out-of-print album. The modern vinyl record came into the world post World War II, largely replacing the earlier 78 rpm shellac. And it almost immediately spawned crate-diggers (also known as record-diggers and vinylheads). Their tribe is still growing. According to Nielsen Music’s 2016 “US Year-End Music Report”, vinyl LP (long-playing) record sales reached an all-time high of 13 million units. A little less than two months ago, India saw its first celebration of Record Store Day. On 22 April, Mumbai-based audio and vinyl shop, The Revolver Club, together with Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation (DADC), took the lead in organizing a blowout across Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. On the same day, Delhi-based online music magazine Wild City celebrated its first Record Store Day with the inauguration of its “Selectors” listening sessions. These are planned to be monthly sessions, led by an individual who will take the audience through their vinyl collection. It feels like a portent of things to come. In January last year, when the news of David Bowie’s death started flooding social media and breaking a million hearts, my husband’s first reaction was to place an order on Amazon for a double vinyl edition of one of his best live concerts, Santa Monica ’72. Years of being an online crate-digger had given him a hound’s instinct when it came to predicting surges and dips in prices. Needless to say, he was spot on—all of Bowie on vinyl became worth its weight in gold soon after. By then, of course, our LP was well on its way. Prof. Suresh Chandvankar at a talk during Record Store Day celebrations in Mumbai. Courtesy: The Revolver Club Later that week, we carefully unwrapped one of the LPs and placed the needle on the groove. And just like that our Bandra flat faded away and we were one of the audience at Santa Monica, dazzled by our glam rock god. As the record kept spinning and the opening riffs of Ziggy Stardust filled the room, we were filled with sadness but we revelled in the incredible music he had left behind. One corner of the houses we have lived in has always had a thriving ecosystem based around vinyl—the buying, storing and caring of each LP that comes in. Thanks to my husband’s singular devotion to LPs, I too have been drawn to the black. We now always have a vinyl tour bookending our holiday itineraries—we go digging in flea markets, old bazaars and hipster warehouses. It began with a trip to Melbourne, our first foreign holiday together, where we found a wealth of records, including a near-mint edition of The Graduate soundtrack. On a recent trip to Egypt, we discovered a wonderful old record shop in Zamalek, Cairo, stocked with retro turntables and old trunks filled with records of Arabian music, Western classical and oddball disco. It has become such a tradition that even on my solo work trips, I take time out to go LP shopping. I found a rare Black Tie White Noise EP in the labyrinthine lanes of old Jaffa’s flea market in Tel Aviv. While wandering around the charming old town of Lucerne in Switzerland, I bagged a limited-edition 10-inch vinyl of Radiohead’s Kid A. It would be fair to say that ever since we got our first vinyl (Radiohead’s Pablo Honey) in 2011, we have started listening more mindfully. Our attention-deficit, playlist-hoarding selves have learnt what it is to immerse ourselves in an artist and an album. We don’t play music to keep time as we run on the treadmill. We are not drowning out ambient sounds in our workplace. We listen for the sole pleasure of listening. We feel the thrill of watching the disc delicately wobble and spin, of hearing the occasional dirt-inflected crackle. What’s more, we have suddenly became part of a larger community of enthusiasts, hipsters, collectors, archivists, DJs, musicians, store owners and record labels with complete faith in vinyl.

Photo Courtesy: Amarrass The crackling beauty of analogue What we hear every time we put on an LP is detail, a singer clearing her throat, the gentle twang of a marimba, the background noise of a bar at a live gig. It feels like our favourite musicians and bands are closer to us than they have ever been. And sometimes if we close our eyes and just listen, it feels like they are playing right in front of us in our living room. That is what I identify as the warmth of a vinyl record’s analogue sound. For Rajat Kakar, managing director, Sony DADC India, the vinyl experience is intrinsically linked with the romance of un-sleeving the record, the original inlay and the artwork. He believes that vinyl is largely the preserve of collectors and connoisseurs with a passion for high- fidelity sound which gets lost in compressed digital formats. “The sound quality is really good and you can hear each instrument clearly,” says Kakar, who has a collection of over 500 vinyl records. According to Jude de Souza, chief executive officer (CEO) and founder of The Revolver Club in Mahim, Mumbai, “People who get into vinyl are usually those who have an intrinsic need to touch and feel.” Though vinyl gradually faded from the mainstream when the audio cassette was introduced in the US in 1966, there was another group of people, apart from audiophiles and vinyl collectors, who kept the second-hand LP market alive—the DJs. Crate-digging in far corners of the world for specific tracks, underground sounds and lesser-known artists, DJs shared a close relationship with the LP, swearing by its superior sound. It is this cool aspect of mixing on vinyl that is the focus of the new Netflix TV show The Get Down. Set in 1970s’ Bronx, New York, the show charts the rise of hip hop. It begins with a DJ instructing his protégé on a quick mix by physically marking a climactic point or “the get down” across a bunch of vinyl records. This then enables him to match tracks and mix a loop of unique beats. Home-grown DJs like Mumbai-based Pramod Sippy aka DJ Pramz, who has recently started doing vinyl-only sets, agrees the sound quality is much superior to digital tracks—and it is a lot more fun to play. “Usually, when DJs play digital music, they don’t have much to do and it’s like they are literally idling away behind the console. Playing with vinyl is challenging as mixing and matching tracks is a task,” he says. And although sourcing, buying, storing and caring for vinyl is a major investment, it is worth it. “I believe what I hear and to my ears, vinyl sounds really sweet,” says DJ Pramz. He believes a vinyl set is an audiovisual experience for the audience, which can really see the DJ at work, handling an LP. An informal listening session at The Revolver Club in Mahim. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint The fine art of the vinyl collector In his book Vinyl Junkies, Brett Milano writes, “Love for the music, love for the artefact, the thrill of the chase: those are the three elements that turn a garden-variety music lover into a vinyl junkie.” Vinyl collectors range from fledgling crate-diggers to collector-archivists like Zero Freitas, a Brazilian businessman who at last count had the world’s largest private collection—over six million LPs—stored across his massive warehouse; he intends to catalogue it and make it available for public use. On a much smaller scale, retired forest officer Sunny Mathew in Kerala is doing the same thing. He runs the Discs & Machines, Sunny’s Gramophone Museum and Records Archive in the little town of Plassanal in Kerala; it has a collection of over 100,000 records (mostly 78 rpm shellac) and more than 250 gramophones from the pre-World War II era. Suresh Chandvankar in Mumbai has over 10,000 records in his collection. A former physicist with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Chandvankar is honorary secretary of the Society of Indian Record Collectors, Mumbai, which tries to bring together Indian record lovers, combine resources and create a vast archive of Indian recordings. At the 2017 anniversary seminar held at the Discs & Machines museum, Chandvankar spoke about the association. “In 1990, we came up with the idea of collecting the collectors and drawing them out of the isolated empires of their households to form some kind of a collective,” he says. He stresses the importance of this community of sellers, buyers, swappers and researchers involved in discography. “While record collectors can be madcaps, their madness will go a long way in writing the history of the recorded past of India.” This cult of vinyl lovers has found its modern-day expression in a WhatsApp group called Vinyl Addicts Anonymous, which brings together 256 collectors and enthusiasts from across India. Run by The Revolver Club, the group has vinylheads sharing all kinds of nerdy trivia, weird vinyl humour, and all manner of useful and random information. There are obscure LPs up for sale, discussions on the most effective record cleaners, travel tips on where to scour the best vinyl, curious artwork and much more. The collector’s love for vinyl also expands into a love for the independent record store. Although many go online for good deals, the brick-and-mortar vinyl store is an unbeatable experience. This is where one can sift through old and new albums and experience the tactility that is such an important aspect of the format. And that is why, in 2007, independent record-store owners came up with the idea of an annual event to get artists, enthusiasts, first-timers and record labels together to celebrate vinyl. The first Record Store Day was flagged off at the Rasputin Music store in Berkeley, California, in 2008. Over the last decade, this event has turned into one large party, featuring everything from vinyl-only DJ sets, listening sessions and special discounted merchandise to academic discussions and debate. “If you look at why Record Store Day started, it was pretty much because store owners wanted to tell the world that they were still around and to inform journalists who were always writing obituaries to vinyl that they were fine,” says De Souza of The Revolver Club. Groovy business This renewed interest in vinyl is something a company like Sony DADC wants to leverage. It plans to bring turntables into the Indian market at accessible price points that it hopes will boost vinyl sales. Talks are on to set up a pressing plant in Europe to stay abreast of the growing demand both in India and globally. However, these are still early days for the business in India—the vinyl market here is largely a collector’s market. So the sales strategies are different from mainstream music marketing. “We can’t just bring in records of random pop acts and expect them to sell. Genres like jazz, blues, classic rock and Bollywood are the top sellers. The records are placed in old-school brick-and-mortar stores across the country that have a certain mindset and a dedicated audience,” says Kakar. De Souza also has distinct catalogue choices for vinyl records based onthe top 100 albums of all time across genres. His sales strategy, however, is different from Kakar’s. The Revolver Club drives most of its business through online retail. “Eighty per cent of our sales happen online. While it is romantic to say vinyl is about crate-digging, it costs money to keep crates and that gets passed on to the customer, and since India is a price-sensitive market, it wouldn’t work,” says De Souza. Apart from the metros, he says, a large number of orders for records as well as turntables come from Patna, Shillong, Ajmer and Indore. “From a business standpoint, I want to be a Walmart of vinyl. I want to get a guy who knows nothing about vinyl, a guy from Ajmer who has a fascination with rock ‘n’ roll, and introduce him to the world of turntables and records,” he adds. For such beginner audiophiles, De Souza offers audio packages complete with turntables, speakers and amps at a variety of levels and price points, starting from Rs75,000 and going up to Rs10 lakh. Much is said about the pleasant imperfections of vinyl, though purists will argue that the pops and crackles just mean you haven’t cleaned your record well. In an article titled “It Kind Of Gives You That Vintage Feel: Vinyl Records And The Trope Of Death”, published in the book Media, Culture And Society in 2008, Emily Chivers Yochim and Megan Biddinger from the University of Michigan quote a young record collector on the sound of vinyl: “I like the popping and crackling to an extent. Some of them are so bad that you can’t really hear the music, but if they are in moderation, that little fuzz that you get from a record, I like that…if you are listening to a record from 1960, you have a record that sounds like it’s from 1960…in a good way though. It kind of gives you that vintage feel.” While the jury may be out on this notion of warmth, for me the LP exudes a certain sound that is pure and easy and accessible. It is the kind of sound that enabled me to pick up the first barks of Seamus in the eponymously titled song from Pink Floyd’s 1971 album Meddle and almost go running to my front door to say hello to the dog outside. After playing Miles Davis’ version of Concierto De Aranjuez on vinyl innumerable times, I could hear every crescendo, track the dips and follow the turns from gentle and sweet to operatic and brooding. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about the vinyl sound that turns casual listeners into converts, but what I know is that I will keep listening in and adding to our LP collection, as will a whole new generation of 21st century crate-diggers. It is not yet time to say goodbye to the long player. *** Collector’s notes Three crate diggers tell us about their turning points in the search for vinyl Chancing upon ‘Rhapsody’ in Japan The first LP I ever bought for myself was at a bargain sale at the Students’ Union building in the University of Warwick in 2002. It was the Spin Doctors’ Pocket Full Of Kryptonite, pulled out of a bin of second-hand records. I didn’t have a record player, so it seemed like a frivolous purchase, but it was £3 (around Rs250 now), which made it cheaper than a sandwich. I finally listened to it only six years later, and even on my low-fi Lenco turntable, the opening riff of Jimmy Olsen’s Blues made me dance like I was 13 again. Five years ago, a friend in Berlin introduced me to The Vinyl District (TVD), an app that locates the record stores closest to your geographical location. It has become my principal navigation system on foreign streets, leading me to dens, basements, warehouses and garages. In 2014, TVD led me to RECOfan in Yokohama. A diminutive store manager walked over to me after I had spent 2 hours sifting through their entire jazz section. I was looking for Leonard Bernstein conducting Rhapsody In Blue, which I had never found. The next day, when I returned to the store, he showed me two copies, and to my surprise packed the cheaper one. “It has a small skip on Side B but overall it’s better. Just a small...(and then he made a gesture like a hiccup).” Two years ago, I found a record of my favourite album by complete accident. I was at Chicago’s Dusty Groove, looking through their rather modest stock of second-hand rock LPs. As I moved from “Q” to “R”, I saw the edges of what looked like the orange cover of R.E.M.’s Monster. I had been hunting for it for eight years but it was out of print and I had only found rare copies of it online, upwards of $150 (around Rs9,670 now). I pulled it out. It was $40. I was so overwhelmed. I walked slowly to one of their listening stations, and standing still for the next 45 minutes, I heard the album from start to finish, as if for the first time. There were no hiccups. —Neel Chaudhuri, founder and artistic director of The Tadpole Repertory theatre company, Delhi Digging around in Chandni Chowk Back in 2011, I had shamelessly bought my wife a red plastic retro-style turntable for her birthday as a treat for both of us. The “gift” was graciously accepted; however, the sound was tinny and of poor quality and the wave of disappointment was soul-crushing. That did not stop me from acquiring records. Seeking out record shops became a quest which took us to places such as the Shah Music Centre in Delhi’s Chandni Chowk area, where the kindly old proprietor told us many stories of collecting records and showed us his mammoth stockpile. Holidays abroad turned into cross-city crate-digging treasure hunts armed with vinyl maps. A helpful friend suggested in 2013 that I try a turntable with a built-in pre-amp and that opened the doorway to an unmatched sonic experience. The vinyl sound to me is more well-rounded and wholesome, and the various instruments feel more relaxed being where they are in the arrangement. So in The Who’s Baba O’Riley, when the piano kicks in, it doesn’t seem to try to challenge the rest of the amply muscular arrangement to a fistfight but is just happy to be given a chance to be part of the song. Add to that the sheer physical pleasure of feverishly anticipating a delivery, carefully unboxing and unwrapping and sliding out the shiny black discs while admiring the artwork on the sleeves. The ample space available for the artwork is a boon—over the years, I have collected some amazing inner sleeves (Gorillaz’ Plastic Beach), picture discs (Rage Against The Machine’s eponymous album) and colour discs (T-Bone Walker’s T-Bone Blues). Finally, there is the constant fussing and caring about storage solutions, cleaning solutions and so on. Vinyl is back. Who would have given it a second chance? Now I spend my weekends lovingly cleaning, sleeving and dancing to my records. —Rahul Roy, associate, global banking, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC) Ltd, Mumbai ‘Yesterday And Today’ by The Beatles...forever I have always been that child who never threw his toys away, some might even call me a hoarder. But it was with vinyl that I truly learnt what it meant to be a collector. My father’s stamp collection was something that inspired me to start something of my own, a collection that I would care for and be proud of. After listening to my first record, I was blown away by the warmth of analogue sound. It was like nothing I had ever heard. And as I played it through my speakers, my living room turned into a lounge or a rock concert arena, depending on the album playing. Although there are new albums being released on vinyl, classic rock is what draws me. I also can’t deny the guilty pleasure of 1960s’ pop and dance music. Those in my family who also collect vinyl warned me about the care and maintenance of records. However, I soon realized that I really liked taking care of my vinyl. I usually grab my cleaning equipment, settle down with my records and make an evening of it. Although I started off fairly recently, my collection already comprises 122 albums. Funnily enough, when I tell my older relatives I collect vinyl, they just hand me their old stuff as well, and it just keeps growing. My most prized possession is the Mothers of Invention album Freak Out! and my collection of The Beatles, including a rare print of Yesterday And Today. —Tarun Abraham Paul, content writer with a leading entertainment channel Diya Kohli Topics: Music vinyl records vinylheads vinyl LP Online music More From Livemint READ MORE Indian Railways to induct 40,000 refurbished coaches Strides Shasun gets USFDA nod for pain relieving drug Donald Trump invited to testify over James Comey, Russian meddling First Published: Sat, Jun 10 2017. 09 34 AM IST Editor's Picks Why India’s bad loan problem is really bad We don’t need more Mandsaurs Maharashtra announces farm loan waiver, farmers call off protest Latest News Indian Railways to induct 40,000 refurbished coaches Strides Shasun gets USFDA nod for pain relieving drug Donald Trump invited to testify over James Comey, Russian meddling Graham Allison’s book ‘Destined for War’ will rattle you AIADMK crisis: Panneerselvam dissolves panel on merger with Palaniswami faction Mint On Sunday Amish’s Warrior of Mithila fuses the mythological with the contemporary Of little-known Indian languages and scripts Art, Frida and chillies in Mexico Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it Letter from... a polling booth in the UK Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

Fortunately, the workers at the different donation areas were optimistic about donor turnouts. While the morning started off slowly, Moore commented that more people would probably show up after lunchtime. Some buses, like the ones at Dick's Sporting Goods, experienced a slower morning than ones in higher-traffic areas, such as Wal-Mart on Olive Street. Overall, the buses had about 15-20 donors by 10:30 Friday morning. Each donation can help three patients, so community members around Cullman had already saved between 45 and 60 lives before noon. It was estimated that there are around 140 eligible blood donors throughout Cullman, both for the city and the county, and Moore thanked each of them for taking the time to help their community. "We have some of the most generous donors in north Alabama, and we'd just like to say thank you." It's also important to remember that blood donations are needed consistently, not just during emergency situations. When a crisis happens and hundreds of people go to donate blood, hospitals and blood banks often end up with a surplus that goes unused and ends up going bad before it's needed. This can lead to a shortage, so eligible donors should keep in mind that blood is always needed, not just during emergencies. Team sites for Cullman County were the Cullman County Courthouse and Wal-Mart south. The City had Wal-Mart north and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Check back for final results.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Microsoft Cortana wants to help you save money as… Microsoft Cortana wants to help you save money as you shop online By Lulu Chang — June 9, 2017 11:17 am Subscribe Share Here are the top 25 games that made the SNES, well, super Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Saving money while you are shopping online is sort of the point and Microsoft can help you do this even more with its new tool. Comparison shopping is smart shopping, but it is also really time-consuming. Sometimes, you just do not have the time to save that kind of money. Luckily, technology is here to help you out. Specifically, Microsoft Cortana is here to help you out. On Friday, the company announced a new pilot feature that claims to help you find “the best pricing for the product you are viewing,” as long as you’re using the Microsoft Edge web browser. Cortana will let you know if “relevant details are available at the time of your visit” to an online shopping site, which is to say, that if there are cheaper prices to be found at that particular moment, you will be notified. As it stands, the new tool supports 14 retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and eBay, within the U.S. Microsoft says that it will be upping this number in the coming months, and we will update you as changes roll out. So how will you take advantage of the offering? Much like existing Cortana features, you see a display notification in the address bar, should there be important information regarding the site you are currently visiting. If you are on the site of a supported retailer, Cortana will let you know that there are similar products at lower prices, getting you a deal. If you click the Cortana icon, you can see this comparison information in the right panel within the same window. Of course, given the newness of the feature, Microsoft is still figuring out a few things. As such, the company is asking for as much feedback as it can get. “Let us know what you think about the feature,” the company noted in a blog post. “Your feedback is important as we continue to make improvements and add support for other sites.”
News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Weather Subscribe subscribe Site Site Archive The Legit Smit: Residents of Ridgecrest —The supercentenarian Saturday Jun 10, 2017 at 12:01 AM Michael Smit Staff Writer "Do you remember watching a moment in history that felt important?" I asked Opal Goode after her 110th birthday party at High Desert Haven on Friday. "Oh, the man on the moon!" she quickly said. She explained that she watched it happen on TV. "I saw them land and I saw them pick them up in the ocean." Cheryl Bernhardi, Goode's daughter, added, "When you're from a time when you used a covered wagon, that's pretty astounding." Goode was born in 1907. Theodore Roosevelt was president. The Ford Model T would enter production the next year. Mark Twain was still writing. She was born in Indian Territory, which would later become part of Oklahoma when it reached statehood. While still young, she traveled with her parents in a horse-led wagon to Texas, then later back to Oklahoma. She was the valedictorian of her 1926 graduating class. The Wright brothers' claims of controlled, powered flight were still mocked in the year Goode was born, and would continue to be until their first public flight demonstration a year later. Within Goode's lifetime, she would watch that technology advance until it landed men on the moon. She now lives in a time with autonomous robots on Mars and high-powered cameras sending us images as they fly past Pluto. She moved with her husband to Bakersfield in 1930 and worked as a clerk at Woolworth through the Great Depression. Bernhardi said she worked every day and made $16 a week. Goode and her husband moved to Long Beach in 1941, then to China Lake in 1945. She got a job at the Bank of America, and continued working there until 1965. She moved to Glendale in 1976, back to Ridgecrest in 2003. She began staying at HDH in 2008, at the age of 101. I asked her what Ridgecrest and China Lake were like when she came in 1945. "There was nothing," she said. Bernhardi, who was seven in 1945, said that there were no houses, no stores, no paved roads, no street lights. It wasn't until years later that the city got paved roads. Goode said the area where the new Super Walmart is now was filled with alfalfa farms and cattle. Goode explained that a normal day now revolves around meal times with her friends at HDH. She also goes to exercise classes whenever she can. HDH hosts chair based exercise classes, mostly moving the arms and shoulders. She continued to explain that she also loves to read. She laughed and said that she's currently reading a book that was given to her as a gift. It's called, "If I Live to be a Hundred." Bernhardi advised me that the interview might be short because Goode has had a busy week since her birthday last week and her party on Friday. She's interviewed with multiple news agencies and met many friends. Yet, while talking to me, she still responded with humor, laughing at her own jokes. I wanted to listen to her tell me what it was like living through the time of Dillinger, the prohibition, watching the Western states form, hearing jazz revolutionize music, and seeing her first car. There were still Apache raids that happened almost two decades after her birth. I asked her, "Has life changed between then and now? Are people different?" "Oh yes!" she exclaimed. I asked how, and she said, "Well, women can vote. Women are coming forward, and we'll even have a woman president, someday." She said she remembered when women got the right to vote, which was in 1920. She heard opponents of women's suffrage say that women would just follow their husband's vote, so giving women the right to vote was just giving their husband two votes. Goode said, "I told them that's not true, women can think for themselves!" I asked her if she had advice for young people today. She said that the secret to a long and happy life is eating healthy, working hard, being honest, and going to bed with no regrets. She thought of another piece of advice, and said, "Do what you want to do, don't put it off." As the time for our interview was coming to a close, I asked Goode what her plans are for the future. She laughed and said, "I'll just go with the flow." — Michael Smit covers education and water for the Daily Independent and pens the occasional “People of Ridgecrest” in his column The Legit Smit.

Angela J. Billings, 42, of Anamosa, pleaded guilty to theft concerning a program receiving federal funds in U.S. District Court. Billings, while working as city clerk for Delhi, “willfully embezzled, stole, intentionally misapplied and converted” for her personal use at least $75,000 in city funds from March 2007 through January 2015, the charging information shows. U.S. District Chief Magistrate C.J. Williams said Billings faces up to 10 years in federal prison and three years of supervised release following any prison time. She also could be fined $250,000 or more and will have to pay victim’s restitution of more than $96,000, according to a plea agreement. In December 2016, Auditor of the State Mary Mosiman conducted a special audit of the city, which found Billings spent the embezzled city funds for satellite television, weight loss supplements, calls to a psychic hotline and more than $69,000 in improper paychecks and expenses. Records show Billings used a city credit card to charge $88,160 of personal expenditures, received $63,226 in unauthorized pay and lowered her and her ex-husband’s utility bills by $6,748. The audit found she paid for a fraction of the personal expenses — $2,419 — with personal checks written to the city’s card company. After Billings resigned in 2015, a new city clerk was organizing records when she noticed payments to a credit card she didn’t know at the time belonged to the city. She also noticed utility billing discrepancies. Delhi Mayor Terry Harbach said last year after the audit was released that he had no “suspicions” at the time that Billings was diverting funds and giving herself extra paychecks. According to the report, Billings, who was the clerk from 2007 to 2015, made improper purchases on the city’s credit card of nearly $90,000 that included: — $16,264 at convenience stores. — $13,780 at Wal-Mart. — $7,998 at various retail stores. There were also charges for $1,798 in late fees, finance charges, electronic payment fees and over-limit fees. Mosiman said in her report that some of the charges on the credit card were for legitimate city business, but the majority were not. From March 2007 through June 14, 2008, the city clerk position was part time and Billings was expected to work only 24 hours per week, the audit report shows. Her position was then made full time by the city, changing it to a 40-hour workweek. Still, based on a review of the time sheets, 173 of the 189 payroll checks issued to her showed hours exceeding those authorized. The audit found $6,700 of unpaid and not billed utilities linked to her — including $4,719 in unpaid utility bills for her home and for her ex-husband’s business from March 1, 2007 through Dec. 30, 2014. Billings also faces theft charges filed in Delaware County District Court but those charges likely will be dismissed once she is sentenced on this federal conviction, court documents show.   Billings remains free on special conditions previously set pending sentencing. Sentencing will be set after the pre-sentencing report is completed. l Comments: (319) 398-8318; trish.mehaffey@thegazette.com Like what you're reading?

Easterly was freed Thursday on a $38,000 bond after turning himself in at the Marion County Jail. He's charged with conspiracy to commit theft, possession of a controlled substance for resale, conspiracy of possession of a Schedule III controlled substance, fraudulent receipt of food assistance, official misconduct, theft of property, coercion of a witness, tampering with or fabricating evidence, and possession of a firearm during the commission of attempt to commit a dangerous felony. The charges stem from a joint investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the Marion County Sheriff's Office over several months in 2016, according to a TBI statement issued late Thursday. Easterly faces arraignment in Marion County Criminal Court on June 23, officials said. The charges were handed down in a Marion County grand jury indictment on evidence presented by Hamilton County District Attorney General Neal Pinkston's office after 12th Judicial District Attorney General Mike Taylor's office stepped aside. Taylor's office has worked with the chief before on criminal cases since the Whitwell Police Department is within the 12th Judicial District's six-county jurisdiction. "I didn't think it was something we needed to be involved with," Taylor said Friday. Melydia Clewell, spokeswoman for Pinkston's office, said the case was originated by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and case records are sealed for now. "Right now, it's part of a pending case," Clewell said on Friday. Meanwhile, Easterly was placed on administrative leave without pay on Thursday as required by city policy "as soon as we were advised he had been indicted," Whitwell city manager Todd Mistrot said. Sgt. Kenneth Seagraves has become interim chief of the department, Mistrot said. The city manager, just two months on the job, declined to talk about his reaction to the charges. The indictments related to the criminal activities in 2016 give some details about some of the allegations, though the documents from Marion County Circuit Court had portions redacted. The indictment for conspiracy to commit theft of property over $1,000 states Easterly and a man named Jerry Jones had an agreement to engage in theft, and between Jan. 1 and April 28, 2016, the two men communicated about Jones obtaining items Easterly wanted. "Jones would enter retail stores throughout Tennessee and commit the offense of theft of property," records state. "Jerry Jones then would sell and distribute the stolen property to Easterly." In the indictment charging Easterly with official misconduct and theft of property, officials charge that Easterly took more than $1,000 worth of property from Walmart, Kmart, Lowe's, Kroger and other retailers and, as a police officer, received benefits not authorized by law. The indictment charging Easterly with conspiracy of possession of phendimetrazine for resale states Easterly had an agreement with a person whose name was redacted from the document that one or more of them would obtain a prescription for the drug that was filled in Alabama. Easterly was the source for the phendimetrazine, according to the indictment. The other person was not charged in the investigation. Phendimetrazine is a drug used with diet, exercise and behavior modification to lose weight and must be prescribed by a doctor, according to the WebMD website. Easterly also possessed phendimetrazine with intent to sell or deliver it, and did so while in possession of a firearm, according to the indictment charging him with possession of phendimetrazine for resale and possession of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. In the charges of coercion of a witness and tampering or fabricating evidence, the indictment states that Easterly tried to coerce a witness to give false testimony or withhold truthful information to elude the legal process. Easterly also altered, destroyed or concealed evidence in the investigation, documents state. The indictment on the charge of fraudulently obtaining food assistance did not contain any details but stated that Easterly was not eligible for the food assistance he got or attempted to get, documents state. Marion County Jail officials said no lawyer was listed for Easterly. Contact staff writer Ben Benton at bbenton@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6569.

We have talked with our residents and heard their interests and concerns. Overwhelmingly, there's a sentiment that this is in the best interest of La Posada in our efforts to position ourselves for the future," said Lisa Israel, La Posada CEO. "However, we also strongly believe that Green Valley has always been our home, and it is our intention, and our residents’ desire, to hold tight to these roots and relationships."  There are several advantages to annexation to Sahuarita including additional services like enhanced public safety, infrastructure maintenance, including roads, economic development assistance with marketing and branding, and streamlined development services.  La Posada residents will also be able to participate in Town boards, committees, and Council, and vote on initiatives.  Additionally La Posada is a not-for-profit health care facility, there would be no additional taxes incurred by the organization or residents as the Town does not have secondary property taxes.  "We look forward to welcoming La Posada into the Town. They are and have always been a valued partner for us. They are a key employer for many residents of the Town in addition to being a service provider for seniors that are ready to move into retirement or need a continuum of care. We are happy to facilitate this process," said Kelly Udall Town Manager for Sahuarita.  According to a news release, La Posada is only in the beginning phase of talks with the Town about the annexation process. According to Arizona State statute, the process for annexation has a number of requirements and timelines. Annexation could take effect as soon as 90 days after it is initiated by the parties. The Town Council would hold a public hearing and then vote on the annexation as one of the last steps.  The Town is experiencing a lot of growth, with a number of new commercial and residential developments, and more on the horizon. The Crossings at Nogales Highway across from the Wal-Mart plaza, and The Corner, at the NE corner of Rancho Sahuarita Blvd. and Sahuarita Blvd. across from Fry’s Marketplace, are currently being built. These commercial developments will offer an infusion of retail and restaurants and gas stations. Further, Sahuarita Unified School District recently passed a bond for a new K-8 school which will be built south of Rancho Sahuarita Blvd. and Sahuarita Blvd. Along with the school will be new sports fields jointly funded in a unique partnership between the Town and School District. There is a lot going on in Sahuarita which continues to put it on the regional map.  La Posada is a nationally accredited not-for-profit senior community that is celebrating its 30 years of service to the Green Valley/Sahuarita community. Its mission is to maximize the well-being of seniors although it touches the lives of many others.  MOBILE USERS: Download our app on your Apple and Android devices. Copyright 2017 Tucson News Now.

Whether companies are attempting to clear out existing channel or drive preorders for the upcoming lineup, some of them are giving their customers more incentive than usual to part with their money. Here are a few of the more notable promotions we already know of going into the show; it's expected that they will be joined by more offers once the E3 announcements start dropping with Electronic Arts' Saturday press briefing. While most of the deals are retailer-specific, Sony has packaged up a Days of Play promotion that will see a wide range of US retailers offer recent releases like Horizon: Zero Dawn and Nioh for $40 (33% off), while a new gold-colored PS4 system launches at the temporarily reduced price of $250 (17% off). (The Days of Play promotion is also running in Europe.) For those who prefer digital copies, the promotion will be reflected (and expanded upon) in the online PlayStation Store. On top of that, Sony is offering deals on its PlayStation Plus subscription service, and a promotion that will give $15 in PlayStation Store credit for those who spend at least $100 on content there between now and June 20 if they use a promotional code. Canadian gamers are also getting deeper-than-usual discounts on physical preorders from a variety of retailers. Walmart was offering a wide range of preorders on upcoming games like Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, Death Stranding, God of War, Call of Duty: WW2, Red Dead Redemption 2, Destiny 2, and Star Wars: Battlefront II for $50 (38% off) this morning, though some were soon changed to "out-of-stock." Amazon.ca reflected similar sales, with some omissions (Switch games) and alterations (Destiny 2 on PC was discounted, but not the console versions).

Analyst Kelly Bania reiterated a Market Perform rating and $32 price target on Kroger Friday, writing that there's the potential for less deflation sequentially and earnings per share upside, driven by retail fuel margins. That said, she thinks investors should be looking to gross margin for the best insight. From her note: [C]ontrary to most quarters, which tend to be focused on comps, we believe just as important of a metric this quarter will be KR's ex-fuel GM% performance. We forecast -25bps (similar to the -22bps in F4Q17), yet given a continued challenging environment plagued by: 1) negative comps from many other large traditional supermarkets; 2) outperformance from industry market-share leader Wal-Mart (WMT) (1Q grocery comps +LSD%); 3) significant investments in margin by large retailers across the broader landscape; 4) comments from SFM on near-term transitory GM% pressures (from difficulty in immediately passing along higher prices); and 5) signs of KR's slowing market share gains (F4Q17 was the first quarter in which KR comps underperformed our ex-Northeast IRI index). We revise our deflation forecast to (1.0%) from (1.3%) prior and see potential for less deflation, which supports modestly better comps (possibly closer to flat), particularly given KR's late 1Q (ended May 20th) when deflation, particularly in produce, appeared to moderate more meaningfully. Kroger shares are down more than 10% this year, but are up 1.8% in recent trading to $30.74. Wells Fargo had a more bullish take on Kroger last month, calling it the best idea in food retail.

Q&A: What leaving the Paris climate deal means for businesses The Associated Press Jun 11, 2017 Updated 7 hrs ago (…) Buy Now Andrew Harnik In this June 1, 2017 photo, President Donald Trump shakes hands with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt after speaking about the U.S. role in the Paris climate change accord in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington. The impact of President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement will differ for companies depending on what they produce and whether they have sales overseas. Formally, it may take more than three years for the U.S. to exit, but Trump said last week that his administration will stop all work on the accord immediately. A look at some key questions about the accord and Trump’s decision. * * * Q: Did the accord set rules for businesses? A: No, the agreement let governments decide how to meet their national emissions-reduction promises. Q: Did we know which industries would have been affected most? A: Actions of the Obama administration drew a map. Obama-era regulations such as the Clean Power Plan targeted reductions from coal and methane leakage from natural gas drilling. It reiterated tough fuel-efficiency standards for automakers. A study cited by Trump during his Rose Garden announcement predicted that the biggest decline in production would have been in the cement, coal and steel industries, with oil and gas also losing out. Critics dismissed many numbers in the study, which was commissioned by longtime opponents of environmental regulation, but the list of target industries was probably accurate. Q: Will withdrawing prove a boon for energy companies? A: Leaving Paris, along with Trump’s other moves to roll back regulations on oil and gas producers, could spur drilling. But if that leads to lower prices by extending the glut of crude, any gain might be temporary. Jason Bordoff, an energy expert at Columbia University, said production “will be determined far more by market conditions, like the price of oil and gas, than by scrapping the Obama-era environmental regulations.” Q: Why do big oil companies want the U.S. to stay in the accord? A: Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell said they favored a predictable structure like the Paris agreement for regulating emissions. David Cherney, an energy expert at PA Consulting Group, said they also feared a backlash — carbon tariffs or consumer boycotts — in countries that are sticking with the accord. The big oil companies sell natural gas — Exxon is the biggest gas producer in the U.S. — which could benefit if the Paris accord further curtails production of coal, a rival fuel for generating electricity. Q: Will renewable energy be hurt by Trump’s decision? A: Renewables are small but growing percentage of the U.S. energy mix. The energy department predicts that nearly two-thirds of new power-generation capacity added this year will come from solar and wind. Renewables are now often competitive on price with fossil fuels. Critics say Trump’s move will cost the U.S. a chance to lead the world in developing clean technology. “The U.S. is not going to benefit from this as much as it could,” said Christine Lins of REN21, a nonprofit that promotes renewable energy. But others believe that states will pick up the slack, and renewables will be fine. Q: Will Trump fulfill his campaign pledge to bring back coal jobs? A: Robert Murray, the CEO of coal producer Murray Energy, said that by withdrawing, Trump was “saving coal jobs, and promoting low-cost, reliable electricity for Americans and the rest of the world.” By reducing regulations on coal, Trump will help the industry, but the effect will be muted because his deregulation agenda is also likely to boost production of natural gas. “To the extent that more natural gas comes out of the ground because of Trump policies, it’s not good news for coal,” said Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners. Coal’s biggest problem, however, is the fracking revolution that has made natural gas abundant and cheap. Leaving the Paris accord and killing the Clean Power Plan won’t change that, said James Van Nostrand, who directs an energy center at West Virginia University. Q: Lots of corporate CEOs endorsed the accord; were any business sectors scared? A: Although some of America’s best-known big companies supported the Paris deal, many small-business owners worried about the potential for higher energy bills and costly new environmental regulations. They cheered Trump’s decision. Small businesses in the clean energy sector say they expect demand for their services to keep growing. Q: Will companies keep their old promises to limit carbon emissions? A: Most say they will. Walmart, which launched a program in April to remove one gigaton of emissions from its supply chain by 2030, said after Trump’s announcement that its own commitment to renewable energy and lower emissions was good for business and the environment. Citibank, which had urged Trump to keep the U.S. in the accord, said Friday that it would “remain very focused on our own efforts to protect the environment,” including its commitment to finance $100 billion in clean energy, infrastructure and technology projects. Q: Couldn’t the next president just recommit the U.S. to the agreement? A: Yes, and that possibility is a strong reason for companies not to react hastily to Trump’s decision. Companies weighing investments that will last two or three decades will have to consider whether Trump — and presidential opposition to the Paris agreement— will be gone in January 2021.

He prodded Cook to manufacture his iPhones and other gear at home rather than outsource them to China. “One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants,” Trump said he told Cook. That sums up the economic vision of the Trump administration. The president and his advisers are convinced more factories can cure the trade deficits, lackluster growth, and (supposed) joblessness plaguing the U.S. economy. Trump has vowed to lure back plants that departed for cheaper locales such as China or Mexico and sanction companies that dare to leave. The result, he claims, will be investments that revitalize down-on-their-luck communities and American economic vitality. “We will bring back our jobs,” he pledged in his inauguration speech. “We will bring back our dreams.” The president, though, is plain wrong. Factories won’t restore the American dream. That’s because they don’t contribute as much to the economy as they once did, despite all the fuss politicians make over them. Chasing them with pro-factory policies will not only fail to bring the benefits Trump has promised but could also hurt the very middle-class families they’re designed to help. A die-hard conviction remains among many Americans that the more an economy manufactures, the stronger it is. Some workers feel that making steel or cars is more respectable than stacking shelves at a Gap, and the Trump administration readily agrees. Calling steel “critical to both our economy and our military,” the president signed an executive order in late April that in all likelihood will lead to curbs on imports to protect U.S. mills. Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s key economic advisers, argues that bringing factories back from foreign countries will shore up the nation’s growth and security. “One of the goals of the Trump administration is to reclaim all of the supply-chain and manufacturing capability that would otherwise exist if the playing field were level,” he recently said. This strategy is based on flawed thinking. Manufacturing is certainly not as important to the U.S. economy as it once was, declining to less than 12 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 from 26 percent 50 years earlier. But the whole idea that “we don’t make anything,” as Trump himself has put it, is a fallacy. The U.S. remains a production powerhouse, accounting for almost 19 percent of global manufacturing, behind China’s 25 percent but bigger than Germany’s and Japan’s shares combined. U.S. manufacturers are still extremely competitive in high-tech and hard-to-duplicate products—think Boeing Co. aircraft. And even as some factory work has moved abroad, the U.S. economy remains remarkably strong. Home to many of the world’s most important and innovative companies, from Facebook Inc. to Tesla Inc., the U.S. boasts an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, less than half the euro-area level. What Trump fails to appreciate is that the true value in making something is no longer in making it. Companies figured out long ago that they can capture most of the value of a product by focusing on its design and research and development, its branding, and the services that support it after it’s been sold. Stan Shih, the founder of Taiwan’s Acer Inc., illuminated this phenomenon in the early 1990s with his “smile curve.” The middle of the smile—the lowest point of value—is where the fabrication takes place; the highest value is found at the corners—the R&D at the beginning and the customer service at the end.© AP Photo/Evan Vucci   Manufacturing is at the lowest point on a curve that plots where companies profit most That simply reflects supply and demand. The talent necessary to conceive, brand, and market a new product is much scarcer than the skills to manufacture it. The integration of giant emerging economies such as China and India into global supply chains increased the number of available hands to screw or sew things together, dropping the cost of making a product even further. There’s “a lot of supply for the actual manufacturing, but not a lot of supply for creating the next Google or Apple,” says Ann Harrison, management professor at the Wharton School and co-editor of the book The Factory-Free Economy. That disparity shows clearly in the apple of Trump’s eye: the iPhone. In a 2010 study, the Asian Development Bank Institute pulled apart an iPhone and figured that the process of assembling it in China accounted for 3.6 percent of its production cost. The remaining 96.4 percent was paid to the parts suppliers, and Apple, as the creator, claimed the big profits. Net income at Apple, which does almost no manufacturing, was an impressive 21 percent of revenue in its last fiscal year, and its shares trade at 18 times earnings. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the companies to which Apple outsources its manufacturing, recorded net profit of 3.5 percent of sales; investors value its shares at 12 times earnings. Apple also creates lots of jobs without big factories: It directly employs 80,000 people in the U.S. and plans to add thousands more. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans Based on Cook’s reaction to Trump’s nagging, he fully understands where the real profits lie. Although Cook in early May made a surprise announcement that Apple was earmarking $1 billion to invest in advanced manufacturing, the savvy CEO never said his company would build and operate factories itself. (Apple’s first investment was $200 million into Corning Inc., a supplier that makes the glass for iPhones.) Of course, more factories mean more jobs, and more jobs are always good. Studies show that workers who lose their job when a plant closes take a long-term hit to their standard of living. Unfortunately, the 21st century factory won’t create the jobs that yesterday’s did. With advancing technology in robotics and automation, a modern plant can churn out a lot more stuff with fewer workers. That’s why U.S. manufacturing output continues to swell while employment in the sector has withered. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans. There are some measures he can take to woo factories home. A corporate tax cut, for instance, might make the U.S. more attractive to some manufacturers. But to entice supply chains back en masse from China and Mexico, where it’s cheaper and more efficient to make certain things, he’d have to intervene in market forces to overturn those cost advantages—for example, by imposing taxes and tariffs on imports lofty enough to render manufacturing outside the U.S. much more expensive, as he’s already threatened to do. But whenever government tries to outmuscle the market, the result is almost always extra costs that have to be borne by the greater economy. A border tax being contemplated in a Republican tax plan could hurt shareholders, by decreasing corporate profitability and share valuations, and consumers, by hiking prices at their local Walmart or Target. That suppresses consumption, which is bad for growth and jobs. A major effort by the administration to force factories home could destroy lots of other jobs. Raising the price of imports would likely decimate the already struggling retail industry, which supports 1 of 4 American jobs, with slower sales and slimmer profits—almost certainly causing store closings and layoffs. By obsessing over factory jobs that no longer exist, Trump may cost Americans the jobs of the future. The logic of the “smile curve” suggests he should focus on developing and supporting the parts of the manufacturing process that hold the real value—in other words, fostering more Apples. That would entail upgrading the skills of the U.S. workforce by devoting more resources to education and reducing the financial burden of a college degree, while encouraging foreign talent to start their next big ventures in Silicon Valley, not Shanghai. Rather than restricting trade, Trump should press for an even freer global exchange of goods and services so U.S. corporations can best organize their operations to maximize profits. Unfortunately, he and his team aren’t headed in that direction. Describing his talk with Cook, Trump called an Apple factory in America a “real achievement for me”—not Apple, the American worker, or the economy. By rallying political support, his obsession with factories may be good for him, but it isn’t necessarily great for the rest of us.

The company has submitted a request to the city for package-liquor sales in the former Staples space at the west end of the Wabash Avenue shopping center. Plaza owner Seritage Growth Properties, based in New York, also plans to renovate and expand the adjacent former Kmart building and add two standalone retail spaces on Kmart outlet property. Email and phone messages left with Binny's were not returned last week, but an initial hearing on company plans is scheduled for June 21 before the city Planning and Zoning Commission. Binny's is marketed as a "wine, spirits, beer and cigar superstore." The family owned company, founded in 1948, has more than 30 locations in the Chicago market, according to the Binny's website, Binnys.com. There also are locations in Bloomington and Champaign. There are no plans for drive-up sales at the Wabash Avenue location, according to the zoning request filed with the city. Other names have been floated as part of the Sherwood Plaza and Kmart work, including Burlington Coat Factory and Outback Steakhouse, though neither company has confirmed plans. The Kmart on Wabash Avenue closed in December after four decades at the location. Staples closed in February after 22 years. The planning commission meets at 6 p.m. June 21 in the city council chamber of Municipal Center West. *** The proposed downtown BICENTENNIAL PLAZA is also scheduled for an initial hearing at the June 21 zoning commission meeting. Illinois Realtors plan to construct the park-plaza on property between Fourth and Fifth streets north of the association headquarters, 522. S. Fifth St. The Springfield City Council approved $1 million from a tax increment financing district in March toward the $2.5 million cost. The association goal is to complete the plaza in time for the August 2018 bicentennial of Illinois statehood. *** MICHELLE OWNBEY has been promoted to publisher of the Illinois Times weekly newspaper in Springfield. Editor and CEO Fletcher Farrar announced the promotion last week. Ownbey most recently was associate publisher of the Springfield Business Journal, acquired by Illinois Times in 2014. Ownbey also worked in commercial real estate. She is a member of the Springfield Economic Development Commission, president of the Enos Park Neighborhood Improvement Association and a commissioner on the Mid-Illinois Medical District Board. *** The city of Springfield is officially ready to accept a $14 million, federal grant for the next phase of rail-consolidation construction. An ordinance approved by aldermen is a technicality required by the Federal Railroad Administration for release of the funding expected in the next few weeks. The funds would go toward the cost of underpass construction at Ash and Laurel streets on the 10th Street rail line. The city's long-term goal is to move Union Pacific and Amtrak trains from the Third Street rail line to the Norfolk Southern corridor on 10th Street. *** The Springfield AMTRAK STATION is scheduled for improvements this summer, including making the station more accessible to people with disabilities and parking lot work, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation. Springfield is among the last of the station improvements between St. Louis and Chicago through the federal high-speed rail program. A new station in downtown Pontiac opened Tuesday. *** Live music and more than 50 artists are planned for a Market Days event 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday through Saturday at THE GABLES shops and restaurants on West White Oaks Drive in Springfield. Artists include handmade jewelry, woven textiles, woodworking and painting. The website is www.thegablesofspringfield.com. *** The SCHUYLER COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS could vote Monday on whether to support or oppose a controversial commercial hog farm proposed near Littleton, approximately 60 miles northwest of Springfield. A group of landowners are fighting the proposal from Carthage-based Olive Branch LLC. The issue is on the county board agenda for Monday, according to the Schuyler County Clerk and Recorder Mindy Garrett. Board votes are advisory. The final decision is up to the Illinois Department of Agriculture. *** VERIZON WIRELESS has filed plans at city Building and Zoning for a store at 3804 Octavus Via.
