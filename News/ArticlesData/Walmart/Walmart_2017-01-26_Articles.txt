Wal-Mart Stores is speeding up the time it takes new employees to complete a training program that allows them to boost their pay. The change was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and was confirmed by the retailer. Two years ago, Wal-Mart raised its minimum wage for store employees to $9 an hour. Then last year, it unveiled a six-month training program for new employees. Once workers complete the program, called Pathways, their salary is bumped up to $10 an hour. After reviewing feedback to the program since its launch, the company will now shorten its length to 90 days. Wal-Mart spokesman Blake Jackson said the company found its associates were able to get through the material of the course — which includes skills tied to a worker's role at the store as well as merchandising, basic economics and "soft" skills — quicker than expected. Jackson told CNBC that the program has helped improve Walmart's customer service. Pathways was one element of a $2.7 billion investment Wal-Mart announced in 2015 to improve its training process and boost worker pay. Critics of the program told CNBC earlier this year that they felt the six-month training program was longer than it needed to be. Wal-Mart is sticking with the annual raise system it put in place last year. This year, workers who were hired on or before Oct. 31, 2016, will get a 2 percent raise on Feb. 18. Just over half of Wal-Mart's store workers are full-time and an average salary is $13.69 per hour, or about $25,000 a year. Read the full story in The Wall Street Journal here.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2017) A clown sits inside a bus seen in front of a Wal-Mart store in Mexico City January 11, 2013. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2017) Previous Next SAN FRANCISCO –  Shares of U.S. supermarket operators fell on Friday as President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of Mexico, which is a major supplier of produce and other foods for U.S. consumers. Continue Reading Below A day after the White House suggested that the United States could impose a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico, shares of Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger Co fell more than 1 percent, while Whole Foods Market dropped 2.8 percent. Trump on Friday repeated statements that Mexico, a major exporter of vegetables, fruits and beer, has taken advantage of the United States. Mexico, he said, "beat us to a pulp," deepening worries about a crisis between the two trading partners. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned trip to Washington to meet Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border to halt illegal immigration. The White House later said the potential 20 percent tax could be used to pay for the wall. Mexico was the second-largest supplier of agricultural exports to the United States in 2015, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, or USTR. Mexican agricultural exports to the United States in 2015 totaled about $21.6 billion, up 191 percent from 1993, before the two countries and Canada cemented the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the USTR. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Less than 1 percent of Hass avocados - the main ingredient in guacamole - sold in the United States so far in 2017 were domestically grown, with 93 percent arriving from Mexico, according to the Hass Avocado Board. The United States consumes nearly all of its own tomatoes, exporting just 6 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of the tomatoes the United States imports, Mexico accounts for 71 percent, with Canada supplying most of the rest. A new tax on food imported from Mexico would leave supermarkets with the difficult choices of raising prices, sacrificing already low profitability, or a mixture of the two. U.S. grocers deal with a higher-than-average cost of goods sold than most other industries, resulting in razor-thin margins. Through 2015, the six-year average cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for U.S. grocers was 73.4 percent versus around 56 percent for all U.S. industries, according to Plunkett Research. Shares Kroger and Wal-Mart are down about 3 percent from before Trump's inauguration a week ago while food distributor Sysco has lost about 1.5 percent.

Walmart Is Selling Its Own “Craft” Beer — Not That You’d Know It Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Is Selling Its Own “Craft” Beer — Not That You’d Know It January 27, 2017 3:44 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk beer goggles beer craft beer walmart Trouble Brewing retail Is that craft beer in your grocery cart really brewed by a small, independent brewery, or does it come from the same commercial vats as other non-craft beverages? It can be hard to tell, especially now that big name retailers like Walmart are selling their own private label “craft” brands. Complete with quirky names like Cat’s Away IPA, After Party Pale Ale, and Pack of Trouble, Walmart teamed up with a company called Trouble Brewing to create its own line of craft brews, which it started selling in early 2016, the Washington Post reports. You might not have noticed, however, as nowhere on the packaging is there any indication that Walmart is behind the cheaply priced brews. That’s par for the course, Walmart says, as it doesn’t put its name on any of its private label brands. There is no intention to deceive customers, the company says. “We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you’d expect of craft beer,” Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart’s adult beverage team, tells WaPo. But as WaPo points out, there is no American brewery called Trouble Brewing: the applicant listed on filings with theTreasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is “Winery Exchange, Inc.,” which has since become WX Brands, a company that “develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world,” according to its website. Then, under “brewery address,” the TTB filings list the address of Genesee Brewing’s business office in Rochester, NY. As anyone who has ever shotgunned a Genesee Cream Ale at a college party knows, it is doesn’t have much of a craft reputation. Beyond that, according to the national Brewers Association, a craft brewery is defined as small (annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less); independent (less than 25% of the brewery is owned or controlled by an alcoholic beverage industry member that is not itself a craft brewer); and traditional (“a brewer that has a majority of its total beverage alcohol volume in beers whose flavor derives from traditional or innovative brewing ingredients and their fermentation”). Genesee is owned by a company called Florida Ice and Farm, which brews a Costa Rican lager and other industrial brands. Walmart isn’t alone in obscuring where a craft beer actually comes from: WaPo points out that Costco’s Kirkland Signature Handcrafted Beer is purportedly made at either New York Brewer in New York, or Hopfen und Malz in San Jose, TX. However, TTB filings show they’re brewed at F.X. Matt (the home of Saranac) and Gordon Biersch, respectively. In the end, you’ll likely get what you pay for: though these private label brands go for as much as $5 less than other craft brands, a team of WaPo staffers weighed in on one Trouble Brewing beverage, calling it “flabby,” and “good for flip cup.” Another was described as, “bland nothingness” and “lacking an identifiable taste.” Last year, a federal court threw out a lawsuit against MillerCoors for allegedly misleading consumers about the “craft” nature of its Blue Moon beers. The plaintiffs in that case had argued that the beer giant had deliberately distanced itself from the Blue Moon brand in order to sell the beer for a higher price.

January 27, 2017 // Franchising.com // TULSA, Okla. – Tulsa-based fast casual BBQ franchise Billy Sims BBQ is continuing rapid expansion across central Oklahoma with its newest opening January 20, in Norman, OK by 7-year Billy Sims franchisee veteran and businessman, Trent Crow. The restaurant is located at Crimson Center 2627 N. Classen Blvd. Suite 104 Norman, OK 73071, the busting east side of University of Oklahoma’s home town and next to Slim Chickens. The grand opening will be held Feb. 3-4, with appearances by Billy Sims BBQ co-founder, and former Detroit Lions and Heisman Trophy winner on Feb. 3, from 3 to 7 p.m. and Feb. 4, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Appearing with Billy Sims on Feb. 4, will be his former team mates from the Detroit Lions Thomas Lott, Victor Hicks and Joe Washington. Crow, along with his wife, Nancy, currently owns and operates three other Billy Sims BBQ units throughout Oklahoma – one in Owasso near Tulsa, one in Midwest City near the Tinker Air Force Base and one in Moore, off the Oklahoma City’s northwest expressway. A former Marketing Manager for Walmart, Crow helped to get Billy Sims BBQ sauce in 145 Walmart stores, where it quickly became the second-best selling BBQ sauce in Walmart stores across the state. After this introduction to the brand and upon retirement, Crow decided to explore business opportunities with the award-winning franchise. “We love the quality of life as franchisees as well as creating jobs in our community, but we very specifically chose Billy Sims BBQ,” says Crow. “We were attracted to the highly structured-operations, great food and competitive pricing. Billy Sims’ name may get guests in the door, but the delicious barbeque keeps them coming back.” The Crows chose Norman for their newest venture due to both its rapid commercial and residential development growth as well as its close proximity to UOK’s Gaylord Stadium, where football legend and Billy Sims BBQ’s co-founder, Billy Sims, made his name in the 1970’s. “Trent and Nancy are among our most loyal and successful franchisees,” said Jeff Jackson, co-founder and CEO of Billy Sims BBQ. “Despite being Billy Sims BBQ’s smallest location, their Midwest City unit, which was a 90-day Quiznos conversion, boasts one of the largest revenues in our entire franchise system. I have zero doubt their Norman site selection will prove to be a smart move.” The Norman restaurant is of the brand’s newest prototype design, featuring updated color schemes and sleek design elements, a digital menu board digital and an outdoor seating patio. Named a Franchisee Satisfaction Award Winner for 2016 and 2015 by Franchise Business Review and a Future 50 fastest-growing small chain restaurant in 2015 by Restaurant Business, Billy Sims BBQ is consistently ranked highly by franchisees for its leadership, training and operations support, financial performance and general satisfaction.

Police say the suspect was seen cutting into packages and concealing the items in his clothing. When two CPD officers responded to the scene, the suspect turned his pistol on the officer in the garden area of the Walmart. The officer then shot at the suspect. The suspect was injured in his left arm and taken to the hospital and he is now released and in police custody. No officers were injured during the incident. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.  “We are not sure whether or not the injury to his left arm was caused from a projectile with the officer or if it was from his caused running into the things into the store while he was trying to get away,” said Police Chief Ricky Boren. “He has already been treated and released.” If the officer caused injury to the suspect from the shooting, the GBI will take over the investigation.  “It makes no sense, it’s getting outrageous, right in the daytime, it’s kids out, why must you?” said witness Kanijah Mike. “It’s ridiculous, that’s how I feel.” The suspect's name has not been released.  Just arrived on scene. Possible police officer involved shooting at Walmart on Victory Drive.

Related Stories Excitement grows in Orlando over sold out Pro Bowl Florida NAACP ponders role of charter schools Fear of alleged shooting plot keeps students home Governor allocates $15M for beach restoration TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (NSF) - A measure that would allow Floridians to mix vodka and veggies in their shopping carts --- something prohibited for more than eight decades --- sailed through a Senate committee on Thursday. The Regulated Industries Committee, in a 9-1 vote, backed the latest proposal (SB 106) to repeal a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." The measure could be a boon to some "big box" retailers. Meanwhile, lawmakers are looking to exclude some small gas stations and neighborhood convenience stores if the proposal becomes law. The proposal, which has failed to advance in past sessions, pits retailers Wal-Mart and Target, both in favor of the repeal, against Lakeland-based shopping giant Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits. Sen. Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville, said she doesn't see the proposed change causing small independent liquor stores to go out of business, as they would continue to attract "niche" customers. "It's a whole different demographic," Gibson said in voting for the proposal. "I go to (an) ABC (in Jacksonville). There is a Wal-Mart I can take the next exit to go to that has a (separate) liquor store there, but I go to that ABC because they have certain brands that I don't believe that a Wal-Mart will ever have." Sen. Keith Perry, a Gainesville Republican who cast the lone vote against the measure, said after the meeting he's open to revisions in the bill but for now has concerns about access to alcohol by minors. "I have teenage daughters, and I have a sophomore in college, and access now is pretty available, whether in bar or places," Perry said. "It's not the competitiveness that I'm concerned about. I think we should have less barriers for business." The proposal is intended by its sponsor, Miami Republican Anitere Flores, to give shoppers more convenience. The bill would allow hard spirits such as whiskey and rum to be sold alongside beer, wine and groceries in traditional supermarkets and other stores that sell groceries. The measure would also allow liquor stores to expand their grocery options. Jason Unger, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would "enable us to meet our customers' demands." Publix views stand-alone liquor stores directly adjacent to its regular stores as a business model. Scott Dick, a lobbyist for the Florida Independent Spirits Association, said the change would give the big-box operators an unfair competitive advantage over small liquor-store owners. "We operate under a level playing field today," Dick said. Charles Bailes, CEO of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, argued big-box stores have been able to compete under the existing law and that there hasn't been a public outcry for the repeal. He also said the change would make liquor more accessible for minors to steal. Bailes noted that earlier this month an 18-year-old was arrested on multiple charges after telling a Wal-Mart manager in The Villages that she drank five cans of beer from the beer aisle. "Big box retailers have difficulty controlling what goes on in their stores, especially those that are minimally staffed," Bailes said. The bill could see some revisions in the coming weeks. Several committee members suggested greater fines for businesses repeatedly found selling liquor to minors. Also, they pointed to a need to exclude small gas stations and convenience stores that now have licenses to sell beer and wine from obtaining liquor licenses. A legal definition related to excluding certain gas stations and convenience stores from obtaining liquor licenses is already being crafted but remains a tricky issue, Flores said. "7-Eleven bad, Wawa I don't know," Flores told the committee. "I'm open to suggestions." Flores added that she'd be willing to consider adding higher fines for stores and people found repeatedly selling liquor to minors as suggested by Committee Chairman Travis Hutson, R-Elkton, and supported by some opponents of the repeal. The committee's support Thursday indicated that the proposal could have a better chance than past versions of the bill that failed to advance through the committee process in the House and Senate. The 2017 legislative session starts March 7. Rep. Bryan Avila, a Hialeah Republican who is sponsoring the House version of the bill (HB 81), said on Wednesday that consumers should be allowed to decide what they prefer. "Government's role is not to determine who wins and who loses in the market," Avila said. "I think consumers should be the one to determine whether a particular business or company is successful."   Information provided by The News Service of Florida.    false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent Excitement grows in Orlando over sold out Pro Bowl Florida NAACP ponders role of charter schools Marijuana candy production found in Pasco Co.

William Avery, who runs the Hudson Police Department’s operations bureau, is still in amazement at the complexity of a scam Jan. 25 that tricked a couple into wiring thousands of dollars to Puerto Rico via Western Union under the guise that their significant other had been kidnapped and held for ransom. “I have 24 years of service with the town of Hudson, and I have never in my career seen a more sophisticated scam,” Avery said. The scammers, he said, managed to tie up both individual’s phone lines so that they couldn’t reach each other, and somehow made it so that both victims could hear the other’s voice on the phone. Moreover, at the same time, Hudson police received a call saying that two individuals were in the parking lot of Wal-Mart on Lowell Road, armed with AK-47 rifles, and were prepared to rob the store. This Wal-Mart was the same location where the female victim transferred the money to Puerto Rico. The robbery call was likely a distraction, Avery said. In order to know the location of the victim, he said, the scammers likely tracked her phone via GPS. While responding to the call, Hudson officers learned that Merrimack police were dealing with the same incident. In need of additional resources, Hudson police contacted the Nashua Police Department, which sent patrol officers to respond to Wal-Mart; Litchfield police resources were also used to patrol the northern part of the town. Merrimack Police Capt. Denise Roy said scams have become especially creative and difficult to detect as technology has improved “A frequent scam we see is when people call elderly folks in town and say their loved ones have been arrested and that they need bail money,” she said on Wednesday. HPD shared some common traits of this type of incident: n Calls are usually made from an outside area code, but often will “spoof” caller ID to appear to come from a known or local number. It may involve multiple phone calls. n Callers go to great lengths to keep you on the phone. They will also try prevent the victim from calling or locating the “kidnapped” victim. n Ransom money is only accepted via wire or online transfer. Additionally, they provided some tips to get through such a call: - Stay calm and try to slow the situation down. Avoid sharing information about yourself or your family during the call. - Request the kidnapped victim call back from his or her cell phone or ask to speak to the victim directly. Ask, “How do I know my loved one is OK?” - Listen carefully to the voice of the kidnapped victim if they speak and ask questions only they would know. If they don’t let you speak to the victim, ask them to describe the victim, what they are wearing: Jewelry or other small personal details only someone with them could know; or describe the vehicle they drive, if applicable. - While staying on the line, try to call the the victim from another phone, or through social media. Don’t directly challenge or argue with the caller, contact local law enforcement through 911, or contact the FBI. Derek Edry can be reached at 594-1243, dedry@nashuatelegraph.com or @Telegraph_Derek.

The retailer will abbreviate a training program that new employees must complete to earn $10 per hour. The six-month program introduced last year will now take three months to complete, said company executives. Wal-Mart WMT, -1.60%   will stick with an annual raise system it first implemented last year, in which most store employees get their raise on a single day. That changes a longtime practice of linking store employees’ annual raises to performance, doling them out on each employee’s hire-date anniversary. This year employees hired on or before Oct. 31, 2016 will get a 2% raise on Feb. 18th.  Longtime workers who make the most their job title allows get a onetime lump sum of 2% of their annual pay, as they did last year. Wal-Mart says its average salary is $13.69 per hour, or about $25,000 a year for a full-time employee, a pool the company says makes up just over half of its store workers.

Scot Gregor | Staff Photographer   Scot Gregor Follow @scotgregor     He comes from Daingerfield, and everybody in the tiny East Texas town knows hard-throwing pitching prospect Michael Kopech. "I can walk through a Wal-Mart and say hi to everybody in Wal-Mart and that's that," Kopech said. After landing early Thursday and easing into SoxFest weekend, Kopech started walking through Chicago, his new home as a professional baseball player. Given his rocket arm and bright future, the 20-year-old starting pitcher could soon be a familiar face on the South Side and throughout the city. One of four minor-leaguers acquired from the Boston Red Sox in a December trade for ace starter Chris Sale, Kopech already has made a name for himself by hitting 105 mph on the radar gun while pitching for high Class A Salem last season and registering 110 mph in a throwing drill earlier this month. "It's kind of surreal to have this much attention on me, because a small town out of Texas is where I grew up," Kopech said. "All of this has been surreal, but I'm extremely excited about it." The White Sox are excited about having the 6-foot-3, 205-pounder in their system. "That dude slings it, huh?" said Zack Burdi, another Sox pitching prospect who regularly throws 100-mph fastballs. "I watched some video of him; it's really impressive. The guy, the way the ball jumps out his hand, everything is electric. The changeup's even electric. It's really cool, and I'm excited to see him live at some point this year." Burdi, a Downers Grove native drafted No. 26 overall by the White Sox last June, is expected to be in the major leagues at some point this season. As for Kopech, he still needs polish in the minors and might not be seen in Chicago until the 2018 season. "I throw hard and it's fun, but my main focus is pitching," said Kopech, rated as baseball's 30th best prospect by MLB.com. "I'm excited to get out there and throw strikes more than anything." In 2016, Kopech got into a fight with a teammate during spring training. He fractured his pitching (right) hand and missed the first two months of the season. Kopech pitched a combined 56⅓ innings with Salem and low A Lowell and had 86 strikeouts. He also walked 33. "There's not too many negatives to having a great arm," Kopech said. "Not to pat myself on the back, but I have a pretty good arm. One of those things is learning how to throw strikes, so that's my main focus right now. I have the velocity behind that, so that's good." At the end of last season, Kopech was very good in the Arizona Fall League, going 3-0 with a 2.01 ERA in 6 starts. He had 26 strikeouts and 8 walks in 22⅓ innings for the Surprise Saguaros. Kopech is likely to spend the bulk of the upcoming season with Class AA Birmingham, but he figures prominently in the White Sox's future. He received an invite to the Sox's major-league, spring-training camp, which opens Feb. 14. "They've been talking about the rebuilding stage, or whatever you want to call it, and I'm glad to be a part of that," Kopech said. "I think it's a good opportunity for me and I think it's great for the team. I'm very excited about it." Get articles sent to your inbox.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Town of Apple Valley, Wal-Mart file petition for rehearing Thursday Jan 26, 2017 at 5:29 PM Jan 26, 2017 at 5:42 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Attorneys for the town and Wal-Mart have filed a petition for a rehearing on a legal matter that has, thus far, thwarted future construction of a Supercenter here. The Jan. 20 filing came nine days after Town Manager Frank Robinson said the Town Council would “consider all of its options” related to a ruling in the 4th District Court of Appeal that the Council violated the Brown Act in 2013 by approving an agreement with Wal-Mart that was not agendized. The now-illegal agreement allowed the town to accept an offer from Wal-Mart to fund a special election for Measure D, known locally as the “Walmart Initiative Measure.” Voters passed the measure in November 2013, but the ruling nullified and voided Measure D. On Wednesday, the town and Wal-Mart issued a joint statement to the Daily Press in which the two parties said the petition was filed with the appellate court to “address a misunderstanding of the facts about the trial court’s decision.” Specifically, the statement read, "the trial court found that the Town did not violate the Brown Act in approving the Resolutions setting the Special Election, and we believe it is important for the Court of Appeal to understand that fact correctly in making its decision.” The statement’s sentiment is similar to comments Robinson previously gave the Daily Press. Following a review of the appellate court’s decision, Robinson said the town was “obviously disappointed in the Brown Act decision, especially as it was premised on some incorrect facts.” The “incorrect facts,” according to Robinson, relate to the trial court finding that the Council’s decision to send the initiatives to voters did not violate the Brown Act. A review of court documents shows that both the trial and appellate courts did find, however, that the Council did violate the Brown Act in approving the agreement with Wal-Mart, which, in turn, made the voter-approved initiative illegal. San Diego-based attorney Cory Briggs, who represents Apple Valley resident Gabriel Hernandez — the plaintiff in the case — previously said while he wasn’t sure, he believed the amount Wal-Mart paid to the town for the special election was approximately $250,000. On Thursday, Briggs told the Daily Press he was aware of the petition’s filing, but he added he had not yet seen it. Briggs, however, did offer a response to the joint statement and the “incorrect facts” comments lodged by Robinson. “This court spent a lot of time on the case,” he said, “and didn't get the facts wrong.” San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge David Cohn first ruled against the town and Wal-Mart on the matter in February 2015. The two parties later filed their appeal in the 4th District in June of that year, insisting the trial court “erred by looking outside the Initiative to the ballot materials to 'identify' Walmart as the beneficiary of the Initiative.” The appellate court’s ruling, which also reversed Cohn’s decision that the initiative violated the California Constitution, came on Jan. 5, and it is unknown when the petition will be taken under review.

Police say the suspect was seen cutting into packages and concealing the items in his clothing. When two CPD officers responded to the scene, the suspect turned his pistol on the officer in the garden area of the Walmart. The officer then shot at the suspect. The suspect was injured in his left arm and taken to the hospital and he is now released and in police custody. No officers were injured during the incident. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.  “We are not sure whether or not the injury to his left arm was caused from a projectile with the officer or if it was from his caused running into the things into the store while he was trying to get away,” said Police Chief Ricky Boren. “He has already been treated and released.” If the officer caused injury to the suspect from the shooting, the GBI will take over the investigation.  “It makes no sense, it’s getting outrageous, right in the daytime, it’s kids out, why must you?” said witness Kanijah Mike. “It’s ridiculous, that’s how I feel.” The suspect's name has not been released.  Just arrived on scene. Possible police officer involved shooting at Walmart on Victory Drive.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 26, 2017January 26, 2017 by Press Release Walmart Donates $50,000 To Gleaners Community Food Bank Detroit, MI (1888PressRelease) January 26, 2017 – Gleaners utilized the funds to purchase a refrigerated truck and walk-in freezer that will support the Monroe County Opportunity Program (MCOP). With the grant-funded resources, Gleaners expects to increase retail donations in Monroe County from approximately 60,000 lbs. of food per year to 200,000 lbs. per year. “We are extremely grateful to Walmart and Feeding America for making the donation of this refrigerated truck and walk-in freezer possible. These additions will provide MCOP with greater capacity for retail donations of fresh produce, frozen meat and other healthy foods throughout the year, benefitting our many hungry neighbors in Monroe County,” said Gleaners Chief Operating Officer, Julie Beamer. According to a 2015 study from Feeding America, the food insecurity rate within Monroe County is 12.8 percent with more than 19,000 food insecure individuals. MCOP is a Partner Distribution Organization (PDO) of Gleaners that serves the majority of food distribution programs in Monroe County and aims to improve access to nutrition in rural areas. Gleaners is focused on strengthening and expanding their most effective programs with a goal of increasing economic impact to households by 20 percent. “Through this wonderful donation, MCOP will be able to increase access to food for our most vulnerable residents in the community,” says MCOP Executive Director Stephanie Kasprzak. “Our work with Gleaners and Walmart continues to expand our capacity to feed more people and we are extremely grateful. Gleaners’ mission aligns directly with the Walmart Foundation’s sustainability initiatives around reducing food waste across the supply chain and diverting underutilized food into the charitable food system. Walmart’s main goal for the grant is to help Gleaners advance their retail donation program by providing assets that support growth. • Photo Album: https://goo.gl/photos/ozyrytWqrb6FMqHe9 About Gleaners Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan For 40 years, Gleaners Community Food Bank has been “feeding hungry people and nourishing our communities.” Last year, Gleaners distributed more than 38 million pounds of emergency food to over 534 partner schools, soup kitchens, shelters and pantries in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Livingston and Monroe counties. Of every dollar donated, Gleaners uses 94 cents for food and food programs. One dollar provides three meals for a hungry neighbor.

(AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File) (Toby Talbot / AP) Jim TurnerNews Service of Florida Should Wal-Mart and Target be allowed to sell booze? Florida lawmakers to decide Privacy Policy A measure that would allow Floridians to mix vodka and veggies in their shopping carts — something prohibited for more than eight decades — sailed through a Senate committee on Thursday. The Regulated Industries Committee, in a 9-1 vote, backed the latest proposal [SB 106] to repeal a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." The proposal is intended by its sponsor, Miami Republican Anitere Flores, to give shoppers more convenience. The bill would allow hard spirits such as whiskey and rum to be sold alongside beer, wine and groceries in traditional supermarkets and other stores that sell groceries. The measure would also allow liquor stores to expand their grocery options. The measure could be a boon to some "big box" retailers. Meanwhile, lawmakers are looking to exclude some small gas stations and neighborhood convenience stores if the proposal becomes law. The proposal, which has failed to advance in past sessions, pits retailers Wal-Mart and Target, both in favor of the repeal, against Lakeland-based shopping giant Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits.

Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville, said she doesn't see the proposed change causing small independent liquor stores to go out of business, as they would continue to attract "niche" customers. "It's a whole different demographic," Gibson said in voting for the proposal. "I go to [an] ABC (in Jacksonville). There is a Wal-Mart I can take the next exit to go to that has a (separate) liquor store there, but I go to that ABC because they have certain brands that I don't believe that a Wal-Mart will ever have." Sen. Keith Perry, a Gainesville Republican who cast the lone vote against the measure, said after the meeting he's open to revisions in the bill but for now has concerns about access to alcohol by minors. "I have teenage daughters, and I have a sophomore in college, and access now is pretty available, whether in bar or places," Perry said. "It's not the competitiveness that I'm concerned about. I think we should have less barriers for business." Jason Unger, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would "enable us to meet our customers' demands." Publix views stand-alone liquor stores directly adjacent to its regular stores as a business model. Scott Dick, a lobbyist for the Florida Independent Spirits Association, said the change would give the big-box operators an unfair competitive advantage over small liquor-store owners. "We operate under a level playing field today," Dick said. Charles Bailes, CEO of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, argued big-box stores have been able to compete under the existing law and that there hasn't been a public outcry for the repeal. He also said the change would make liquor more accessible for minors to steal. Bailes noted that earlier this month an 18-year-old was arrested on multiple charges after telling a Wal-Mart manager in The Villages that she drank five cans of beer from the beer aisle. "Big box retailers have difficulty controlling what goes on in their stores, especially those that are minimally staffed," Bailes said. The bill could see some revisions in the coming weeks. Several committee members suggested greater fines for businesses repeatedly found selling liquor to minors. Also, they pointed to a need to exclude small gas stations and convenience stores that now have licenses to sell beer and wine from obtaining liquor licenses. A legal definition related to excluding certain gas stations and convenience stores from obtaining liquor licenses is already being crafted but remains a tricky issue, Flores said. "7-Eleven bad, Wawa I don't know," Flores told the committee. "I'm open to suggestions." Flores added that she'd be willing to consider adding higher fines for stores and people found repeatedly selling liquor to minors as suggested by Committee Chairman Travis Hutson, R-Elkton, and supported by some opponents of the repeal. The committee's support Thursday indicated that the proposal could have a better chance than past versions of the bill that failed to advance through the committee process in the House and Senate. The 2017 legislative session starts March 7. Rep. Bryan Avila, a Hialeah Republican who is sponsoring the House version of the bill [HB 81], said on Wednesday that consumers should be allowed to decide what they prefer. "Government's role is not to determine who wins and who loses in the market," Avila said. "I think consumers should be the one to determine whether a particular business or company is successful."

New Delhi: Retail giant Walmart sees an increase in India's domestic consumption and retail growth over a period of time on the back of social security measures proposed in the Budget. The company, which has decided to focus only on wholesale business in India owing to several restrictions in the multi-brand retail segment, also feels that the Modi government's continued focus on 'Ease of Doing Business' will help the overall industry. "Provision to provide social security measures for the middle-class and the bottom of the pyramid will help improve consumer confidence and sentiment. "Over a period of time, the middle class will be able to live in the present without the worry of the future and this should drive domestic consumption and retail growth," Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer said in a statement. In the Budget 2015-16, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley proposed to work towards creating universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor. Measures proposed by the FM includes creation of senior citizen welfare fund, increase in limit in deduction of health insurance premium and an additional Rs 50,000 contribution to pension under 80CCD to be allowed. Commenting on doing business in India, Iyer said: "The government's continued focus on 'Ease of Doing Business' will help the industry tremendously. I am sure this move will also encourage State Governments to bring in similar provisions and help in driving investment-led growth." Earlier this year, Iyer had said that the government needs to work more on improving ease of doing business in the country as "the current perception is that it's not easy to do business here". Walmart had decided focus on cash and carry business and said it will open 50 wholesale stores in the next four to five years to expand its footprint in the country. Iyer also said that deferment of GAAR by two years, focus on ease of doing business and general long-term focus and expectations of double digit growth "will further renew the confidence of global investors in the country." He also termed Budget 2015-16 as 'reformist and growth oriented" and welcomed the proposed roadmap to reduction in corporate tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent over four years as well as removal of plethora of exemptions related to taxes which was causing complexity and litigation. "Looking holistically, the Budget presented by the Finance Minister is reformist and growth oriented. The measures outlined in the budget for giving boost to the investment in infrastructure will surely benefit the economy and the retail sector in the medium to long term," he added. domestic consumption retail growth union budget 2015 Walmart Recommended For You MS Dhoni and Anil Kumble Deep in Conversation Ahead of Second T20 Sonam Kapoor Pulls Off A Denim Sari Like No One Else Bigg Boss 10: Bani, Manveer, Manu, Lopa Relive The Moments Spent Inside The House Star Tech: Watch SWAG King Raftaar's Take on Technology Hero Motocorp and The Viral Fever Salutes The Indian Army Soldiers - 'The Real Heroes' Of The Country About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Shades Of India 2.0, Episode- 49: Priyanka Gandhi in Congress list of star campaigners for UP AI Flight Makes Emergency Landing After Passenger Suffers Heart Attack Chris Jordan Hopes to Get Picked in IPL Auction GSM-Shiv Sena Combine Assures to Ban EDMs, Rave Parties in Goa Vodafone May Join Hands With Idea Cellular Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson (hpeterson@businessinsider.com) Jan 26th 2017 1:55PM Walmart is going after one of Costco's most lucrative businesses: car sales. The retailer is diving into the car business through a partnership with CarSaver, a website that lets customers shop for, finance, and insure vehicles, Automotive News reports. Under the partnership, CarSaver will open kiosks and information centers at Walmart stores where customers can shop for vehicles and make appointments at nearby car dealerships. If the appointments lead to a sale, CarSaver earns $350 from the transaction. To start, CarSaver is opening kiosks in 25 Walmart stores in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, and Oklahoma City on April 1. CarSaver CEO Sean Wolfington told Automotive News that he based the Walmart program off of Costco's wildly popular car-buying service.

"I was impressed with Costco's program and how much easier it was for the dealership because consumers trusted Costco and appreciated the haggle-free pricing and hassle-free experience," he told Automotive News. He said he became "convinced that this was the right way to sell cars — with a fair, transparent price, presented by brands the customer trusts most." Costco is one of the nation's top car sellers. The company sold more than 465,000 cars last year, or about 1,000 cars per store. CarSaver is aiming to sell about 1,000 cars annually through each Walmart store. So if the program is successful and expands to more than 450 stores, it could become a major threat to Costco's service. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman says the program is still in test mode, however. CarSaver launched a pilot program last year at a Walmart store in Stuart, Florida. "We're still evaluating customer response," Blakeman told Business Insider. "It's not uncommon for us to test different customer offerings in our stores using our leased spaces." About 80% of the dealership appointments made through the Walmart store turn into sales, according to Automotive News. So what does Walmart get out of the program? The company has a landlord/tenant relationship with CarSaver like it does with others that occupy the leased space at the front of its stores, including McDonald's and Smart Clips, Blakeman said.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 26, 2017: 2:12 PM ET What the U.S.-Mexico border really looks like Money transfer service MoneyGram is being bought by a financial services giant based in China. MoneyGram is one of the leading companies that helps people in the United States send money to Mexico and other countries. Ant Financial, a related company of Alibaba (BABA, Tech30), the global conglomerate backed by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, announced Thursday it was buying MoneyGram (MGI) for $880 million. MoneyGram stock rose nearly 10% on the news. The deal could be one of the first tests of how serious President Donald Trump is about cracking down on money transfers, also known as remittances, to Mexico. Trump has already proposed building a physical wall on the border with Mexico. Trump has previously said he would consider levying big taxes -- or even halting -- remittances to Mexico if the country would not pay for the wall. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a previously scheduled meeting with Trump after the rhetoric on who is going to pay for the wall ratcheted up. MoneyGram already has a thriving remittances business. And last October -- just a few weeks before the election -- MoneyGram announced a deal with Walmart (WMT) that would let customers send money from Walmart's U.S. stores to Walmart Mexico locations. So will Trump approve of MoneyGram selling out to a Chinese company? Perhaps. It's worth noting that Trump already had a meeting with Ma in New York earlier this month before the inauguration. Trump praised Ma after the meeting, saying that Ma was a "great, great entrepreneur and one of the best in the world." Trump added that "Jack and I are going to do some great things." Could the Ant deal for MoneyGram be the start of those great things? Related: Trump threatens Mexico's biggest cash source The White House was not immediately available for comment about the proposed acquisition. But executives from Ant Financial seemed to go out of their way in the press release to stress that the deal would be good for the employees of MoneyGram and consumers. The two companies stressed that MoneyGram will keep its headquarters in Dallas and that it should "maintain and grow its U.S.-based workforce." Ant Financial CEO Eric Jing said in a release that "we are committed to continuing to invest in MoneyGram's workforce and growing jobs in the United States." But Jing didn't shy away from the fact that MoneyGram is a major player in remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. He said a combined Ant Financial and MoneyGram will "will provide greater access, security and simplicity for people around the world to remit funds, especially in major economies such as the United States, China, India, Mexico and the Philippines." Related: 40% of a Mexican import is American MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes, who will remain with the company after the acquisition, added that the deal will allow MoneyGram to expand around the world. Interestingly, Holmes predicted that consolidation in the money transfer business was coming a few years ago. He said in an interview in the Financial Times in December 2015 that "regulators want more information" and that rising compliance costs could put pressure on companies to merge. There were even rumors that MoneyGram could wind up combining with its rival Western Union. (WU) MoneyGram and Ant Financial said Wednesday that they hope their deal will close during the second half of this year. It will require regulatory approval around the globe though. Related: Jack Ma and Donald Trump met to talk jobs One of the regulators that monitors MoneyGram in the United States is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency that was the brainchild of now Senator Elizabeth Warren and was created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. So it will be interesting to see whether Democrats like Warren have any issues with the proposed merger, as well as whether or not Trump gives his blessing to it. Mexico's central bank recently said that nearly $25 billion in remittances made their way into the country from friends and relatives living outside the country during the first 11 months of 2016. Nearly all of that cash was from people in the U.S. --CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this story.

X Corporate America divided over import tax reform plan Walmart among US firms claiming tax changes would force up consumer prices Thu, Jan 26, 2017, 18:40 Barney Jopson, Ed Crooks President Donald Trump: rift in business community threatens his pledge to overhaul the tax code by undermining a blueprint House Republicans are drafting for the White House. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst         Dozens of US exporters including GE and Boeing are squaring off against Walmart and other retailers as a radical Republican plan to tax imports divides the giants of corporate America. The rift in the business community threatens President Donald Trump’s pledge to overhaul the tax code for the first time in 30 years by undermining a blueprint that House Republicans are drafting for the White House. GE, Boeing and several dozen manufacturers are in advanced talks over forming a coalition to lobby in favour of the import tax, just as Walmart and other big importers, including the billionaire Koch brothers, mobilise against it. Walmart sent its top tax executives to meetings on Capitol Hill this week to warn officials that the proposal would have a dramatic impact on its business, potentially forcing the retailer to raise prices for shoppers, according to two congressional aides. The “border adjustment” tax regime, which would penalise imports and encourage exports, is central to the plans of House Republicans initiating tax legislation. But visceral divisions over the idea do not bode well for its prospects. US companies have spent years urging policymakers to fix a “broken” tax code only to see previous efforts fail on Capitol Hill. A post-election rally in the US stock market has been driven partly by hopes of a cut in the tax rate, but the outlook has been clouded by the import tax furore. The stakes for both sides in the battle are high. Helping exporters GE is known as one of the sharpest tax planners in US industry and Jeff Immelt, its chief executive, said of border tax adjustments in December that “things that help exporters are a good thing for GE”. GE and Boeing are among the companies negotiating the formation of a coalition to lobby for the proposal by Kevin Brady, the chief tax policymaker on Capitol Hill, according to three people familiar with the talks. ADVERTISEMENT The coalition is likely to be launched in a matter of weeks and one person said 27 businesses had already agreed to join it while dozens more had expressed an interest. The companies are in talks over hiring a political consulting firm called Cavalry to manage the campaign. The firm was founded by two former aides to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, who will help decide whether the import tax survives in the Senate. More crucial to the idea’s fate will be the stance taken by Mr Trump, who has equivocated on it. Lobbyists predict that it will only prevail if he embraces border adjustments as part of his “America first” agenda – and comes up with a better slogan for the tax policy. Border adjustments would work by not letting US companies deduct the cost of foreign inputs from their revenues for tax purposes, while giving a rebate to exporters by allowing them to exclude revenue from foreign sales from their taxable income. Mr Brady, who is writing the tax plan as an ally of House speaker Paul Ryan, says the import tax would make US exporters more competitive overseas. Foreign-made goods Retailers that sell a high proportion of foreign-made goods say the import tax threatens to wipe out a large chunk of their profits. The Walmart officials visiting Capitol Hill said the company estimated conservatively that it would have to raise the prices consumers pay for clothing and electronics by 20 per cent, said one congressional aide. Scot Ciccarelli, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, divided retailers into four groups according to the impact of border adjustment and placed Walmart among those likely to suffer the most, alongside Best Buy and Williams Sonoma. They would experience “sizeable drops in net income and more limited ability to pass through price increases, materially raising future earnings risk”, he wrote this month, citing the price sensitivity of Walmart shoppers as a barrier to asking them to pick up the cost. With 98 per cent of clothes sold in the US made overseas, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, says the import tax could inflate the tax bills of some fashion chains to three to five times their pre-tax profits, jeopardising their solvency. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Donald Trump Doug Holtz Eakin Jeff Immelt Kevin Brady Mitch Mcconnell Paul Ryan Scot Ciccarelli Best Buy Boeing Cavalry Ge WalMart Williams-Sonoma Read More John FitzGerald: Expanding capacity of building sector takes time Mixed signals for Dublin’s economy as consumer morale dips Exporters urged to exploit Asian market after Brexit Consumers drive Britain’s economy, repulsing Brexit hit Central Bank downgrades growth forecast amid Brexit fears Planet Business: alternative facts and a dash of Musk How much did Airbnb hosts in Dublin earn last year?

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Saturday January, 28, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Judge rejects US$80 million penalty in Wal-Mart truck drivers By Sudhin Thanawala, AP  January 27, 2017, 12:06 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Wednesday refused to force Wal-Mart to pay US$80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage for certain tasks. Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than US$54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn't pay the drivers the state's base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional US$80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict on the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were "overreaching." The company has said its drivers earn from about US$80,000 to more than US$100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart's compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that "reasonable minds could differ" about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart's payment policy developed in an "uncertain" legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly US$6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury's verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers US$42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said.

Head to your local Walmart by: Crystal Bonvillian, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: Jan 26, 2017 - 9:37 AM Clayton Fackler, 72, works at the checkout at the Walmart Supercenter in Bowling Green, Ohio, in May 2006. J.D. Pooley/Getty Images Twtter Walmart customers can add a new car to their shopping lists in April, when the retail giant will begin selling autos at select locations. The move into auto sales will be accomplished through a partnership between Walmart and CarSaver, an online auto retail platform. According to Automotive News, CarSaver will launch the program April 1 at 25 Walmart Supercenters in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Oklahoma City. “It is not uncommon for us to test different customer offerings in our stores using our leased spaces,” Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said. “We currently have a one-store pilot underway with CarSaver in Stuart, Florida, and are still evaluating customer response.” Consumerist reported that 80 percent of the appointments set up at dealerships by Florida Walmart customers resulted in a sale. >> Read more trending stories CarSaver’s online platform allows car buyers to search for the car they want, finance it and insure the vehicle through its website or a touch-screen kiosk, Automotive News reported. As part of the plan for Walmart, Carsaver is partnering with a variety of dealership groups, including AutoNation Inc., the largest retailer of new vehicles in the U.S. Ally Financial will be the preferred lender for the program. CarSaver staff will be set up at CarSaver Centers established inside the Walmart Supercenters, where they can explain the program to customers and offer other assistance. Once customers have chosen their vehicles and applied for financing and insurance, they will be put in contact with a local certified dealership. All dealerships in the program are within 15 miles of the Walmart stores from which buyers can shop, Automotive News said. CarSaver CEO Sean Wolfington said the program is modeled after Costco’s auto sales program, which he managed for a dealership at which he worked more than 20 years ago. “I was impressed with Costco’s program and how much easier it was for the dealership because consumers trusted Costco and appreciated the haggle-free pricing and hassle-free experience,” Wolfington said. Fortune reported last year that Costco has become one of the nation’s top auto sellers. In 2015, the warehouse chain sold more than 465,000 vehicles. Sam’s Club launched its own program later that year, Consumerist reported.  Amazon, which recently struck deals with auto parts suppliers to sell parts directly through its website, has also been selling autos online in Italy since last November, Business Insider reported. It could potentially launch a similar initiative in the U.S.    © 2017 Cox Media Group. Twtter Need a new car?

 Walmart is going after one of Costco's most lucrative businesses Hayley Peterson Jan. 26, 2017, 12:34 PM 12,146 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is getting into the car business. AP Walmart is going after one of Costco's most lucrative businesses: car sales. The retailer is diving into the car business through a partnership with CarSaver, a website that lets customers shop for, finance, and insure vehicles, Automotive News reports. Under the partnership, CarSaver will open kiosks and information centers at Walmart stores where customers can shop for vehicles and make appointments at nearby car dealerships. If an appointment leads to a sale, CarSaver earns $350 from the transaction. To start, CarSaver is opening kiosks in 25 Walmart stores in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, and Oklahoma City on April 1. CarSaver CEO Sean Wolfington told Automotive News that he based the Walmart program on Costco's popular car-buying service. He said that more than two decades ago, he managed the Costco program for a dealership he worked at. "I was impressed with Costco's program and how much easier it was for the dealership because consumers trusted Costco and appreciated the haggle-free pricing and hassle-free experience," he told Automotive News. He said he was "convinced that this was the right way to sell cars — with a fair, transparent price, presented by brands the customer trusts most." Shelves with merchandise at a Walmart distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Costco is one of the nation's top car-sellers. The company sold more than 465,000 cars in 2015, or about 1,000 cars per store. CarSaver is aiming to sell about 1,000 cars annually through each Walmart store. So if the program is successful and expands to more than 450 stores, it could become a major threat to Costco's service. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman says the program is still in test mode, however. CarSaver launched a pilot program last year at a Walmart store in Stuart, Florida. "We're still evaluating customer response," Blakeman told Business Insider. "It's not uncommon for us to test different customer offerings in our stores using our leased spaces." More than half of the dealership appointments made through the Walmart store turned into sales, according to Automotive News. So what does Walmart get out of the program? The company has a landlord/tenant relationship with CarSaver like it does with other companies that occupy the leased spaces at the front of its stores, including McDonald's and Smart Clips, Blakeman said.

Since American public education needs to change, as everyone seems to agree, what would it take to turn around an institution that’s bigger than Walmart and the U.S. military combined? A technocrat who knows many things will never turn around a massive organization. Subtlety and complexity are quickly lost in a sea of 3 million people. The focused leader who knows one big thing at least stands a chance of turning around even the largest organization: One big message, driven home relentlessly, can get through. Betsy DeVos’s one big idea is school choice, and that big idea brings a secondary effect, which is institutional competition. While her big idea is not guaranteed to fix America’s failing public schools, at least it has a chance — and that’s more than can be said for everything else that has been tried. Indeed, DeVos would be worse off if she had the kind of extensive in-school experience that liberals so angrily attack her for lacking. If she had been a teacher, administrator, and political campaigner, she would be the fox that knows many things. Thankfully, she’s not. Instead she has stuck with one big idea over a long philanthropic career: school choice. She’s the hedgehog that knows one big thing. And this hedgehog is about to wander into a very complicated situation. The United States has the best public schools in the world. The top public high schools send nearly all their graduates on to college, and many to the most selective colleges. Faculty and parents are dedicated to the educational task, and most students graduate with college credit already in hand. The quality of these schools supports high housing prices within the district, generating property-tax revenues to fund the schools. Even a whiff of weak school performance will draw the ire not only of parents but of every homeowner with something to lose. It’s a positive feedback loop. We also have the worst public schools in the developed world. In 1,200 American high schools, a third or more of the students don’t graduate. In 2013, 66 percent of U.S. fourth graders and 64 percent of eighth graders could not read at their grade level, according to the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) reading test. In 2013 the United States spent more per student than all OECD countries except Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland — yet our educational outcomes have hovered around 20th place among OECD’s 34 (now 35) nations. Our worst high schools are essentially prisons with poor security and lots of overhead. Parents see all of this, and most would rather not be trapped in a bad system. According to a 2013 Luntz Global Public Opinion Survey, 64 percent of American parents said they would send their children to a different school if they could. What that means in practice is that most American parents want — and lack — the option to enroll their child in a better charter, magnet, or private school than the public school they now attend. Into this complex picture walks Betsy DeVos, a relentless school-choice advocate. The daughter of a public-school teacher, she has never taught professionally and never attended public schools. Her philanthropic career has never strayed from the issue of school choice. She has campaigned in her home state and across the country to give lower-income families the chance to choose the right schools for their children. Can her big idea fix American public education? She has campaigned in her home state and across the country to give lower-income families the chance to choose the right schools for their children. Consumer choice has been a basic tenet of American law since at least 1890. At that time, the field of economics was still evolving, but competition was one of its tenets as well, and it would turn out to be its most enduring. Competitive markets were known to improve products, prevent corruption, encourage adequate supply, and keep prices moderate. And competition happens only when consumers have a meaningful choice between different products or services. This point was enshrined in the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, a statute that remains a cornerstone of American commercial law. Theodore Roosevelt and his successor as president, William Howard Taft, were the original trust-busters, doggedly prosecuting over 100 companies under the Sherman Act in what seemed at the time an uphill battle against large, entrenched interests. Today such high-profile prosecutions are less frequent and arguably less necessary because our society is so committed to the basic principle of consumer choice. But consumer choice suddenly becomes controversial — and somehow emotional — when it comes to public schools. The local monopoly of the public school went unquestioned until Milton Friedman suggested a free-market voucher system in 1962. His idea didn’t take root right away, but in 1991 some left-leaning reformers in Minnesota passed a charter-school law, creating for the first time the possibility of school choice. Now 43 states and the District of Columbia have passed charter-school laws and 17 states have some form of voucher system. Still, change is hard. Powerful institutional forces keep millions of American students in poorly performing public schools with no meaningful alternatives. As Betsy DeVos said in her confirmation hearing, “The human tendency is to guard what is because change is difficult.” She appears to know, after a few decades dedicated to this issue, that most failing schools won’t improve on their own, because teachers, administrators and even parents fear change. To change, the worst schools need exposure to a force more powerful than their own incentives and inertia. DeVos knows that competition is a force powerful enough to change a sector as big and change-resistant as American education. Perhaps nothing else is. The best evidence that competition might actually be powerful enough to work is the unearthly shrieking now emanating from those who fear change the most: teachers’ unions. Their shrieking is probably justified. Competition always brings on change, and change within large institutions hurts like hell. Michigan, DeVos’s home state, is familiar with that kind of pain. By the 1980s it was clear that Detroit’s signal industry was ceding ground to foreign competition — Toyota in particular. It would have been sensible for a company like General Motors to seek out Toyota’s recipe for success and start to replicate it. W. Edwards Deming, an American well known in Detroit, was the inspiration for Toyota’s quality revolution. In fact, Toyota shared Deming’s playbook with General Motors through a joint venture begun in California in 1984. Deming’s approach was initially rejected by GM, Ford, and Chrysler because it involved massive change, and change hurts. But competition is powerful enough to change even the biggest institutions, given enough time to do its work. Toyota didn’t just give us great Toyotas; it eventually gave us better Fords. Competition is powerful enough to change even the biggest institutions. American education in 2017 looks a lot like American cars did in 1987. Average quality is low by international standards. The largest school districts (e.g., Chicago) fear competition the most because, like the Big Three, they know how much pain it will bring. For unions and management alike, the great enemy is not one another; it’s the spectre of competition. Which is why school choice is the only remaining hope for parents and children caught in America’s failing schools. The Bush administration’s effort to achieve higher public-school performance through the No Child Left Behind Act was finally abandoned in late 2015 after broadly failing to achieve its goals. As reported this week, the Obama administration’s effort to improve America’s worst high schools with $7 billion in federal cash has been judged by the Department of Education itself to have had no effect. School choice has the power to be different. It may be that some of the worst schools can’t be fixed. For some children, school choice will mean a chance to attend a private or charter school that performs better — or is just a better fit for their needs. For others, the competition brought on by school choice will mean that their local public school will begin to make some painful changes, the way GM, Ford, and Chrysler all eventually did. Either path is far better than the status quo. Mrs. DeVos’s confirmation hearing saw Democratic senators concede that charter schools could be acceptable as long as they had no effect on public schools. (Senator Murray asked DeVos to commit that she would “not cut a penny” from public schools.) But having an effect on public schools is half the point of school choice. We don’t just want to be able to buy Toyotas. We want the fact that we could buy a Toyota to make our Chevrolets better. Betsy DeVos will continue to be characterized by her critics as an opponent of public schools. She is no more against American public schools than W. Edwards Deming was against American cars or Theodore Roosevelt was against American railroads. In all three cases, the success of the whole sector required a hedgehog with one big idea: competition. For American schools, Betsy DeVos is that hedgehog, and in 2017 her time has come. — Dan Currell is a legal consultant who serves on several nonprofit educational boards.

MoneyGram is one of the leading companies that helps people in the United States send money to Mexico and other countries. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Money transfer service MoneyGram is being bought by a financial services giant based in China. MoneyGram is one of the leading companies that helps people in the United States send money to Mexico and other countries. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba, the global conglomerate backed by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, announced Thursday it was buying MoneyGram for $880 million. MoneyGram stock rose nearly 10% on the news. The deal could be one of the first tests of how serious President Donald Trump is about cracking down on money transfers, also known as remittances, to Mexico. Trump has already proposed building a physical wall on the border with Mexico. Trump has previously said he would consider levying big taxes -- or even halting -- remittances to Mexico if the country would not pay for the wall. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a previously scheduled meeting with Trump after the rhetoric on who is going to pay for the wall ratcheted up. MoneyGram already has a thriving remittances business. And last October -- just a few weeks before the election -- MoneyGram announced a deal with Walmart that would let customers send money from Walmart's U.S. stores to Walmart Mexico locations. So will Trump approve of MoneyGram selling out to a Chinese company? Perhaps. It's worth noting that Trump already had a meeting with Ma in New York earlier this month before the inauguration. Trump praised Ma after the meeting, saying that Ma was a "great, great entrepreneur and one of the best in the world." Trump added that "Jack and I are going to do some great things." Could the Ant deal for MoneyGram be the start of those great things? The White House was not immediately available for comment about the proposed acquisition. But executives from Ant Financial seemed to go out of their way in the press release to stress that the deal would be good for the employees of MoneyGram and consumers. The two companies stressed that MoneyGram will keep its headquartered in Dallas and that it should "maintain and grow its U.S.-based workforce." Ant Financial CEO Eric Jing said in a release that "we are committed to continuing to invest in MoneyGram's workforce and growing jobs in the United States." But Jing didn't shy away from the fact that MoneyGram is a major player in remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. He said a combined Ant Financial and MoneyGram will "will provide greater access, security and simplicity for people around the world to remit funds, especially in major economies such as the United States, China, India, Mexico and the Philippines." MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes, who will remain with the company after the acquisition, added that the deal will allow MoneyGram to expand around the world. Interestingly, Holmes predicted that consolidation in the money transfer business was coming a few years ago. He said in an interview in the Financial Times in December 2015 that "regulators want more information" and that rising compliance costs could put pressure on companies to merge. There were even rumors that MoneyGram could wind up combining with its rival Western Union. MoneyGram and Ant Financial said Wednesday that they hope their deal will close during the second half of this year. It will require regulatory approval around the globe though. One of the regulators that monitors MoneyGram in the United States is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog agency created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that was the brainchild of now Senator Elizabeth Warren. So it will be interesting to see whether Democrats like Warren have any issues with the proposed merger, as well as whether or not Trump gives his blessing to it. Mexico's central bank recently said that nearly $25 billion in remittances made their way into the country from friends and relatives living outside the country during the first 11 months of 2016. Nearly all of that cash was from people in the U.S. --CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this story. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Most Popular Walmart is going Hollywood, tapping star directors to create three 60-second ads to air on the Academy Awards on ABC Feb. 26 in the giant retailer's first appearance there. Walmart has challenged directors Antoine Fuqua, Marc Forster and filmmaking partners Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg to make the 60-second "short films," based not on a play or a book, but a Walmart receipt. The six items on the receipt are bananas, paper towels, batteries, scooter, wrapping paper and video baby monitor. The Hollywood Reporter originally reported the deal with the filmmakers earlier today. "Agency partners were definitely involved, both on the [Saatchi & Saatchi] and [Publicis Groupe] side," said spokeswoman Meggan Kring. Plans were in the works before Haworth was officially named Walmart's U.S. media agency earlier this month, she said. The effort is a move by Walmart to get a place in popular culture on par with its retail footprint. "Being a part of the Academy Awards is a great way to connect with our customers in a fresh, new way," said Walmart U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Tony Rogers in a statement. "As the world's largest brand, and a company that sells just about everything, we plan to be more involved, more engrained in the cultural moments that our customers care about, starting with the Oscars." Every receipt tells a story "as diverse as the customer who shops us," Mr. Rogers said. "We think of our business beyond simple transactions." He described the campaign an "unexpected way of telling our brand story" and "a perfect fit for a night where compelling storytelling is celebrated." Walmart is teasing the campaign on its website at Walmart.com/thereceipt. Often called the "Super Bowl for Women," the Academy Awards are likely well over the cost of a single Super Bowl spot for Walmart. Kohl's, last year's exclusive sponsor with five spots and a total of three minutes on the broadcast, spent an estimated $9 million on media, according to iSpot.tv. Historically the broadcast has had an exclusive retail sponsor, with JC Penney having held that position for 14 years prior to Kohl's appearance last year. But Ms. Kring couldn't immediately confirm if Walmart has a category exclusive. This is the first of multiyear sponsorship of the Oscars, Walmart said, though it didn't disclose the length of the commitment or spending. But the effort also includes a $250,000 donation to The Academy Grants Program for FilmCraft in the name of the participating directors. The donation "demonstrates Walmart's continual commitment to diversity in filmmaking," the company said. Even prior to this, Walmart sponsored an annual Bentonville Film Festival in partnership with Geena Davis, among others, aimed at encouraging diversity in casting, direction, writing and production of films. The third year of the festival is set for May. Michael Francis, who has considerable Hollywood ties as former Dreamworks chief marketing officer, is now a Walmart marketing consultant and was part of the team involved in putting the deal together, Ms. Kring said. But the retailer always has had deep ties to the entertainment industry by virtue of selling so many DVDs and CDs, licensed goods, and streaming video via Vudu. Among other things, that's given Walmart leverage to draw an endless stream of stars to its annual shareholder meeting in Arkansas each year, but now its putting Hollywood to work entertaining customers in ads, too. "This was a wonderful challenge from Walmart," said Mr. Fuqua in a statement. The director known for the Academy Award-winning film "Training Day" and other action thrillers said the Walmart work lets him "tell an extraordinary story shaped around six ordinary objects." Mr. Forster, director of "Monster's Ball" and "Kite Runner," said, "The uniqueness of this challenge from Walmart allowed me to exercise my passion for storytelling in a very exciting way by crafting a story that revolves around people's everyday needs, wants and desires."

Ant Financial CEO Eric Jing said in a release that "we are committed to continuing to invest in MoneyGram's workforce and growing jobs in the United States." But Jing didn't shy away from the fact that MoneyGram is a major player in remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. He said a combined Ant Financial and MoneyGram will "will provide greater access, security and simplicity for people around the world to remit funds, especially in major economies such as the United States, China, India, Mexico and the Philippines." Related: 40% of a Mexican import is American MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes, who will remain with the company after the acquisition, added that the deal will allow MoneyGram to expand around the world. Interestingly, Holmes predicted that consolidation in the money transfer business was coming a few years ago. He said in an interview in the Financial Times in December 2015 that "regulators want more information" and that rising compliance costs could put pressure on companies to merge. There were even rumors that MoneyGram could wind up combining with its rival Western Union. (WU) MoneyGram and Ant Financial said Wednesday that they hope their deal will close during the second half of this year. It will require regulatory approval around the globe though. Related: Jack Ma and Donald Trump met to talk jobs One of the regulators that monitors MoneyGram in the United States is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency that was the brainchild of now Senator Elizabeth Warren and was created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. So it will be interesting to see whether Democrats like Warren have any issues with the proposed merger, as well as whether or not Trump gives his blessing to it. Mexico's central bank recently said that nearly $25 billion in remittances made their way into the country from friends and relatives living outside the country during the first 11 months of 2016. Nearly all of that cash was from people in the U.S. --CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this story.

Xi Jinping calls on the official union to. "[R]epression no longer works as in the past." The director of the China Labour Bulletin analyses the situation. Hong Kong (AsiaNews) – Tensions are rising between workers and employers in China, a trend accentuated by the global economic crisis and greater awareness by workers of their rights, this according to Han Dongfang, China’s first free trade union leader. A leading figure in 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Han spent 22 months in prison until his release for health reasons in 1991. After spending a year in the United States for medical treatment, he returned home in 1993 only to be expelled to Hong Kong where in 1994 he founded the China Labour Bulletin, an NGO that fights for the rights of Chinese workers. (Courtesy of the China Labour Bulletin). Multinational companies with interests in China are facing a challenge: labour unrest. While academics debate whether there is or isn’t a labour movement in China, human resource managers and CEOs on the ground are facing the reality of an angry workforce aware of its rights and conscious of its interests. Take Wal-Mart for example. Since 2014, Wal-Mart ‘associates’ – workers to the rest of us – have built social media platforms through which workers share information and support resistance to the corporation’s introduction of flexible working hours. The ‘comprehensive working hours system’ does not just reduce overtime pay. It makes it hard for workers to plan family life or take the second jobs often required to meet basic living costs. In early July this year, strikes broke out across four stores. Blogs posted by workers and read by tens of thousands of Wal-Mart employees tell of store managers using the new work roster to target activists, especially those who refuse to sign up to the new system. The arrogance and at times bullying behaviour displayed by store managers belies Wal-Mart’s service values such as ‘Act with Integrity’ and ‘Respect for the Individual’. In the southern province of Guangdong, Chinese workers are furious at factory sell-offs with the potential to impinge negatively on pension rights and seniority. In November, workers at a Danone water-bottling plant organized a week-long strike after learning that the factory had been sold off without anyone informing them. They demanded proper severance arrangements be put in place for those wishing to leave due to uncertainties over pension rights and social insurance arrears. In the same month, Sony ran into similar problems following the sale of its camera plant in Guangzhou that came as a total shock to its 4,000 plus workers. On 10 November, workers organised a strike and picket lines that brought the plant’s assembly lines to a halt and blocked goods from coming in and out of the plant just as the Christmas busy season was getting into gear. Perhaps for this reason, there were indications that Sony has met most of the workers’ demands – but were reportedly going after strike organizers. Of course, multinational companies acquire and sell factories all the time. That’s how capitalism works. However, in China deals are signed off without their employees finding out until months later. As these highly organised, coordinated and social-media connected strikes suggest, we are entering a new era in which workers are demanding a place at the negotiating table. At present there is no effective channel through which workers can negotiate their share of the pie with employers. In its absence, local governments deploy riot police and make arrests, repressing strikes but failing to address the cause. It is a violent and expensive response and it doesn’t work: strikes continue to be a regular feature of China’s labour relations. As we have argued at China Labour Bulletin, there is an effective alternative for workers, employers and the state to the strikes and protests: collective bargaining. Why? First, repression no longer works as in the past. It was certainly effective in the early days of unregulated capitalism when China opened up its coastal zones to foreign investment in 1980s. It worked too during the privatisation of large numbers of state-owned enterprises in the late nineties when up to 35 million workers lost their jobs. But it won’t work today. Workers know their rights and know what is due to them. Second, millions of China’s workers are now able to spread information via social media bypassing the state’s firewalls and official media channels. The information genie is out of the bottle giving workers access to knowledge hitherto denied them. And as the old cliché goes, knowledge is power. Information reduces isolation and the fear that comes with it. Workers can see that they are not alone and there are others facing similar struggles whether it be over flexible working hours, secret sell-offs or wage arrears. Information also increases leverage. Workers in the Danone strike had access to data on a previous dispute over a sell-off by Pepsi-Cola in which workers’ demands were mostly met. Third, and most important with regard to collective bargaining, is the issue of workers’ representation. In China there is only one legal trade union, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) led by the Chinese Communist Party and controlled by employers in most workplaces. Although there are rare occasions when it has acted on behalf of workers, this is almost always under pressure from strikes and protests. Indeed, Chinese workers are like workers anywhere. They need to have the opportunity to elect representatives and present their grievances to management via a legally-defined process of negotiation otherwise known as collective bargaining. The inability of the ACFTU to carry out this core trade union task means that workers have no option but to go on strike, taking us back to repression.   The pressure on the ACFTU is not just coming from workers. In 2015, China’s ‘core leader’ Xi Jinping ordered the ACFTU to come up with a plan to improve workplace representation. Xi’s anti-corruption drive won him considerable support among China’s workers. But he cannot afford to sacrifice it, particularly in the run-up to this year’s 19th Party Congress where the legitimacy of his leadership and of the Party’s rule will be subject to domestic and international scrutiny. Thus his instruction to the union to up its game and ensure workers needs are met is aimed at shoring up legitimacy. To date, no plan has been forthcoming – at least not in public. But the longer the ACFTU procrastinates, the higher the stakes for everyone, including the multinationals and their supply chains. Labour unrest in China is not going to go away. Beginning 21 November, striking Coca-Cola workers in three cities thousands of miles apart – Chengdu, Chongqing and Jilin – called for effective trade union involvement in talks with management over plant sell-offs. Their demands have clearly been coordinated and the dispute escalated amid reports of police violence in Chongqing. Faced with this pressure from below, it is my firm conviction that the question is no longer if the Party will introduce some form of collective bargaining, but when. It will do so in order to ensure its own survival and my advice to domestic and international employers alike is to be ready for it.  e-mail this to a friend Printable version TAGs china labour unrest china labour bulletin workers strikes trade union han dongfang e-mail this to a friend :Han Dongfang: Dismissals, arrests, and jail do not stop Chinese workers China Labour unrest is growing in China. Xi Jinping calls on the official union to. "[R]epression no longer works as in the past." The director of the China Labour Bulletin analyses the situation. : : (*) : : (*) : (*) : (*) See also 24/06/2010 CHINA More strikes in China, Toyota stops Workers put down their tools for a third day in a row. They want better salaries and a higher end-of-year bonus. Worker rights advocate Han Dongfang says, “After 30 years of reform and spectacular economic growth, the cracks are beginning to show”; workers deserve “better standard of living, better working conditions and a better future”. 05/03/2007 CHINA Democratic unions against European and US exploitation of industry workers The noted Chinese union leader Han Dongfang speaks out against the exploitation of workers by foreign companies. Public authorities rarely intervene. Independent workers organisations are needed to evaluate rising popular dissent. Migrant’s situation particularly precarious. 04/06/2007 CHINA Tiananmen massacre still continues today Eighteen years since the repression of the anti-corruption and pro-democracy movement, Han Dongfang, founder of the first free Chinese trade union, looks at the current situation of human and civil rights in his country and warns that continued repression and terror against the people can only undermine society as a whole. 21/07/2007 CHINA Slave labour “normal” in today’s China, says Han Dongfang The founder of China’s first independent trade union talks about the brick kiln slave scandal. Slave labour is symptomatic of society in which those in power distort the common good for personal gain and hide their misdeeds. Deng Xiaoping’s black and white cat analogy has led to a society where the powerless get crushed. 10/05/2006 CHINA Human rights in China threatened by local governments' violence Exploitative working conditions and human rights abuses are feeding social unrest in China. Local authorities are resorting to gangs of thugs to beat up protesters. This phenomenon runs counter to statements coming from Beijing about the need for harmonious development; it is worrisome because it is opening the door to total illegality when it comes to human rights.

Police say a group of young men met in the McDonald’s inside the Walmart to discuss the sale of a cell phone, but at some point, the meeting turned violent and shots were fired. Rafael Semmler was at the store with his family when the gunfire erupted and said everyone was screaming and running to get away. Semmler, a military veteran who served as a medic in Kuwait, Iraq, and Bosnia, made sure his family was safe, then ran straight to the area where the gunshots originated. “You don’t really think about it, it’s just at that time it’s kind of like instinct, it’s what you’ve been trained to do,” Semmler said, “And was my first instinct was to go toward it to see if there’s anything I could do to help out.” Semmler found the injured man with a gunshot to his arm. He was bleeding profusely and said he was dying. So Semmler grabbed shirts and whatever else he could use to apply pressure to the wounds. “He just kept telling me, ‘Please don’t leave, just stay with me. Stay here,’ and I told him I’d stay there, so I did,” Semmler said. The other two men involved in the incident took off and the injured man is expected to survive. Semmler, who never even got the man’s name, said he was just glad he was in the right place at the right time.

CHINA-APPLE-QUALCOMM Apple sues Qualcomm in China over technology fees BEIJING (AP) — Apple Inc. has filed suit in China challenging chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.’s fees for technology used in smartphones. A Beijing court says two suits filed by the iPhone maker accuse Qualcomm of abusing its control over essential technology to charge excessive licensing fees. Most of Apple’s iPhones are assembled in China by contractors. Qualcomm said in a statement it had not seen Apple’s complaint but defended its fees. The company said Apple was offered terms consistent with those accepted by more than 100 Chinese manufacturers. Qualcomm agreed to change its licensing practices after Chinese regulators fined the company 6 billion yuan ($975 million) in 2015 on charges it abused its control over technology to charge excessive fees. WAL-MART TRUCKERS-WAGE DISPUTE Judge rejects $80M penalty in Wal-Mart truck drivers lawsuit SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge in San Francisco won’t force Wal-Mart to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant failed to pay hundreds of California truck drivers minimum wage for certain tasks. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith and reasonably believed its payment policy met California law. An email to an attorney for the drivers wasn’t immediately returned. A jury in November found Wal-Mart failed to pay the drivers minimum wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Jurors awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages. The drivers requested additional damages and penalties. The company had argued that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks. FACEBOOK-TRENDING TOPICS Facebook tweaks ‘trending’ feature to root out fake news NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is updating its “trending” feature, which shows popular topics discussed and shared on its site, in an effort to root out fake news and misinformation. The social media giant says it will now look at the number of publishers posting about the same topic — not just the number of people sharing or commenting on single posts or articles — when assembling its list. That’s intended to ensure that the topics “reflect real world events being covered by multiple outlets.” Facebook will also stop personalizing the topics based on users’ interests. After criticism of the way it has allowed misinformation to spread on its site in the months leading up to the election, Facebook in December announced a slew of new measures to curb the spread of fake news. BORING MUSK Elon Musk tweets mystery tunnel boring project LOS ANGELES (AP) — Elon Musk’s already going high, and now he says he’s going low. In mid-December the billionaire tweeted “Traffic is driving me nuts” and “am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.” On Wednesday, the SpaceX and Tesla founder tweeted he plans to begin in a month or so at his Los Angeles-area rocket factory. The statements have launched speculation about another fantastic transportation idea from Musk, who is known for advocating a “hyperloop” — a futuristic system of vacuum tubes with passenger-carrying capsules. But Musk’s cryptic tweets leave unclear what kind of tunnel he’ll be digging. One tweet said the starting point will be across from his desk at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California, but didn’t say how big the tunnel will be or where it will lead to. BOOKS-ROXANE GAY Gay parts with publisher over deal with far-right pundit NEW YORK (AP) — Angered with her publisher for giving a platform to the “blunt, inelegant hate” of far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, author Roxane Gay has withdrawn a planned book with Simon & Schuster. Gay confirmed to The Associated Press on Wednesday that she will not be releasing “How to Be Heard” through Simon & Schuster, which had scheduled the book for 2018. In comments provided to BuzzFeed News, Gay says Yiannopolous, whose book “Dangerous” comes out in March, had every right to express his views. But she says a deal with a major publisher is not a right, but a privilege. Gay decided she did not want to be in “business with a publisher willing to grant him that privilege.” Simon & Schuster did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BACKPAGE-SEX TRAFFICKING Website that advertised escort services sued in 4 states SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — New lawsuits have been filed in four states on behalf of women who say they were victimized as teenagers when they were sold for sex on an international website. Attorneys say the suits filed Wednesday in Alabama, California, Texas and Washington are the first to individually name the operators of Backpage.com. CEO Carl Ferrer and purported owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin are among those sued, along with other affiliated individuals and holding companies. The complaints say the three men are liable because they knew they were profiting from illegal sex trafficking. The men appeared in a California courtroom on Tuesday to contest similar criminal charges that they say are barred by federal law and free speech protections. Backpage’s general counsel, Liz McDougall, declined comment on the lawsuits. CHINA-NORTH KOREA China releases new list of items banned for export to NKorea BEIJING (AP) — China has released a new list of items banned for export to North Korea, following a new round of United Nations sanctions and complaints from President Donald Trump that Beijing was doing too little to pressure its communist neighbor. A statement from the Commerce Ministry said the items included dual-use technologies that could aid the North’s programs to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as the missiles to deliver them. While largely comprising specialty chemicals and rare alloys, the list also included computer software, machinery, high-speed cameras, aircraft engines and six-axle truck chassis. China is the North’s largest source of trade and aid, but is frustrated by Pyongyang’s defiance of the U.N. Trump complained in a tweet earlier this month that China “won’t help with North Korea.” PHILIPPINES-ECONOMY Philippines GDP grows 6.6 pct in Oct-Dec, 6.8 pct for year MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Officials report the Philippine economy expanded at a 6.6 percent annual rate in October-December, the slowest pace of expansion for the year, though full-year annual growth clocked in at a relatively brisk 6.8 percent. Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said Thursday that robust domestic demand helped offset a contraction in agriculture, slowing government spending and wariness over President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. The 6.8 percent expansion for the year was at the high end of the government’s target of 6.0 to 7.0 percent growth. Growth in the past seven years has averaged 6.3 percent. Brash-talking Duterte inherited a relatively vibrant economy when he took office in May. He has pledged to slash the poverty rate, but investors are wary of his swashbuckling approach to governing.

The first advantage is its customer base. Target's shoppers are younger on average than those of Kohl's or Walmart. The second advantage is its Cartwheel App, which already has some 30 million users. "If Target can build a payment system that makes redeeming offers and checkout easier, there's a good chance it will get serious adoption rates," said eMarketer analyst Yory Wurmser. The timing of the rollout was reported by Recode earlier this week. (Reports that Target was working on a payment system had been circulating for more than a year.) Target's chief information and digital officer Michael McNamara told Recode that the company plans to introduce mobile payment features to one or more of its apps, though the service will at first only be offered to shoppers with a Target REDcard. Target's focus on millennials gives it a strong base from which to develop mobile payment use. Millennials have been the quickest of any generation to adopt mobile payments. eMarketer estimates that more than a third of millennial smartphone users will use mobile payments this year. These millennial mobile payment users will account for more than half of total mobile payment users in the US. While mobile payment adoption among US millennials is expected to see healthy growth, Gen Xer and baby boomer shoppers will also increase their usage of such services. eMarketer expects the number of mobile payment users to jump from 50.8 million to 76.0 million, or 24.3% to 33.1% of total smartphone users, between 2017 and 2020. For all the growth, though, mobile payments still make up only a tiny portion of overall spending. eMarketer expects total mobile payment transaction value to more than double this year to reach $62.49 billion—a heady total, but a mere 1.2% of this year's projected $5 trillion in retail sales. —Alison McCarthy New in eMarketer PRO This Week StatPack: Global Mobile Payments Report: US Affluents 2017 Report: Digital Video Advertising Best Practices 2017 Report: UK Mobile Payments Not a PRO subscriber?

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Sudhin Thanawala, The Associated Press on January 25, 2017. SAN FRANCISCO – A federal judge on Wednesday refused to force Wal-Mart to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage for certain tasks. Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn’t pay the drivers the state’s base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. “While we still disagree with the jury’s verdict on the case, we’re pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties,” said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were “overreaching.” The company has said its drivers earn from about $80,000 to more than $100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart’s compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that “reasonable minds could differ” about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart’s payment policy developed in an “uncertain” legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly $6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury’s verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers $42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. You must be logged in to post a comment.

By Krystal Steinmetz on January 25, 2017 Photo by Antoniodiaz / Shutterstock.com You might soon find yourself driving out of the Walmart parking lot with a trunk full of groceries in a brand-new car. The retail giant has partnered with auto-buying program CarSaver to start selling new and used cars to consumers, Automotive News reports. Walmart plans to roll out CarSaver’s online auto retail platform at 25 of its big-box stores beginning in April, Consumerist reports. Select Walmart stores in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Oklahoma City will also offer one-stop shopping for car purchases and financing through CarSaver. The CarSaver platform allows a shopper to choose, finance and insure a vehicle through its website or a touch-screen kiosk. Automotive News explains how Walmart’s new car-buying program will work: Customers will be able to select a new, used or certified pre-owned vehicle and apply for financing and auto insurance on the kiosk at the CarSaver Center, on their mobile device via CarSaver’s website or by calling an 800 number. Then CarSaver will connect customers with an AutoNation dealership or other local dealership, where buyers can complete the purchasing paperwork and drive away in a new car. If a car deal is successful, CarSaver will pay the dealership a “success fee” of approximately $350. According to Consumerist, Walmart tested the new car-buying program at one of its Florida stores in 2016. It was wildly successful. “[Eighty] percent of appointments set by Walmart customers resulted in a sale that averaged more than $3,000 in savings for buyers,” Consumerist explains.

REUTERS/John Gress/Files A federal judge refused to order Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retailer failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum compensation for certain tasks, the Associated Press reported. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and reasonably believed its payment policy aligned with California law, AP reported. apne.ws/2jTppuK Current and former Wal-Mart truck drivers in California sued the company in 2008, claiming a plan that compensated drivers by mileage and activity rather than hours worked violated state law. The company dropped the plan in 2015. In November 2016, a jury held that Wal-Mart owed the drivers backpay and handed down a $55 million verdict against the company for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict in the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Wal-Mart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial. Lawyers for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. Wal-Mart said that its drivers were among the highest paid in the industry, earning about $80,000 to over $100,000 per year, adding that drivers were paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires.

He had been released from the Belmont Correctional Institution that day, prior to committing the offense. Theft, Mayfield Road: A mixer motor was reported stolen from a construction site at Marc's Jan. 11. It had been dropped off there Jan. 6 and was valued at $1,500. Drug abuse, Mayfield Road: Officers responded to Taco Bell around 1 a.m. Jan. 16 for a report of a woman passed out behind the wheel in the drive-thru. She did not seem impaired when they woke her, but they detected an odor of marijuana and found some of it inside the vehicle. The Beachwood woman, 23, said her sister had smoked in the vehicle earlier and the marijuana belonged to her. She was cited for driving under suspension and drug possession. Theft, Mayfield Road: A Cleveland woman, 55, was arrested Jan. 14 after she left Giant Eagle without paying for $167.29 worth of groceries. She was located crossing Victory Drive and had eight packages of steaks in her sweater and eight packages of shrimp in a bag. She was later taken to the hospital after complaining of a swollen hand. Reports indicate she had complained of the same problem when she was arrested three days earlier at Walmart for theft. She was charged with theft, possession of criminal tools, obstructing official business and failing to stop for an officer. Counterfeiting, Mayfield Road: A cashier at Giant Eagle was suspected of taking in three counterfeit $100 bills from the same customer Jan.9 on three separate transactions. The Cleveland woman, 21, left 20 minutes before the end of her shift because she said her father was gravely ill and might not make it through the night. The bills were marked with a Turkish word that when translated meant fake or counterfeit. The incident is under investigation. Animal complaint, BayardRoad: Officers responded to a report Jan. 14 of a dog running loose in the area. The resident, whose home the dog belonged, told officers it was her nephew's dog and she would not accept a citation. She also told an officer to "taze" the dog because it was not going to stop running from him. The woman, 38, was cited for dogs at large. Officers returned to the area Jan. 19 when the dog got loose again. The woman again said it was her nephew's dog and she did not want it at the home. She said it ran past her when she was taking her own dog outside. She was cited once again. Burglary, East Berwald Road: A man and woman reported Jan. 15 their home had been broken into and a TV, wedding ring and laptop computer had been stolen. Entry was believed to have been made through a kitchen window. The ring was valued at $3,200. There were no suspects identified. Burglary, East Berwald Road: A woman reported Jan. 14 someone had entered her home while she was at work, but nothing appeared to be missing. She said a package had been opened that she had placed on the kitchen floor and a knife was removed from a drawer and left on a cabinet. Someone also went through dresser drawers. Entry was believed to have been made through a rear door, which was found with a broken window pane. Theft, Edmond Drive: A woman said Jan. 10 she realized her debit card was missing after she had last used it at Dunkin Donuts Jan. 5. She also learned a check for $2,847 had been deposited into the account at an ATM and someone then used the account to make a $2,019 purchase at a Walmart store of an unspecified location. A second charge for $602 was also made at a Cleveland Walmart store and a withdrawal of $80 was made from an ATM. The incident is being investigated by her bank's fraud department. The woman said the card's PIN was written on the card. Robbery, Monticello Boulevard: A BP clerk reported around 7 p.m. Jan. 15 a man handed her a Family Dollar bag and told her to fill it with money or he would shoot her. She said the suspect had been in the store earlier to buy a can of beer, but did not have enough money. He did not show a weapon, but kept his hand by his waist band. Officers spoke to employees at the neighboring Family Dollar and learned a man matching the description of the suspect was in the store and had purchased a greeting card. The clerk believed there was a greeting card inside the bag. It was believed the suspect received about $80 from clerk. She said he is a regular customer, who frequently comes to buy beer. Robbery, Warrensville Center Road: A woman, 65, had her purse stolen around 7:15 p.m. Jan. 11 while she was loading items into her vehicle at Walmart. She tried to fight off the three male suspects, but fell to the ground. They left in a vehicle and she tried to follow them, as did a witness, who was not identified. She later learned one of the credit cards from her purse had been used fraudulently at an Express Gas Station at an unknown location. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: Officers received a report Jan. 16 of a man at Walmart placing a fire hydrant into the trunk of his vehicle. They did not locate him, but learned the identity of the man when they ran a check of his license plates. The man was contacted and responded to the station to return the fire hydrant. He said he had found it in the roadway in Cleveland and placed it into his trunk so nobody would run into it. When he was at Walmart placing items into the trunk, he realized it was still in there so he was rearranging items to get everything to fit. It was later learned the color of the hydrant matched the color scheme of those in Cleveland. It is valued at approximately $4,400. Disorderly conduct, Cedar Road: Officers responded to Jimmy John's sub shop Jan. 18 for a report of a woman who was throwing bags of chips and cookies around the restaurant. The manager said the woman had complained about a sandwich she received hours earlier and got upset because she was only being offered another sandwich or gift card for the price of the original order. He said she began to swear at employees, threw items around and picked up a chair in an attempt to throw it through a window. The South Euclid woman, 22, told police she felt disrespected by employees and decided to throw bags of chips and cookies. She said she was hit in the back with a sandwich that was thrown by an unknown person and manager closed the door preventing her from leaving. She was subsequently charged with disorderly conduct.

Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn't pay the drivers the state's base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict on the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were "overreaching." The company has said its drivers earn from about $80,000 to more than $100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart's compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that "reasonable minds could differ" about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart's payment policy developed in an "uncertain" legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly $6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury's verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers $42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Watch Judge Rejects $80M Penalty in Wal-Mart Truck Drivers Lawsuit By sudhin thanawala, associated press SAN FRANCISCO  Jan 25, 2017, 8:31 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email A federal judge on Wednesday refused to force Wal-Mart to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage for certain tasks. Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and had reason to believe its payment policy aligned with California law, according to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco. A jury awarded the workers more than $54 million in back wages in November after finding that Wal-Mart didn't pay the drivers the state's base wage for inspecting their vehicles before and after trips and for taking 10-hour layovers and 10-minute rest breaks. Attorneys for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. An email to their lawyer was not immediately returned Wednesday. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict on the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," said Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its drivers earn among the highest salaries in the field and that the plaintiffs were "overreaching." The company has said its drivers earn from about $80,000 to more than $100,000 a year. Illston largely agreed with Wal-Mart, citing testimony that she said showed Wal-Mart's compensation was among the highest in the trucking industry. Attorneys for Wal-Mart also had said in a court filing that "reasonable minds could differ" about the legality of its pay and layover policies. The judge said Wal-Mart's payment policy developed in an "uncertain" legal landscape, giving the company reasonable grounds to believe it was complying with California minimum wage law. Illston did award the drivers nearly $6 million in restitution for an additional year that they say Wal-Mart violated minimum wage law but was not covered by the jury's verdict. Wal-Mart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. The company argued during trial that it paid drivers for activities that included smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. Wal-Mart pays drivers $42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Scott Edelman, an attorney for the company, said during trial. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Judge Rejects $80M Penalty in Wal-Mart Truck Drivers Lawsuit " Trump Orders Suspension of All Refugees, Immigrants From Some Muslim Nations " Trump Called National Park Service Upset Over Inauguration Crowd Retweet " Vice President Mike Pence Tells March for Life: 'Life Is Winning Again in America' " Seasonal Flu Reaches Epidemic Levels in US " Trump Says He'll Let Defense Secretary 'Override' Him on Torture After New Rape Lawsuit, Baylor Says Made 'Great Progress' " Trump, Mexico's President Speak by Phone " Putin Consults His Security Council Before Talking to Trump " Mumps Outbreak Worsens in Washington State " Army Veteran, Double-Amputee Finds New Battlefield in DC " Georgia Town Leaders Apologize for 1940 Lynching " In Iowa, Trump Voters Cheer Changes, Dismiss Petty Fights " Ivanka Trump's Son Crawls for First Time in White House " Holocaust Site Spurs Questions on Young Germans' Changing Views " How Trump's Memorandum Could Boost Military Readiness " Philadelphia Mayor: Trump's Remarks an 'Insult' to Police " New Trump Agency Memo Gags Staff Communications, Democrats Say " Little Girl Befriends Baby Cow Who Lost Its Mom " NASA Opens Exhibit on 50th Anniversary of Apollo 1 Fire " FBI Offers Up to $10K Reward for Information in Murder of ABC Chicago Producer in Belize " 'Hamilton' Actors to Sing 'America the Beautiful' at Super Bowl LI " Inside Taylor Swift's $25 Million Beverly Hills Mansion " 'Bear' the Dog Hoping to Find a New Forever Home

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it One of the Macy’s stores the company plans to close. (Mike Blake/Reuters) By George F. Will By George F. Will Opinion writer January 25 Follow @georgewill When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like “tombstones” across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises “protection” to prevent foreigners from “destroying” manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be “destroying” more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $390 billion), created by Jeffrey P. Bezos. He owns The Post, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers and were as important in the nation’s commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy’s, after announcing in August that it would close 100 more of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing 150 more (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation’s population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Walmarts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Walmart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Walmart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy’s and other “anchor tenants” that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, the New York Times reported that online retailing “has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.” The Times quoted specialists’ calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees in the past four years, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, “destroyed” lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy-makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it “is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.” If so, the “problem” is productivity. Nutting says “Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does.” The Times reports that “the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores.” All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee’s or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge’s Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers’ choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today’s faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs “saved” but not those that, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy’s flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels’s nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America’s first merchant to offer “a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen.” It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy’s vs. Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good. (Reuters) Read more from George F. Will’s archive or follow him on Facebook.

REUTERS/Henry Romero By By Noel Randewich, Reuters Jan 27, 2017 at 3:58 pm | Print View SAN FRANCISCO — Shares of U.S. supermarket operators fell on Friday as President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of Mexico, which is a major supplier of produce and other foods for U.S. consumers. A day after the White House suggested that the United States could impose a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico, shares of Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger Co fell more than 1 percent, while Whole Foods Market dropped 2.8 percent. Trump on Friday repeated statements that Mexico, a major exporter of vegetables, fruits and beer, has taken advantage of the United States. Mexico, he said, “beat us to a pulp,” deepening worries about a crisis between the two trading partners. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned trip to Washington to meet Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border to halt illegal immigration. The White House later said the potential 20 percent tax could be used to pay for the wall. Mexico was the second-largest supplier of agricultural exports to the United States in 2015, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, or USTR. Mexican agricultural exports to the United States in 2015 totaled about $21.6 billion, up 191 percent from 1993, before the two countries and Canada cemented the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the USTR. Less than 1 percent of Hass avocados - the main ingredient in guacamole - sold in the United States so far in 2017 were domestically grown, with 93 percent arriving from Mexico, according to the Hass Avocado Board. The United States consumes nearly all of its own tomatoes, exporting just 6 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of the tomatoes the United States imports, Mexico accounts for 71 percent, with Canada supplying most of the rest. A new tax on food imported from Mexico would leave supermarkets with the difficult choices of raising prices, sacrificing already low profitability, or a mixture of the two. U.S. grocers deal with a higher-than-average cost of goods sold than most other industries, resulting in razor-thin margins. Through 2015, the six-year average cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for U.S. grocers was 73.4 percent versus around 56 percent for all U.S. industries, according to Plunkett Research. Shares Kroger and Wal-Mart are down about 3 percent from before Trump’s inauguration a week ago while food distributor Sysco has lost about 1.5 percent.

Yucatan would have at least one of these logistics centers. The moves are expected to generate about 10 thousand jobs in the region.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, January 28, 2017 Updated: 6:10 AM, January 28, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO - Shares of U.S. supermarket operators fell on Friday as President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of Mexico, which is a major supplier of produce and other foods for U.S. consumers. A day after the White House suggested that the United States could impose a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico, shares of Wal-Mart Stores <WMT.N> and Kroger Co <KR.N> fell more than 1 percent, while Whole Foods Market <WFM.O> dropped 2.8 percent. Trump on Friday repeated statements that Mexico, a major exporter of vegetables, fruits and beer, has taken advantage of the United States. Mexico, he said, "beat us to a pulp," deepening worries about a crisis between the two trading partners. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned trip to Washington to meet Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border to halt illegal immigration. The White House later said the potential 20 percent tax could be used to pay for the wall. Mexico was the second-largest supplier of agricultural exports to the United States in 2015, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, or USTR. Mexican agricultural exports to the United States in 2015 totaled about $21.6 billion, up 191 percent from 1993, before the two countries and Canada cemented the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the USTR. Less than 1 percent of Hass avocados - the main ingredient in guacamole - sold in the United States so far in 2017 were domestically grown, with 93 percent arriving from Mexico, according to the Hass Avocado Board. The United States consumes nearly all of its own tomatoes, exporting just 6 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of the tomatoes the United States imports, Mexico accounts for 71 percent, with Canada supplying most of the rest. A new tax on food imported from Mexico would leave supermarkets with the difficult choices of raising prices, sacrificing already low profitability, or a mixture of the two. U.S. grocers deal with a higher-than-average cost of goods sold than most other industries, resulting in razor-thin margins. Through 2015, the six-year average cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for U.S. grocers was 73.4 percent versus around 56 percent for all U.S. industries, according to Plunkett Research. Shares Kroger and Wal-Mart are down about 3 percent from before Trump's inauguration a week ago while food distributor Sysco <SYY.N> has lost about 1.5 percent.

Ottumwa was officially proclaimed the Video Game Capital of the World at the launch party and plans are underway to build a full museum in the small Iowa city. (Photo : (Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images)) The Nintendo NES Classic Edition is now back in-stock at Target, Walmart and Toys "R" Us stores in limited supply. And adding more games in the palm-sized console is now doable via hackers' tools. The miniaturized version of the Nintendo Entertainment System  was sold during the holidays and the supply was instantly depleted. The demand for the console was so high that Nintendo bore the brunt of criticisms for failing to meet customers' demands. Now, a month after the holidays, the NES Classic console is now back in-stock in U.S. stores as revealed by GameStop. The palm-sized console hits the shelves of Target stores starting last Jan. 26. The device has been reported to be in stock in New York, New Jersey and Los Angeles. However, the supply is again not as extensive with only one to 10 units on shelves in Target stores. The stocks in different branches vary depending on the size and location of the branch. The best place to find the NES Classic console will be a suburban Target store in close proximity to a big city. The in-demand console is also available in Walmart according to i4u News. Toys "R" Us will also be having the NES Classic as indicated on its website. The page says that the stores are expecting shipments to come in and will soon be on display. The Nintendo NES Classic Edition retails starting at $59.99, which is available online through GameStop. The retro console is pre-loaded with 30 classic oldie NES titles, which include "Super Mario Bros.," "Donkey King," "Pac-Man," "The Legend of Zelda," "Metroid" and "Kirby's Adventures." Though Nintendo did not intend any games to be added, hackers were able to do it by connecting a USB cord in the power supply port, according to Polygon. The NES Classic modding tool  hakchi2 will enable gamers to add as much as 600 titles in the small console.

(Submission Guidelines) Oxfam is wrong about ‘obscene’ wealth Email Share Tweet Print By Peter Zeller | 01/27/17 REUTERS/Ruben Sprich James Brandt, a Jan. 23 letter writer to the Star Tribune, is correct in writing, “If Bill Gates and the other rich men had never been born, the world would be worse off, and the poor would be no richer.” Last week Oxfam released a sensational report that said eight people have “obscene” wealth, as much as the poorest half of the world’s population. I don’t dispute this statistic, but is inequality really “trapping hundreds of millions in poverty” and is higher taxes on wealth and income really a solution, as they claim? Turns out these assertions are absolutely and demonstrably wrong. Photo by James Netz Peter Zeller James Brandt, a Jan 23 letter writer to the Star Tribune (“Don’t malign the rich; instead help the poor help themselves”), is correct in writing, “If Bill Gates and the other rich men had never been born, the world would be worse off, and the poor would be no richer.” Creating value and thus wealth does not hurt the poor; it makes everyone else richer. And this fact has even been quantified by Yale economics professor William Nordhaus. He found that “most of the benefits of technological change are passed on to consumers rather than captured by producers.” His research for the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that innovators capture about 2  percent of the value they create and the other 98 percent of the value flows to consumers. Need further convincing? Here’s Jason Furman, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration: There is little dispute that Walmart’s price reductions have benefited the 120 million American workers employed outside of the retail sector. Plausible estimates of the magnitude of the savings from Walmart are enormous – a total of $263 billion in 2004, or $2,329 per household. Sure, Sam Walton’s heirs are wealthy, about $100 billion between them, but consumers are receiving value of over $250 billion a year from that creation. So over 20 years we’ve received $5 trillion in value for the $100 billion kept by the Walton family, and that’s quite a deal. On a purely practical level, should we really care that great innovators keep 2 percent of what they create? No we shouldn’t. We should want more rich people, creating more value, and our focus should be on reducing poverty, not inequality. According to Tim Worstall at CapX: Oxfam’s redistribution argument has been tried before and found wanting. It was the subject of the world’s largest economic experiment: the 20th century. Anyone surveying the rubble of central Europe from the Brandenburg Gate in 1989 knows that the taking and giving solution does not work. What is needed is the wealth creation strategy that we’ve been using in the period of free-market globalization ever since. And the result of technological advance, innovation, and free-market globalization has been wonderful and breathtaking:  The last 100 years (or 50, or 25, take your pick) has seen the greatest reduction in poverty in human history (see the dramatic progress here). In 2015 68% of the world population had access to proper sanitation facilities compared to only 24% in 1980. 285,000 more people have gained access to safe water every day for the past 25 years. According to Johan Norberg, Swedish author of "Progress: Ten Reasons to Look to the Future": “When we don’t see the progress that we’ve made, we begin to search for scapegoats for the problems that remain.” You don’t need to like the super-rich or decide if they are deserving, but you should recognize that most of them got there by making the rest of us richer, and not fall for off-base populist rhetoric that somehow blames them for trapping others in poverty.

So how do you square this with middle class wage stagnation for the last 30 years or so? I would hardly characterize that as "making everyone richer".

Login or register to post comments Entrepreneurs not Aristocrats Submitted by Andy Summers on January 27, 2017 - 9:52am. I don't question the need for entrepreneurs to seek and receive a reward for their work. Wealth is a yardstick of success for many, and an important incentive for the risk required to build great ventures. As Andrew Carnegie wrote about over 120 years ago, there is a stark difference between Bill Gates and the Walton Family. Bill Gates is using his wealth to solve global problems and will donate all of his wealth to those causes upon his death. He and his father have been working very hard to convince other Forbes-listers to do the same. The Waltons did not create and grow Walmart - their father did. They are now sitting on enormous wealth that could be put to better use. Couple this with the financial industry owning a inordinate share of US profits and the problems compound. The middle and lower classes are fighting over a smaller and smaller pie, while inherited sums of money continue to pool at the top and pour into evermore complex investments and tax havens. The richest families lobby extensively to keep and grow this money they did not earn, and back the propaganda that immigrants and people of color are to blame for everyone's woes. And now we have one of their own in the White House. Login or register to post comments I'll bite! Submitted by Dennis Wagner on January 27, 2017 - 9:54am. What was not argued is the skewed Tax code! Have yet to hear folks begrudge the well to do for their efforts. However the Tax code is exceptionally generous to them and less generous to Joe & or Jane six pack, as noted seems the Billionaire POTUS hasn't paid Federal Income Tax in almost 20 years! To a comment on a different post, when can we cut down the welfare for the uber-rich, tax Credits, deductions etc? Do you want to try again and also address the fairness of the system? Should be a healthy discussion. Login or register to post comments Strawman Submitted by Peter Stark on January 27, 2017 - 10:17am. Nice try, but this is an obvious strawman argument. There is no reason why innovation, competition, and equitable distribution of wealth need to be at odds with one another. It is obviously false that the only country in the history of the world that has attempted a more equitable distribution of wealth and income was the USSR. It is also completely false that all of the wealth owned by the rich or super-rich is justly earned for providing social benefits to the proles. Much of the wealth owned by the super-rich is inherited. Over the next 20 years, just 500 people will likely pass on over $2.1 trillion to their heirs. Paris Hilton didn't scrap from the bottom of the heap to a fashion empire; President Trump didn't launch into real estate as a small-time hustler; Sam Walton (of Walmart fame) started his first store in 1945 with a 2016 equivalent $246,678 loan from his father-in-law, L.S. Robson, a wealthy rancher. This is why distribution matters. People who are born into higher income brackets tend to stay there, because of all the benefits that come with it: access to trusts, "loans," or family wealth, access to good housing and nutrition, education, developmental opportunities, less stressful family relationships, and on and on. Those born into lower income brackets tend to stay there as well, because of all the handicaps associated with them, and because they can't compete with people from higher brackets. Here is some evidence for you of social mobility in the US: 1. http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/re... 2. http://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/economic_mobility_sho... I am a top-quintile guy, born into a top-quintile family, and I've gotten where I am purely through nepotism and taking advantage of my station. I have a toddler now, and they are essentially guaranteed a ticket to the upper-middle class by birthright, even if they don't work particularly hard or do anything particularly out of the ordinary. According to Pew, they have a 63% chance of remaining in the top 4th or 5th quintile. My kid is also more likely to marry a high-earning partner than kids born in lower quintiles. My kid's kids are also going to have this baked in advantage. A kid born just up the road into the bottom quintile will have to scrape and claw and fight against their destiny every day, and they still only have a 13% chance to get into the 4th or 5th quintile. To get into the top quintile, my kid has to basically just live their life and they have a 40% chance. The kid up the road born into the bottom quintile has a 4% chance of getting there. This sort of determinism based on family station is appalling and is a direct consequence of opinions like the one expressed in this article; That all wealth is justified, that all the rich earned all of their money, and that unequal distribution of wealth and income has no negative consequences for those who are bereft. Login or register to post comments Stakeholders Submitted by Patrick Tice on January 27, 2017 - 12:12pm. Great comment - What I might add is that in the coming age of automation, there is no way everyone can have a well-paying job. This is obvious to anyone who reads and can parse data, as is the concentration of wealth to such obscene excess. What we need to do is start thinking of people as stakeholders - not as consumers, employees, retirees, students, or (God forbid) "job creators". In other words, we recognize that we are all in this together and everyone is entitled to some kind of basic "living". This will require a change in the traditional American attitude toward work, since we will no longer be able to blame the unemployed for their joblessness and treat them as lazy "takers". I'm not exactly sure how we'll get there, but we'd better start the discussion soon - self-driving trucks are right around the corner, and your Uber will be a robot. Software will be written by AI, and many medical diagnoses will be done by machines. No one's job is safe, so we may forestall the inevitable by shortening the workweek, but that will not ultimately be enough. Something must be done to recognize every stakeholder's right to a living - and no amount of yammering about retraining or "new jobs" will ever solve the problem. With no path to wealth available through work - even hard work - the existing plutocracy will continue to reap even more while the masses stagnate at the bottom. And, as we have seen, these plutocrats will not be shy about using their resources to buy astroturf policy platforms, politicians, and a life lived without regard to national boundaries or laws that the rest of us must follow. They are already transnationals and have no real reason to think in terms of national identity, further diluting their responsibilities to fellow citizens. Login or register to post comments Yes, a profoundly silly article. Submitted by Charles Holtman on January 27, 2017 - 12:52pm. I won’t pile on with yet other observations as to the fallacies populating Mr Zeller’s economic argument. I’ll just add the simple additional but different criticism that economic power, political power and the power - thru the media, schools, etc - to define the way others think all are aligned with comparative wealth. When wealth is concentrated too highly in too few hands, democracy is impossible, not just because the wealthy determine who can be a viable candidate for office, but more profoundly because the social discourse is so thoroughly managed that the people can no longer engage in the level of critical thought necessary to fulfill their roles as citizens and voters. Mr Zeller apparently would trade freedom and self-determination for the mess of pottage that is the ability to buy crap at Walmart even cheaper than it is at Target. I particularly appreciate the comments by Mr. Stark and Mr. Tice. As to the latter, it long has been apparent that the growth imperative (which is what ensures that wealth will continue to augment itself) has majority justification only because it is the only real mechanism that we have to distribute social wealth. If we were to substantially reduce our economic activity, much of which goes toward production of no intrinsic value, the value of capital would decline substantially but we would have a much better quality of life in the aggregate, and perhaps we keep a habitable planet, as well. But then a whole lot of folks don’t have jobs. That is what underlies the proposition that a society shifts toward (note to over-excited commenters from the Right: “toward” not “to”) socialism, and a right to a “basic living,” as it becomes wealthier and as its norms of trust strengthen. But interests have thwarted this natural trajectory for the past 80 years. So we’re facing a mass loss of employment in our near future without the steady evolution of social relations over these decades that would have facilitated a qualitative redistribution of labor, under which the grand leap in the productivity of labor via technology would have redounded to the benefit of all, rather than the prospect ahead of enriching a few and immiserating the many.

Read this quote again with emphasis added: "There is little dispute that Walmart’s price reductions have benefited the 120 million American workers employed OUTSIDE OF THE RETAIL SECTOR." In other words, you can benefit from Walmart's low prices -- but only as long as you don't work for them, or one of their suppliers, or one of their vendors, or anyone in any way associated with the company -- or any other retail endeavor! Wow. I can't believe that I missed all of that great benefit to our economy that we can get just by avoiding all possible contact with Walmart or the entire retail sector (other than at the cash register, of course). Citing Walmart as an example of healthy redistribution of wealth is a little like hailing cancer for redistributing white blood cells. Further, when you have billionaires like Warren Buffet, and even alleged billionaires like Donald Trump, asking to raise their taxes (which both of them actually did), then it's long past time to reconsider the distribution of wealth. But let's be clear about what that means. It is NOT about taking their money and giving it to poor people. And it is NOT about limiting how wealthy they can become or what they can do with their wealth. It's about recognizing in our tax code that those who have benefited the most from our economic playing field have the greatest amount of responsibility (and motivation) to protect it. In other words, it is in their own BEST INTEREST to make sure the system captures the appropriate portion of their wealth for the benefit of all. Without that, the system will ultimately collapse. Login or register to post comments Utter Claptrap Submitted by Brian Simon on January 27, 2017 - 10:46am. The world would not be worse off without Gates, or Zuckerberg. Neither introduced a revolutionary product. They both just happened to win in the marketplace. On the Waltons, the author only examines half their impact. Better access to cheap goods for condumers? Sure, that's true. But he ignores the small businesspeople who've closed their stores, unable to compete with the behemoth. Rural shoppers have fewer shopping options, Walmart has squeezed out the competition. Are we better off? I'm skeptical. More to the point; were any of these people even motivated by the accumulation of massive amounts of wealth? What is the benefit to society that so few can accumulate so much? Wouldn't it be better if more people could accumulate more modest wealth? Login or register to post comments Please, cut the propaganda Submitted by Joel Stegner on January 27, 2017 - 1:14pm. Those with wealth are not victims. They do not deserve anyone's sympathy. What we have are a situation in which many of the children of the wealthy lack any discernable personal values or any sense that they need to follow the rules that apply to everyone else. The flip side of generational poverty is generational wealth and privilege. Tip to the wealth. Earn your wealth honestly, treat your workers humanly, spend your time and effort to improve your community, serve your customers well and don't waste our time talking about how wonderful you are. If you are, others will say so without having to be paid to do so. In Minnesota, the Dayton family is an example of this. Their success came out of a life of service to others. Now we witness a Governor Dayton who is working his butt off, through great pain and a serious illness, to make life better for the state of Minnesota. He has spent most of his inheritance to do good for others, showing his humanity at all times. The contrast with Trump is breathtaking. Humble beats haughty ever day of the week.

Win tickets to the Rachel Ray Burger Bash at the SOBE Wine and Food Festival. Enter now! Opinion Editorials Repeal ban of liquor in Florida grocery stores | Editorial By Sun Sentinel Editorial Board It's long overdue for Florida to repeal ban of liquor sales in grocery stores Privacy Policy Nearly a century after Prohibition, Floridians are still living with antiquated alcohol laws. Over the last few years, the Florida Legislature has changed a few. We can now ship ourselves cases of wine, for example, and buy 64-ounce "growlers" of craft beer. This year comes a decision on whether to let grocery stores, drugstores and big box stores — like Wal-Mart and Target — sell liquor alongside beer and wine. The change is long overdue. It makes no sense that consumers can buy beer and wine in one store, but must walk outside and into a separate store to buy distilled spirits. Today's regulation protects liquor stores, but limits competition and poses a needless burden on consumers. By getting rid of this regulation, the Republicans who control Tallahassee can prove their free-market bona fides and rein in government's tendency to pick winners and losers in the marketplace.

Thirty states already allow this. This is not the first time this push has been mounted, but its chances appear better this year because the Legislature has so many new faces. The bill passed the Senate Regulated Industries committee on Thursday by a 9-1 vote, and now heads to the Rules Committee before a final floor vote. A companion House bill has also been filed. If this bill passes, a change will also be needed in the number of stores that can obtain a liquor license. It makes no sense for consumers to be able to buy liquor at one chain store, but not at another because of the state's licensing quota. While there's nothing wrong with restricting liquor sales at gas station convenience stores, if you're going to allow liquor sales in some Publix, Wal-Marts or Walgreens, allow it in them all. Flores told the Sun Sentinel Editorial Board another bill may be filed to address that issue. For now, she's focused on the bill to let stores sell liquor alongside beer and wine. "This law was around more than 80 years ago with a purpose," she said. "That purpose is long gone. It's not our job to stand in the way of 21st Century innovation, the American entrepreneurial spirit." The bill's opponents, including the Florida Independent Spirits Association, argue that allowing liquor sales in stores like Wal-Mart will lead to an increase in crime and underage drinking. "If you have spirits readily available inside a Target or a Wal-Mart, it invites underage kids," executive director Rory Eggers told us. "Not to mention the employees who work in those chains — they can hire anyone 16 and up." It's a familiar argument. When fighting the push to let people ship themselves a case of wine, opponents suggested kids might answer the door and drown in trouble. Let's remember that stores like Wal-Mart and Walgreens already sell beer and wine, and there's no evidence their teenage workers are stealing and imbibing. The bill says employees under 18 would not be able to handle liquor — the same regulation that already exists in liquor stores. Ron Ziff, long-time president of the California Beverage Retailers Association, told us such scare tactics have been used for years to prevent change. Since the repeal of Prohibition, California has let grocery stores sell liquor alongside beer and wine. "It's a facetious argument," Ziff said. "It's just something people make up to argue against it. Crime doesn't go alongside grocery stores just because they sell liquor." The Florida Independent Spirits Association's other argument — that will it hurt liquor stores — has some merit. But in California, liquor stores have responded by going upscale to serve a niche market, selling a wider variety of wines and liquors than can be offered in grocery stores with limited shelf space. Plus, they retain the convenience factor. If someone just wants to purchase a bottle of Scotch, a liquor store is a faster and easier option. And the bill would lift the prohibition on liquor stores selling grocery items, allowing room for reinvention. It's long past time to repeal this outdated law. Let stores sell beer, wine and liquor, too. Let's end Prohibition altogether. Copyright © 2017, Sun Sentinel All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 59°

(BABA) 10 Facts You Didn’t Know About Tesla Motors Inc And Elon Musk (TSLA) Why Apple Inc. Stock (AAPL) Was Downgraded Ahead Of Earnings View All Posts Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk posted a series of tweets on Saturday, mapping an update schedule that is more often seen among smartphone makers than traditional automakers. The schedule indicates that the automaker is expecting to release major updates to its vehicles every 12-18 months, according to MarketWatch. Retrofits to Slow Tesla’s Progress Older-model cars will not be equipped with the latest sensors or hardware, and this is worrying some Tesla owners who are seeking upgrades to their vehicles. Musk’s response to these complaints was essentially “tough luck.” “Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months. . . . If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically,” Musk tweeted. Adding self-driving tech to earlier vehicles would require replacing 300 parts, something that needs stripping the “entire car,” he added. According to Musk, cars with HW2 technology made after October 2016 are now getting Autopilot. Musk also warned owners to be careful while their car’s cameras readjust. Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock No Matter Which Way It Moves Responding to his tweet on Sunday, Musk said the auto-steer mode is limited to 45 mph for now, but once the company gets more driving data, it will raise the speed. Tesla Acts More Like  a Tech Company Before making any major upgrade launches, traditional automakers usually keep the same base technology for about five years. Tesla is known for operating more like a tech company and less like an automaker, not to forget its fondness of conducting beta tests and constant lineup adjustments. This all strengthens the belief that the EV firm has no plans of settling into the familiar patterns of its conventional rivals, notes Engadget. However, it has both positive and negative aspects associated with it. On one hand, it guarantees owners cutting-edge tech whenever they buy a Tesla, while on the other hand, it means that owners will find their cars outdated in record time. This could make owners hesitant to buy one if they suspect they will miss out on a must-have feature, notes Engadget. Of course this means the only way for owners to keep their vehicles the most up to date is by buying new Teslas.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 26, 2017 at 6:56PM Image source: Wal-Mart. What happened Shares of retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) jumped 12.75% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. There was no single piece of news that drove the gains, which all occurred in the first seven months of the year. Instead, steady comparable-sales growth in the United States and new online initiatives likely drove investors to buy the stock. So what Wal-Mart followed through on its plan to raise wages and improve training in February. The moves knocked down Wal-Mart's profit, but the company expects improved efficiency, employee morale, and customer satisfaction to eventually reverse that trend. The focus on making its U.S. stores more appealing to shoppers paid off in 2016. The third quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of comparable-sales growth, with much of the growth driven by increased store traffic. Earnings declined as expected, but investors focused on the solid U.S. results. Wal-Mart's e-commerce business also gained momentum during 2016. Global e-commerce sales rose by just 7% year over year, adjusted for currency during the first quarter, but accelerated to 20.6% growth during the third quarter. Wal-Mart's push into online grocery, allowing its customers to order online and pick up for free at its stores, has helped drive this growth. Wal-Mart also acquired Jet.com in August, but the stock declined from that point on. Now what Shares of Wal-Mart have continued to decline in 2017, as many retailers that have reported results so far have disappointed investors. Wal-Mart stock has slumped about 3.5% year to date, wiping out a portion of last year's gains. Wal-Mart will need to remain aggressive as it grows its e-commerce business to compete with Amazon.com. The acquisition of Jet.com gives the company a brand that should appeal to those wary of shopping at Wal-Mart, and initiatives like the Pickup and Fuel concept stores could help the company maintain and grow its grocery market share. Wal-Mart will report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 21, with investors expecting continued U.S. comparable-sales growth and double-digit e-commerce gains. If Wal-Mart disappoints like other retailers have, even more of 2016's gains could be erased. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Sam’s Club ecommerce operations will soon be under Sam’s Club corporate instead of Wal-Mart’s global e-commerce business partially based San Bruno, Calif. This change follows job cuts at Wal-Mart corporate offices, reorganization of Wal-Mart’s replenishment operations, and management changes at Sam’s Club under incoming CEO John Furner. Furner announced that Jamie Iannone, CEO of SamsClub.com, will also be the executive vice president of membership and technology for Sam’s Club and will begin reporting to him Feb. 1. Furner also created a new chief technology officer role for Sam’s Club which will be led by Hsiao Wang who will report to Iannone. Furner said this means Sam’s Club will have dedicated support for its own technology efforts in clubs and online, while also being able to leverage Wal-Mart resources when necessary. “Wang is a technology expert, starting with the company nearly 15 years ago as an enterprise architect, and has since worked within infrastructure, security and development. He also served as the chief information officer for Walmart China before transitioning to his most recent role as vice president of analytics and decision platforms for Wal-Mart Technology,” Furner noted in the memo. Furner worked with Wang during his assignment in China between 2013 and 2015 as the chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart China. Furner said SamsClub.com was significant to the company’s overall growth last year and the omnichannel efforts are being recognized across the industry for innovations like the Scan & Go app which allows members to completely omit the checkout line. Furner also announced Kelly Thompson has been promoted to senior vice president and chief operating officer for SamsClub.com. Thompson has 10 years with the company, most recently leading the global category development team. Prior to that she spent seven years as chief merchant for Walmart.com where she managed all merchandising, pricing and planning areas of the business. Thompson will report to Ianonne. Her new SamsClub.com team includes: Alain Nzigamasabo, vice president of merchandising; Adrian Fung, vice president of marketing; and Jim Oliver, vice president of Business Intelligence. Iannone, Wang, Thompson and her team will be based in San Bruno, but answer to Furner in Bentonville. Membership and marketing will also fall under Iannone’s new job description, in addition to managing a team in San Bruno, he will also manage a small team in Bentonville which includes: Eddie Garcia, vice president of product and member experience;. Darshan Gad, vice president of member engines, digital innovation; Matt Martin, vice president of member decision services; and Taylor Duersch, vice president of member and data strategy. Tracey Brown, who previously led the membership division, is transitioning to the new role of senior vice president of operations and customer experience. Brown will report to Furner who said she will be tasked with helping to transform the way members shop clubs, while also simplifying the shopping experience.

Then he was asked which scents he didn’t like: “Well, there are things you don’t want to mention,” he said. “Sometimes I smell things on people that are just terrible—things that make you not like them.” Last Friday, the day that Trump became President of the United States, I marked his ascension by wearing a perfume that seemed, to me, more fitting than Success. Apocalypse, an olfactory index of every element in the Book of Revelation that could conceivably have a smell, was loaned to me by the London gallery of the conceptual artists Thomson & Craighead, who produced fifty bottles last year with the help of the Edinburgh perfumer Euan McCall. Among the twenty or so elements, which are conjured with a mixture of nearly a hundred synthetic compounds and natural oils, were “a rod of iron,” “the smoke of the earth,” “a grievous sore,” “flesh burned with fire,” “the wine of her fornication,” and “a lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.” Since last October, when Hillary Clinton declared that “I’m the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse,” the end-timers have been out in force. Nostradamus is said to have predicted Trump’s rise with talk of “the false trumpet concealing madness”; Bible-prophecy experts like Erika Grey, the author of such books as “The Antichrist of Revelation: 666,” are waxing eschatological on Christian talk radio; and the “Broad City” girls are panicked that “it is about to get ‘I Am Legend’ up in here.” Whether we welcome the Second Coming or not, there’s a reason for our obsession with apocalypse in times of terror: the quick singe is always preferable to the slow burn. On Saturday, still bug-eyed from Trump’s talk of “American carnage,” I opened the black Apocalypse box, emblazoned with a Gothic-looking “A.” The bottle was entombed in black velvet. Through the clear glass, the liquid looked both precious and vile—like Bordeaux, but murkier. I sprayed my wrist, inhaled deeply, and, I kid you not, got a nosebleed. After I recovered, I resumed sniffing, gingerly, and got the general impression of sweetness gone rogue. It was as though a cinnamon cookie had been sautéed in balsamic vinegar. The next night, at dinner, a friend pronounced the scent “not that bad.” She added, “It smells like you’re in line at the Abercrombie store, waiting to buy another bottle of the cologne you’re already wearing.” What of the burning flesh? When I asked McCall, the perfumer, why I hadn’t smelled “every living soul died in the sea,” he told me that I had, in the jasmine oil: “A lot of the compounds you find in the smell of decaying flesh you also find in white flowers,” he explained. Costus, a type of thistle, provided the rooty, leathery notes—and also, McCall said, “the smell of unwashed hair.” And the grievous sore? McCall told me about civet, a musk material from the civet cat, which was part of the original formula for Chanel No. 5; it’s now produced synthetically. “It has a fecal smell in large quantities,” he said. “In small doses, it’s sweet.” With time, the perfume seems to grow even sweeter—another thing it has in common with putrefying bodies, it turns out. Alison Craighead, one half of the artist duo, told me that commercial perfumers spend most of their money on the high notes, “which disappear quickly. We spent a lot of time in the lower notes, which last on your skin a lot longer. You should be able to smell it twelve hours later.” Jon Thomson, the other half, described his experience of wearing the perfume: “It starts hot, like incense; then it gets bloody, with iron notes and some leather.” The scent’s materials are apportioned according to a simple formula: the percentage of “blood” versus “flesh,” for instance, is determined by the number of times each is mentioned in the Book of Revelation. “We were trying to be as literal as possible,” McCall said. The project was inspired by a visit to London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, where Craighead happened on a fourteenth-century altarpiece from Hamburg with forty-five colorfully gruesome scenes. “It’s laid out like a cartoon,” she said, “and I couldn’t quite believe some of the images—the walking dead, the Earth opening up, things shooting out of the sky.” When I asked Thomson if we were living through an apocalypse, he mentioned climate change, income inequality, and Brexit, in addition to our new American regime: “Perhaps this ‘post-truth’ climate harks back to a more medieval mind-set, when everyone in Europe believed that the end of the world was actually taking place around them.” On Friday, the Apocalypse scent will suffuse the room at Young Projects Gallery, in Los Angeles, for the opening of a new Thomson & Craighead show, spanning sound and video work. The title: “Wake Me Up When It’s All Over.” By now, we know that the Trump apocalypse is happening step by step, rather than at once. That’s by design, as Steve Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter after the election: “Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. It only helps us when they”—liberals—“get it wrong. When they’re blind to who we are and what we’re doing.” When the White House floats two names for the Supreme Court vacancy—Neil M. Gorsuch, an originalist who is nonetheless erudite and circumspect, and William H. Pryor, Jr., who not so long ago argued that anti-sodomy laws were constitutional—there’s no reason for wishful thinking, for imagining that things are mellowing out when in fact they are rotting through. As Thomson told me of the Apocalypse scent, “The cloying sweetness is what sticks in my nostrils. That is where the bile and dread hide in plain sight.” Daniel Wenger is a member of The New Yorker’s editorial staff.

U.S. online seller Amazon said it will increase its investment in Joyo.com, one of China's leading online shopping websites. Loss-making Joyo has been growing fast since Amazon bought the Chinese company for 75 million USD in 2004.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like "tombstones" across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises "protection" to prevent foreigners from "destroying" manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be "destroying" more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns The Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the Pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation's commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy's, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing another 150 (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation's population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Wal-Marts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Wal-Mart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Wal-Mart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy's and other "anchor tenants" that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, The New York Times reported that online retailing "has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America." The Times quoted specialists' calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, "destroyed" lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it "is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did." If so, the "problem" is productivity. Nutting says "Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy's does." The Times reports that "the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee's or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge's Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers' choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today's faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs "saved" but not those which, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy's flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels' nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America's first merchant to offer "a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen." It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy's versus Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good. George F.

To make sense of all of this information, and put it to work solving problems, the company has created what it calls its Data Café – a state-of-the-art analytics hub located within its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters. Here, over 200 streams of internal and external data, including 40 petabytes of recent transactional data, can be modelled, manipulated and visualized. Teams from any part of the business are invited to bring their problems to the analytics experts and then see a solution appear before their eyes on the nerve centre’s touch screen “smart boards”.

Target will launch its own mobile payments system this year Posted Jan 24, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Ford hires Apple, Nike and Burberry alum to lead global branding efforts Target’s CartWheel application has grown to some 27 million shoppers who have used it over the past three years following its debut to save over $600 million at checkout. Now, the retailer hints it may be adding mobile payments to the app, and potentially its main Target application, as well. The company didn’t confirm which of the two, or if both, would be updated to include mobile payments functionality, only that it was planned for this year. However, it makes sense that Cartwheel would be updated with this feature. The app already offers consumers a barcode they display at checkout to save on their purchases, among other features. It’s basically a modern-day alternative to clipping coupons as users add selected savings to their list, then receive those discounts via the barcode scan. Adding the ability to also transact with a barcode scan seems to follow. The news was first reported by Recode, who spoke with Chief Information and Digital Officer Michael McNamara at the National Retail Federation conference in New York. (Target confirmed the report as accurate.) The retailer said that it would “at least initially” make its mobile payments service available to Target REDcard holders – a comment that doesn’t seem to rule out broadening its scope in the future. This would make Target the third major big box store to launch its own mobile payments system. Walmart introduced its own Walmart Pay at the end of 2015 and Kohl’s more recently debuted Kohl’s Pay, along with its own loyalty and rewards program, into its mobile app. But Target has an advantage in making its mobile payments platform work where others failed – including CurrentC, the payments system a consortium of retailers (including Target and Walmart) once backed. Meanwhile, Target’s CartWheel app is already popular with mainstream consumers, easily maintaining its top 10 status in the App Store’s “Shopping” category, for example. And according to a 2016 report, CartWheel isn’t just a popular download, it keeps people engaged, too. As of early last year, it had a reported 13 million-plus active user base. “CartWheel is Target’s mobile advantage over most other retailers. It gives Target a much larger and more frequent mobile application user base than almost any other retailer,”  Jason Goldberg, SVP of commerce and content at digital marketing agency Razorfish, previously noted. In other words, retailers in general may be fumbling with their mobile initiatives, but Target is something of an outlier in terms of real-world adoption and usage. That being said, REDcard holders only make up a portion of the app’s user base. That would make Target’s foray into mobile payments something that’s more of a perk for cardholders than a feature that would be universally adopted, unless Target chooses to expand this feature to be more inclusive. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Cartwheel App Description Target savings, mobile style Website http://cartwheel.target.com/ Full profile for Cartwheel App Target Founded 1962 Overview Expect the Best.

Straight Talk offers cheap monthly plans with plenty of minutes, texting and 4G LTE data. It is a very attractive option for users who want the new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus but need a lower monthly bill. Advertisement With the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers pay the full price for the new iPhone, but the cheaper monthly plan prices still lead to savings over traditional carriers. A Straight Talk iPhone 6 sounds like a great deal, but there are things that buyers need to know before signing up and paying $650 for a new iPhone. You can bring your current iPhone to Straight Talk, or you can now buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 direct from the carrier or at Walmart. What you need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before you buy. Advertisement A Straight Talk iPhone plan starts at $45 a month and $60 a month for international calling. For the lower price there are some trade-offs that you need to be aware of before you buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6. Advertisement This is a pre-paid carrier, but you can set up an auto-pay plan so you aren’t always entering in codes and remembering a monthly payment. You’ll need to compare a variety of plans to make sure you are getting a deal, but for the same $45 a month you get vastly less data and need to pay for the phone each month on Verizon or $60 a month for just 1GB of data. Here are 7 facts buyers need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before buying the new iPhone on this popular pre-paid carrier. Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus The great news is that you can buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 or Straight Talk iPhone 6 Plus. Normally we see some limitations on other carriers, but Apple is letting anyone get in on the iPhone 6 Plus demand. All of these details apply to both of the new iPhones. Advertisement Read: iPhone 6 Plus Review The Straight Talk iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 6 Plus a 5.5-inch display. The iPhone 6 Plus features a higher resolution 1080P display and a camera with optical image stabilization. Both new iPhones use an Apple A8 processor, come with many sensors and an all metal design. 16GB Only, But All Color Options There is no 64GB Straight Talk iPhone 6 available. Like Walmart, the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are only available with the lowest amount of storage. Although a 16GB iPhone 6 is enough for some users, there are good reasons not to buy the 16GB iPhone 6. Straight Talk offers all colors, but only 16GB options. On the upside, you can buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in all three colors. This includes gold, solver and space gray. Here’s help deciding which iPhone 6 color to buy. Advertisement 4G LTE Data for the Straight Talk iPhone 6 Straight Talk started offering 4G LTE data last year, which means consumers can enjoy the same speeds as on major carriers. This is key to a good iPhone 6 experience, since many apps and services assume you are using a fast connection. Watch the iPhone 6 speed test in the video below. Same Network as Major Carriers As the iPhone 6 speed test video shows, 4G LTE speeds and coverage vary between carriers. The good news about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 is that it connects to the same networks as the big names in wireless. Straight Talk does not list the specific networks but it is very likely that the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus purchased from Walmart will run on AT&T. There is a chance it will run on Verizon, but it is less likely. Here’s a look at Straight Talk coverage. Advertisement Unlimited Data With a Catch When you look at the Straight Talk iPhone 6 plans you’ll see unlimited data listed, but it isn’t unlimited. Despite the need for an asterisk, Straight Talk is more up front than in earlier years. You aren’t cut off after a set amount, but your data is slowed down after you use 3GB of high-speed data in a 30 day period. You’ll still connect, but it will likely be at slower 3G speeds. At the end of the 30 day period you’ll get your high-speed data back. Straight Talk still reserves the right to cancel your line if you use too much data, but the new terms better explain limits and use. Customer Support isn’t Up to Big Names The last time Gotta Be Mobile used Straight Talk and needed support, we ended up bounced between Straight Talk and Tracfone with no real resolution to our problem. Friends and family who switched to Straight Talk and brought their own iPhones found little help when data connectivity failed, despite a simple software solution. You may receive good support, but there is not the same store and support agent availability as with the bigger carriers, so keep that in mind. No Tethering There is no support for tethering or personal hotspots with Straight Talk. That means you can’t use the new Instant Hotspot between your Straight Talk iPhone 6 and Mac running OS X Yosemite. No hotspot or tethering options on the Straight Talk iPhone 6. In fact you can’t use any type of hotspot or Internet Sharing. It is not included in any plans and if you are eventually able to use an iPhone 6 jailbreak to do this, you risk cancellation by Straight Talk. 22 Responses 10/30/2014 Alex Reply What’s wrong with this picture? 10/30/2014 Randal Reply Check out this line of iPhone compatible projectors, display your pictures, iTunes content, and any other apps while on the go with one of these PICO projectors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjECbaLd_ac&list=UUAgQDzRklgm9Ku7EVkqBbHA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upe6CzwbhNc 11/16/2014 Amina Reply Is there a trade in option with straight talk?

There are 31 days in July, which means your buddy’s mother-in-law would have worked $21480/$63=341hrs, or 341/31=11hrs/day. 11*7=77hrs/wk. I mean, if I was making $63/hr, I’d probably be working 77hrs/wk too, because I’d be making $258k but I don’t think that 77hrs/wk is classified as “a few hours”. 10/20/2015 D Reply Straight Talk customer service is worse than horrible 11/27/2015 J Reply Why do you need customer service? 12/07/2015 A Reply I bought the iPhone 6s and have had a horrible month of the internet working when it wants to 12/18/2015 Stacy Snider Reply I paid a lot for the 5c iPhone in March & half the time or more the Internet doesn’t work, if I hadn’t spent so much for the phone I wouldn’t be as upset as I am.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Political Pulse Your political and regional news source News Politics Central Florida Political Pulse 'Liquor wall' bill clears 1st committee Tallahassee Orlando Sentinel file Orlando Sentinel file News Service of Florida Privacy Policy TALLAHASSEE —  A measure that would allow Floridians to mix vodka and veggies in their shopping carts -- something prohibited for more than eight decades --- sailed through a Senate committee on Thursday. The Regulated Industries Committee, in a 9-1 vote, backed the latest proposal (SB 106) to repeal a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." The measure could be a boon to some "big box" retailers. Meanwhile, lawmakers are looking to exclude some small gas stations and neighborhood convenience stores if the proposal becomes law. The proposal, which has failed to advance in past sessions, pits retailers Wal-Mart and Target, both in favor of the repeal, against Lakeland-based shopping giant Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits. Sen. Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville, said she doesn't see the proposed change causing small independent liquor stores to go out of business, as they would continue to attract "niche" customers. "It's a whole different demographic," Gibson said in voting for the proposal. "I go to (an) ABC (in Jacksonville). There is a Wal-Mart I can take the next exit to go to that has a (separate) liquor store there, but I go to that ABC because they have certain brands that I don't believe that a Wal-Mart will ever have." Sen. Keith Perry, a Gainesville Republican who cast the lone vote against the measure, said after the meeting he's open to revisions in the bill but for now has concerns about access to alcohol by minors. "I have teenage daughters, and I have a sophomore in college, and access now is pretty available, whether in bar or places," Perry said. "It's not the competitiveness that I'm concerned about. I think we should have less barriers for business." The proposal is intended by its sponsor, Miami Republican Anitere Flores, to give shoppers more convenience. The bill would allow hard spirits such as whiskey and rum to be sold alongside beer, wine and groceries in traditional supermarkets and other stores that sell groceries. The measure would also allow liquor stores to expand their grocery options. Jason Unger, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would "enable us to meet our customers' demands." Publix views stand-alone liquor stores directly adjacent to its regular stores as a business model. Scott Dick, a lobbyist for the Florida Independent Spirits Association, said the change would give the big-box operators an unfair competitive advantage over small liquor-store owners. "We operate under a level playing field today," Dick said. Charles Bailes, CEO of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, argued big-box stores have been able to compete under the existing law and that there hasn't been a public outcry for the repeal. He also said the change would make liquor more accessible for minors to steal.

Democrat and Chronicle Published 2:15 p.m. ET Jan. 26, 2017 | Updated 4:08 p.m. ET Jan. 26, 2017 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Federal law enforcement talk about the sentencing of ISIL sympathizer Emanuel Lutchman and Lutchman's courtroom outburst after Lutchman's sentencing. Tina MacIntyre-Yee Emanuel Lutchman, who pleaded guilty in August 2016 to conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorism organization, was sentenced Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017, to 20 years in prison. He was accused of planning a terror attack in Rochester on New Year's Eve 2015. (Photo: Carlos Ortiz, Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle) ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Before he planned to attack patrons at a New York bar in an Islamic State-inspired crime, Emanuel Lutchman had another plot: He would kill his wife. The FBI had not planned to arrest Lutchman on Dec. 30, 2015, when it did — a day before Lutchman intended to wield a machete and attack New Year's Eve patrons at a Rochester, N.Y., bar. But agents learned Lutchman had told an FBI informant that he wanted to kill his wife — Lutchman had earlier been convicted of menacing her — and agents believed they had to intervene for the woman's safety. "We were getting worried that he was taking serious steps" to find his wife, FBI Special Agent Joseph Testani said Thursday, after Lutchman was sentenced to 20 years for conspiring to assist the terrorist organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIL or ISIS. USA TODAY Man pleads guilty in plot to attack New York bar On Thursday, U.S.District Judge Frank Geraci Jr. sentenced Lutchman, 26, to the maximum sentence of 20 years. Only moments before, Lutchman had tearfully apologized to the court and his family. He said he had renounced ISIL and its plans to violently establish a caliphate in the Middle East. But once Geraci imposed the sentence, Lutchman turned angry and defiant. "You think because I'm going to be incarcerated there aren't going to be more of us that rise up," Lutchman said, his voice rising. Geraci responded calmly, saying that Lutchman apparently still adhered to ISIL's tenets, despite his assertions to the contrary. "Yes I do," Lutchman answered. "… There's going to be more of us." For prosecutors and police, the outburst was evidence of Lutchman's danger. A man who has struggled with mental illness for much of his life, Lutchman has been portrayed by family and supporters as a fragile individual who was hand-held into the terrorist plot by an FBI informant. But Lutchman's anger, which included shouts and rants in Arabic, were proof of his "true colors," said assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Harvey, the prosecutor in the case. At Lutchman's sentencing Thursday, Harvey detailed how Lutchman had initiated contact with a Syria-based ISIL recruiter, who directed Lutchman to commit a crime on U.S. soil. USA TODAY N.Y. terror suspect pledged allegiance to Islamic State A felon who'd been imprisoned for robbery, Lutchman could not buy a gun. So he decided to attack the patrons at Merchants Grill in Rochester with a machete and knives, and possibly take some hostages, authorities say. "He's a zealous and ardent supporter of the Islamic State," Harvey said. “You think because I'm going to be incarcerated there aren't going to be more of us that rise up.”Emanuel Lutchman Lutchman recorded a video in which he told of his planned New Year's Eve assault. He'd been told to create the video by the recruiter for ISIL, and the Islamic State aimed to use it for propaganda, Harvey said. At sentencing, Lutchman's attorney,  Steven Slawinski, an assistant federal public defender, highlighted Lutchman's mental health problems, including bipolar disorder, depression and suicidal ideations. Lutchman, who often panhandled in the same neighborhood as the Merchants Grill, was so destitute that the FBI informant accompanied him to Walmart on Dec. 29, 2015, and spent $40 to buy the machete, knives and zip ties that Lutchman intended to use in his attack. "The risk of danger here is exaggerated by the government," said Slawinski, who had argued in court papers for a 10-year sentence for Lutchman. Lutchman's anger toward his wife was not mentioned in court, or in court papers. But, in an interview after the sentencing, FBI agent Testani said law enforcement arrested him when they did because of Lutchman's comments that he wanted to seek out his wife and kill her. USA TODAY FBI wanted terror suspect as informant, grandma says The wife, who has a 2-year-old son with Lutchman, had an order of protection against him. The FBI and other members of the regional Joint Terrorism Task Force were preparing the legal papers to arrest Lutchman and head off the New Year's Eve plot when they learned that he'd told the informant of his murderous intentions toward his wife.

The informant, who had been working with the FBI, was able to connect with Lutchman. Agents arrested Lutchman in a car with the informant. Lutchman was "intent on doing it ... and irrational," Testani said of Lutchman's desire to kill his wife. Lutchman pleaded guilty in August to providing "material support" to a terrorist organization —  a sweeping law designed to battle terrorism in the United States. USA TODAY N.Y. terrorism cases likely shared same informant In court Thursday, Geraci acknowledged Lutchman's mental struggles, but said that same psychological fragility "also created a real danger in this community." Lutchman's ISIL-motivated video, in which he told how he intended to attack the Merchants Grill, was proof of his seriousness to carry out the crime, Geraci said. "That video ... indicates that this was the real deal," Geraci said. "People were going to die at the Merchants Grill on New Year's Eve, but for the intervention of law enforcement." As U.S. Marshals Service deputies removed Lutchman from court after his eruption, he shouted back at Geraci, "(Expletive) you!" An unfazed Geraci responded, "Motion denied."

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

She reported the incident to Wahpeton Police and days later hasn't heard back. That's when she contacted our Whistleblower Hotline looking for help. Jenny McQuiston is a mother of soon to be eight children. Over the weekend, she went food shopping with her three-year-old daughter. While in Walmart, a man caught their attention and asked the little girl's name. Mom said "Elliana" and continued on. Later after checking out, the mother-daughter pair were in an exit area looking at a Redbox. "And that same man that wanted to know her name came around and picked her up from behind under her arms and he said, 'Got one!'" explains the mother from Wahpeton. McQuiston yelled and the man dropped her daughter saying, "Just joking!" The man left and following the incident McQuiston knew it had to be reported with police and Walmart but was later extremely disappointed with what police told her. "Based on what they saw on surveillance, they don't think that the man was meaning any harm," she says. "For you to arrest anybody, you have to either have a warrant charging them with a crime already or you have to have probable cause that they've committed an offense and right now we're absent of those things," says Scott Thorsteinson. The Wahpeton Police Chief says cases like this are not as easy as you think but they are working alongside Walmart to identify the suspect who is described as being a regular shopper. But for this mother, that is not enough because now her concern isn't just for her children but for her entire community. "You know if he had pulled a gun on somebody and when he was caught backed up and said, 'Just joking!' would he still be out there just wondering around?" adds McQuiston. Wahpeton Police recommends never giving your child's name out to strangers in public, always have your children close by you and to never leave them unattended. The Police Chief also invites McQuiston to contact the department if she has any concerns as they continue getting to the bottom of this. Chief Thorsteinson did not give us a description of the suspect, but according to McQuiston, the suspect is a white male in his 40s with red hair and some facial hair who was wearing a Harley Davidson black sweater jacket with a black leather hat.

According to the criminal complaint, Dominick Garretson, 37, was taken into custody Tuesday at the North Atherton Street Wal-Mart after attempting to leave the store with about $575 in merchandise. Garretson reportedly said he received an email asking him to be a “secret shopper,” seeking out loss-prevention workers and establishing flaws in the loss-prevention system. Garretson was also found with a small jar of white powder that field-tested positive for amphetamine, police said. It was sent to a lab for further testing. Garretson was charged with a felony count of retail theft and misdemeanor charges of receiving stolen property and possession of a controlled substance. Bail was set at $2,500.

Marc Lore, Wal-Mart's new U.S. e-commerce chief executive officer, informed employees of the job cuts in an internal memo. He said the Bentonville-based retailer is "focused on adding the right talent to our team and making sure we're investing in ways that directly improve our customer experience." "As difficult as this decision is, I know it's the right one," Lore said in the memo. The cuts are part of Wal-Mart's strategy to eliminate nearly 1,000 corporate-level positions before Tuesday, the end of its fiscal year. Multiple sources said employees in the company's replenishment department were among those affected by a round of layoffs in Northwest Arkansas on Friday. The decision to eliminate positions in California is not a sign Wal-Mart will slow investments in e-commerce. Instead, Lore pointed to comments from Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon in another internal memo last week that indicated the retailer would have to make changes on the inside so customers can experience the benefits on the outside. E-commerce resources are expected to shift to other areas within the division. "While some roles are going away today, we'll be investing in our business and adding new skillsets during the year," Lore said in the internal memo. Economists said earlier this month that it's not unusual for a company of Wal-Mart's size to eliminate workers and hire others at the same time as it restructures operations. Wal-Mart employs more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] "With any kind of company as big as Wal-Mart, that's going to mean that they occasionally switch strategies and switch the kinds of skills that they need to implement," said Kathy Deck, a University of Arkansas economist and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research. Wal-Mart's e-commerce restructuring began after the company closed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com last year. Lore, Jet.com's founder, became the head of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce business as part of the acquisition. He announced his e-commerce leadership team earlier this month and the group is a blend of Walmart.com and Jet.com leaders. Lore said in the internal memo that the organization plans to become more "customer-centric" and told employees Tuesday that the retailer had a "clear strategy" moving forward. "We've structured the team for speed and simplicity," Lore said in the memo. "We're building an organization with the right talent and experience. We've created an environment where the best minds across our many locations can team up and drive great ideas forward."

(Reuters photo: Fred Greaves) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by George Will January 25, 2017 8:00 PM @GeorgeWill Economic development always leads to some job loss to competition that is domestic as well as foreign. When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like “tombstones” across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises “protection” to prevent foreigners from “destroying” manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be “destroying” more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns the Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward, and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation’s commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy’s, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores, and is closing another 150 (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation’s population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Walmarts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Walmart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Walmart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy’s, and other “anchor tenants” that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, the New York Times reported that online retailing “has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.” The Times quoted specialists’ calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, “destroyed” lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it “is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.” If so, the “problem” is productivity. Nutting says “Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does.” The Times reports that “the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee’s or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge’s Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers’ choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today’s faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs “saved” but not those that, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy’s flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels’ nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America’s first merchant to offer “a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen.” It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy’s-versus-Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good. — George Will is a Pulitzer Prize–winning syndicated columnist. © 2017 Washington Post Writers Group Load More Photo Essay March for Life About Institute Advertise Contact NR Facebook Twitter Google+ Privacy

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Amy Lamparske, W2O Group's Managing Director of Digital Media will strengthen the firm's PESO media and search capabilities across key industries. (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail January 26, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--W2O Group, a network of complementary communications, marketing and digital firms, announced today that digital marketing strategist Amy Lamparske, formerly of 3M, General Mills and Walmart, has joined to further bolster the organization’s digital media capabilities across paid, earned, shared and owned (PESO) media. Lamparske’s extensive background includes more than 15 years in digital marketing and communications with an array of organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 200 brands. “Amy has a proven track record of implementing global strategic communications plans and activations by leveraging her expertise across interactive marketing, e-commerce, social media and search,” said W2O President Bob Pearson. “She has held leadership roles that provided her with unique exposure to the breadth of digital and social capabilities and programs executed by industry-leading companies. Her extensive experience will be integral in evolving our offerings and facilitating integration within our media teams.” She will be based in the Minneapolis office and partner with Adam Cossman, Chief Digital Officer, and Jeff Rohwer, Managing Director of Digital Strategy and Innovation, to oversee and build a fully integrated digital team across W2O Group’s three operating units. Cossman and Rohwer joined W2O Group late last year as part of its acquisition of Sentient to strengthen its digital offering notably in paid media and search optimization. In 2016, Sentient had significant business in paid media (search, display, online video, etc.), and W2O Group steadily increased its management of paid social media and search on behalf of its healthcare and global brands/technology clients. Pearson added, “We continue to round out our PESO media and search capabilities, and we are projecting a significant increase in digital paid media demand from our clients in 2017. Amy will ensure we’re able to execute programming seamlessly while creating a world-class offering for brands across healthcare, technology, consumer, finance, energy and automotive.” Sentient’s digital media function coupled with W2O’s paid social and search capabilities will function as a solid platform on which the company will continue to build out a robust PESO digital media. This will open up new revenue streams for current W2O clients. The combination of Sentient and W2O also increases the firm’s competitiveness with other digital and media agencies. Further, W2O Group is building its current Search Engine Marketing (SEM) capabilities including paid search campaigns (PPC) and organic search optimization efforts (SEO). The firm is poised to add new search offerings such as “search media relations” to evolve how clients think of search in the context of their broader marketing and communications plans. “W2O Group is truly rewriting the rules and forging new pathways for clients to break through in an extremely complex environment,” said Lamparske. “It’s an innovation hub that has built an ecosystem with talented strategists, analysts, creatives, counselors, technologists and innovative thinkers all working in concert with client leaders to grow their brands and businesses.” For a deeper look into Lamparske’s background and vision, view W2O Group’s Common Sense blog post. About W2O Group Founded and led by CEO Jim Weiss in 2001, W2O Group is an independent, fast-growing network of complementary digitally-oriented marketing and communications firms focused on integrated business solutions to drive change and growth through "pragmatic disruption" for the world's leading brands and organizations.

The developer tested it with over 600 ROMs. "Everything working fine including save-states.

Users of hakchi2 can now initial a mass cover download and do not have to uncompress ROMs before installation. The new hakchi2 release is a major update and despite being a pre-release, the first users are ecstatic about it. There is renewed interest in the NES after hackers found a way to add more games to the NES Classic that increases the pressure on the NES supply. New tools make it easy for NES owners to open up the system and install more games. The instructions to hack the NES Classic Edition are available. Several stores have received new NES Classic inventory this week including Walmart and GameStop. Find the latest updates on the NES Classic supply below: NES Classic at GameStop NES Classic at Walmart NES Classic at Target NES Classic at ToysRUs Stores The reseller prices of the NES Classic have come down a bit after the Holidays, but are now increasing again to $150 plus shipping on amazon.com. It is easier to find NES Classic controllers Amazon now, although they are not from Nintendo. The Nyko MiniBoss Wireless Controller for NES Classic Edition in stock at Amazon for $18. The 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver is also in stock for $39.99. Find all NES Controller on sale at amazon.com. The demand for the NES is still extremely high. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $150 and up. Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On launch day Nintendo said: "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." Nintendo did not make any further comments about the NES Classic supply situation since then. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime tried to explain last week in an interview why the NES is suffering a shortage.  "When we looked at that proposition what we believed was the adults, 30-40 years old, who grew up playing NES as a kid, 10 years old or so but had stepped away from the gaming category--that was going to be the buyer," Fils-Aime said to GameSpot. "As we thought about that, that led us to a certain level of supply. The reality, however, was that the lapsed gamer and the "more active gamer" bought the NES Classic." This is a poor excuse. Nintendo apparently does not do focus groups ahead of console launches. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The NES Classic Edition comes only with a single wired controller. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Gamers can get additional controllers and even wireless controllers. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. In a short two months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch.

Both vehicles sustained disabling damage and had to be towed from the scene, Webber reported, adding that no injuries were reported.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Harbor Freight, Starbucks, Tractor Supply Co: Planning Commission talks a lot of plans Thursday Jan 26, 2017 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 After a hiatus lasting several months, the Planning Commission was back to business Tuesday. New Planning Commissioner James Sanders was sworn in, alongside returning commissioners Warren Cox, Solomon Rajaratnam and Cecil Yates. The other new Planning Commission appointee, Cameron Bruce, was absent. Former Planning Commissioners since elected to City Council Lindsey Stephens and Warren Cox were also recognized for their service to the commission. The commission again selected Cox as chair and Rajaratnam as vice chair. Committee assignments were also made. According to City Manager Dennis Speer at the council meeting last week, former City Planner Matthew Alexander will be returning as a contractor. Staff reports were presented Tuesday by Economic Develop Manager Gary Parsons, however. On the agenda were site plan presentations or reviews for several upcoming projects. The commission heard a presentation about Harbor Freight Tools (in the old Lindsey's Furniture building), and approved a site plan review for Tractor Supply Co. (to go in to part of the old Walmart building).  They also had a preliminary discussion about a new drive-thru Starbucks (in the old Pizza Hut building). “We do have a lot of public hearings tonight and plans to look at,” Parsons said. Harbor Freight Tools Harbor Freight Tools has leased the old Lindsey Furniture building at 250 N. Balsam St. and accessible from China Lake Boulevard. Harbor Freight Tools will use the entire 15,045 square foot building and has entered into a parking agreement with nearby Crossroads Community Church according to a staff report. Parsons reported that construction has started and that the business may be opening as quickly as two weeks from now. “They are that far along,” he said. The item was before the Planning Commission as a presentation to bring them up to date. According to Parsons, a staff site plan review of the project was previously conducted and approved contingent on several conditions, including signage modifications, controlling access to the alleyway, and double-striping and ADA compliance for the parking lot. Dave Matthews spoke up asking if the city council has to abandon the alley right of way. “That is correct, I believe,” Parsons said. “The city is not utilizing that alleyway right now.” Tractor Supply Co. The commission also approved a site plan review for Tractor Supply Co. Tractor Supply Co. has leased approximately one third (32,368 square feet) of the old Walmart building at 911 S. China Lake Blvd. Parsons described the project as a tenant improvement lease arrangement. “The building plans have been approved I believe and stand ready for construction. They have been approved through the building department process and those building plans are ready and we are ready to issue permits pending approval of the site plan by the Planning Commission. They would like to begin construction as soon as possible.” He added that the plan was for parking to be jointly used by all tenants, similar to a shopping center. Parsons said that Tractor Supply is planning to convert Walmart's old garden area into a big display area with equipment and hay. “I guess they do sell hay at Tractor Supply. It's kind of interesting,” he said. Parsons also asked the commission's opinion on an issue he said was not covered in the municipal code. Tractor Supply, he said, wants to change some parking and planter areas to display areas. “There is no code, so staff is asking the Planning Commission what their feeling is. Staff would recommend it, but its up to you. We didn't want to make a determination when there is no code.” “I am having a hard time considering this a burden,” Cox said. “The staff didn't consider it a burden either, that's why we are recommending it,” Parsons said. There was no public comment. The site plan review was approved unanimously by the four commissioners present. Drive-thru Starbucks The Planning Commission also discussed preliminary plans for a new Starbucks with a drive-thru at 1245 N. China Lake Blvd., at the corner of Ward and China Lake Blvd. The plans involve converting the current Pizza Hut building to a drive-thru Starbucks. No building plans were available at the meeting, so Parsons was asking for initial input only. “We believe this will be a time-sensitive project,” he said. “We may do a staff review on this and I wanted to get your input.” Parsons described the project as “fairly simple,” involving the re-use of the existing Pizza Hut building for a new drive-thru Starbucks. Plans would also include an outside patio and lowering the roof. “Its a large facility so it would be a large Starbucks. We are being informed that they may seek a liquor license as well, so it will be a wine and Starbucks,” he said. “We are looking for any input or major concerns you might have on this design,” he said. “They intend to use the existing sign exactly as it is, except it will say Starbucks there.” Sanders had a question. “How does this work with them wanting to serve liquor and have a drive-thru? Can they sell liquor from the drive-thru?” he asked. Michael McFadden, representing Starbucks and the architect responded. “I promise you we don't do that. They are very strict about their policies.” Dave Matthews also spoke up, expressing concern about the proximity of a nearby Christian school. No action was taken by the commission, but Parsons did take a moment to answer two other questions. For those who want to know what will become of Pizza Hut, he said, a preliminary conversation with “the Pizza Hut people” indicated they are looking at relocating their business but for pickup and delivery service only. “Do they plan on keeping the other [Starbucks] location open as well?” Yates asked. “They smile at me when I ask that, so we don't have the answer to that,” Parsons replied.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

REUTERS/John Gress/Files A federal judge refused to order Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to pay $80 million in penalties in a lawsuit alleging the retailer failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum compensation for certain tasks, the Associated Press reported. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and reasonably believed its payment policy aligned with California law, AP reported. apne.ws/2jTppuK Current and former Wal-Mart truck drivers in California sued the company in 2008, claiming a plan that compensated drivers by mileage and activity rather than hours worked violated state law. The company dropped the plan in 2015. In November 2016, a jury held that Wal-Mart owed the drivers backpay and handed down a $55 million verdict against the company for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict in the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Wal-Mart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial. Lawyers for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. Wal-Mart said that its drivers were among the highest paid in the industry, earning about $80,000 to over $100,000 per year, adding that drivers were paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires.

Lamar Ray, emergency management director, in Cook County where the deaths occurred Sunday, said he doesn't expect the toll to rise. Alexis Livingston, 18, Jamie Cantrell Walters, 33, Mary Cantrell, 62, Adreian Mays, 38, Lawansa Perry, 41, Amanda Rowe, 41, and Joe Deskins, 36, all died in the storm.  "At this time we believe everyone is accounted for," Ray said at a news conference Monday afternoon. "We used the cadaver dogs. We went over the whole area. We did two extensive searches yesterday and then today, with nothing changing." He says property owners will be allowed back Tuesday morning to see their destroyed and damaged homes - if they are considered safe. Authorities are estimating that 45 homes were damaged or destroyed by Sunday's severe weather in Cook County, and of those, 36 were mobile homes in Sunshine Acres counted as total losses. The dead were identified as five females and two males, their ages ranging from 18 to 62 years old. Copyright 2017 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

Will/Washington Post WASHINGTON — When the president speaks of closed factories scattered like “tombstones” across America, has he noticed the shuttered stores in shopping centers, and entire malls reduced to rubble? He promises “protection” to prevent foreigners from “destroying” manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be “destroying” more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial? The company is Amazon (market capitalization: $388 billion), created by Jeff Bezos. He owns The Washington Post, which syndicates this column, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the Pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers, and were as important in the nation’s commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. In 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy’s, after announcing in August that it would close another 100 of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing another 150 (including some Kmarts). Sears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalogue that put downtown goods within reach of rural America (3 million catalogues were distributed in 1907, when the nation’s population was 87 million), caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th century, Wal-Marts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern — meaning pre-Wal-Mart — global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Wal-Mart to master online retailing. Although e-commerce was just 8 percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy’s and other “anchor tenants” that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, The New York Times reported that online retailing “has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.” The Times quoted specialists’ calculations that traditional retailers have shed more than 200,000 employees since 2012, and that there are 1.2 million fewer retail workers than there would be if there were no online retailers. But Henry Ford, too, “destroyed” lots of jobs — those of blacksmiths, buggy makers, etc. — the holders of which moved on, and usually up. Writing at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it “is going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.” If so, the “problem” is productivity. Nutting says “Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does.” The Times reports that “the typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. All of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee’s or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge’s Diner, why does Madge not merit protection? Or the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is available for workers, firms, farmers, even communities that can plausibly claim to have been otherwise injured by foreign competition or outsourcing of jobs? The reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth — and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers’ choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this. Reactionary liberalism has long held, and today’s faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs “saved” but not those which, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created. Macy’s flagship Manhattan store was one reason Gimbels’ nearby flagship closed, after 76 years, in 1986. This, even though in 1945 Gimbels had been America’s first merchant to offer “a fantastic, atomic era, miraculous pen.” It was a ballpoint. Will the winner of the once-famous Macy’s versus Gimbels rivalry always be with us? Probably not, which is probably good.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday that Wal-Mart acted in good faith when paying the drivers and reasonably believed its payment policy aligned with California law, AP reported. http://apne.ws/2jTppuK Current and former Wal-Mart truck drivers in California sued the company in 2008, claiming a plan that compensated drivers by mileage and activity rather than hours worked violated state law. The company dropped the plan in 2015. In November 2016, a jury held that Wal-Mart owed the drivers backpay and handed down a $55 million verdict against the company for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled. "While we still disagree with the jury's verdict in the case, we're pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties," Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Wal-Mart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial. Lawyers for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages. Wal-Mart said that its drivers were among the highest paid in the industry, earning about $80,000 to over $100,000 per year, adding that drivers were paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires.

In a new scam, thieves are draining money from the cards once shoppers load them up. Pearl City teen Michael Tam is one of many local victims. He got a $75 Walmart gift card for Christmas and wanted to buy a Nerf gun for some fun. "I was happy that I got what I wanted for Christmas," Tam said. But when he tried to make the purchase at Walmart, there was a big surprise. "I swiped the card and it said the card balance was zero," he said. A search of the gift card's history showed his relative bought it in Torrance, Calif., but the balance was drained five days later in a different California city. "What we believe is happening is that people within the store, either an employee of the store or an actual thief, steals the cards," said Gregory Dunn, president and CEO of Hawaii's Better Business Bureau. Dunn said consumers shouldn't buy gift cards from store racks because they're open to thieves. "They'll steal the card, take them home, be very careful about opening the card up, remove the pin number scratch, record the card and the pin number and then re-affix a scratch off cover over the pin," he said. The Better Business Bureau says once the scammers have the card number and pin, they wait for it to be activated. As soon as the amount is shown, they can steal the money in an instant. "Criminals are finding new ways to use new technology to cheat you out of your hard earned money," Dunn said. Walmart's gift card policy says that lost or stolen cards will not be replaced and the company is not liable for lost or stolen cards by third parties. For consumers, the financial loss hurts. But there's also an emotional sting and that rings true for Tam. He's bummed he got ripped off by a Christmas Grinch. Here are some tips to avoid gift card scams: Don't buy gift cards from store racks. Buy gift cards online. Use your credit card when purchasing gift cards so if there's a problem, you can make a claim with your credit card company. Copyright 2017 HawaiiNewsNow. All rights reserved.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Walmart Foundation donates grants for kids, veterans Friday Jan 27, 2017 at 4:39 PM Jan 27, 2017 at 8:51 PM Tamara Browning Staff Writer @tambrowningSJR A central Illinois nonprofit was among three organizations this week that received a total $280,000 in grants from the WALMART FOUNDATION. ILLINOIS COALITION FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES will use the $200,000 it got to support its BACKPACK BITES FOR KIDS program that provides weekend meals for 571 children each week from schools that include St. Patrick Catholic School in Springfield and Riverton Elementary School. The VETERANS FOUNDATION OF ILLINOIS received $50,000 for its veterans service program, and GOODWILL INDUSTRIES OF CENTRAL ILLINOIS got $30,000 to support its veterans employment program. The grants, part of a total $1.2 million donated to Illinois organizations in 2016, were made possible through the Walmart Foundation’s State Giving Program. “Backpack Bites for Kids … is a weekend meal program for kids. Most of them come from low-come families,” said MIKE CREWS, associate director for Illinois Coalition for Community Services. “Often, kids go hungry over the weekend when free or reduced-price lunches are not available to them.” Crews said Backpack Bites will likely surpass its goal of serving 100,000 meals for the 2016-17 school year. Kids typically receive nonperishable, individual food items such as granola bars, breakfast kits and microwavable macaroni and cheese to take home. “We’re proud of that and happy that we can do that because during the summer months and then during the weekends, that’s when food insecurity is most prevalent for kids here in Illinois and, really, throughout the country,” Crews said. “We’re thankful to the Walmart Foundation for their partnership.” St. Patrick School’s development director GRAINNE MAHONEY said the entire school of 54 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade participates in Backpack Bites. “They had the option of signing up for or not signing up for, and they all signed up for it,” Mahoney said. “The kids take (the food) home for the weekends, and it provides three solid meals for them over the weekend. …. The kids love it.” For more information about Walmart’s giving, visit foundation.walmart.com. -- Contact Tamara Browning: tamara.browning@sj-r.com, 788-1534, twitter.com/tambrowningSJR.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 3  +  five  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter SMG Stock Outlook: Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (NYSE: SMG) will release its Q1 2017 earnings report before the opening bell on Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017. This will be an important earnings report from Scotts, as the SMG stock price is currently underperforming compared to the broader market. The SMG stock is down 1.62% so far in 2017. In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.64%. So what will move the stock price after earnings? These are the five things shareholders will want to pay attention to in the Scotts Miracle-Gro Q1 earnings report… SMG Stock Catalyst No. 5: Revenue Scotts is a seasonal business, and most of its revenue is generated in Q2 and Q3. For example, Scotts reported $246 million in revenue for Q1 2016. But in Q2 2016 and Q3 2016, Scotts respectively reported $1.24 billion and $994 million in revenue. For Q1 2017, the company is expected to report $232.9 million in revenue. That would be a year-over-year (YOY) drop of 5.2%. But because of Scotts' seasonality, shareholders should remember to focus on the long-term results… According to FactSet, analysts expect Scotts to report YOY sales growth of 5.8% for the full-year 2017. In comparison, sales growth only climbed 2.9% for 2015, and it actually fell 2.9% in 2016. SMG Stock Catalyst No. 4: Earnings per Share The company is projected to report an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $1.25. The negative EPS is also because of Scotts' seasonal business. For example, EPS was -$1.13 in Q1 2016, but climbed to $3 per share in Q2 2016. Analysts expect the lawn care company to report an EPS figure of $3.21 in Q2 2017. That would be an increase of 7% from Q2 2016. The Roadmap to Marijuana Millions: This exclusive 90-page "Pot Investing Bible" is now being offered to Money Morning readers. Click here to learn how to get a copy absolutely free (supplies limited). For its 2017 calendar year, Scotts is projected to record an EPS figure of $4.36. That would be an increase of 12.66% from the $3.87 figure reported for 2016. SMG Stock Catalyst No. 3: Dividend Updates Currently, Scotts pays its shareholders a dividend of $0.50, which is a yield of 2.13%. The company generally raises its dividend each August. Here's a breakdown of the total dividend payouts since 2013: August 2013: $0.438 per share August 2014: $0.45 per share August 2015: $0.47 per share August 2016: $0.50 per share While Scotts is not expected to increase its dividend this quarter, shareholders should still pay attention to the earnings call on Jan. 31 for any news on dividend hikes for the future. SMG Stock Catalyst No. 2: Acquisitions Since 2014, Scotts has been acquiring companies to diversify and increase its revenue sources. Its acquisitions since July 2014 include the following companies in the table below. Shareholders will want to pay attention to updates on how these acquisitions are performing. Also, shareholders will want to watch for news on any new acquisition plans. SMG Stock Catalyst No. 1: Marijuana Investments Scotts is known for being a leader in lawn care and gardening since 1868. When the economy seemed to be flourishing in the early 2000s, mega retailers like Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) were expanding their locations. And because each store carries Scotts' products, Scotts' revenue climbed 80% between 2001 and 2009. But after the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, Wal-Mart and Home Depot stopped expanding and shut down stores. That left Scotts' revenue stagnant. So in order to boost sales, CEO Jim Hagedorn made what some consider a controversial decision: He invested in the marijuana industry. In 2015, Hagedorn purchased two companies that specialize in soil and fertilizer for cannabis growers. In July 2016, he also invested a 75% stake in Gavita International, a hydroponics equipment company. And it appears Hagedorn's forward-thinking decision is paying off… As of December 2016, Scotts' hydroponics business generated roughly $250 million annually, according to Bloomberg. And that number will continue to climb as more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana… According to Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson, the value of the hydroponically grown plants market is skyrocketing. The global crop value of hydroponically grown plants is expected to climb from $17 billion in 2013 to $24 billion by 2018. That's a 41% increase in just five years. For Q1 2017, SMG shareholders will want to watch for any updates to Scotts' marijuana holdings, such as General Hydroponics and Gavita. Because of Scotts' diversified revenue sources, Robinson is bullish on SMG stock. In fact, he believes the SMG stock price could climb double digits in less than a year… SMG Stock Long-Term Outlook Join the conversation.

No growers would use Mirical Grow because of chemicals in it. They have purchased an organic division and a hydro division and are trying to appeal to growers. But I don't see it happening. There are so many other good pot stocks. SMG isn't one of them.

Shabazz, the daughter of Malcolm X, and her daughter Bettih Shabazz, are charged with stealing a rental truck that was carrying seven pit bulls in what police say were inhumane conditions. Malikah Shabazz is also charged with animal cruelty. (Photo: AP) A daughter and granddaughter of slain black nationalist Malcolm X have been charged with stealing a rental truck that was found in southern Maryland carrying seven pit bulls in what police described Friday as inhumane conditions. Malikah Saban Shabazz, 51, of Berlin, New Hampshire, and her daughter Bettih Bahiyah Shabazz, 19, of Stark, New Hampshire, were released in Charles County on Thursday after posting bond of $2,000 each, according to online court records. The records do not list defense attorneys, and calls to the women’s possible telephone numbers were either not answered or not returned. The women were arrested Wednesday night in a Wal-Mart parking lot in La Plata by a deputy responding to a report that the U-Haul truck in which they were traveling had been reported stolen earlier that day to Vermont State Police, according to charging documents. The truck’s enclosed cargo area contained seven dogs, locked in crates and covered in their own waste, the documents state. One dog had injuries to its face, neck and eyes that required emergency care, the report said. The dogs were taken to an animal shelter, sheriff’s office spokeswoman Janelle Love said. Malikah Shabazz told investigators that she owns the dogs, according to charging documents. Both women are charged with stealing the truck, valued at $40,000. If convicted, each could face up to 20 years in prison and $20,000 in fines. Malikah Shabazz is also charged with seven misdemeanor counts of animal abuse or neglect, each punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. The arrests were first reported by TMZ.com. Malikah Shabazz is one of six children of Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little, and Betty Shabazz. She was born seven months after her father was assassinated in February 1965 in New York City by three members of the Nation of Islam, which Malcolm X had left a year earlier.

Malikah Saban Shabazz, 51, of Berlin, New Hampshire, and her daughter Bettih Bahiyah Shabazz, 19, of Stark, New Hampshire, were released in Charles County Thursday after posting bond of $2,000 each, according to online court records. The records do not list defense attorneys, and calls to the women's possible telephone numbers were either not answered or not returned. The court records do not list any upcoming court dates. The women were arrested Wednesday night in a Wal-Mart parking lot in La Plata by an officer responding to a report that the U-Haul truck in which they were traveling had been reported stolen earlier that day to Vermont State Police, said Janelle Love, spokeswoman for the Charles County Sheriff's Office.

By John M. Ackerman January 27, 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter MEXICO CITY—On Barack Obama’s first visit to Mexico as president in 2009, thousands of people spontaneously swarmed onto Mexico City’s grand Reforma Avenue to see whether they could get a peek at the 44th president of the United States as he passed by. Despite a long history of conflict between the two countries, the Mexican people were highly optimistic about the future of binational relations and believed in Obama’s message of hope and renovation. In contrast, after the events of this past week, it will be difficult for Donald Trump to ever set foot on Mexican soil. Mexicans are a proud and dignified people and do not take well to being humiliated in public. Indeed, in response to the constant insults and lack of respect coming out of the new U.S. administration, Mexican citizen groups already have started to plan boycotts of Citibank, Walmart and other U.S. corporations. The newspapers and TV shows are full of biting commentary about Trump’s intolerant and aggressive behavior. At a rally a couple of weeks ago, one of the protesters even burned an American flag, something entirely unprecedented for more than a century in Mexico. Story Continued Below Trump is apparently confident that Mexico's weak and highly questioned president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will eventually cave into his demands. As I have argued elsewhere, Peña Nieto was instrumental in making Trump’s victory possible and generally shares the same pro-corporate worldview. Trump’s real Latin American double is not Hugo Chávez or Evo Morales, as some misguided commentators have suggested, but Peña Nieto. Peña Nieto's first actions since Trump´s election have been conciliatory—some might say servile. At the beginning of January, he appointed Luis Videgaray, an economist with no diplomatic experience but with ties to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as Mexico's new secretary of foreign relations. And the day before Trump´s inauguration, Peña Nieto sent over Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán to the United States as a demonstration of his willingness to collaborate with the new administration. But Trump has underestimated the response of the Mexican people. Even before Jan. 20, Mexico was already a tinderbox. The drastic reduction of international oil prices along with the collapse in the value of the Mexican peso—50 percent since Peña Nieto took power in 2012—has led to a serious fiscal crisis along with a jump in inflation. The government has responded with the highly questionable strategy of squeezing consumers through new taxes on gasoline and hiking the prices on public utilities, such as electricity. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back. On Jan. 1, the day the new gas and electricity prices came into effect, tens of thousands of angry citizens took to the streets throughout the country. Since then there have been marches and protests almost every day. Just about every city, small, medium or large, has participated in the mobilizations and the protests have quickly morphed from being about gas and electricity prices to a broader set of demands. Mexicans blame Peña Nieto’s privatizing oil reforms for the weakness of Mexican oil production and thereby the increase in oil prices. Corruption scandals have drawn close to the president’s inner circle, including former governors Humberto Moreira and Javier Duarte, fueling further outrage. Recent polls place his approval rating at 12 percent, the lowest for any Mexican president in modern history. Mexicans are demanding a full overhaul of the entire political system. This is the context that explains Peña Nieto’s surprising cancellation of next Tuesday's meeting with Trump in the White House. In other circumstances, Peña Nieto would have been willing to subject himself to Trump's abuse and even explore different options for Mexico making a contribution to the border wall. After all, in his frequent meetings with Obama, Peña Nieto never uttered a forceful word or gave any sign of standing up to Washington. Only after Trump and his team embarrassed him and threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican goods has he shown any hint of a backbone. The two leaders spoke again on Friday, and issued face-saving statements on the need to “work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales” while agreeing to disagree on who would pay for Trump’s wall. “Both presidents have instructed their teams to continue the dialogue to strengthen this important strategic and economic relationship in a constructive way,” the White House readout said. But it’s other politicians, such as left-wing presidential hopeful Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who have best expressed the feeling on the streets. López Obrador has called on Peña Nieto to formally bring charges against Trump to the United Nations for human rights violations and has announced a tour to the United States to construct a binational “citizen front” against xenophobia. The greatest beneficiary of Peña Nieto’s humiliation will indeed be the left—and not just in Mexico. In the midst of the Twitter exchange between Peña Nieto and Trump, in which the U.S. president wrote, “Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW!”, Bolivian President Evo Morales reached out to the Mexican people: “I make a call to our Mexican brothers to look more to the south; to build unity together on the basis of our Latin American and Caribbean identity.” As of noon on Friday, Morales’ tweet has been retweeted 10 times more than any other tweet in the Bolivian president’s entire timeline. Many have noted that the Mexican economy relies heavily on exports to the United States Some 16 percent of U.S. exports go to Mexico, while 80 percent of Mexico’s go to the United States. So it would seem Peña Nieto has little recourse but to accede to Trump’s demands. The Friday Cover Trump’s Yuge Week One By Michael Grunwald FOURTH ESTATE Trump the Bully By Jack Shafer SOAPBOX Trump’s Bad Voter Fraud Math By Chris Ashby Consider, however, that the Mexican economy is the 15th largest in the world, with an annual GDP of $1 trillion, and is the second-largest market for U.S. goods. And Mexico has the means to retaliate for any Trump punishments. Dean Baker, for instance, an economist at the D.C.-based think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research, has proposed that Mexico simply refuse to enforce U.S. patents and copyrights on its soil, for instance in the area of pharmaceuticals or technology. Expensive drugs and software could immediately be provided at bargain-basement prices—generating incredible savings for Mexicans and significantly cutting into the profits of major U.S. corporations. That, of course, would probably mean leaving the North America Free Trade Agreement, the trade pact that Trump has vowed to renegotiate. Even stalwart neoliberal supporters of NAFTA among Mexico’s political class have begun to argue that it wouldn’t be so bad to simply walk away from it. Last Tuesday, Mexico’s economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo made this threat official, telling a television interviewer: “If we go for something that is less than what we have, well, then there is no sense in staying.” Trump’s attitude has led to a transformation of Mexico’s medium and long term economic calculations. Although a withdrawal from NAFTA would create short-term pain, it would also create the opportunity for Mexico to finally delink itself from its excessive dependency on the U.S. economy and consolidate its alliances with other Latin American countries as well as with Europe and Asia. Ironically, Trump’s attack on Mexico may be just what Mexicans need to wake up and smell the coffee. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter John M.

(Darryl Dyck For The Globe and Mail) Shoes.com Chairman and Co-founder Roger Hardy. (Darryl Dyck For The Globe and Mail) Vancouver's Shoes.com shuts down operations Add to ... Sean Silcoff The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 4:37PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 6:05PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article Vancouver e-commerce company Shoes.com Technologies Inc. shut down operations effective Friday, and will work with its lenders to liquidate its assets and assign some of its companies to bankruptcy. The company took its websites offline and said it had closed its two stores in Vancouver and Toronto. It’s an abrupt end for a company that was once touted as an IPO hopeful, as chairman and CEO Roger Hardy hoped to repeat the success of his previous e-commerce company – online eye wear merchant Coastal Contacts – which he sold in 2014 to Essilor International for $430-million. Shoes.com had previously said it brought in more than $200-million in revenue two years ago and had hopes to reach $1-billion by 2020. Mr. Hardy did not return messages Friday. Shoes.com’s forerunner started in 2012 as Shoeme.ca, when former Coastal employee Sean Clark started an online shoe merchant after Zappos pulled out of the Canadian market. Mr. Hardy was an early investor and became CEO shortly after selling Coastal. Part of his strategy was to consolidate the online shoe market, and he raised tens of millions of dollars to fund acquisitions across North America, including rights to the shoes.com website from U.S. footwear retailer Brown Shoe Co. But earlier this month rival online shoe maker Shoebuy.com sold to Wal-Mart for $70-million (U.S.). Combined with the fact market leader Zappos was already owned by e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc., Shoes.com faced a much tougher competitive environment. By then the Vancouver company was already struggling. A story in the Vancouver Sun last fall revealed the company was plagued by customer service issues and peppered by legal claims from unpaid suppliers.  New president Brad Wilson, a former GM with Expedia Inc.’s Travelocity unit, was hired last summer to turn the company around, saying at the time he had “jumped in, feet first” to the opportunity. Through the course of last year the company laid off two-thirds of staff and outsourced some work. “There are a number of things that we’re doing that are pretty consistent when a new president or CEO comes in and looks at the business and establishes a path forward,” Mr, Wilson told BIV two months ago. As of Friday, Mr. Wilson’s LinkedIn profile made no mention of his tenure at Shoes.com. Shoes.com’s demise is the latest in a string of e-commerce disappointments, as companies including Canada’s Shop.ca and Beyond the Rack and U.S. retailers One Kings Lane and Hayneedle either filed for creditor protection or sold for a fraction of their former value. At the same time, many other e-commerce merchants continue to thrive, as evidenced by the strong growth of Ottawa-based online retail management platform Shopify.com and last year’s sale by upstart Dollar Shave Club to Unilever for $1-billion. E-commerce sales are expected to expand well ahead of overall retail sales in Canada and internationally through the end of this decade, according to eMarketer. Doug Stephens, founder of consultancy Retail Prophet, said the company suffered from having too few managers from the fashion industry and too many from the technology sector. And customer service “wasn’t where it needed to be to give online customers the level of confidence necessary – especially in such a tricky category ...” “It seems a matter of biting off way more than they could chew through a spate of acquisitions,” Mr. Stephens said. “Despite all the appearances of growth, market awareness was still quite low.” As well, Amazon.com Inc. “has been a juggernaut both in terms of its penetration into the Canadian market and in the North American apparel market generally. I think investors are recognizing that competing head to head against Amazon online is practically foolhardy at this point, unless you’re tremendously specialized.” David Ian Gray of retail consultancy DIG360 also said the company was lacking executives with retail experience. “Shoppers want shoes that look good and fit well with minimal fuss,” Mr. Gray said. “The price can lure them in but getting two left shoes in a box or limited call-centre access – fail.” Mr. Gray said e-commerce operators have a tough time running profitable businesses. “Many early investors are so eager to exit there is little incentive to build a complete model for the long term.” Suthamie Poologasingham, director of marketing and research at consultancy J.C. William Group, noted that giant shoe specialist Zappos.com tried and failed in Canada, where companies have trouble achieving economies of scale because of the relatively small population. “They would have needed to have a unique offering and/or sell internationally as well.” And companies that have both e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar stores as an “omni-channel” operation have an edge, she said. Retailers such as Aldo with multiple stores and an online presence have found a better formula, she said.

Auto-login on future visits submit Kristi Allen / ctnewsjunkie Fast food workers hit the street in Hartford HARTFORD, CT — Fast food employees rallied in Hartford against President Donald Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, while lawmakers met at the state Capitol to push for a $15 minimum wage in the new legislative session. “Enacting a $15 minimum wage will pay dividends for over 300,000 workers in our state, who will put their money right back into our communities and our small businesses,” Rep. James Albis, D-East Haven, said. The Labor and Public Employees Committee voted to draft legislation that would increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. Connecticut last passed a minimum wage increase in 2014. The base wage was raised to $10.10 on Jan. 1 of this year. It was the last increase included in that bill. Lawmakers argued that $10.10 still isn’t enough to get by in Connecticut and putting more money in the hands of workers could benefit the local economy. “Big corporations are ripping off workers and they’re ripping off taxpayers. Low wages in Connecticut keep profits high, and then those dollars get sent to corporations and shareholders outside of our state,” Working Families Party State Director Lindsay Farrell said. For several years, Democratic lawmakers have also proposed legislation that would fine big companies with more than 500 workers for not paying their employees $15 an hour. The nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis has estimated that the legislation, dubbed “The Walmart Bill,” will bring in $305.1 million annually. Lawmakers have said they could offset the amount of state assistance, such as Medicaid and food stamps, that are paid to those same workers. “The more money you put in real people’s pockets, the more money is going to get spent. It doesn’t get shipped overseas. It doesn’t buy expensive pieces of art. It buys what people need every single day,” Connecticut AFL-CIO President Lori Pelletier said. And while Democrats said raising the minimum wage isn’t a partisan issue, Republican lawmakers and a small business organization disagreed that the law could help the economy. “Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is at best a short-term response to a long-term problem,” Senate Republican President Len Fasano said in as statement. “At worst, raising the minimum wage would accelerate the loss of jobs and result in an increase in costs for middle and working class families.” Andrew Markowski, director of the Connecticut chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business, said “Small businesses in Connecticut simply cannot afford a government mandated $15-an-hour minimum wage, and neither can our state’s economy as a whole.” Unlike in 2014, when the last minimum wage increase was adopted, Democrats no longer have a majority in both chambers of the legislature. A small margin in the House and a tied Senate could make passage difficult, but Democratic lawmakers maintained their optimism. Kristi Allen / ctnewsjunkie Lawmakers line up in support of a minimum wage hike “The proposal that James has put together is not everything the advocates want,” Sen. Mae Flexer, D-Killingly, said. “This is a slow roll out. The full $15 isn’t achieved until 2022, so hopefully that will be a compromise that will lead to the bipartisan support that we’ve seen in the past for the minimum wage in Connecticut.” Rep. Bob Godfrey, D-Danbury, noted that the the minimum wage would be closer to $20 if it had kept pace with inflation since the 1980s. “Fifteen dollars an hour is a modest request in terms of what a living wage is in Connecticut and what a minimum wage would be if it kept pace with inflation,” Albis said. Demonstrators at the rally outside the Department of Labor offices in Hartford were in agreement that a $15 minimum wage would help them. “My priorities are just trying to raise my family and take care of my children,” Yvonne Rodriguez, a Dunkin Donuts employee and mother of four, said. “A $15 minimum wage would make a hell of a difference to my family ... We put in the work. Acknowledge us for our work. That’s all,” she said. Along with a dozen or so other fast food employees and supporters, Rodriquez was protesting Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder. The demonstration was one of 30 organized across the country by the Fight for $15 group, which advocates for an increase in the minimum wage and a union for fast food employees. Puzder, who is CEO of CKE, the parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurants, has faced criticism over his opposition to raising the minimum wage and support for automation replacing workers in his stores. According to the research from the University of California at Berkeley, 52 percent of the families of fast food workers rely on government assistance, totaling about $7 billion in government spending per year. “We do deserve higher wages. We can’t afford the things we need. Parents can’t afford childcare. I don’t have health insurance anymore ... a $15 minimum wage would change a lot of things,” Burger King employee Richard Grimes said. Demonstrators Thursday overwhelmingly felt a Trump labor department would be friendly to workers. “The whole attitude of a Puzder department would be to put pressure on workers through their employers to reduce wages and prevent an improvement in the standard of living,” Windsor Town Councilman Al Simon, who had shown up to support the demonstrators, said. “What America needs is higher incomes for average people.” Tags: minimum wage, fast food workers, James Albis, Andrew Markowski, Len Fasano, Mae Flexer, Lori Pelletier, Lindsay Farrell, dh Share this story with others.

If you ever see one of their movies in the theater, even at a screening, expect to get a sea of promotional materials before the film starts. If you ever walk into Target, Wal-Mart, Toys R Us or any store of that variety, expect to see Frozen and Marvel toys until your eyes bleed. Yes, Disney isn’t necessarily one for underselling their products in the marketing department, and that’s likely going to be the same for this year’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales when it swims its way into theaters. While we’ve already seen one eerie trailer for the blockbuster, Disney seems to be gearing up to release another one now. Consumer Protection BC reports that a second Dead Man Tell No Tale preview has officially been rated. It’s 90 seconds long and it’s expected to drop in early February. An exact date hasn’t been revealed, but the Super Bowl seems like a very good bet. Disney usually incorporates at least one trailer during the biggest football game of the year, and while one would assume that Cars 3 will make it in there as well, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tale is an understandable choice. Set to premiere in May, the marketing for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean sequel is noticeably kinda shy so far, so it’d definitely help to get that next trailer out there in a big way. Like they did with The Jungle Book last year, however, it’s possible that the 90-second trailer will be an online only release, with a shortened version of the promo hitting the air. As we all know, air time doesn’t come cheap during the Super Bowl, and even Disney knows when to save money. Tell us, are you looking forward to Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tale, or have you had enough of the series? If it’s the latter, we wouldn’t blame you. Either way though, let us know down below.

Shares of Victor, New York-based Constellation Brands Inc. began falling Thursday: The company generates about 70 percent of its profit from importing Mexican brands like Corona and Modelo, and investors feared it would get hammered by the new tax. Constellation is far from alone in facing a reckoning if taxes or tariffs are imposed. U.S. companies that would suffer range from automakers like General Motors Co. to retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. and even medical-device producers like Medtronic Plc. Hostilities between President Donald Trump and his counterpart, Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico, could derail $584 billion in trade between the border nations. The relationship has made supply chains densely interconnected. American-made materials and parts make up 40 percent of the products Mexico exports to the U.S. Meanwhile, Mexico is America’s second-largest export market and third-largest supplier of imported goods. “Because the economies are so far integrated, the industries that would be impacted are extremely broad,” said Caitlin Webber, a trade analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s hard to think of a U.S. sector that wouldn’t be touched if there was a full-scale trade war with Mexico. It would really wreak havoc on the economy.” Tax Balloon The Mexican president scrapped his trip to Washington after Trump said he’d follow through on pledges to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement and charge Mexico to build a border wall. Spicer then responded by saying the U.S. could impose a 20 percent tax on all Mexican imports -- a notion he later said was just one idea to finance the wall. Separately, congressional Republicans have been pushing a tax on all U.S. imports as part of their efforts at rewriting the corporate code. Trump could likely impose a temporary tariff on his own authority, but would need Congress to impose what is known as an adjustable border tax on imported goods, according to Webber. Mexico would undoubtedly retaliate with its own tariffs and could revoke Nafta benefits for U.S. exporters, she said. Mexican Weekend An estimated one-third of goods imported from Mexico last year were sold at U.S. retailers, according to the Trade Partnership consulting firm in Washington. The pain of a trade war would spread to many facets of American life. Imagine sitting in a deck chair on the patio you built over the weekend, drinking a nice margarita. You’re wearing Bermuda shorts. Mexico helped at every turn: Home Depot Inc., which sells pavers and landscaping gear, has sourcing operations in Mexico, and in 2015, the U.S. imported $10.7 billion in furniture. The price of your tequila would likely be higher. From 2010 to 2015, consumption of the spirit rose 30 percent by volume in the U.S., more than any other alcohol category except cognac, according to Euromonitor International. That spurred the world’s largest distillers, Diageo and Pernod Ricard, to increase investment in Mexico. Those fashionable shorts? The nation in 2015 imported $3.7 billion worth of apparel and accessories from Mexico. But the relationship goes much further than this. Mexican imports also include oil, cars and lots of medical equipment. Medtronic alone has almost 1 million square feet of manufacturing space in the country for making products to treat cardiovascular disease. Spokesman Fernando Vivanco said the company was monitoring the dispute. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

Only a physical barrier -- paid for by Mexico -- can solve the problem, he has said. But U.S. shoppers would ultimately foot the bill for the wall, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry lobbying group. Won’t Pay? “The notion that Mexico is going to pay for this is wrong,” said David French, a senior vice president for the group. “This is going to be paid for by American consumers. A tariff is a just a tax on consumers. Americans are already paying billions of dollars in tariffs, and this is just going to result in one more price increase.” Retailers’ exposure to increased import taxes is now being considered by investors, said Mike Balkin, an investor in small-cap stocks at William Blair Investment Management LLC. “There are so many things companies are trying to deal with, and it’s just one more,” Balkin said. “It’s bad news,” said Trevor Stirling, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “It’ll slow down growth.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photos: Polar Bear Plunge 2017 News Nation/World 2 Malcolm X descendants charged in truck theft, dog abuse DAVID DISHNEAUAssociated Press A daughter and granddaughter of slain black nationalist Malcolm X have been charged with stealing a rental truck that was found in southern Maryland carrying seven pit bulls in what police described Friday as inhumane conditions. Malikah Saban Shabazz, 51, of Berlin, New Hampshire, and her daughter Bettih Bahiyah Shabazz, 19, of Stark, New Hampshire, were released in Charles County on Thursday after posting bond of $2,000 each, according to online court records. The records do not list defense attorneys, and calls to the women's possible telephone numbers were either not answered or not returned. The women were arrested Wednesday night in a Wal-Mart parking lot in La Plata by a deputy responding to a report that the U-Haul truck in which they were traveling had been reported stolen earlier that day to Vermont State Police, according to charging documents. The truck's enclosed cargo area contained seven dogs, locked in crates and covered in their own waste, the documents state. One dog had injuries to its face, neck and eyes that required emergency care, the report said. The dogs were taken to an animal shelter, sheriff's office spokeswoman Janelle Love said. Malikah Shabazz told investigators that she owns the dogs, according to charging documents. Both women are charged with stealing the truck, valued at $40,000. If convicted, each could face up to 20 years in prison and $20,000 in fines. Malikah Shabazz is also charged with seven misdemeanor counts of animal abuse or neglect, each punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. The arrests were first reported by TMZ.com. Malikah Shabazz is one of six children of Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little, and Betty Shabazz. She was born seven months after her father was assassinated in February 1965 in New York City by three members of the Nation of Islam, which Malcolm X had left a year earlier. She pleaded guilty in 2011 to stealing the identity of a 70-year-old woman to obtain credit cards and make purchases totaling $55,000. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Malikah Saban Shabazz, 51, of Berlin, New Hampshire, and her daughter Bettih Bahiyah Shabazz, 19, of Stark, New Hampshire, were released in Charles County Thursday after posting bond of $2,000 each, according to online court records. The records do not list defense attorneys, and calls to the women's possible telephone numbers were either not answered or not returned. The court records do not list any upcoming court dates. The women were arrested Wednesday night in a Wal-Mart parking lot in La Plata by an officer responding to a report that the U-Haul truck in which they were traveling had been reported stolen earlier that day to Vermont State Police, said Janelle Love, spokeswoman for the Charles County Sheriff's Office.

Both women are charged with unlawfully taking a motor vehicle and theft in excess of $10,000. If convicted, each could face up to 20 years in prison and $20,000 in fines. Malikah is also charged with seven misdemeanor counts of animal abuse or neglect, each punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.

Malikah was born seven months after her father was assassinated in February 1965 in New York City by three members of the Nation of Islam, which Malcolm X had left a year earlier. Malikah pleaded guilty in 2011 to stealing the identity of a 70-year-old woman to obtain credit cards and make purchases totaling $55,000.

Kelly Schneider, 23, acknowledges in court documents he lured victim Steven Nelson to a remote area and used steel-toed boots to kick Nelson roughly two-dozen times while Nelson begged for his life. The plea agreement document filed in Boise’s U.S. District Court on Wednesday outlines the details of the crime. On April 27, 2016, according to the document, Schneider posted a solicitation for sex on Backpage.com, along with a shirtless photo of himself. Nelson responded to the posting, and the two met that same night. Though Schneider took Nelson’s money, the two didn’t engage in any sexual acts, according to the plea agreement. “Before the encounter, the defendant told his friends that he was not gay and would not let anyone who was gay touch him,” U.S. Attorney Wendy Olson wrote in the plea agreement. Schneider contacted Nelson and agreed to meet him at a local Wal-Mart parking lot. There, he asked Nelson to drive to an isolated wildlife area outside of town for a romantic encounter. Unbeknownst to Nelson, however, Schneider planned a robbery and had two of friends lying in wait at the wildlife area in case Nelson resisted. Schneider began beating Nelson as soon as they arrived, and Nelson never resisted, according to the plea agreement. Instead, he volunteered his ATM number and begged for his life, saying, “Please don’t kill me. Take whatever you want,” Olson wrote. As Schneider’s friends remained hidden, Schneider kicked and beat Nelson while taunting him with a gay slur. Then he stripped Nelson and left him at the wildlife area, driving away in Nelson’s car. Despite being critically injured, Nelson managed to make it to a house about a half-mile away to get help. He was able to describe the attack to police before he died in a hospital a few hours later. Prosecutors have agreed to ask a judge to sentence Schneider to 28 years in prison, to be served at the same time as any sentence Schneider gets in Idaho state court, where he has already pleaded guilty to Nelson’s murder. Nelson faces up to life in prison on the state murder charge. Three other men — Jayson Woods, 28; Kevin R. Tracy, 21; and Daniel Henkel, 23 — have also been charged with murder in state court in connection with Nelson’s death. They’re awaiting trial. © 2017, Associated Press, All Rights Reserved.

Malikah Shabazz and her daughter Bettih Shabazz, 19, were arrested Wednesday night in a parking lot of a La Plata, Maryland, Wal-Mart, cops said. Seven injured pit bulls were found inside stacked crates in the back of the rental truck, cops said. The truck was reported stolen earlier in the day to Vermont state police. The women were charged with seven counts of animal cruelty and vehicle theft and released on $2,000 bond. Malikah, 51, the youngest of six daughters of the late civil rights activist, pleaded guilty in 2011 to identity theft charges and racking up more than $55,000 in someone else’s name. The victim, Khaula Bakr, was the widow of one of Malcolm X’s bodyguards. Malikah was sentenced to probation in that case.

Burwell will assume her responsibilities on June 1, 2017, when President Neil Kerwin steps down, after more than a decade of outstanding service in the role. Burwell comes to AU after serving as the 22nd Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a role she held from 2014 through the end of President Obama’s second term. Prior to that Cabinet appointment, Burwell was Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also a Cabinet position. She emerged as the top candidate in a very competitive national search. The daughter of Cleo (née Maroudas) Mathews, a teacher and Hinton, WV mayor from 2001 to 2009, and Dr. William Peter Mathews, an optometrist, Burwell’s grandparents on both sides were Greek immigrants. An accomplished senior government official and global foundation executive, Burwell is a leader of immense character and vision, known for her rigor of thought and laser-like focus on mission. A Rhodes Scholar, she possesses an inherent intellectual curiosity that she has applied to push the boundaries of knowledge in order to address complex problems. These traits, combined with her experience and commitment to education and research, make her well suited to lead AU at this moment in their history, as they build on the momentum and progress achieved in recent years. Burwell has managed large and complex organizations across the public and private sector. Her career reflects strategic thought leadership at the highest levels of US government, and global executive leadership at two of the world’s largest and most well-known non-profit and corporate foundations. Prior to her roles in the Obama Administration, she was President of the Walmart Foundation, where she led efforts to fight hunger in America, empower women around the world, and improve local communities. Previously, she served for a decade at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as Chief Operating Officer and as founding President of the Global Development Program, where she helped advance solutions to some of the world’s most pressing global public health issues. “My family and I are honored and excited to become a part of this vibrant AU community,” said Burwell. “American University’s distinctive mix of academic strengths, its influential scholars, engaged students, successful alumni and extraordinary location are great assets. AU’s trajectory over the last decade enables us to leverage our strengths and think in bold, ambitious ways.” University of Pennsylvania President Emerita and Rockefeller Foundation President, Judith Rodin, said, “I applaud the American University community on this outstanding appointment. Sylvia Burwell is a visionary, strategic, and talented leader with an unmatched drive for excellence. She loves learning and rigorous debate, and has a passion for engaging people, from students to scholars, in the critical issues of the day. All of these qualities make her perfect for a 21st Century university presidency.” Burwell observed, “Given the challenges facing higher education, our nation, and our world, there is no better time for American University to assert its considerable strengths, to lead and convene thought leaders, and take on the world’s thorniest problems. I welcome the opportunity to help AU expand its scholarly influence, enhance the student experience, and be a model for inclusion and innovation at a time when these ideals are vitally important.” During Burwell’s recent government tenure, HHS advanced the most comprehensive reform of the nation’s health care system in a generation; confronted urgent public health issues, such as the opioid crisis; through the Centers for Disease Control, addressed the Zika and Ebola outbreaks; and at the National Institutes of Health, supported advancements at the forefront of biomedical research. At OMB, she helped lead the negotiations that won a landmark two-year budget agreement. Burwell also held leadership roles in the Clinton Administration, including as Deputy Chief of Staff to the President and Chief of Staff to the US Secretary of Treasury. Burwell has served on the boards of the Council on Foreign Relations, MetLife, and the University of Washington Medical Center, among other organizations.

The Aug. 10-13 stage race — with pro cycling’s highest profile teams, a two-day women’s race, public riding events, live music and a rolling festival — will blend the best elements of Colorado’s lost Red Zinger Bicycle Classic, the Coors Classic and the USA Pro Challenge. “Sustainability is the goal here,” said David Koff, the chief of RPM Events Group, an investment team that includes Denver’s Gart family and local philanthropist Ben Walton, grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton. The Colorado Classic — with specific details still pending — will be the latest iteration of professional cycling in the bike-loving Centennial State and the U.S., where stage racing has struggled to thrive. It will marry the spectator-friendly urban criterium circuits of the long-gone Red Zinger and Coors Classic with the Pro Challenge’s television-friendly traverses of Colorado’s high country. The four-day race will feature 18 domestic and international, six-man teams racing 300 miles in circuits that start and finish in the same location. The women’s race will begin in Colorado Springs on Aug. 10 and conclude the following night under lights in Denver. The men on Aug. 11 will race a second stage in Breckenridge and the third-and-fourth stages will begin and end in Denver’s River North Art District. Like the Pro Challenge, the Colorado Classic has been designated by cycling’s governing body, the UCI, as 2.HC, the highest rating outside of UCI World Tour races like the Tour de France. The Colorado Classic joins the May 14-21 Amgen Tour of California, the July 31-Aug. 6 Tour of Utah and the inaugural Aug. 24-27 Tour of the Commonwealth in Virginia as the country’s highest profile professional bike races. “Coloradans love pro bike racing,” said Derek Bouchard-Hall, the chief of USA Cycling, in a statement. “We’re extremely pleased that the Colorado Classic will continue the state’s proud tradition with both men’s and women’s events.” Related Articles January 25, 2017 Will Colorado Classic bike race find “sustainability” secret that eluded predecessors? More information about race routes through Denver, Colorado Springs and Breckenridge, as well as musical acts, public participation events and the traveling festival will come soon, Koff said. Those specifics will reveal how the Colorado Classic will defy a national trend that has seen all but two U.S. multi-stage professional bike races die. The viability of the Colorado Classic “will be apparent” when those details emerge, Koff said. “We have focused on all elements on the cost side to try to make this more sustainable.” One of those elements is public participation. In the coming weeks, RPM will announce amateur events that coincide with the elite race. “We think that’s an exciting way to help connect pro cycling with your average daily cyclist,” Koff said. “It fits with our investors’ approach. We view this as a large-scale community event with participation being a major part of that.” Koff said the RPM team is “well on our way” to securing television coverage of the race, an essential yet pricey ingredient for success. International event coverage of the Pro Challenge splashed images of Colorado’s high country across millions of television screens worldwide, helping elevate host cities like Aspen, Vail, Steamboat, Breckenridge and Denver as a destination for coveted international tourists. “We  expect to have the same type of coverage that similar races have had in the last five years,” Koff said. Helen H. Richardson, The Denver PostThe peloton makes its way down Ute Pass Road heading towards Silverthorne in Stage 2 of the USA Pro Challenge from Steamboat Springs on Aug. 18, 2015. The race started in Steamboat Springs and ended at Arapahoe Basin. The Pro Challenge debuted in Colorado in 2011, with local benefactors Rick and Richard Schaden covering a nearly $10 million loss that first year. By 2015, a team of deep-pocketed sponsors — like Lexus, UnitedHealthcare and Pepsi — helped stem the losses of the statewide production. But the race still foundered, despite luring a reported 1 million spectators and delivering more than $130 million in economic impact to the state. The Pro Challenge pushed big crowds into host communities that enjoyed robust bumps in tourist spending that lingers even without the race. Local organizers see that as a sign that the Pro Challenge boosted Colorado’s profile as a cycling destination. The Schadens ceded ownership of the race in 2015 but Pro Challenge chief Shawn Hunter was unable to keep it afloat, giving rise to the RPM Events Group. Ken Gart, the governor’s unpaid boss of all things bike in Colorado, organized the group with hopes of cherry-picking the successful elements of the Pro Challenge minus the crippling cost of producing a race that roams several hundred miles of Colorado roadways. “I can’t wait to once again show off this wonderful state to the world during the Colorado Classic,” Gart said in a statement. “The Colorado Classic is being developed to appeal to not just cycling fans but a wide array of Coloradans and visitors to the state.” Tags:  Colorado Classic Ken Gart Richard Schaden Rick Schaden USA Pro Challenge Jason Blevins Jason Blevins covers tourism, mountain business, skiing and outdoor adventure sports for both the business and sports sections at The Denver Post, which he joined in 1997.

They’ve been growing naturally since 2010 in Washington State! Non-GMO Project Verified Opal Apples are distinctive yellow apples with a sweet, tangy crunch and a natural non-browning superpower. What’s more, they’re crisp, delicious, and available right now in stores nationwide including Trader Joe’s, Walmart and Whole Foods. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170127005508/en/ Opal Apples: the non-GMO naturally non-browning apple already available nationwide. (Photo: Opal Apples) Opals naturally promote healthy lunch-packing habits for kids and parents. But while most kids love apples, it can be tricky to get those apples eaten. According to data collected via SurveyMonkey survey conducted by Opal Apple, 46 percent of parents reported a whole apple comes home with just a bite or two out of it—or completely uneaten. Kids want their apples sliced — but most apples turn an unappetizing brown by lunchtime. The surveyed parents were clear: almost 50 percent of them told us their kids don’t like even slightly brown fruit. Opal Apples to the rescue! The Opal Apple’s naturally occurring slow oxidation rate means these Washington State-grown non-GMO apples don’t brown after slicing. It’s an apple that meets all lunch-packing needs: it’s sweet, crunchy and still Instagram-worthy hours after slicing. Opals are a non-GMO cross between a Golden Delicious and a Topaz, and are available in both conventional and organic varieties grown exclusively in the United States by Broetje Orchards in Washington State. Recognized as leaders in the apple industry for decades, their family-owned and operated orchards grow apples, and cherries on more than 8,500 acres – including the largest contiguous orchard in the United States. More information on the crispy, sweet, non-GMO and naturally non-browning Opal apple can be found at opalapples.com.

WIRE 8 Questions About Trump's Plan to Tax Mexican Imports to Fund Border Wall A 20 percent tax on Mexican imports might cover the cost of the wall, but is it legal? Josh Lederman and Josh Boak, Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement President Donald Trump is promising Mexico will pay for his massive border wall. On Thursday, his administration finally suggested how: a 20 percent tax on products imported from south of the border. The new measure could be part of a comprehensive tax reform package that Trump and Congress will work out, the White House said. But there was great ambiguity about the proposal. White House officials later clarified that the tax was but one possible way Trump could finance the wall. Much was left unanswered. Would Mexico be footing the bill or American consumers? What items would become more expensive? Is this even legal? Some of the details Trump's proposal still has to work out: 1. Is it a tax, a tariff, or something else? It's unclear. The White House said Congress' tax overhaul would place a 20 percent tax on imports from any country enjoying a trade surplus with the United States. In other words, countries selling more goods and service to the U.S. than buying from it. The idea is to rebalance the playing field for U.S. companies by discouraging Americans from importing. The idea appears to overlap with a plan House Republicans are pushing called "border adjustment." Under this plan, the U.S. would refrain from taxing American companies' exports, but would tax imports. The new revenues are projected to top $1 trillion over a decade. The money had been envisioned as an offset for lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates, though House Republicans say it could also pay for a wall. Trump, however, recently said he didn't like the "border adjustment" idea. 2. What does this mean for Americans? Mexican products would become more expensive. That means pricier tequila, but also things Americans need: cars, eyeglasses and many basic groceries. A Toyota Camry? About $1,000 more, according to Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, noting that a quarter of the car's parts are imported. U.S. exporters are behind the House plan because it would reduce their taxes. Here's the flip side: Importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say the higher prices for Mexican products could hurt sales. And that means American jobs. Retailers such as Wal-Mart also could face higher tax burdens. 3. Would Mexico really be paying? Not quite. The U.S. could recoup some of the wall's costs by changing the tax and trade policies with Mexico. But the money wouldn't necessarily be coming from Mexican taxpayers or the Mexican government. While the tax would land first on companies exporting from Mexico, the costs would likely be passed on to consumers. That leaves Americans footing much of the likely bill. Trump has said he's OK with being "reimbursed" at a later point because he is keen to start building the wall immediately. 4. What it raise enough money to pay for the wall? Probably. Various estimates put the wall's cost at up to $15 billion. House Republicans expect their plan to pull in much more than that in its first year. They say that could easily cover the costs of the wall. 5. Is it legal? To be determined. The U.S. has a range of obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and at the World Trade Organization. And Mexico is likely to challenge any new tax that penalizes its economy. Trump has said he plans to renegotiate NAFTA. Mexico, however, is under no obligation to soften the agreement for his sake. Other countries may also object, if their products and services are targeted. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the border adjustment is essentially a tariff that would be struck down by the WTO if it targets Mexico. 6. How would this affect the economy? A topic of great dispute. The White House said the plan would increase U.S. wages, help U.S. businesses and consumers, and deliver "huge economic benefits." With so much of the plan ill-defined, it's impossible to substantiate those claims. Any turbulence in the U.S.-Mexican trade relationship could have implications for the entire world. Mexico is the second-largest exporter to the United States, after China. The United States imported roughly $271 billion of goods from Mexico during the first 11 months of 2016, according to the Commerce Department, and ran a trade deficit of almost $60 billion. 7. Do Republican's like Trump's plan? Not all of them. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said on Twitter it would be a "tax on Americans to pay for the wall." Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was "mucho sad" and that "any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila or margaritas is a big-time bad idea." Even Trump's pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, dismissed the idea of using tariffs as a trade ploy. Republicans have traditionally hailed themselves as the party of free trade. 8. What other ways could Trump get Mexico to pay? During the campaign, Trump floated a number of possibilities without committing to any in particular. He proposed changing a rule under the USA Patriot Act to block some of the roughly $25 billion in remittances that Mexicans living in the U.S. send home each year. He said he would refuse to free up the money until Mexico agrees to pay the U.S. between $5 billion and $10 billion. Opponents of that plan say Mexicans in the U.S. would likely find other ways to send money back. They could take cash with them when traveling, wire money to a non-Mexican bank or use off-the-books transfers that are difficult to police. Trump also suggested increasing visa fees for Mexicans to raise money, or canceling business and tourist visas issued to Mexicans until their country pays for the wall. --AP Business Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit and writers Erica Werner and Stephen Ohlemacher in Washington contributed to this report.

SUBSCRIBE After a most lively year, where does live video go in 2017? As live video continues to rise in popularity, how will it evolve this year? Columnist Fritz Brumder shares his predictions on the tools and innovations we should expect to see in 2017. Fritz Brumder on January 27, 2017 at 11:25 am More In 2016, most major social media platforms launched live-video streaming capabilities; Twitch moved beyond video games; and tween-girl must-have Musical.ly launched Live.ly. Big brands started aggressively using live-video tools to connect with customers through their own sites, and smaller platforms such as YouNow.com forged ahead, even as pioneering app Meerkat left the fight. Live video in 2016 was, to put it mildly, nuts. With all this activity, 2017 will be hard-pressed to top its predecessor. But it’s also likely we will see a bigger, more diverse and capable universe of live-video programming and tools this year — and perhaps even more innovation, now that so many platforms and capabilities are available and audiences are learning to look for these experiences. If 2016 was the Year of Live’s Launch, 2017 will be the Year of Live’s Mainstreaming. Millions of people are learning to create live video, and more importantly, watching the live programming they find. They enjoy the power, immediacy and authenticity of live video, whether it’s on their mobile device, their desktop or other platforms. As a result, creators, publishers and brands will have even more opportunity to connect with consumers, employees and suppliers through programming that builds their bottom lines. So, where is live video heading? Below are some of our predictions: Multi-camera broadcasting New tools will make it easier to network multiple smartphones for live broadcasts, making possible not just new kinds of programming, but transforming the news business. The ability to nimbly stream an event from multiple perspectives, and switch between them, will take live video to another level of power and immersiveness. Some of these tools allow a producer to control switching between cameras; other tools will let viewers choose their favored perspective. Think of it as crowdsourced live video, particularly useful at events such as concerts, political rallies and protests. News organizations in particular will adopt emerging tools that let them pull together multiple live streams from a big event to more completely cover an unfolding story, switching among those streams in real time while giving audiences the power to choose their own view of the proceedings. Brands go big on their own terms The chance to connect directly and compellingly with consumers attracted more and more smart brands in 2016, particularly as their traditional audiences on pay TV, radio and print continued to erode. In 2017, brands will still spend plenty on those traditional platforms, but they’ll increasingly turn to live online video to reach customers directly. Importantly, brands won’t just rely on someone else’s platform as they move into live streaming. Instead, they’ll incorporate live onto their own branded online sites, short-cutting both traditional media companies and the big social media platforms. They will have more control over the experience and far deeper knowledge about their visitors, information they can use to build a long-term consumer relationship of extraordinary depth. More kinds of branded live experiences At Brandlive (my employer) and elsewhere, we’ve already seen significant investments by big brands such as Walmart and Nike’s Air Jordans, which added live video to their broader marketing mix. But expect that programming to evolve in ambitious ways as companies expand their use of live video for: • communicating company values and internal messaging, building esprit de corps and ensuring consistent training and processes for their far-flung base of employees. • building richer connections with customers. Imagine the home shopping networks of the cable TV world, but now with superpowers. They’ll have more interactivity, easy sales conversion and deep knowledge about each specific audience member. There will be shopping shows and auctions, product announcements and showcases, and programming that shows how to more fully take advantage of their products and those of their partners. • creating closer relationships with suppliers and distributors. For many companies, communicating their core values and messages to their partners can be complicated and challenging. Live video gives them powerful new ways to build connection and interaction, ensuring better products and relationships. More programmed live video shows The TV networks have created annual event viewing around streaming musicals live. It’s among the few kinds of programming left in traditional linear TV that drives appointment viewing, higher ad sales and buzzy social media interest. Now, take that experience, with the potential for mistakes and in-the-moment magic, and the kinds of audiences attracted by that potential, and you can see why we expect other programming, even on traditional linear TV, to go live. Better promotion tools The social media platforms typically notify audiences about a live broadcast just as it begins. As more live programming becomes scheduled, potential audiences will need more lead time to prepare to watch. The live-streaming platforms need to do a better job of allowing live events to be scheduled and promoted in advance to help build the stars of the future. Better monetization In 2016, Facebook put up $50 million to pay 140 creators and publishers to experiment widely in live video, the first time the social media giant has paid creators for anything. Expect more money, particularly from ad revenue sharing, to come into the business for creators on all the social-media platforms, at least if those platforms want to continue to have creators working there. Other sites are experimenting with other monetization approaches. Twitch, for instance, has long allowed audiences to “tip” stars directly through a virtual currency. Musical.ly does the same, and incorporated the payment mechanism into Live.ly. This direct relationship between fan and performer will finance new kinds of stars, and it will likely change the way some live programs are structured. Live video aggregator apps What could be easier than finding all your live content in one place? In the same way that Apple TV and Roku aggregate services for prerecorded streaming media, an app that connects you to all your live video streams across various social and other channels would provide a similar ease of access and supercharge the live experience. Live virtual reality and 360-degree video This is already happening, but will become exponentially more popular as the cameras and other production tools for such experiences get smarter, smaller, more powerful, easier to use and cheaper. And creative minds will learn how to fully exploit those tools to create more immersive experiences that put viewers right in the action. Expect lots of missteps, but a year or two of experience also will yield some stunning new viewing options. Are we certain that all of these will come into fruition this year? No. But we’re confident the future of live video is vast and headed down these paths. And that’s pretty freaking cool.

Obama 'spineless' for not commuting jailed governor's sentence: Daughter Share Josh Lederman And Josh Boak, The Associated Press Jan 27, 2017 , Last Updated: 11:39 AM ET WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is promising Mexico will pay for his massive border wall. On Thursday, his administration finally suggested how: a 20 per cent tax on products imported from south of the border. The new measure could be part of a comprehensive tax reform package that Trump and Congress will work out, the White House said. But there was great ambiguity about the proposal. White House officials later clarified that the tax was but one possible way Trump could finance the wall. Much was left unanswered. Would Mexico be footing the bill or American consumers?

Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017 IS IT A TAX, A TARIFF OR SOMETHING ELSE? It’s unclear. The White House said Congress’ tax overhaul would place a 20 per cent tax on imports from any country enjoying a trade surplus with the United States. In other words, countries selling more goods and service to the U.S. than buying from it. The idea is to rebalance the playing field for U.S. companies by discouraging Americans from importing. The idea appears to overlap with a plan House Republicans are pushing called “border adjustment.” Under this plan, the U.S. would refrain from taxing American companies’ exports, but would tax imports. The new revenues are projected to top $1 trillion over a decade. The money had been envisioned as an offset for lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates, though House Republicans say it could also pay for a wall. Trump, however, recently said he didn’t like the “border adjustment” idea. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR AMERICANS? Mexican products would become more expensive. That means pricier tequila, but also things Americans need: cars, eyeglasses and many basic groceries. A Toyota Camry? About $1,000 more, according to Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, noting that a quarter of the car’s parts are imported. U.S. exporters are behind the House plan because it would reduce their taxes. Here’s the flip side: Importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say the higher prices for Mexican products could hurt sales. And that means American jobs. Retailers such as Wal-Mart also could face higher tax burdens. WOULD MEXICO REALLY BE PAYING? Not quite. The U.S. could recoup some of the wall’s costs by changing the tax and trade policies with Mexico. But the money wouldn’t necessarily be coming from Mexican taxpayers or the Mexican government. While the tax would land first on companies exporting from Mexico, the costs would likely be passed on to consumers. That leaves Americans footing much of the likely bill. Trump has said he’s OK with being “reimbursed” at a later point because he is keen to start building the wall immediately. WOULD IT RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE WALL? Probably. Various estimates put the wall’s cost at up to $15 billion. House Republicans expect their plan to pull in much more than that in its first year. They say that could easily cover the costs of the wall. IS IT LEGAL? To be determined. The U.S. has a range of obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and at the World Trade Organization. And Mexico is likely to challenge any new tax that penalizes its economy. Trump has said he plans to renegotiate NAFTA. Mexico, however, is under no obligation to soften the agreement for his sake. Other countries may also object, if their products and services are targeted. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the border adjustment is essentially a tariff that would be struck down by the WTO if it targets Mexico. HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT THE ECONOMY? A topic of great dispute. The White House said the plan would increase U.S. wages, help U.S. businesses and consumers, and deliver “huge economic benefits.” With so much of the plan ill-defined, it’s impossible to substantiate those claims. Any turbulence in the U.S.-Mexican trade relationship could have implications for the entire world. Mexico is the second-largest exporter to the United States, after China. The United States imported roughly $271 billion of goods from Mexico during the first 11 months of 2016, according to the Commerce Department, and ran a trade deficit of almost $60 billion. DO REPUBLICANS LIKE TRUMP’S PLAN? Not all of them. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said on Twitter it would be a “tax on Americans to pay for the wall.” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was “mucho sad” and that “any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila or margaritas is a big-time bad idea.” Even Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, dismissed the idea of using tariffs as a trade ploy. Republicans have traditionally hailed themselves as the party of free trade. WHAT OTHER WAYS COULD TRUMP GET MEXICO TO PAY? During the campaign, Trump floated a number of possibilities without committing to any in particular. He proposed changing a rule under the USA Patriot Act to block some of the roughly $25 billion in remittances that Mexicans living in the U.S. send home each year. He said he would refuse to free up the money until Mexico agrees to pay the U.S. between $5 billion and $10 billion. Opponents of that plan say Mexicans in the U.S. would likely find other ways to send money back. They could take cash with them when travelling, wire money to a non-Mexican bank or use off-the-books transfers that are difficult to police. Trump also suggested increasing visa fees for Mexicans to raise money, or cancelling business and tourist visas issued to Mexicans until their country pays for the wall.

Now Target is planning to introduce its own mobile payment solution later this year which suggests Apple Pay support in stores isn’t coming any time soon. Recode reports that Target is planning to let customers use the retailer’s REDcard debit or credit card through a smartphone app as a payment method later this year. Instead, Target plans to introduce mobile payment features to one or more of its own apps, the retailer’s Chief Information and Digital Officer Michael McNamara told Recode last week at a National Retail Federation conference in New York City. This strategy is similar to what Walmart, another major Apple Pay holdout in the US, has offered rather than adopting contactless payment methods. Chip-enabled debit and credit cards are more secure than traditional cards, but the payment terminals typically make the payment process slower than swiping. Contactless payment methods like Apple Pay can be used by waving an iPhone or Apple Watch near the terminal for a nearly instant transaction and is also more secure than using a traditional card. While Walmart and Target are checking the ‘pay with smartphone’ box with their own services, paying through apps that require scanning barcodes is usually the least convenient payment method especially compared to Apple Pay. Target’s CEO has expressed interest in accepting Apple Pay in stores before, although that was before the 2015 holiday period. When we asked Target for an update on this timeline back in November, the company offered “no updates or new news to share at this time.” Apple Pay adoption by retailers is slowly picking up with 35% of US retailers accepting it at checkout according to Apple, and GAP retail stores are planning to start accepting Apple Pay this year.

By Bernie Becker 01/27/17 10:00 AM EST WHAT A THURSDAY: Let’s just see if we can get this straight: First, President Donald Trump seemed like he might have shown interest in the House GOP’s border adjustment framework in a Thursday address to congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia. Then Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, definitely appeared to show interest in border adjustability on Air Force One on the way back. And by the end of the day, border adjustability was just one of a “buffet” of options for forcing Mexico to contribute to a border wall. Got that? However chaotic a Thursday it was for tax nerds, our Brian Faler notes that observers both on and off Capitol Hill took all the comments from the administration as a sign that Trump was moving closer to the House GOP, especially since he’d previously scoffed that the border adjustment plan was too complicated. Story Continued Below Our Katy O’Donnell ran down how exactly border adjustability would work (imports taxed, exports exempted) — and, theoretically at least, how the framework would lead to a stronger dollar that didn’t hurt importing companies, in part by lowering the cost of the products they bring to the U.S. Retailers, oil refiners and other importers are skeptical of that logic, and Thursday showed that there are a lot of people who believe that consumers would be hurt by the plan. (Morning Tax, for instance, learned that D.C.-based reporters are very, very concerned about potential spikes in avocado prices.) The administration’s seeming new openness to border adjustability raised questions about whether GOP senators — so far skeptical of the House proposal — would follow suit, but at least a couple showed they’re far from being onboard. “Any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad,” tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Other reading on the day that was, from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. WELCOME TO FRIDAY, and to the end of the first full week of the Trump presidency. On this day 37 years ago, the end of the movie “Argo” — Americans hiding in the Canadian Embassy spirited out of Iran — happened, though there’s an argument that the ending took some dramatic license, while the movie itself shortchanged the efforts of our neighbors to the north. Hey, what’s going on out there? Email: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax. ACT STEPS UP: The Alliance for Competitive Taxation, one of several corporate coalitions dedicated to lobbying on tax reform, stepped up and backed the House GOP plan on Thursday, as your Morning Tax author noted. The group called the proposal bold, even as it acknowledged there are a lot of details left to fill. But the move apparently didn’t come without a price. ACT still has 37 members, but it looks like it lost four pretty heavyweight names — Cisco, FedEx, Nike and Wal-Mart — from its roster over the decision to back a plan with the controversial border adjustment framework. “There are a few companies who remain committed to tax reform, but decided they couldn’t continue with the coalition,” said one person with knowledge of the coalition’s workings, adding that there are still companies out there expressing an interest in joining. What does it mean? Certainly seems like proof, if you needed any more, that tax reform’s got better odds now than it has in the past few years. The tax reform coalitions, frequently featuring corporations from different sectors and with different business models, have been united on broad, gauzy principles like low rates and fewer tax preferences. Now they’re dealing with more specific frameworks that would make winners and losers out of their members, and Republican officials who are itching for a deal, so perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise that the coalitions can’t keep everyone happy. ** A message from Americans for Tax Reform: Obamacare imposes more than one trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) in higher taxes on middle class families including taxes on Health Savings Accounts, taxes on families with high medical bills, taxes on medical innovation, and taxes on health insurance. True repeal of Obamacare means repealing ALL Obamacare taxes. ** NEVER GONNA LET YOU GO: A faction of conservative House Republicans is doing a fair bit of looking back in addition to their work on Obamacare, a border wall and tax reform, as POLITICO’s Rachael Bade reports from the GOP retreat. Among the issues on the conservatives’ mind during a private meeting with Vice President Mike Pence: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who they still want out for his handling of the investigation into the agency’s tea party controversy. Pence said he’d look into it, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t put out that Trump has been awfully silent on the matter, having first met Koskinen more than 40 years ago on a New York real estate deal. SUPPLY SIDERS STRIKE BACK: Larry Kudlow of CNBC and Stephen Moore, an economic consultant with FreedomWorks, helped Trump craft his tax plan during the campaign — and now they’re worried Republicans won’t strike while the iron is hot. GOP lawmakers have said they’ll get to tax reform after they’re finished scrapping and replacing Obamacare, but Kudlow and Moore instead urged Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed to call for a big tax cut when he addresses Congress at the end of next month. How big a tax cut? Immediate expensing for all businesses and a rate cut down to between 15 percent and 20 percent, including for the pass-throughs that pay through the individual tax system, an idea that critics say would be ripe for gaming. Kudlow and Moore acknowledged the fears among some Republicans who want to do all of tax reform in one fell swoop, arguing that there’s only enough energy for one tax bill in the near future. But they counter: “Trying to rewrite the entire tax code without any Democratic support is a fool’s errand. The smart play is for Mr. Trump to save that fight for another day and deliver a big jobs plan to voters quickly.” MORE HOMEWORK: Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee found Steven Mnuchin’s answers to their questionnaire lacking, and want the Treasury secretary nominee to follow up with them, the Pro Financial Services team’s Zach Warmbrodt reports. And the Democrats want more than just information on OneWest, Mnuchin’s old bank that’s gotten some attention for its foreclosure practices. They also want to know more about Mnuchin’s thoughts on tax policy, pensions and financial regulation. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: There are a few quirks in a new poll from the Salt Lake Tribune, but it’d be hard to spin this result as good for Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch – well over half of registered voters don’t want him to run in 2018, despite the fact that they’re roughly split on the quality of his performance, as Campaign Pro’s Kevin Robillard reports. Now, for the quirks: Utah voters were specifically reminded that Hatch would be up for an eighth term next year, should he decide to run. The survey also polled registered voters for a hypothetical matchup between Hatch and former Gov. Jon Huntsman, and Huntsman came out on top generally and among Republicans. (Did we mention that Huntsman’s brother owns the Salt Lake Tribune?) MORE IMMEDIATELY: Hatch and Brady were supposed to meet with Trump on Thursday in the Oval Office, at least according to the president’s daily schedule sent out by the White House. That would have marked two Oval Office visits in as many days for Hatch, but a White House spokeswoman said the meeting was postponed to allow Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, to attend as well. WHAT’S BEN CARDIN SAYING? The Maryland Democratic senator, a veteran tax writer, is quoted in a Bloomberg story on the House GOP plan as saying “I don’t think it works” and labeling border adjustability a consumption tax. The interesting thing there: You won’t find many bigger fans of a consumption tax on Capitol Hill than Cardin, who has long pushed for what he calls a “progressive consumption tax.” Cardin’s office says that he was only questioning whether the House GOP plan would get blessed by the World Trade Organization — a real question — when he called it a consumption tax. NO DAY BUT TODAY: Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, directly broached the idea of a carbon tax in a meeting with Trump and business leaders on Monday, Bloomberg’s Kevin Cirilli reports. Musk has backed Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state — in part because the former ExxonMobil chief executive has at least sounded open to the idea of a carbon tax. (As it turns out, that’s probably more than can be said for those attending Monday’s White House meeting.) INTERNATIONAL UPDATE — DON’T FORGET ABOUT THE 1 PERCENT: U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May might have gotten a warm reception when she addressed GOP lawmakers in Philly, but Parliament members back home are warning her she needs to do a better job ensuring that the top 1 percent pay their fair share in taxes, Bloomberg reports. A cross-party panel found that income tax receipts from the wealthiest have fallen by more than 20 percent since 2009, and called on Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to find new ways to wring more revenue out of the wealthy. STATE NEWS — THE WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART: All the gridlock on federal tax reform is trickling down to hurt state revenues, because most states link their tax systems to the federal code, according to a group of experts that follow state policy. The current climate has businesses and individuals in a wait-and-see attitude, our Toby Eckert reports, perhaps delaying new equipment purchases or stock sales. “It’s the uncertainty that’s kind of killing states right now,” said Kim Rueben of the Urban Institute.

The law imposes a tax on employer provided care, a tax on innovative medicines and other treatments, a tax for failing to buy government-mandated insurance, a new tax on health insurance, a tax on medical devices, taxes on Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts and even a tax hike on Americans facing high medical bills. In total, these taxes exceed one trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) over a decade. The Obamacare repeal process is moving forward. Many members of Congress campaigned on lower taxes and reducing the federal government’s involvement in healthcare. They can fulfill both campaign promises by repealing all of Obamacare’s $1,000,000,000,000 in higher taxes. True repeal of Obamacare means repealing ALL Obamacare taxes. ** « View Archives Authors: Bernie Becker bbecker@politico.com About The Author Bernie Becker is a tax reporter for POLITICO Pro, where he is primarily responsible for writing the Morning Tax tipsheet.

In November 2015, Jon Wellinghoff, former chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, spoke to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission about the grid of the future. In particular, he addressed the issue of giving customers meaningful choices within a monopoly grid model, present in Minnesota and 34 other states. In the following video, he outlines the five key principles for guiding the rules of the 21st century electricity system. A Time of Change The first thing Wellinghoff addressed was the changing nature of the electricity system: We have central station plants around distribution systems that were vertically integrated monopolies that provided reliable, safe, and markedly affordable power for us all. Those are legacy systems that are changing He noted that electricity sales have leveled off in recent years, a great sign of increasing efficiency but a problem for sales-hungry electric utilities: It’s very disruptive to utilities. The fact is this efficiency improvement is happening everywhere. Last October, I was in Tuscany walking in a very ancient city at the top of that hill. My wife and I, away from all cares and all technologies, until I saw a street light and I looked up at the street light, it was an LED. There was an LED streetlight in this whole city in Tuscany. I think, “Boy, this technology is going everywhere.” We’ve seen far more technological innovation within other industries. Wellinghoff suggested that if you drive by a substation, there’s far more evidence of modern technology in your car than in the grid equipment. Other industries saw innovation because, Competitive forces have created opportunities in [other] industries to advance them, to optimize them, to make them more efficient. We have to figure out how to do this in our electric industry as well. Providing market mechanisms is important because customers already have a chance to spend their own money to capture energy savings: It will happen because it’s just money sitting on the table. Question is, where can you go out and get 12% return on your investment on a fairly guaranteed basis over 20 years? Anybody want to take that? Anybody else because … I took it out of my house in Berkeley and I put it to these solar panels on my roof. The consumers are making these choices. Regardless of what is done on the utility side of the meter, consumers want solar, they’re putting solar in. Markets Within Monopolies Wellinghoff began with a discussion of how meaningful market-based mechanisms can be used within monopoly markets like Minnesota. This matters for the 35 states that still have vertically-integrated monopoly utilities, shown below. He gave an illustration using the map of market prices for MISO, the grid operator for the Midwest. Already, there is a working market for wholesale electricity, pricing electricity based on its availability by location (called the “locational marginal price”). But he suggested another way to view the map: “If you look at this and then you overlay over this every Walmart in the Midwest. Think about if the Walmarts there could have accessed those market prices what they would have done and how they would have changed the operations in those stores, in those locations where prices were near zero versus where the prices were $200 per megawatt-hour. What they could have done with their operations, their HVAC systems, to have optimized their operation and by doing that, help to optimize the overall market. But right now we don’t have that real interface between the retail market and wholesale market.” In California, one way to integrate the retail and wholesale levels is with distribution resource planning. They are mapping their distribution grid system just like the wholesale market is mapping the transmission system, and getting granular data on pricing by location. If you were to put in place market mechanisms that would help consumers put in distributed resources in appropriate locations that these prices can be mobilized and you can optimize the system and lower costs overall. There’s a big opportunity as customers install their own generation, says Wellinghoff. We have to…figure out how to coordinate and collaborate between the [wholesale and retail levels] because now that we have distributed resources that are being put in at the consumer level. I believe that those resources should not be isolated by that meter simply for the use by consumers. Consumers should have the opportunity, if they want to, to use those resources for larger grid support for things like voltage and VAR support at a local level, reduction of congestion at the local level. Electric vehicles are a powerful technological opportunity to serve consumers and the grid simultaneously. Wellinghoff provided an example from the PJM market area in the mid-Atlantic. If you happen to have an electric car, we should plug that electric car in and charge it and while you’re charging that car …. you can send a signal within the car …to have that car, not only charge, but as it’s charging provide regulation service off the grid. Just like a combustion turbine. In fact, not only just like a combustion turbine, better than a combustion turbine because it can respond instantly to injections in and withdraws out and can do it very quickly and very small increments. The thing is, you get paid for it. You get paid $5-7 per car, per day. That’s a lot of money. That’s a lot of money you can use to offset the cost of that new Tesla… Five Principles for “Grid Neutrality” Wellinghoff wrapped up his presentation with five principles for designing the right rules for the 21st century electric system (you can read more about them here and see how they overlap with ILSR’s principles for Energy Democracy). Empower the consumer – give customers the ability to manage their individual energy needs, giving them choices. Demarcate and protect the commons – Establish clear boundaries for public and private interest. Consider operating the distribution system as we do the transmission system, with an independent operator. Align risks and rewards – allocate risks to those able to accept them, contain the cost of risks to those who take them. Is it better for utilities to deploy voltage control technology, for example, or to allow customers to invest in solar with inverters that does the same, with their own money and receive a rebate for that value? Create a transparent, level playing field – promote open standards, data access, and transparency. Provide maps of where value can best be added to the distribution system, for example. Foster open grid access – allow anyone who meets basic standards contribute value to the grid, without discrimination. A Big Opportunity Wellinghoff wrapped up his presentation with a powerful anecdote of the opportunity and why we sometimes fail to seize it. If you ask the classic economist, the classic economist will tell you that there no $20 bills laying on the ground, because if there were, somebody would pick them up. Well here, I’m on the subway, on the BART, going from Berkeley to San Francisco. …I look down on the floor and I see this. It’s a dollar bill on the floor. I look at her, look at the guy in front of me. He looks at me. We all look at each other, but does anybody lean down and pick up the dollar bill? Nobody. Nobody leaned down to get the dollar bill. We were on that subway for fifteen minutes, and nobody picked the dollar bill There’s billions of dollar bills laying around in the electric system. Billions of them just laying there to be picked up, but that doesn’t mean that everybody is going to go out there and pick them up. It’s your job and regulators jobs to figure out how to pick them up as most efficiently as possible. For timely updates, follow John Farrell on Twitter or get the Energy Democracy weekly update.

On Thursday, his administration finally suggested how: A 20% tax on products imported from south of the border. The new measure could be part of a comprehensive tax reform package that Trump and Congress will work out, the White House said. But there was great ambiguity about the proposal. White House officials later clarified that the tax was but one possible way Trump could finance the wall. Much was left unanswered. Would Mexico be footing the bill or American consumers? What items would become more expensive? Is this even legal? Some of the details Trump’s proposal still has to work out: Is it a tax, a tariff, or something else? It’s unclear. The White House said Congress’ tax overhaul would place a 20% tax on imports from any country enjoying a trade surplus with the United States. In other words, countries selling more goods and service to the US than buying from it. The idea is to rebalance the playing field for US companies by discouraging Americans from importing. The idea appears to overlap with a plan House Republicans are pushing called “border adjustment”. Under this plan, the US would refrain from taxing American companies’ exports, but would tax imports. The new revenues are projected to top $1 trillion over a decade. The money had been envisioned as an offset for lowering US corporate income tax rates, though House Republicans say it could also pay for a wall. Trump, however, recently said he didn’t like the “border adjustment” idea. What does this mean for Americans? Mexican products would become more expensive. That means pricier tequila, but also things Americans need: cars, eyeglasses and many basic groceries. Read | Mexico President cancels US visit after Trump’s comments on border wall A Toyota Camry? About $1,000 more, according to Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, noting that a quarter of the car’s parts are imported. US exporters are behind the House plan because it would reduce their taxes. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto pauses during a press conference at the Los Pinos presidential residence in Mexico City. (AP File Photo) Here’s the flip side: Importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say the higher prices for Mexican products could hurt sales. And that means American jobs. Retailers such as WalMart also could face higher tax burdens. Would Mexico really be paying? Not quite. The US could recoup some of the wall’s costs by changing the tax and trade policies with Mexico. But the money wouldn’t necessarily be coming from Mexican taxpayers or the Mexican government. While the tax would land first on companies exporting from Mexico, the costs would likely be passed on to consumers. That leaves Americans footing much of the likely bill. Trump has said he’s OK with being “reimbursed” at a later point because he is keen to start building the wall immediately. Would it raise enough money to pay for the wall? Probably. Various estimates put the wall’s cost at up to $15 billion. House Republicans expect their plan to pull in much more than that in its first year. They say that could easily cover the costs of the wall. Is it legal? To be determined. The US has a range of obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and at the World Trade Organization. And Mexico is likely to challenge any new tax that penalises its economy. Read | Build Mexico wall: US President Trump’s executive orders on immigration Trump has said he plans to renegotiate NAFTA. Mexico, however, is under no obligation to soften the agreement for his sake. US President Donald Trump signs an executive order to start the Mexico border wall project at the Department of Homeland Security facility in Washington, DC. (AFP Photo) Other countries may also object, if their products and services are targeted. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the border adjustment is essentially a tariff that would be struck down by the WTO if it targets Mexico. How would it affect the economy? A topic of great dispute. The White House said the plan would increase US wages, help US businesses and consumers, and deliver “huge economic benefits.” With so much of the plan ill-defined, it’s impossible to substantiate those claims. Any turbulence in the US-Mexican trade relationship could have implications for the entire world. Mexico is the second-largest exporter to the United States, after China. The United States imported roughly $271 billion of goods from Mexico during the first 11 months of 2016, according to the Commerce Department, and ran a trade deficit of almost $60 billion. Do Republicans like Trump’s plan? Not all of them. Republican Justin Amash of Michigan said on Twitter it would be a “tax on Americans to pay for the wall.” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was “mucho sad” and that “any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila or margaritas is a big-time bad idea”. Even Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, dismissed the idea of using tariffs as a trade ploy. Republicans have traditionally hailed themselves as the party of free trade. What other ways could Trump get Mexico to pay? During the campaign, Trump floated a number of possibilities without committing to any in particular. He proposed changing a rule under the USA Patriot Act to block some of the roughly $25 billion in remittances that Mexicans living in the US send home each year. He said he would refuse to free up the money until Mexico agrees to pay the US between $5 billion and $10 billion. Opponents of that plan say Mexicans in the US would likely find other ways to send money back. They could take cash with them when travelling, wire money to a non-Mexican bank or use off-the-books transfers that are difficult to police. Trump also suggested increasing visa fees for Mexicans to raise money, or cancelling business and tourist visas issued to Mexicans until their country pays for the wall. tags Donald Trump US President President Trump Mexico border wall Mexico-US border more from world Russian lawmakers back easing punishment for some form of domestic abuse Jan 27, 2017 19:45 IST US economic growth slows to 1.9% in fourth quarter Jan 27, 2017 19:31 IST Confessions of a rampant dataholic Promotional feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.
