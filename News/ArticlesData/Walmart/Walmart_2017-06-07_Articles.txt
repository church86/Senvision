During Walmart Wellness Day on June 17, Walmart will offer free health screenings in its more than 4,600 locations across the country, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time. This year, Walmart is helping to extend the event beyond a single day by teaming up with the American Diabetes Association to offer support to people who are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, one in 11 Americans has diabetes today, and 86 million more – about one in three – are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Following the June 17 Walmart Wellness Day, the American Diabetes Association will follow up via email with interested customers whose blood pressure and blood glucose tests indicated they may be at a greater risk for diabetes, providing suggested next steps and resources. “We’re more committed than ever to serving as an open door to affordable, accessible healthcare, and our Walmart Wellness Day program is a key piece of that,” said George Riedl, senior vice president & president, Walmart Health & Wellness. “We know that many of our customers have learned about an existing health problem for the first time at one our Walmart Wellness Day events, and that can be overwhelming. Walmart is proud to be working with the American Diabetes Association to offer even more support to customers who may find themselves in this situation.” Since its first Walmart Wellness Day event, the company has provided nearly 1.1 million free health screenings to people across the country. These events have helped countless individuals uncover existing health problems, including high blood pressure, signs of diabetes and other potential illness. Just this past January, free screenings topped 338,000. “An estimated 8 million people with diabetes are undiagnosed, and when left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious health complications including kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, blindness and amputations,” says Tamara Darsow, PhD, senior vice president, research and community programs for the Association. “We are excited to work with Walmart on this initiative and encourage as many Americans as possible to participate. Knowing your risk for diabetes is the first step to being able to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.” Future Walmart Wellness Days with the American Diabetes Association are planned for September 2017, January 2018 and spring 2018. Screening Information Walmart Wellness Day will take place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time on Saturday, June 17, in more than 4,600 Walmart stores across the country. Free screenings will include blood glucose, blood pressure, vision (select locations) and body mass index tests.

In the first quarter of 2017 the retail giant saw a 63% leap in online sales over the period year on year. And to further augment that success, Walmart has launched it’s first collection kiosk in US cart Oklahoma City. The service offers same day collection, and offers more than 30k items times that can be collected for free, 24/7 There’s a $30 minimum purchase. There’s nothing particularly innovative in this development and doubtless the trial will roll out across America in due course. It gives Walmart the opportunity to leverage its magnificent fulfilment network, and real estate, and offer greater convenience to shoppers. It will be interesting to see whether the new system is embraced by US shoppers. Walmart has said that they will be introducing discounts on goods that shoppers order online and then collect at a store location. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon says: “Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers, and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores.” Here’s the promotional video: Have your say Click here to cancel reply.

Customers purchase and pay for the groceries online. Walmart employees then pick and pack the orders into bins inside the 20 by 80 foot kiosk. When you're ready to pick up your order, a unique code will retrieve your groceries. There is no cost for picking up groceries, but customers must spend at least $30 in order to use the service.

Duane “Dak” Kees, director of global ethics governance, anti-corruption at Wal-Mart Stores, has been with the retailer since 2014. He began his legal career with the U.S. Army. His service included a 12-month deployment to Afghanistan and a 15-month deployment to Iraq. He was awarded two Bronze Stars during the deployments. Kees also worked as an adjunct professor at the University of Arkansas School of Law (July 2013-June 2014), and between October 2009 and July 2013 was a partner in the Asa Hutchinson Law Group. One of his duties in the Army included prosecuting military felonies and federal court cases “ranging from drug distribution and sexual assault to murder,” according to his LinkedIn page. At Wal-Mart, his primary job is dealing with corruption allegations and alleged violations of the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Bentonville-based Wal-Mart has spent more than $837 million since 2012 to respond to the allegations and to beef up its compliance protocols. It’s been rumored that the retailer is close to a $300 million settlement of the matter. Three sources have told Talk Business & Politics that Kees is a nominee for the post vacant since August 2015 when Connor Eldridge resigned. Eldridge would soon after announce his bid for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., in the 2016 general election. Boozman would defeat Eldridge with 59.7% of the vote. Duane Kees, director of global ethics governance, anti-corruption at Wal-Mart Stores Kenneth Elser has served as acting U.S. Attorney for the district since August 2015. Nominations for the politically-appointed post are sent by the state’s U.S. Senators to the White House for vetting and approval. Such approval includes background checks by the Department of Justice. The office of U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., declined to say who was nominated, only saying that, “Senator Boozman has submitted nominations to the White House for federally appointed positions in Arkansas,” and added later, “Senator Boozman’s office will not confirm any names for federal positions submitted to the White House.” In early May, the office of U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the process is underway to name the next U.S. Prosecuting Attorney. “The Administration is amidst its process to fill those U.S. Attorney slots and others. We’ll continue to work with them throughout the process,” noted a statement from Dylan Haney with Cotton’s office. Boozman’s office said an announcement about a nominee “is at the discretion of the White House.” Talk Business & Politics made two attempts to get comment from the White House. Wal-Mart confirmed only that Kees is an employee. Several attempts by Talk Business & Politics to contact Kees were unsuccessful. Arkansas’ western federal judicial district includes 34 of the state’s 75 counties and stretches from El Dorado and Texarkana in the south, up through Fort Smith and into Northwest Arkansas. Fort Smith serves as the base office for the district. According to the Department of Justice website, the district has 19 attorneys and 18 support staff. “The office is responsible for the prosecution of federal criminal statutes for all of The Western District of Arkansas, from acts of terrorism to public corruption, white-collar crime, organized crime and gang activities, internet-related crimes, drug importation through Western Arkansas, and many other criminal acts,” according to the Department of Justice website. “The Office also is charged, through its Civil Division, with defending agencies of the United States, enforcing regulatory agencies’ authority, and recovering funds from violators of U.S. criminal, regulatory, and civil laws.” Comments comments Previous post TheatreSquared will break ground on $34 million facility June 23 Next post Fort Smith’s Brick City Emporium wins Ozark SBA InnovateHER challenge Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Justin Allen Arkansas legislators remain busy in the ‘interim’ Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, non-berries, and stuff that doesn’t make America great again Jason England Cash flow critical in commercial construction Marshall Ney A win for wet communities in Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, curly mustaches and lost causes Latest Popular U.S. manufacturing industry lost 1,000 jobs in May, ending five-month growth streak 53 mins ago Arkansas State University may raise tuition and fee rates 11 hours ago EPA extends deadline on ozone regulations, future of Clean Power plan in limbo 12 hours ago Arkansas legislators remain busy in the ‘interim’ 15 hours ago Fort Smith’s Brick City Emporium wins Ozark SBA InnovateHER challenge 15 hours ago Arkansas congressional delegation applauds Trump’s withdrawal from climate treaty 1,505 views Late Fort Smith City Administrator Ray Gosack gifts $750,000 to universities 1,464 views Warren Stephens on capitalism, tax reform and the Trump administration 1,083 views First District Democrat eyeing challenge to Rep.

Jeannine Degaston Isom allegedly entered a Walmart location in Cedar Hills, Utah, on Monday with her two sons, according to the Daily Herald. While in the store, she bought hand sanitizer and a pair of needle-nose pliers, the Associated Press reports, citing police records. Isom then brought the younger child, who is 7, into the store’s bathroom and pulled his two upper front teeth with the pliers, police told ABC 4. She did so without any anesthetic, police say, and when asked why she did so, she told authorities the teeth were infected, per KSL. The child’s older brother heard him screaming and crying, according to the Daily Herald, and entered the bathroom with a Walmart employee. The older brother took the child out of the store and away from Isom, police records say. The child was later taken to a dentist, who told police the teeth did not need to be pulled. The child had told his brother that only one of the teeth was loose, while the other was only slightly loose, per KSL. It is unclear whether the teeth were infected in any way. However, police told ABC 4 that the teeth did come out in pieces, not all at once, indicating that their removal was medically unnecessary. “When (Isom) proceeded to extract them, they didn't come out in one whole piece. There were multiple pieces. So that illustrates that they were still very attached to this child's mouth," a police spokesperson told the station. The incident was “child abuse in its purest form,” the spokesperson said.   Court and jail records indicate that Isom has been arrested once before, on charges of disorderly conduct. She eventually took a plea in abeyance in the case, meaning she pleaded guilty or no contest but avoided sentencing by agreeing to certain conditions in the plea deal, per the Daily Herald. She has had no prior arrest for child abuse. A study published in the scientific journal Oral & Implantology estimated that as roughly 50 percent of physical child abuse cases result in oral or facial trauma, including “dental fractures, dental dislocations (and) dental avulsions.” Child neglect often also results in poor oral health too, the study found, and as a result, the study’s authors recommended dental health professionals be on the lookout for child abuse cases.

A woman's warning about a man who gave her a "bad feeling" at a Walmart in Coon Rapids, Minnesota probably had nothing to do with human trafficking. 75 CLAIM A woman narrowly escaped an abduction attempt at the Coon Rapids Walmart in Minnesota. UNPROVEN RATING UNPROVEN ORIGIN On 4 June 2017, Facebook user Tianna Stipp shared a post cautioning others about an incident she purportedly experienced at the Coon Rapids Walmart in Minnesota: You know those really long posts on Facebook that you just bypass thinking “oh yeah, that will never happen to me? 🤔” well, this is going to be one of those, but please do not just scroll on by.. Saturday after work Kalvin brought Levi to me at work in Coon Rapids, I needed to run to Walmart to pick up some essentials and so I took Levi and went to the Walmart right off of Round Lake Blvd, in Coon Rapids, MN. We walked in and I went immediately back to the baby section along the wall is car seats and then diapers. A gentleman stopped me and asked me if I could help him pick out a car seat for his daughter. I asked him how old she was and how much she weighed. He was looking at infant carriers and so I showed him the convertible car seats. He started asking me personal questions about Levi’s age, weight, where we live, if I am from around here, and whether or not his father and I were together. I was instantly turned off. Stipp’s post was one of countless similar warnings in which a shopper, typically female, believes that she narrowly escaped the grasp of human traffickers in the course of an interaction with fellow shoppers in a retail environment.  Although the questions were perhaps bothersome and unwanted, nothing in particular set off alarm bells on first glance. According to Stipp, the man she encountered became increasingly engaged as she attempted to extricate herself from the conversation. Stipp speculated that her discomfort caused her child to become visibly fussy — at which point the man reportedly asked her if he could hold and comfort the boy: As I started to walk away- he got frantic and asked me If I would put the car seat in his vehicle for him. I told him “I’m sorry I can’t do that.” I started to walk away again, and he began following me. He stopped me again when I got to the diapers and said “oh I have a 6 year old boy. What does he need?” I pointed to a seat and said “this will be fine.” He started asking me again to put them in his car and I denied again. I didn’t grab anything and walked to the sippy cups, looking all around for an associate. . I began to ignore his questions. Levi started to get fussy and I took him out of the cart and began to soothe him. I think he could tell I was uncomfortable because he wouldn’t calm down. The guy asked me to Hand him Levi.. I told him “no, thank you.” He became persistent and said “it’s ok. I will hold him for you. ” I told him “my son doesn’t like strangers. I think I am just going To take him home.” I began down the aisle in search for an associate and there was no one to be found. The gentleman was walking next to me and his phone rang. He had a very strong accent but the parts I could make out pushed me over the edge. I heard “yes. Yes. Meet me outside the car.” I looked down the garden center as I knew he would have to pay for his items and I could easily find an associate there. I started that way and he tried to walk straight out without paying for his items- he was stopped and, as he went back around to check out as he was still on his phone. Stipp added that she summoned a Walmart greeter, and then fled the store. On advice she later received from family members, Stipp said she called the police to report the encounter: I waved to the greeter at the door as If I knew him and whispered to him “I am afraid. This gentleman was very persistent on wanting to hold my child and get me to go to his car. I’m going to go this way. Please do not tell him where I went.” I pulled Levi close and ran as fast as I could across the front of the store and back into the store to the bathroom. I cried and pulled myself together for probably 5 minutes. Peeked out the door, seen a manager and told him what happened. Asked him to walk me to my car as I wanted to leave. I drove to CVS in Anoka, called Kalvin and told him what happened. Told him we were safe. But I was so scared. I had my first Anxiety attack in over 4 years. I Called my mother, Wendy Perry and spoke to my Step Dad, Neal Perry, who told me to call the police because if he didn’t get away with my child. He will go back for someone else’s. I need thought of that.. I Hung up and instantly called and I spoke to a Sargent last night and he told me I did everything I could and Did it right. Although the story’s subtext was somewhat dependent on the interpretation of the reader, it sounded most of all as though an overbearing shopper made a fellow customer feel uncomfortable. Stipp made it clear that she felt differently: I gave them times and a detailed description of the man who tried to take my baby away from me.. I spent a majority of my day yesterday trying to wrap my head around what happened and how I could have done things differently. But I don’t think I could have. I protected my child the best way I knew how. And I’m sharing this with all of you in hopes you never have to encounter this situation. There are some sick freaks out there && I never thought I would have to encounter one. . Stipp claimed that the police told her that she “did it right” and “did everything she could,” hinting that authorities were in agreement with Stipp’s interpretation of events as a ruse to abduct children. Many of the comments on Stipp’s thread came from readers who were also convinced the incident was related to trafficking (although they disagreed on whether the mother or child was the intended victim), recounted instances in which the “same thing” happened to them, encouraged Stipp to carry a gun or conceal her identity, and repeatedly claimed that similar interactions are becoming exceedingly common. One of the recurring themes amid hundreds of comments was absolute, unshakeable conviction that Stipp narrowly avoided being targeted, and that abductions of that nature were on a measurable upswing: We contacted the Coon Rapids Police Department to ask about the rumor and related claims, particularly since Stipp hinted that police reinforced her belief the encounter was likely an attempted crime. Police sent us a report pertaining to Stipp’s experience, noting it was classed as “suspicious activity.” However, they said that there are no similar-but-credible reports of abductions or near misses in the area of the Coon Rapids Walmart. Although the report notes that a Walmart associate suggested Stipp was possibly followed out to her car, the department did not appear to believe the incident was related to human trafficking. The department did look for the individual, but noted that he might very well have been going about his business unaware that Stipp was so unsettled by the encounter: As Stipp and hundreds of commenters demonstrated, the belief that Walmarts, Targets, Krogers, and IKEAs are teeming with accented men swarming with the intent to whisk women and children away is as pervasive as it is old. Dozens of nearly identical Facebook posts recount similarly vague (but shared as harrowing) accounts of purported attempted abductions in Target, Walmart, mall parking lots, or other family-friendly retail outlets. Rumors of this sort became fashionable on Facebook in or around May 2015, when a woman shared a story, later debunked, about an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store encounter. The following month, Twitter was overrun with rumors of a sex slavery ring targeting college kids at summer job interviews; later that same month a long-circulating urban legend about a theme park abduction appeared and made the rounds again. Subsequent stories included a frightening (but false) claim about purported teenaged abductors (armed with heroin-filled syringes to drug putative victims) at a Denton, Texas, Dillards, a story from a woman convinced she was a near-victim of human traffickers with gift bags in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart store, and a constellation of rumors claiming Target stores in Tampa, Longview (Texas), and Houston were populated by a legion of sex trafficking scouts. Not long after a similar claim on Facebook went viral, “Free Range Kids” author and parenting advocate Lenore Skenazy wrote about the skyrocketing popularity of social media abduction horror stories: What the heck is going on, America? This “My kids were about to be trafficked, I just KNOW it” post is so shockingly similar to last week’s, “My kids were about to be trafficked, I just KNOW it” post that it feels … creepy. A lot creepier than being at Ikea where a couple of men glance at my kids. The reader who sent me this link asked if I thought there might be some “validity” to it, to which I must respond: No. In fact, I think it’s crazy. What, two men are going to grab two or three kids, all under age 7, IN PUBLIC, in a camera-filled IKEA, with the MOM and the GRANDMA right there, not to mention a zillion other fans of Swedish furnishings? Can we please PLEASE take a deep breath and realize how insanely unlikely that is? How we don’t need to be “warned” about this? How NOTHING HAPPENED! You can TELL nothing happened, because the whole thing was described as an “incident.” And Lenore’s #1 Rule of Reporting is: When something is called an “incident,” it’s because nothing happened. In fact, my alternate headline for this post was: POINTLESSLY TERRIFIED MOM URGES OTHER MOMS TO BE POINTLESSLY TERRIFIED Skenazy notes that the tales themselves fueled the belief that trafficking is happening everywhere, but that is completely incongruent with known patterns of abduction or trafficking: So while we’re at it, here’s a snippet of last week’s note from David Finkelhor, head of the Crimes Against Children Research Center, on the likelihood (or not) of sex trafficking of young children in America: Child abduction rarely occurs in a crowded public venue like that, where help would be easy to muster. Moreover: Most sex trafficking lures and abductions are of teenagers. We have been so brainwashed by talk of trafficking that we imagine we see it everywhere.  We contacted Stipp via Facebook to ask about the Coon Rapids Walmart incident, but have not yet received a response.

Jeannine Degaston Isom allegedly entered a Walmart location in Cedar Hills, Utah, on Monday with her two sons, according to the Daily Herald. While in the store, she bought hand sanitizer and a pair of needle-nose pliers, the Associated Press reports, citing police records. Isom then brought the younger child, who is 7, into the store’s bathroom and pulled his two upper front teeth with the pliers, police told ABC 4. She did so without any anesthetic, police say, and when asked why she did so, she told authorities the teeth were infected, per KSL. The child’s older brother heard him screaming and crying, according to the Daily Herald, and entered the bathroom with a Walmart employee. The older brother took the child out of the store and away from Isom, police records say. The child was later taken to a dentist, who told police the teeth did not need to be pulled. The child had told his brother that only one of the teeth was loose, while the other was only slightly loose, per KSL. It is unclear whether the teeth were infected in any way. However, police told ABC 4 that the teeth did come out in pieces, not all at once, indicating that their removal was medically unnecessary. “When (Isom) proceeded to extract them, they didn't come out in one whole piece. There were multiple pieces. So that illustrates that they were still very attached to this child's mouth," a police spokesperson told the station. The incident was “child abuse in its purest form,” the spokesperson said.   Court and jail records indicate that Isom has been arrested once before, on charges of disorderly conduct. She eventually took a plea in abeyance in the case, meaning she pleaded guilty or no contest but avoided sentencing by agreeing to certain conditions in the plea deal, per the Daily Herald. She has had no prior arrest for child abuse. A study published in the scientific journal Oral & Implantology estimated that as roughly 50 percent of physical child abuse cases result in oral or facial trauma, including “dental fractures, dental dislocations (and) dental avulsions.” Child neglect often also results in poor oral health too, the study found, and as a result, the study’s authors recommended dental health professionals be on the lookout for child abuse cases.

Mark Lennihan/AP Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Amazon is attempting to lure low-income shoppers from Walmart by offering a discount on its pay-by-month Prime membership for people who receive government assistance. The giant online retailer said in a statement Tuesday that people who have a valid electronic benefits transfer card — used for programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs, or food stamps — will pay $5.99 per month for a year. Amazon is offering a 30-day free trial for qualifying customers. The typical Prime membership is $99 a year, though people have the option to pay $10.99 a month. Prime benefits include free shipping, unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows, and a rotating selection of free e-books and magazines. "We designed this membership option for customers receiving government assistance to make our everyday selection and savings more accessible, including the many conveniences and entertainment benefits of Prime," Greg Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, said in the statement. As Reuters notes, "The online retailer's move directly challenges Walmart — the biggest beneficiary of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — where at least one in five customers pay by food stamps." And The Wall Street Journal adds that "Walmart generated about $13 billion in sales last year from shoppers using the SNAP Program, accounting for around 18 percent of the money spent through the program nationwide." Not everyone is convinced that Amazon's strategy will pay off. The Associated Press reports: "Internet consultant Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali says Amazon's move 'seems inevitable' because it's saturated a good part of the affluent and middle-class sector — but describes it as a 'head scratcher.' " 'These consumers have always indexed lower in online transactions, and their living circumstances are often not well-suited to package delivery, and many of these consumers don't have vehicles to drive to a location to pick up packages,' she wrote in an email. 'Of the long list of businesses that Amazon could target, this doesn't seem like the biggest one.' " Amazon and Walmart each have been upping their game to cut into the other's bottom line. Walmart is pressing ahead with strategies to better compete against Amazon online. Last year, the company announced it would acquire Amazon competitor Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Last week, Walmart said that it would begin testing a program in Arkansas and New Jersey that would use store employees to deliver online orders at the end of their shifts. Bloomberg reports: "About 90 percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart, and the company is using those locations as shipping hubs to compete with Amazon on the last mile of delivery — the most expensive part of getting goods to customers. By using existing workers in their own cars, Wal-Mart could create a vast network with little upfront cost, similar to how Uber Technologies Inc. created a ride-hailing service without owning any cars." Walmart and Amazon are bending over backward to make shopping easier for customers. But take heed: Shopping with the click of a mouse can be trouble for your wallet. The website CheatSheet.com recently remarked on two indications that you spend too much money on Amazon: Your credit card statements are full of Amazon purchases. Your living room is cluttered with unopened Amazon boxes. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.   The best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.

The brightly colored 20-by 80-foot kiosk sits in the parking lot of a Walmart Super Center at N Council and W Britton Roads in Oklahoma City, Jack Money with NewsOK reported. A Walmart spokesperson told Money that the machine can fulfill ‘hundreds of orders’ in a day and although Amazon Fresh delivers its orders to the customer’s home, Walmart's kiosk allows them to pick them up the same day. Amazon’s online grocery business is available to Prime users for an additional $10 a year and it also beat Walmart to a pickup service, as it began testing Amazon FreshPickup in Seattle last month.

Share this article Share 38 shares But Amazon's service doesn’t seem to have discouraged Walmart from staying in the race. Its service offers more than 30,000 times that can be ordered for free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week – there is however, a $30 minimum. Customers simply place and pay for their order online and are then sent a pickup code to use at the kiosk. Walmart employees receive the online purchase and shop around the store for the correct items. The pickup code is linked to their order inside of the small building, retrieves the order for the customer that is sitting inside a bin. Customers simply place and pay for their order online and are then sent a pickup code to use at the kiosk. The pickup code is linked to their order inside of the small building, retrieves the order for the customer that is sitting inside a bin Walmart employees receive the online purchase and shop around the store for the correct items, which are then shipped to the kiosk in bright blue bins  And the firm is not stopping at groceries. Walmart had noted that it is testing other concepts across the US, one specifically called Pickup Tower, which is dedicated for online purchases of retail merchandise. Anne Hatfield, Walmart's director of communications, told Money that the tower is 16 feet tall and 8 feet in diameter. The facilities house 300 items at a time and are fitted with sensors to know when someone is approaching in order to open a door leading to a scanner. SHIP ITEMS TO WALMART STORE AND PICK UP FOR DISCOUNTS Walmart will offer big discounts on thousands of online-only items when customers elect to have them shipped to one of the company's stores for pickup. The move, which starts next week, is part of the retailer's efforts to better compete with online leader Amazon. Initially, the discount will be available on about 10,000 items. But the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer says it will then expand the price cuts to more than one million items by the end of June. Walmart is able offer the discounts by delivering the products directly to its 4,700 stores, saving on costs by avoiding shipping to individual shoppers' homes. The offer builds on Walmart's move in late January that replaced a pilot program offering free shipping but that came with an annual fee of $49, with one with a lower free-shipping threshold, faster delivery and no membership fee. The retailer said it will reduce free shipping time to two days on two million of its most popular items including essentials like diapers and pet food as well as hot toys and electronics. Walmart's average time has been three to five days. Also, at the time, it reduced the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. After making a purchase online, customers are given a unique barcode that they wave over the scanner, which prompts the machine to hand over their order. Although Amazon may be a giant in retail, it has been slowly making its way into the grocery business. Last October, leaked documents had revealed that the firm was set to open up 20 grocery store locations across the country by the end of 2018, according to the documents reviewed by Business Insider.  Once the customer enters the code, the kiosk doors open and their groceries are there to be retrieved  AMAZON FRESH PICKUP   Amazon set up at two locations in Seattle back in March, to test out their FreshPickup service on employees of the firm.  Now these shops have opened to the general public.  Each pickup point is set up like a cross between a petrol station and drive through fast-food restaurant Customers can drive up and park underneath canopies and Amazon staff will bring your order to your vehicle.  There is also a reception area for people who may prefer to walk in to pick up their orders.  If the service proves to be a success, it may eventually become available to members of Amazon's $99 (£79) a year Prime loyalty scheme in cities and larger towns internationally. These internal papers had also revealed that Amazon’s goal is to open up 2,000 Fresh-branded grocery stores over the next decade - and they will open 200 every year to hit the mark. Both Amazon and Walmart have picked up on the successful business of selling food, as it was recently revealed that about a fifth of consumer spending goes to groceries in the US, but only two percent of sales account for online grocery purchases, according to Morgan Stanley Research.  However, as it stands, Walmart also owns 17.3 percent of the grocery business – compared to Amazon’s 1.1 percent.   Read more: Walmart introduces automated grocery pickup kiosk at Oklahoma City store | News OK Amazon projects 2,000 grocery stores in the US over next 10 years - Business Insider Share or comment on this article e-mail 38 shares Most watched News videos Man gets caught with motor oil and DVDs stuffed in his jeans Driver pulls out HUGE snake stuck in gas pump using his hands How to make an amazing snow globe cupcake Sounds ruff!

Wal-Mart uses VR to simulate numerous issues, including a hectic Black Friday event in order to train employees. The turnaround story for Walmart U.S. began with the focus more than two years ago on its workforce behind a $2.7 billion investment in higher wages and training, according to company officials. Execs with the retail giant recently touted during the recent shareholders’ week the 153 training academies across the U.S. In most cases the regional training academies are located in the back of host stores that must go through an extensive audit of more than 2,000 criteria in order to be selected for academy host status. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said he’s excited about the training academies on many levels. “We have been able to reduce inventory in our back rooms enough to construct three classrooms for the academy and that’s very exciting to me,” McMillon said during the retailer’s question and answer session with analysts following the annual shareholder meeting. Inventory reduction under the direction of Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran is a positive and an indication the retailer is running a leaner overall operation. But the real benefit, according to McMillon and Foran, is the first class training its workforce is getting on everything from how to improve customer service during the holiday rush to optimizing day-to-day department operations. Tom Ward, vice president of central operations for Walmart U.S., said the retailer will have 200 of the academies open by this summer. The academies are roughly 3,000 square feet. About 75% of the training takes place on the sales floor of of the host store and 25% is in the classrooms. He said the first round of training last year was with department managers, a position McMillon added back to the operation two years ago. “They are the kings and queens of the business. They are the ones closest to the shelves and also serve the customers. Next we did the assistant store managers and we are not stopping there,” Ward said. He said if someone is promoted to a new department manager or hourly management position they can get training on the front end of that promotion to be more confident in their new roles. The training can span two weeks to six weeks depending on curriculum. Employees are paid their regular hourly wage for the time they spend training. The academies have begun training for online grocery pickup employees. In the next two two weeks the academies will train store employees on new simplification rules recently rolled out by management pertaining to streamlining various store operating processes. Ward said the academies allow Wal-Mart to quickly deploy the training to masses across the retailer’s nearly 5,000 stores. He said the academies will train around 250,000 by the end of this year, since the first academies opened in the spring of 2016. So far the academies have trained 100,000 employees and they can handle the training of 5,500 per week. Since the academies first opened they have also trained 4,000 who have taken on new roles. Ward said the academies are giving employees a path to a career with Wal-Mart as they take ownership in their jobs and exude confidence and purpose in their positions all while serving customers on the front line of the business. One of the new training methods utilizes virtual reality (VR) to train employees without putting them in hazardous situations. For instance if there is a spill of hazardous liquids, the clean-up protocol can be taught through VR without creating a spill. It’s also been effective in recreating Black Friday situations in stores for employees to be immersed. Ward said not every employee has experienced Black Friday bedlam, but VR can put them in the situation so they can learn what to expect, and then deploy an effective plan for the real thing. The VR system used by Wal-Mart in training was developed by STRIVR and is available in about 30 of the academies. Wal-Mart said other locations will be get the technology by the end of the year. Wal-Mart also talked about other technology such as the TC 70, a hand-held device that allows employees to check the availability of a product within the supply chain. The employee can see if a product is available on Walmart.com and then order it into any store on behalf of a customer. Each store has a few of the devices but Wal-Mart said the apps can also be pulled up on the MC 40s which are a little slower, and the data is also accessible on smartphones. Judith McKenna, COO for Walmart U.S. and Mark Ibbotson, executive vice president of central operations, spoke to the media on the importance of the training academies which were modeled after training methods used by ASDA, Wal-Mart’s grocery chain in the United Kingdom. McKenna and Ibbotson each were recruited to the Walmart business from ASDA. McKenna said the $2.7 billion investment originated by Wal-Mart in 2015 began with wage increases and structural changes when the department managers were brought back but it became clear that alone was not enough to move the bar. She said the training program launched last year has been crucial to the retailer’s success and it’s also a platform for the business going forward. She said having the right leadership in stores is the first element in running a better U.S. division. Secondly, she said having employees that engage with customers and are happy, well trained and paid fairly in their jobs is equally important. Thirdly, she said having the right people at the right time with respect to scheduling is the trickiest to tackle. The retailer continues to revamp its scheduling process allowing employees to pick up open shifts when they are available. Effective training is the final piece of the blueprint and McKenna said the academies are delivering on that in a big way. She said the academies in the future will be the conduit that will allow Walmart to respond quickly to change to stay relevant in retail. “With 1.2 million people, one of our greatest challenges is communication through the organization and getting people to do things in a consistent way and also understand why that is important. Whether it’s training personal shoppers for the new grocery pickup service or some new role in the future, it’s the academies that allow us to stay agile,” McKenna said. “You hire for attitude and train for skill and the academies are playing a big part in that endeavor.” Wal-Mart employees who have been through the academy recently spoke to the media about their experiences. It was clear they were more passionate about their jobs having gone through the training, which is another way Wal-Mart can indoctrinate its culture into a huge workforce. One benefit stores are seeing among those who do go through the training is less turnover. “The academies were the right thing to do on every level and that became evident after watching the first graduation,” said Ibbotson. “It’s a huge undertaking.” Chris Norton, a veteran employee at the Fayetteville Joyce Avenue store, spoke highly of the academy as well as the technology she has been given to do a better job managing the back of the store. “We were a little derailed in the past, but we’re on the right path now. If you haven’t worked for us lately, you don’t know who we are,” Norton said.

A Prime membership ordinarily costs $10.99 per month, or $99 per year. The EBT card is used to disburse funds for a variety of government assistance programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program (WIC). Consumers have to qualify for the discount program every 12 months, and may take advantage of it for up to four years. Eligible consumers can sign up for a free 30-day trial. Amazon is working on ways to expand the program to government assistance recipients who don't use EBT. Prime offers unlimited fast, free two-day shipping on more than 50 million eligible items. In certain ZIP codes, it also offers free same-day delivery on roughly a million eligible products, and free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of eligible items. Prime membership includes access to Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Reading and Prime Photos, as well as original podcasts, audio series and audiobooks from Audible. Further, members can get a free prerelease Kindle e-book each month, easy access to select Lightning Deals, and discounts on select products. Walmart's Strategy Amazon's Prime discount appears to be an attempt to attract lower-income customers from Walmart. "Walmart pretty much owns this demographic," noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. The discounted Prime membership program might work out for Amazon, because "cars are expensive luxuries" for many EBT card holders, Enderle told the E-Commerce Times. "Having the default option delivery along with low prices should provide a stronger alternative to discount stores -- and particularly, Walmart." Walmart has been fighting to retain its customers. The company this spring began offering customers a choice when purchasing eligible online-only items: discounts if they picked them up at its stores; or free two-day shipping without membership requirements. Walmart recently began paying some store associates to deliver customer packages on their way home from work. Walmart CEO Doug McMillion earlier this month told shareholders the company was leveraging technology to empower associates and improve the customer experience. Among those improvements: Digital endless-aisle shopping in stores; Automated pickup towers in stores for online orders; Pickup stations in store parking lots; Grocery pickup; Delivery from stores; and Jet Fresh delivery of produce to homes within 1-2 days, available to about half the U.S. population. Government Pilot Program The U.S. Department of Agriculture this week named Amazon as one of seven firms selected to participate in a two-year pilot project established under the Obama administration and slated to begin this summer in a number of states. Amazon's participation in the government pilot will be limited to Maryland, New Jersey and New York. The other retailers are FreshDirect in New York; Safeway in Maryland, Oregon and Washington State; ShopRite in Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylania; Hy-Vee in Iowa; Hart's Local Grocers in Rochester, New York; and Dash's Market in Buffalo, New York. The pilot will test both online ordering and payment. The USDA plans to roll out the program nationwide at a later date. Retailers with locations in multiple states, such as Amazon, may opt to phase in the program state by state over time. "It looks as though the government trial covers SNAP grocery items with the emphasis on fresh, wholesome food," noted Michael Jude, a research manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "Be interesting to see how that actually goes over," he told the E-Commerce Times. "I remain skeptical about programs like this." Richard Adhikari has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2008.

But online retail titan Amazon wants to poach some of that share as it again mulls taking a stab at the prescription drug category. Amazon has not made a public announcement about a pharmacy play, but the retailer recently hired Mark Lyons of Premera Blue Cross as its senior manager of pharmacy benefits. Amazon also is reportedly testing one-hour delivery for non-prescription drugs in its home base of Seattle with local drug-store Bartell Drugs. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, told Talk Business & Politics there are several factors converging to make pharmacy the next logical frontier for Amazon. “The increase in high-deductible insurance policies is driving price scrutiny on the part of consumers. That in turn will make Amazon’s value proposition clear and compelling from the start, not to mention the easy point of entry from Amazon’s loyal Prime members,” she said. “Amazon has redefined convenience in multiple categories – its customers often find Amazon far more convenient than a trip to the store. Even the most efficient brick and mortar pharmacies can’t seem to break the 20-minute minimum wait habit that for now may drive incremental sales but soon could offer a powerful incentive for consumers to switch to Amazon’s no-hassle model,” Spieckerman added. Earlier this year Wal-Mart instituted its “skip the line” service for pharmacy when a prescription refill is ordered using the retailer’s mobile app. Analysts said the goal of adding the service is to provide customers more convenience in areas where lines from from awaiting services – for example, pharmacy and financial services. Wal-Mart has also been focused on expanding its private label over-the-counter meds and other health-focused items seeing opportunities from an aging population and consumers looking for health supplements, protein bars and other nutraceuticals that fits a “live healthy” agenda. Most analysts think if Amazon can pull off a successful pharmacy program it would be big threat to CVS, Walgreens, Express Script and Wal-Mart, the four largest players in the pharmacy market, in that same order. These top four pharmacy divisions comprised 52.8% of the total pharmacy sales last year. Keith Anderson, senior vice president of strategy and insight at Profitero, told Talk Business & Politics, the pharmacy segment is “ripe for disruption.” He said it’s comparatively high margin but jumping in would be challenging for Amazon. If successful, this would be a threat to Wal-Mart and other brick and mortar retailers given pharmacy is also a trip driver. Anderson can understand why this category is attractive to Amazon given its size. He said there will be substantial challenges Amazon will have to overcome if it’s going to pose a threat to the major pharmacy players. He said pharmacy is a complex, opaque industry that’s well entrenched by insurers, retailers, discount programs not to mention the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) — a third-party administrator — of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and state government employee plans. Anderson said regulatory compliance is big and mail order prescriptions have declined over the past several years and trends show more consumers are seeking access to pharmacists. It’s also important to note that law requires prescriptions be filled by licensed and regulated pharmacists. The biggest pharmacies in the country employ their own pharmacists, something Amazon would have to do unless it partners with professionals. Some analysts believe it makes more sense for Amazon to buy an existing pharmacy business or perhaps partner with large employers to reach a captive client base from which to begin. Mizuho Securities USA noted it would be too costly for Amazon to enter the pharmacy market without key partnerships given Amazon couldn’t offer generic discounts any higher than the industry already gives. Anderson could see Amazon eventually integrating pharmacy with its physical stores and pick-up points as these initiative mature. “The main barrier to entry is regulatory red tape but Amazon is tenacious when it sees an opportunity and certainly won’t give up easily,” Spieckerman said. Anderson agreed saying he doesn’t expect Amazon to be an overnight success, but it could be another pillar for the retailer to pair along with groceries and consumables. “This would also underpin Amazon’s continued expansion of the wallet share,” he said. “The biggest impact on Wal-Mart would be on traffic. Rx is one of the most critical trip-driving categories.” This is not Amazon’s first stab at the pharmacy business. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos backed Drugstore.com in the late 1990s and over a three-year period Drugstore.com sold over-the-counter products on Amazon. Drugstore.com was eventually sold to Walgreens in 2011. Walgreens shuttered the site in 2016 to focus on its own e-commerce business.

Welcome to the newest edition of Marketer's Brief, a quick read on marketing news, moves and trends. Have tips or suggestions for next week's edition? Send to eschultz@adage.com. Don't look for a Walmart cashier on your doorstep tomorrow. Walmart got lots of attention last week when it announced employees in three stores are delivering e-commerce packages on their way home. But in an analyst briefing after the retailer's Friday shareholder's meeting, CEO Doug McMillon threw cold water on the prospect of a national rollout soon to the other 4,700 stores. Given the complexities of applying wage and hour laws to this extra work, he said: "I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that's going to be nationwide too soon." Store pickup is a winner, though Credit: Walmart Walmart is, however, getting plenty of mileage out of offering people discounts to pick up their online orders at stores, now available on 700,000 items. A new survey from IRI shows why. While only 8% of U.S. shoppers have bought stuff using such a "click-and-collect" option, 82% who did liked it enough to probably do it again. Of those who've picked up an online order in stores, 69% said they bought something else during the trip. IRI estimates e-commerce will account for 11% of packaged-goods sales by 2022, with $6.6 billion of the $88 billion in revenue coming from store pickups. America: home of the brave, and the best brands Have no fear, Americans still no know to grow brands. U.S.-based marketers dominate the 2017 BrandZ Most Valuable Global Brands ranking made public this week by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown. Of the top 100, 54 are U.S. brands, accounting for 71% of value of the top 100. The 54 brands grew 12% last year compared with a 1% decline for brands based in other regions -- except for China, whose brands accounted for 11% growth (not including state-owned enterprises). One of the biggest movers was Chinese brand Tencent. The owner of the WeChat social platform cracked the top 10 after its brand value jumped 27%. Rankings are compiled using analysis of financial and business performance along with interviews with over 3 million consumers globally.

These billboards are watching you Transformers: The Last Knight ad Credit: Lamar Advertising and Paramount Pictures As Ad Age reported last year, outdoor advertising is enjoying a renaissance. A couple of new innovative campaigns show why. Lamar Advertising Co. has teamed with Paramount Pictures to promote the new "Transformers: The Last Knight" movie by using billboards to deliver personalized messages to oncoming cars -- like "Attention. Your Honda Civic is an Autobot." Cameras mounted 1,000 feet ahead of the billboards scan vehicle grilles, enabling the targeted messages. Meanwhile, fashion site Highsnobiety this week reported on billboards popping up in Los Angeles by fashion brand Anti Social Social Club. The boards carry a number that when dialed simply returns a morse code that translates to "June 10." "Whether that date refers to another LA-only pop-up shop or a new drop altogether is yet to be confirmed," reported Highsnobiety. Sky high MetLife building Credit: MetLife To the untrained eye, the signage on the MetLife Building in midtown New York City might look the same as usual, but font fanatics will soon notice a change. After kicking Snoopy to the doghouse last year for a rebranding that included a new logo and typeface, the insurer is updating the exterior signage of the building where its name has been displayed for nearly a quarter century. "200 Park is a cultural icon, and a major asset for the MetLife brand," said Howard Pyle, senior VP-customer experience and design at MetLife. "Our new logo represents our partnership with our customers, which will now be reflected in the city's skyline." Portland, meet Iceland What do Portland and Iceland have in common? A lot, according to Icelandic vodka brand Reyka, which is targeting the U.S. city in hopes of doubling its volume there. A new campaign by Red Tettemer O'Connell and Partners features a character named Frikki drawing quirky comparisons between the two locales, including a common love of beards. Number You Need to Know 20 -- The number of stores German discount chain Lidl is opening this summer in North Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina, as it makes its U.S. debut. Lidl, which has about 10,000 stores in Europe, has plans for another 80 East Coast locations by the summer of 2018. Would You Buy This? Starbucks Frappuccino Credit: Starbucks Starbucks clearly has a thing for wacky Frappuccino flavors. (Unicorn, anyone?) Now, patrons in Asia can try three limited-time flavors with somewhat unique textures. The Banana Split Frappuccino comes with strawberry whipped cream, banana, mocha, vanilla whipped cream and waffle pieces; the Matcha Earl Grey Jelly one has bright green tea, a jelly layer and matcha powder; and the Irish Cream Coffee Pudding version includes a coffee pudding base, espresso whipped cream and espresso powder.

Through their websites, Walmart and Sears recently began selling shirts, phone cases and other items with anti-Semitic messages. Most of the designs read “Free Palestine. End Israeli occupation,” and many people—especially the Jewish community—are protesting and calling for boycotts. Amazon has also come under fire for having over 30 such shirts and clothing items on its site. Unlike the retail companies which had the items on their sites via third party vendors, Amazon is selling some directly through Prime. The backlash regarding this was quick and widespread. Several Jewish media organizations reported on the issue and reached out to the offending companies. While Amazon has yet to give a public comment or take action, Sears explained the items were from a third-party seller and that they would review them. Amid complaints Tuesday evening, the company announced it will remove all of the “Free Palestine” paraphernalia from its site. Walmart has not responded publicly, but people who complained to the company have been sharing their correspondence with customer service on social media. This morning, one person received a message from a Walmart representative informing him the items have been removed, and indeed they are no longer on the site. Major conversation about the sale of the items took place on Facebook, where many people went to express their outrage and urge others to boycott. Here are some of their comments: “There is no justification for Sears to have allowed such politically-charged, factually incorrect T-shirts – whether it was sold through a third party, or not.” “Sears is off my list as retailers. How ridiculous to pull a stunt like this! Shame on you Sears!!!!” “So disappointed and disgusted to see you peddling and supporting a murderous entity that calls for the destruction of Israel that I just cancelled my Amazon Prime membership. I’ll consider patronizing you should you’ll correct this atrocity.” “I will be forced to no longer shop at Walmart due to the carrying of your antisemitic merchandise, one of which are your ‘Free Palestine‘ t-shirts, which promulgate the lie that Israel and Jews are oppressing a group of people, which is not the truth. In doing so, you show your hatred of the Jewish people and if Israel.” “Sears has been struggling financially for quite some time. This may be the nail in the coffin for alienating the Jewish/Christian community.” “Amazon also selling this offensive anti-Israel propaganda ‘wolf in sheep’s clothing’ t-shirt. Due to an outpouring of disgust, Sears has promised to remove this item. Let’s do the same with Amazon and any other retailer who chooses to close its eyes in the name of commerce.” “Have you seen the latest is summer fashion at Sears?? @Sears you should be ashamed to sell this type of anti-Semitic and anti-Isreal crap. Sure let’s just legitimize anti-semitism wrapped up in ‘fashion.’ How cool is this movement that ultimately just says that Israel does not have the right to exist and the Jewish people don’t have a right to their eternal homeland.” “Call To Action! Amazon-REMOVE OR BOYCOTT. Amazon has over 30 anti-Semitic, pro jihadist shirts for sale. Many are being sold DIRECTLY by Amazon.” On Amazon, protest has even hit the reviews. Every single review on one of the shirts is shaming the company for selling it. Amid all of the outrage, there are also many pointing out that selling the items is free speech. “I know I am asking for trouble by saying this, but we are in America, where we still have freedom of speech, even if you don’t agree with it,” wrote one commenter on Facebook. “Feel free to boycott all you want, but the companies have the right to sell whatever they want.” “As much as we hate it, its free speech sadly,” wrote another. “Having said that, the choice you have is to not use these retailers, and that is the best weapon—their bottom line.” The Observer has reached out to Walmart and Amazon for comment and will update if we hear back.

The grant will support investments in the equipment necessary to handle perishable products, such as refrigerated vehicles; coolers and freezers for transporting, storing and distributing food; thermometers and temperature calibration devices; among other items. “One in 4 people struggle with hunger in Vermont, including 34,000 children,” said Vermont Foodbank CEO, John Sayles. “We are thankful to the Walmart Foundation for helping to ensure that people who struggle with hunger have access to nutrient-rich food. This grant will go a long way in helping the Vermont Foodbank and our partner agencies serve our state.” The Vermont Foodbank secures fresh, perishable food from retailers across the state. Through their Retail Partner Agency Program, the Foodbank facilitates the direct rescue of these foods by training food shelf personnel in safe food-handling procedures and connecting them with nearby retailers to receive or pick up the food themselves. Through this grant opportunity from Walmart, three Foodbank network partners were chosen to receive funds to increase the number of produce pounds rescued from their retail partners. Loaves and Fishes and Groundworks in Brattleboro, and Helping Overcome Poverty’s Effects (HOPE) in Middlebury will be purchasing new commercial refrigerators, freezers, and shelving to support their efforts to bring more fresh food to their clients. The Walmart Foundation has been instrumental in helping food banks rescue and distribute more perishable food from retailers across the United States in a sustainable, cost-effective way. This grant is a part of Walmart and the Walmart Foundation’s ongoing commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger by providing four billion meals to people in need in the U.S. by 2020. Since 2009, the Walmart Foundation has been a leading supporter of infrastructure grants to Feeding America food banks and their member agencies. Walmart and the Walmart Foundation provide donations of both food and funds to the Feeding America nationwide network of 200 food banks. Locally, the Vermont Foodbank picks up donated food weekly from the local Walmart stores; has received funding through the company’s Fight Hunger, Spark Change campaign; and has received grants to support their Retail Partner Agency Program, 3Squares VT (SNAP) Outreach, the BackPack Program, and VT Fresh programs. With food insecurity remaining high throughout the country, the ability to distribute more food is critical for food banks. According to the USDA, more than 42 million people nationwide are food insecure, which means that they may not know where they will find their next meal. In Vermont, 74,600 residents are food insecure. To learn more about what the Vermont Foodbank is doing to fight hunger, visit www.vtfoodbank.org.

That has not stopped many from doing it, but getting caught is a matter of time for some people. A 32-year-old man apparently stole a bicycle from a community center, which he then used to ride to a Walmart in Idaho. He threatened a customer of the store, and displayed a holster in his waistband while demanding money. After fleeing the scene with an unspecified amount of money, he started a Facebook Live video of his trip on Interstate 84. Police officers were already investigating a bike theft, and they also had the description of a man with a beard and red hair, who had robbed a Walmart store. Somehow, the officers managed to see the live video of the man, later identified as Jason Granger, who bragged about the new bike that he was riding. He was courteous enough to thank the community center he’d just robbed. Granger noted that the institution was “pretty cool,” and he even considered the possibility of returning to take some more stuff from that place. As Idaho Statesman notes, police officers did not disclose whether the suspect did have a gun on him when he was stopped at gunpoint. There was a possibility that he just had a gun holster on himself, and pretended to have a weapon in an attempt to trick the cashier during the robbery. Since no amount of money in a register is worth a human’s life, it was only natural for the suspect to get every bill in the unit before leaving, without anyone counting how much they just lost. Regardless, police officers booked him into the Elmore County Jail on two charges - burglary and attempted armed robbery. Facebook has been used by law enforcement before, and it seems like a useful tool in detecting people who suddenly become wealthy or recently acquired things that belonged to someone else. thief robbery stolen theft USA social media lol   Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) 10 Debuts To Look Forward To At The 2017 Geneva Motor Show Mercedes-Benz Model Nomenclature is Getting Ridiculous Engine Break-In: What You Need to Know Platform Sharing - When Expensive Cars Get Cheaper Platforms And Viceversa Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore’s led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we got a customer base —those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup helped bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is helping, since people realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook and furniture pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensor track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.” Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Have to spend at least $30, though. Amazon and Walmart are locked in a never-ending battle for customers, and it's being fought on prices, choice, and convenience. The focus right now seems to be on that last one: convenience, with Walmart carrying out a trial of a new, 24-hour automated grocery pickup kiosk. Only last month Amazon rolled out its Fresh pickup service in limited form. It allows Prime members to skip the grocery store completely and let Amazon choose and load an order into your car at a pickup location. For now, it's limited to two locations in Seattle, but is sure to expand. Walmart's pickup kiosk trial is happening in Oklahoma City according to The Verge. Customers select the groceries they want using Walmart's online store, pay, then choose a location and time to visit a kiosk. The only prerequisite is you spend at least $30, and of course there's only one pickup location to choose from right now. On visiting the kiosk, which is simply a 20-by-80 foot building with multiple pickup bays, there's a kiosk where you enter a five-digit code that opens a bay door with your chilled food already bagged and ready to go. If there's an issue, Walmart provides phone support. Related Walmart Wants Drones in Stores Shopping for You Walmart Wants Drones in Stores Shopping for You Walmart is slowly expanding its range of pickup-focused services. For example, back in April the company launched Pickup Discount, which applied an automatic extra discount to around one million online-only products. In order to qualify for Pickup Discount, you simply order online and then choose to visit a store to collect the order rather than have it delivered. If this automated grocery kiosk proves popular, and why wouldn't it? Then expect to see these kiosks popping up in other major cities in the near future.

McIntyre June 7, 2017 5:27 am EDT Print Email Tweet Most analysis of online retail counterfeit sales focuses on the e-commerce giants. That means figures get pointed at Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY). However, despite the size of its brick-and-mortar empire, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  (NYSE: WMT) has one of the largest online retail businesses in the world. That means counterfeit products have become a major challenge. Some say Wal-Mart has not done enough to check the abuses. According to The Counterfeit Report: Walmart has a counterfeit problem. Both Walmart, and third-party sellers Walmart allows to list on Walmart’s website, are selling counterfeit products. Walmart’s global name recognition and consumer perceived credibility is a significant advantage in marketing (and profiting) from unaware consumers. Buyers place their confidence in, and rely on Walmart’s credibility to purchase authentic goods. Sometimes that confidence is misplaced. Unknown to many consumers, Walmart allows outside third-party sellers to list and sell products on Walmart’s website. Alarmingly, counterfeit products appear right next to authentic items conveying Walmart’s endorsement and the illusion they are from Walmart. The Counterfeit Report goes on to give examples of fake memory cards. All the major e-commerce sites have methods whereby counterfeits can be reported, and supposedly removed. Critics say these are little more than band-aides because the number of counterfeit goods on sale at any given time stretches into the thousands. The e-commerce sites do not have the capacity to police such a significant problem, at least at a level they are willing to afford. The wider issue is whether they have an obligation to do so.

The retail giant is testing a self-service automated kiosk at a store in Oklahoma City, from where customers can pick up online grocery orders at any time of the day without interacting with any employees. The service lets Walmart customers order their groceries online or through an app and select to pick up the order from a 24-hour kiosk. Once the customer enters a pickup code, the kiosk will automatically fetch the order from bins inside in 60 seconds or less. There is no special cost for picking up groceries, but customers must spend at least $30 per order to use the service. Wallmart offers more than 30,000 grocery items, including fresh produce, meats, and dairy products, for online ordering and pickup. The kiosk has refrigerators and freezers inside that keep the groceries fresh. Walmart spokesman Scott Markley reportedly said that the kiosk is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and it's able to fulfill hundreds of customer orders in a single day. Markley said, "Especially for busy families with kids, grocery shopping used to take a couple of hours on the weekend. You can now pickup your groceries in just a few minutes and have more time back in your day." The move is part of Walmart's efforts to more seamlessly integrate its online and offline services as it competes with Amazon. Walmart is also experimenting with vending machine-like Pickup Towers in five cities across the US for retrieving non-food orders. Recently, Amazon opened its first drive-up grocery pickup service in Seattle. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Europe's 10 Hottest Housing Markets 10 Most Stable Nations On Earth Hell on Earth: The World's 10 Most Fragile Nations Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Job Openings In US At Highest Level: Report U.S. Weekly Jobless Pull Back To 245,000 Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary ECB Holds Rates, QE Steady As Draghi Drops Easing Bias Tesla Motors, 19 Other Companies Join Fortune 500 For First Time German Industrial Production Growth Tops Expectations Street To Edge Higher At Opening As It Awaits Comey Testimony Eurozone Economy Grows Faster Than Estimated Earlier European Shares Hold Steady As UK Votes Asian Shares Mixed Before Big Events ECB To Maintain Rates, QE ABBV Hits A High Note, AGN Opens Wallet, TEVA's HALO Does An Encore Now's The Time: Mortgage Demand Surges Amid Low Interest Rates China Export Growth Tops Expectations EWG Names Worst Sunscreen For Kids <<Previous        102 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Wal-Mart Stores To Participate At Baird Global Conference; Webcast At 1:25 PM ET Walmart Using Store Workers To Deliver Packages Wal-Mart Stores Annual Shareholders' Meeting At 9:00 AM ET Wal-Mart Stores Annual Shareholders' Meeting At 9:00 AM ET Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Amazon, whose Prime service claims more than 70% of upper-income households in the US — those earning more than $112,000 a year — is suddenly going after customers on government assistance who earn less than $15,444 a year. The retailer on Tuesday announced it would slash the cost of its monthly Prime membership nearly in half, to $5.99 a month, for customers who have an electronic benefit transfer card, which is used for government assistance like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps. "It's a shot over the bow at Walmart," said Doug Stephens, a retail-industry consultant. In other words, the strategy is a direct grab for Walmart's core customers. Nearly $1 out of every $5 in SNAP benefits was spent at Walmart last year, according to Morningstar. For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available on iOS and Android. At the same time, Walmart is going after Amazon's core customers with its $3 billion acquisition earlier this year of Jet.com, which attracts a younger and higher-income group of shoppers than Walmart. The retailer has also recently been snatching up trendy online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw, and Shoebuy, and it's reportedly considering a bid for the high-end menswear brand Bonobos. The two retailers' strategies of aiming at the furthest ends of the income spectrum highlight the widening gap between wealthy and poor Americans and the disappearance of what was once the most sought-after class of income-earners in the country. "This is absolutely symptomatic of a deteriorating middle class, or at least what we used to consider to be the middle class in America," Stephens told Business Insider.

"From postwar to about the late 1970s, you wanted to be in the mid-tier of retail. That is where everybody was making a fortune, including Walmart," Stephens said. "Then from 1980 onward, you wanted to pick a side, because it started to become clear that the middle class was evaporating." The deterioration of union jobs, the shift of manufacturing jobs overseas, and the growth of the knowledge economy that led to a boom in high-skilled jobs contributed to this trend. After the Great Recession, several other factors aggravated the problems facing mid-tier retailers. View photos SearsMore (Sears) Consumers started saving more money, and mall traffic plunged, along with spending on apparel and accessories. People started shifting their spending from durable goods to experiences, travel, and restaurants. Consumers also started dealing with higher fixed expenses from increasing technology and healthcare costs. As shoppers' spending habits changed, the middle class declined. Between 2000 and 2014, middle-class populations decreased in 203 of the 229 metropolitan areas reviewed in a Pew Research Center study. That's why today, both high-end retailers and discount retailers are thriving — or at least surviving — while companies that relied heavily on middle-class spending, like Macy's, Sears, and JCPenney, are closing hundreds of stores.

While they make up just 2% of the companies on the list, the combined revenue of the top 10 reached $2.2 trillion last year, accounting for 18.2% of the total $12.1 trillion earned by the 500 list companies. The results of the Fortune 500 companies reflected the slow but steady growth of the economy at large. Their combined revenues rose by 0.5%, or $61 billion, over 2015. The total number of people employed at Fortune 500 firms, meanwhile, hit a record high, with 28.2 million net employees, up 1% from a year earlier. Here are the companies that top the list. 1. Walmart Last year's Fortune 500 Rank: No. 1 2016 Revenue: $485.9 billion One-year Revenue Change: 0.8% Big-box retailer Walmart (wmt) has continued its online push in 2016, In a bid to accelerate e-commerce growth, Walmart has acquired digital-native retail companies in including ModCloth, ShoeBuy, and Moosejaw in recent years, and in 2016, in perhaps its biggest e-commerce move yet, it acquired Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. But the gulf between Walmart's online business and that of the top online retailer, Amazon, is still daunting. While Amazon (No. 12 on this year's list) carries some 300 million products, Walmart offers 10 million. And, while Amazon saw its revenue rise 27% last year, to $135 billion, Walmart's revenue has remained relatively steady, up less than 1%. 2. Berkshire Hathaway Former Fortune 500 Rank: No. 4 2016 Revenue: $223.6 billion One-year Revenue Change: 6.1% Berkshire Hathaway(brk.a) rose two slots on this year's Fortune 500 list, taking second place for the very first time. And 2016 was full of firsts for the holding company. The conglomerate helmed by CEO Warren Buffett bought a 1.1% stake in Apple, despite having avoided the so-called FANG tech giants in the past. Berkshire also piled into four airline stocks near the year's end, even though for decades Buffett had called airlines a bad investment. So far, those bets appear to be paying off, and some the company's core operating units, including its insurance and energy businesses, have done well, too. 3. Apple Related Fortune 500Fortune 500 CEOs See A.I. as a Big Challenge Fortune 500 Fortune 500 CEOs See A.I. as a Big Challenge Former Fortune 500 Rank: No. 3 2016 Revenue: $215.6 billion One-year Revenue Change: -7.7% Investors worried when, for the first time since 2001, the iPhone maker (aapl) reported an annual drop in revenue. That metric fell 7.7% in 2016, while profits slid 14.4% to $45.7 billion, as Apple struggled to compete with locally made phone brands in China. Still, many are hopeful that Apple's next iPhone, variously known as the iPhone 8 or iPhone X, could come with major revamps that will lure new consumers. And despite a subpar year, Apple still boasts the highest profits of any company on the list. 4. Exxon Mobil Former Fortune 500 Rank: No. 2 2016 Revenue: $205 billion One-year Revenue Change: -16.7% Even an energy giant like Exxon Mobil (xom) couldn't weather the oil slump without some fallout. As OPEC struggled to put a together a production agreement addressing the global oil glut, Exxon Mobil's revenue slid 16.7%, while profits sank to $7.8 billion—down 51.5% from a year earlier. In a sign of just how much the glut has hit Exxon, Standard and Poor stripped the company of its much admired triple-A credit rating—a rating it had held even through the oil crashes of the 1980s and 2008. Exxon's struggles in 2016 caused it to slide two spots down the Fortune 500 list—to its lowest ranking since 1999. 5. McKesson Fortune 500 Rank: No. 5 2016 Revenue: $192.5 billion One-year Revenue Change: 6.2% The issue of drug-price gouging, which began attracting significant notice in late 2015, has certainly left its mark on companies the sector. And other factors have also affected the often highly profitable industry. The country's largest pharmaceuticals distributor, McKesson (mck), has cut its U.S. workforce by 4% in a bid to cut costs as drug prices stalled and the industry consolidated. 6. UnitedHealth Group Fortune 500 Rank: No. 6 2016 Revenue: $184.8 billion America's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth (unh), has been on a steady upward climb since CEO Stephen Hemsley took the helm in 2006, and 2016 was no different. Revenue was up 17.7% from a year earlier, despite losses from its involvement in the Affordable Care Act healthcare exchanges. United has said that it will exit most ACA state exchanges by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, its technology and services division, Optum, is expected to continue driving United's earnings growth. 7. CVS Health Fortune 500 Rank: No. 7 2015 Revenue: $177.5 billion CVS(cvs) struggled to get consumers through its door in 2016. Some observers trace those woes back to 2014—when the retail and pharmacy chain said it would stop selling cigarettes. While that meant $2 billion less in annual sales, CVS's top brass seemed convinced that the new strategy forward would eventually be better for its financial health, too. More recently, CVS has emphasized its beauty and health sections, in an effort to draw more retail traffic. 8. General Motors Fortune 500 Rank: No. 8 2015 Revenue: $166.4 billion General Motors (gm) embraced the new in 2016, foraying into all-electric cars such as the Chevrolet Bolt, and delving into car-sharing in Los Angeles. The company has been focusing on its U.S. operations, while whittling down its India and Europe operations. Revenue rose 9.2% in 2016, while profits were slightly down. 9. AT&T Fortune 500 Rank: No. 10 2015 Revenue: $163.8 billion Well aware that entertainment and the internet are becoming almost one and the same, AT&T(t) has gone on a mega-merger spree in recent years to keep up. In 2015, it acquired DirecTV for about $49 billion. This year, it should complete an acquisition of Time Warner for $85 million, assuming the deal is not blocked for antitrust reasons. Revenue rose 11.6% in 2016, but profits dropped 2.8%, and the company's total number of customers in the video segment fell 186,000. 10. Ford Fortune 500 Rank: No. 9 2015 Revenue: $151.8 billion In 2016, revenue at Ford (f) popped 1.5%, but profits fell to $4.6 billion—38% lower than the year prior, due to a change in the company's accounting practices. The company is continuing down a trajectory that would commit it more fully to producing self-driving cars. This year, CEO Mark Fields (himself a proponent of that evolution) was ousted in favor of the executive behind Ford's automated driving unit, Jim Hackett.

The current Tracy Morgan insurance case against Walmart has changed its tone as the celebrity refused to testify in a deposition. Walmart’s insurance company, Ohio Casualty, demanded that Morgan participate in a 7-hour deposition. The purpose of the deposition, said the insurance company, is to show that Morgan has exaggerated his injuries in order to obtain the claimed payout. The payout is reported to be around $90 million. That said, Benedict Morelli, the star’s attorney in the headline-making claim against the retail giant, said that “Deposing Tracy Morgan will lead to nothing. We are opposing it.” The entire multimillion dollar Tracy Morgan insurance dispute has to do with a truck accident that occurred in 2014. Morgan and comedian Ardie Fuqua suffered life threatening injuries from the crash and their friend, comedian Jimmy Mack, was killed. The Tracy Morgan insurance case began when a Walmart tractor-trailer crashed with the stars’ limo. The three comedians were returning home from a Delaware casino stand-up performance in June three years ago when their limo was struck by the Walmart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. Mack was instantly killed and both Morgan and Fuqua were in comas. Morgan suffered a broken leg and ribs as well as a brain injury. Fuqua’s leg broke in five different places. “The people I represented were all in comas for more than a week. They were devastatingly injured,” said Morelli, meaning both Morgan and Fuqua. He also underscored the fact that Morgan is making attempts to revive his stand-up career. However, he added that, “When he does stand-up comedy now, he has a stool and he keeps sitting down because he can’t stand. He now needs notes when he does stand-up because he doesn’t have the same memory.” The Walmart truck driver, Kevin Roper, had allegedly been awake for over a full day by the time the accident happened. He gave a guilty plea to charges of aggravated assault and vehicular homicide. Morgan and the other limo passengers filed a lawsuit against Walmart, arriving at a settlement in May 2015. Now, Ohio Casualty wants to depose Morgan as a part of a federal lawsuit it filed against Walmart. It is also investigating certain purchases Morgan made following his settlement payments, including a Lamborghini valued at $440,000. That said, Morelli explained that, “They had multiple years of Tracy Morgan’s tax returns. They had all, I repeat, all of Tracy Morgan’s medical records from the accident.” A judge will rule on the Tracy Morgan insurance deposition issue on June 19, at which time it will be determined whether or not the actor must participate. celebrity insurance, insurance claim, insurance deposition, insurance lawsuit, Ohio Casualty, tracy morgan, tracy morgan accident, Tracy Morgan insurance, walmart insurance, walmart insurance company, walmart lawsuit Related Posts Event insurance policy for Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl gig may cost over $100k $300k renters insurance settlement proves you shouldn’t blowtorch a squirrel Insurance company merger between Aetna and Humana will not go forward About Julie Campbell Julie Campbell has been writing professionally for over 15 years, following a brief career in the insurance industry, in which she took emergency claims while guiding and supporting policyholders through some of the most difficult moments in their lives.

Mike Wolanin | The Republic Local News In Driver’s seat By Mark Webber - 6/7/17 12:04 PM Dorel Juvenile USA announced plans to create 60 new jobs after landing a 1.4 million car-seat supplier deal with retail giant Walmart, then hinted that even more expansion will be coming to Columbus. Although the car-seat deal with Walmart is limited, Dorel President and CEO Paul Powers said the new jobs will be permanent as the company explores even more business opportunities. A hint of that came when Powers was asked Tuesday about Dorel’s 2014 purchase of the juvenile operations of the Lerado Group, which provided the company with its first manufacturing facilities in China and Taiwan. “Our China facility makes primarily strollers,” Powers said. “But stay tuned because we’ve got some other plans for Columbus in that regard.” Story continues below gallery 1 of 15 Dorel Juvenile Group employees package child car seats on the manufacturing floor of the Dorel Juvenile Group in Columbus, Ind., Tuesday, June 6, 2017.

Mike Wolanin | The Republic Click here to purchase photos from this gallery Dorel Juvenile and Walmart officials gathered at the company’s manufacturing site on the east side of Columbus to make the announcement about moving the production of 1.4 million car seats from a Chinese competitor to the Columbus facility. The 60 new jobs being added to the 720 already in Columbus will be mainly in manufacturing and distribution positions, Powers said. Dorel ranks eighth among all employers in Columbus and is the sixth largest among local manufacturers, with Cummins Inc. ranking first with about 7,500 local workers. Dorel’s average hourly rate for production operators is $15 per hour, Dorel marketing director Jennie Freedman said. “We have already started some hiring, but it will be spread over the next nine months as product lines are expanded to meet customer launches,” Freedman said. The expanded volume will start at the end of this year and will grow through 2018, she said. Dorel Juvenile Group, a leading manufacturer of children’s car seats and strollers, will add two additional assembly lines at the Columbus facility to produce the products for Walmart, which include car seat, stroller and walker categories, Freedman said. The lines will include: Grow and Go Convertible Car Seats Easy Elite Car Seats Store n’ Go Backed Boosters Rise No Back Boosters Disney Walkers In addition, new products are set for release next year, Freedman said. While the current Walmart order is limited to 1.4 million seats, “when we do a deal like this with Walmart, it becomes permanent,” Powers said. That was also the expectation expressed Tuesday by Walmart Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies. “Obviously, a move like this requires a lot of capital investment,” Bratspies said. “So when we step into relationships with buyers like Dorel, we’re looking for the long term.” Walmart tied the deal with Dorel to a 10-year initiative by the company to buy an additional $250 billion in products that support American jobs. Walmart intends to continue using its scale and leverage to create jobs, Bratspies said. “There’s no reason that, here in Columbus, we can’t continue to do a lot more,” he said. Besides Walmart, other major retail partners for Dorel include Amazon, Target, Babies R Us, Buy Buy Baby and Nordstrom, Freedman said. According to market research from the London-based Technavio Company, the global baby car seat market is expected to exceed $2 billion by 2020, growing at a rate of almost 5 percent annually. Currently, Dorel manufactures more than 3 million car seats per year that range from infant to convertible, Freedman said. The company produces a range of car seats priced from $45 to $500 under brands that include Cosco, Safety 1st and Maxi-Cosi, she said. Specific car-seat models manufactured in Columbus include award-winning and high safety rating seats including the Grow n’ Go Convertible Car Seat and the Scenera Next. The Scenera, manufactured exclusively for Walmart, played an important role in further strengthening the 40-year relationship between Walmart and Dorel. In 2014, Dorel exceded expectations of many when it quickly ramped up production to make 3,000 Scenera Next car seats a day, in order to meet a requirement to have 600,000 of the models shipped to Walmart by Christmas Day of that year. 10-year commitment Bratspies described Tuesday’s announcement as a small part of a 10-year commitment to buy an additional $250 billion in products supporting American jobs. That commitment began in January 2013 and includes working with suppliers to increase U.S.-manufactured products in its stores, said Scott Markley, a Walmart spokesman. But those billions of dollars will be spread all across the United States in many different geographical areas, Bratspies said. One million new U.S. jobs will be created through Walmart’s initiative, according to data from the Boston Consulting Group quoted Tuesday by Bratspies. A company press release broke that down into direct manufacturing job growth of about 250,000 _ and indirect job growth of about 750,000 in the support and service sectors. For Walmart, it is inefficient to ship the oddly-shaped child car seats in oversize boxes overseas, Markley said. But Bratspies says a combination of changes in today’s economy are working together to add manufacturing jobs in the United States. “Transportation costs internationally are going up, wage rates are rising internationally, and we’re getting to be a lot more manufacturing-friendly in the U.S. than we’ve been in the past,” Bratspies said. Retailers and manufacturers still need to create a relationship that shares a common vision in order to create opportunities, he said. “What’s great about Dorel is that they innovate and bring new things to the market,” Bratspies said. “Walmart needs new products. They are the lifeblood of every retailer.” About Dorel While headquartered in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Dorel Juvenile USA has its main U.S. manufacturing facility, as well a design and development center and a technical center for child safety, located in Columbus. Dorel Juvenile Group, located near the intersection of State Street and Gladstone Avenue, is considered the world’s largest car-seat manufacturer, producing recognizable brands including Cosco, Safety 1st, Quinny, Cosco and Maxi-Cosi. The company is a division of Dorel Industries, established in 1961 in Montreal, Quebec. Besides juvenile products, Dorel Industries also products recreational and leisure products marketed under the Cannondale, Schwinn, GT, Mongoose, IronHorse and SUGOI names. Dorel’s Home Furnishings markets a wide assortment of furniture products, both domestically produced and imported. Dorel Industries Inc. has annual sales of $2.6 billion and employs about 10,000 people in facilities in 25 countries worldwide. The company has a commitment on sustainability initiatives that are designed to minimize environmental impact, company officials said. This includes energy-management systems to reduce electric, natural gas and water usage at the zero-landfill manufacturing facility, recycling packaging materials and more than 99 percent of its plastic manufacturing waste. The company also has a recycling program to keep post-consumer car seats out of landfills, repurposing materials into other products. Mark Webber Mark Webber is a reporter for The Republic.

The online leader is offering a discount on its pay-by-month Prime membership for people who receive government assistance. The move, announced Tuesday, is seen by some analysts as an attempt to go after rival Walmart’s lower-income shoppers. The world’s largest retailer has revamped its shipping program and improved other services to drive online sales growth as it tries to narrow the gap with Amazon. People who have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer card, used for programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs, or food stamps, will pay $5.99 per month for the Amazon Prime benefits like free shipping and unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows. The typical Prime membership is $99 a year, but those who cannot afford to pay up front also have a $10.99-a-month option. Amazon designed this option to make its “selection and savings more accessible, including the many conveniences and entertainment benefits of Prime,” Greg Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, said in a statement. Walmart has gained momentum in its online business, seeing its e-commerce sales soar 63 percent in its first quarter, up from a 29 percent increase the previous period. It now offers free-two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a purchase of $35. Online shoppers who collect their purchases at a store get extra discounts. And Walmart has dramatically expanded its online offerings – though it’s still far behind the hundreds of millions of products at Amazon.com. Amazon’s aim with the latest move is two-pronged, says Ken Perkins, president of research firm RetailMetrics. “It is part of Amazon’s overarching goal to inexorably move into every corner of retail,” he said. “Secondly, it is a direct move to pull consumers away from its chief retail rival Walmart, which has been far more aggressive competing with Amazon on price, offerings, delivery and building out its formidable e-commerce operations.” Internet consultant Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali says Amazon’s move “seems inevitable” because it’s saturated a good part of the affluent and middle-class sector – but describes it as a “head scratcher.” “These consumers have always indexed lower in online transactions, and their living circumstances are often not well-suited to package delivery, and many of these consumers don’t have vehicles to drive to a location pick up packages,” she wrote in an email. “Of the long list of business that Amazon could target, this doesn’t seem like the biggest one.” Associated Press Publish date: June 7, 2017 7:17 am| Modified date: June 7, 2017 7:20 am Tags: Amazon, Amazon Prime, Electronic Benefits, Government Aid, government assistance, Greg Greeley, Online Sales, Prime Membership, United States, Walmart Also read WWDC 2017: Tech rivals join hands, Amazon Prime Video now on Apple TV Amazon.in announces ‘Samsung Carnival’ offering discounts on mobiles, TVs and large appliances X Recommended For You Amazon boosts sales in its marketplace by lending $1 billion to merchants Amazon Echo open to Siri, Google Assistant, says Amazon’s senior VP of devices OnePlus 5 to feature 8 GB RAM; sale to begin on 22 June after launch event Amazon apologises for technical disruption on its website Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Laura Stevens and Sarah Nassauer 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL CEO Elon Musk says Tesla may need more plants Sears is closing 72 more stores — here's the full list Amazon.com Inc. is dropping its membership price for low-income shoppers, going after a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stronghold. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 1,010.04 +0.12 +0.01% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 79.80 +0.64 +0.81% The online retailer giant said Tuesday that it will offer a nearly 20% segment of the U.S. population—people who obtain government assistance with cards typically used for food stamps—a $5.99 monthly Prime membership, less than the $10.99 a month or $99 annual plan for other consumers. The membership buys access to unlimited two-day shipping, video and music content, photo storage and other perks. The new Prime offering takes direct aim at Wal-Mart, which counts on shoppers who receive government assistance for a large percentage of sales. Wal-Mart generated about $13 billion in sales last year from shoppers using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, accounting for around 18% of the money spent through the program nationwide. Those customers also spend additional income while in Wal-Mart stores. Amazon will require cards typically used for food stamps as an initial measure to determine participant eligibility, although they can’t yet be widely used for shopping online. The retailer plans to add additional ways to qualify. Low-income shoppers are “a big opportunity” and are already buying online, said Laura Kennedy, director, retail insights at consultancy Kantar Retail. But some lower-income consumers still face hurdles because they more often lack typical bank resources like accounts or credit cards. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was looking at underserved audiences when it came up with the concept, adding that $99 might be a barrier to entry for some consumers in a temporary state of need. Amazon will require eligible participants to requalify every year for up to four years.

It acquired low-cost Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year and has been revamping its online strategy, scrapping a $50 charge for a two-day, no-cost shipping membership program in favor of offering free shipping on orders over $35. (Amazon’s free-shipping threshold for non-Prime customers is currently for orders over $25.) Wal-Mart executives hoped it would draw in more value-oriented and non-Prime customers by removing membership fees. Load Error At the same time, Amazon has been working to grow its Prime membership program, adding perks and expanding it to more than a dozen countries internationally. Analysts estimate that its more-than-60-million members spend significantly more than other shoppers. Still, 47% of U.S. primary household shoppers say they never or rarely shop on Amazon, according to data from Kantar Retail. About 30% of the approximately 44 million SNAP recipients have access to Prime via a subscription, free trial or family member, according to Kantar. Amazon also introduced “Amazon Cash” earlier this year, which lets customers add cash to their account balance at more than 10,000 physical locations around the country. Food-stamp grocery purchases are set for an overhaul with a new test allowing online food stamp payment. Amazon and Wal-Mart are among 10 in a two-year pilot by the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to start next year.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah YMCA, Walmart aim to combat child hunger with Summer Food Program Deseret News Published: June 7, 2017 11:30 p.m. Updated: 7 hours ago + Leave a comment 1 of 1 View 1 Item Adobe Stock photo The YMCA of Northern Utah and Walmart Foundation are joining forces to combat child hunger this summer. SALT LAKE CITY — The YMCA of Northern Utah and Walmart Foundation are joining forces to combat child hunger this summer. The Y Summer Food Program, with the help of a $7.1 million grant from the foundation, will serve 5 million meals and snacks along with learning activities to 250,000 kids and teens at 1,500 locations across the country. The program runs through Aug. 18. Last summer, the YMCA of Northern Utah served more than 28,000 meals and 19,000 snacks in Utah communities. According to the U.S Department of Agriculture, more than 22 million children and teens live with food insecurity and receive free or reduced-cost meals through the National School Lunch Program. However, only 12 percent of those kids continue to receive meals through the USDA’s Summer Food Service Program. Comment on this story “Children within our own community rely on free and low-cost lunch plans during the school year, and they’re at risk of going hungry when school’s not in session,” Rich West, CEO of YMCA of Northern Utah, said in a statement. “The Y’s Summer Food Program helps fill that gap to make sure kids can enjoy healthy and delicious meals and snacks all summer long.” Funding is used to provide healthy meals and snacks for the Y’s Summer Day Camp in Salt Lake, Weber, Summit and Wasatch counties, as well the YMCA Camp Roger and YMCA Mill Hollow overnight camps.

The levee fees should not be borne by all the homeowners in the district. History has shown that incomes have allowed all the expansions and comforts within the terminal. Raises given to the director seem in excess too. There are businessmen on the board who condone all this—shame on them. There should be a responsibility to maintain all the property, including the levees. Lack of payments due are a direct reflection on each board member. To claim exemption from fees and not pay delinquent amounts is abhorrent. It is time for an outside audit and all funds due paid in full within 30 days after audit completion. A report to the public is due. ANITA C. GATZKE Little Rock Wrong side of history After reading that the Arkansas governor and congressional delegation approved the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, I was saddened. President Trump’s decision to abandon the world community isolates America. Their statements abound with hyperbole that the Paris agreement will harm the economy and cost jobs. Ignored was advice to remain from the world’s largest retailer—Wal-Mart—as well as many other corporations which do business in Arkansas that it is beneficial to curb carbon pollution. We can end dependency on fossil fuels, create jobs and grow the economy with Carbon Fee and Dividend (CF&D). As the price of fossil fuels (the carbon pollution emitters) increases with the annually rising fee, polluters quickly find cleaner and more efficient ways to produce energy. This leads to more investment into clean, renewable energy. The money is given back to consumers and employers. The returned fee will assist lowincome families with energy costs. Businesses will have incentive to create more jobs as their dividend is hinged to the number of permanent employees. A recent Yale University poll reported almost half of Trump voters and two-thirds of moderate Republicans support a carbon tax. Gentlemen, please to read “The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends.” This study is the work of leading Republicans: James Baker III, George Schultz (both served as secretary of State and Treasury) and Rob Walton, Wal-Mart chairman, 1992-2010. Even with the U.S. beginning the process of leaving the Paris Accord, companies, cities and states are moving ahead with carbon pollution reduction policies and an investment in a clean future. Please let’s don’t let Arkansas once again be on the wrong side of history! An overwhelming majority know that curbing carbon pollution is good business. ROBERT McAFEE Hackett High costs of college One of the suggestions for the high cost of college is free tuition. I think this will drive up the costs even faster. Free money seems to have that effect. Why not stop any payments from the federal government to colleges that increase tuition costs faster than the cost of living increases? The states could decide how much additional money would go to colleges. This would make colleges responsible for holding down costs. GREG MARTIN Hope On women in combat I once again grimace at the turnaround of your editorial page. What was once a page which was populated by writers who were seasoned by the world, it seems we now have a new tribe who wish to see it framed as what they wish it to be. I read with askance the “Welcome to the jungle” contribution which could no more typify this flight from reality. It called to mind the warning from Heinlein, “All societies are based on rules to protect pregnant women and young children. All else is surplusage, excrescence, adornment, luxury, or folly, which can—and must—be dumped in emergency to preserve this prime function. As racial survival is the only universal morality, no other basic is possible. Attempts to formulate a ‘perfect society’ on any foundation other than ‘Women and children first!’ is not only witless, it is automatically genocidal. Nevertheless, starry-eyed idealists (all of them male) have tried endlessly—and no doubt will keep on trying.” Our current military leaders are earnestly trying to follow orders by obeying this genocidal policy. Further, I have yet to read of any of our current male troops being captured and raped—which the newly integrated policy seems to invite. We were assured that the new military policy of gender neutrality would have no effect on the effectiveness of our troops while we witness the repeated instances of complaints and problems of discipline in implementing this specious, politically correct policy. We do so at our peril. WAYNE G. ELLIOTT El Dorado Will regret it in time I agree totally with Gary Brodnax’s letter. I believe Tom Cotton, John Boozman, and others in Congress who support President Trump in his many ignorant moves will in time regret it. Mr. Brodnax’s comparison of Trump with Chamberlain of pre-World War II days is right on the mark. Most voters under 40 know little of that. History is not their favorite subject, and the knowledge of it is very lacking. I believe Trump is a disgrace as president, with his lies, his fraud, his commercial approach to the office, his crude and questionable overt behavior toward women, handicapped, and all minorities. How did we ever get this man elected? The answer is money. Promises of jobs for those in dirty industries which will never materialize. When will his supporters get wise to likely the greatest electoral scam in our history?

Citing the need to stay engaged with The Trump Administration, American business leaders said they will remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Last Thursday, President Trump said he would pull the United States from the Y 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from some world leaders and some heads of industry. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) CEO Robert Iger left White House advisory councils after President Trump’s deceleration Asked about CEO’s’ criticism of the US withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Mr. Spicer added he does not know if President Trump will replace Messrs Musk and Iger on the business council. “IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world,” a company spokeswoman said. Jamie Dimon CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized President Trump’s decision, but said he would not step down from the President’s business group. “I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Mr. Dimon said in a statement. General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on President Trump’s manufacturing council, said he was disappointed in the decision and added: “Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” Mr. Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on President Trump’s manufacturing council, called the withdrawal “a failure of American leadership.” A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve “as a voice for working people.” Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In a TV interview last Friday, Mr. Cohn said the move was part of the administration’s efforts to boost US economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for US goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. “If we can grow our economy, we’re going to consume more and more products,” he said. “We’re going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption.” President Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP (NYSE:BX). Blackrock Inc CEO Larry Fink said he will continue to serve on President Trump’s business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra will remain on the Presidential advisory panel.

The items are offered by Amazon via various third parties, and include shirts, hats and pins, some bearing Palestinian flags and many featuring a fist symbolizing resistance. One shirt demanding “Free Palestine” features a drawing the covers the entire area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, thus including all of Israel. Sears said Wednesday it had removed a line of clothing featuring the slogan from its website. The clothing was offered for sale by another company, Spreadshirt Collection, and included tank tops, T-shirts and hoodies featuring a variety of pro-Palestinian messages. Amazon website sells many items with “Free Palestine” logo, June 7, 2017. (Screen capture: Amazon.com) The clothing was offered for sale through Sears Marketplace, which provides a platform for third-party sellers to market their wares through websites managed by Sears. The designs included a clenched fist in the colors of the Palestinian flag and statements opposing the Israeli occupation. Ynet news reported that Walmart was also selling the shirts and featured a screen capture of them for sale, but by later Wednesday they were no longer available. According to a statement from a Sears spokesman, the apparel was pulled from the site based on feedback the company received. “These items were being sold by a third-party seller via the Sears Marketplace,” said the statement, which was sent to JTA Tuesday afternoon. “Given the feedback we’ve received, they are being removed.” The statement added that Sears felt it had been “unfairly singled out on this issue,” as similar items were available for purchase from other companies, such as Amazon and Walmart. Amazon website sells many items with “Free Palestine” logo, June 7, 2017. (Screen capture: Amazon.com) The Sears statement noted that the company serves “a broad base of customers around the country and around the world,” and that it has 200 employees in Israel. Amazon has also been under fire recently for selling Holocaust-denying books on its website. The books included “Did Six Million Really Die?” by Richard Harwood; “The Six Million: Fact or Fiction?” and “The Myth of the Extermination of the Jews.” After receiving complaints the company initially removed the texts only from its websites in nations where Holocaust denial is illegal, including Italy, France and Germany. The books remained available for some time on Amazon’s US and UK stores, though they appear to no longer be available.

The first was an interview I read with the chariman of Welspun Group, Balkrishan Goenka. In the interview, Goenka talks about the aftermath of an issue that impinged on the credibility of the Group. In August last year, Walmart charged the Group as having mislabelled 7,50,000 sheets and pillow cases sold under the Fieldcrest label as premium Egyptian cotton products. In addition, Walmart terminated all business ties with Welspun and offered refunds to their customers. Goenka describes how Welspun coped with the fallout of this incident on their company’s brand and image as well as the fact that owning up to their mistake enabled them to recover their credibility fast. What struck me though was Goenka spoke about how it was not the fault of any one individual but a more systemic issue. He also mentioned the incident forced them to adopt a more process-oriented approach at Welspun to ensure such issues never cropped up again. Next, the storm brewing in India cricket with allegations that the coach Anil Kumble and the captain Virat Kohli did not see eye to eye with each other, also caught my eye. This was followed by the resignation of Ramachandra Guha, a member of the Committee of Administrators (CoA) appointed by the Supreme Court to oversee BCCI running, alleging massive conflicts of interest within the BCCI. He cited the case of ex-cricketers who were both commentators as well as managing some of India’s cricketers through their sports management companies. He also mentioned that the challenge with the BCCI was the personality-driven nature of all appointments with the captain for example having an inordinate say in the coach being appointed for the team. What these two incidents brought home to me was the fact that organisations often face challenges, especially as they scale and become big, of becoming personality oriented. Personalities have an inordinate say in the running of the organisation. While this might work during good times, it can also quickly lead to a breakdown of communication and lack of accountability when crisis hits an organiation. As Goenka and his team realised, making an organisation process-oriented can help to ensure that there are enough check-points built into the system to pre-empt any catasrophic failures. While there are legitimate concerns that organisations in a growth phase can be stifled by too many processes, on the whole, a lack of process-orientedness can cause more damage than the other way round. Paraphrasing a popular quote by Peter Drucker on culture and strategy, process-orientedness eats individuality for breakfast!

He said he had locked himself in a room and he believed she was currently in the garage disposing of drug items because she knew he called police. Officers located the girl, 17, who was subsequently taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. They removed several drug paraphernalia items from the garage. The incident was referred to the officer in the juvenile diversion program and to the drug enforcement unit for possible charges. Fraud, Hidden Woods Trail: Police from Parkersburg, West Virginia reported May 25 two men were stopped in a vehicle on their way to Ohio and they were in possession of multiple Ohio drivers' licenses. One of the licenses belonged to a Mayfield Heights resident. Officers notified the man, who had no idea how the suspects got his information. Grand theft, Mayfield Road: A vehicle, valued at $34,000, was reported stolen from Nick Mayer Ford May 25. An employee said the last time it was accounted for was in March, but he waited to report it while they made sure it wasn't accidentally sent or sold to another dealership. One of the two sets of keys was also missing. Theft, Mayfield Road: Officers tried unsuccessfully to stop a vehicle driven by two suspected Walmart shoplifters May 24. They lost sight of it at Brainard and Wilson Mills roads in Highland Heights. The vehicle was registered to a Mayfield Heights woman, who told officers a man, who had been living with her, had been in possession of the vehicle for several weeks. An employee at Walmart positively identified the Youngstown man, 59, as one of the suspects he saw loading his vehicle at an emergency exit. Theft and fleeing charges are pending. Overdose, East Miner Road: officers responded to a home at 1:26 a.m. May 28 for a report of a suspected overdose by a 21-year-old man. He was revived and taken to the hospital. Several indicators of drug use were presented in his room, including suspected heroin and three different types of unidentified pills. The incident is under investigation and reports indicate police have dealt with the man multiple times in the past for similar incidents. Abusing a minor, Bonnie Lane: A resident said May 28 her boyfriend pressed on her son's legs to restrain him while they were in a vehicle May 15. She said the man had since ended their relationship and obtained a protection order against her. She said she is also in fear of him because she called his place of work and informed the management that he is a drug user and he will likely be fired because it is a drug-free workplace. She said he still has a key to her home. Officers told her to contact police if he attempts to contact her or shows up at her house. The prosecutor determined there were no criminal actions in the incident. Theft, Mayfield Road: An East Cleveland man, 31, and Euclid man, 29, were each charged with theft from Walmart May 25 after they fled the store, but were located in the area. The latter was also cited for driving under suspension, no operator's license and short-cutting private property. He was believed to be acting as a lookout while the other man concealed items in his overalls. Theft, Mayfield Road: A Gates Mills Place resident reported May 30 items were stolen from a package that was delivered to the mail-room. She said the package contained two cell phone cases, valued at $16. Management said video surveillance would be reviewed to try to identify a suspect. Theft, Golden Gate Plaza: A price scanner was reported stolen from JoAnn Fabrics May 24. A manager said it looked like a cell phone and someone may have stolen it thinking it was. Theft, Mayfield Road: A woman and a man were suspected of stealing $729 worth of merchandise from Walmart May 24. An employee was able to recover some of the merchandise but the suspects fled in a vehicle and were not located. A bag of merchandise was left behind and subsequently found to be stolen from Bath & Body Works. Suspicion, Mayfield Road: Officers responded to Dunkin Donuts May 27 for a report of a man drinking a beer in a vehicle. The man who had the beer was a passenger in the vehicle and the beer was thrown out before officers arrived. Disturbance, Mayfield Road: A resident at Gates Mills Place apartments said May 27 another tenant threatened him because his two-year-old son was bouncing a basketball. The woman denied making any threats and was advised to contact the leasing office about the matter. Officers told the man a basketball should not be bounced inside the apartment. He thought it was OK because it was not the "middle of the night". See more Mayfield Heights news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest.

Now, Wallmart is testing a similar concept in Oklahoma City that uses a huge, automated kiosk. The feature, available at the Walmart Super Center at N Council and W Britton Roads, is similar to Amazon’s in several ways. Users place grocery orders either online or through a mobile app before driving to the pickup point for collection. But unlike AmazonFresh Pickup, employees pack the items into bags ready for the customers to collect themselves. After arriving at the 24-hour kiosk, it’s simply a matter of typing a five-digit code into the machine, which will then retrieve the goods. The 20-foot-by-80-foot building contains refrigerators and freezers that keep the groceries fresh. Using the service is free, but there is a $30 minimum order limit, so it’s not ideal if you’re only looking to purchase a small number of items. AmazonFresh Pickup requires a Prime membership, but there are no minimum order requirements. Amazon is trying to compete with Wallmart in several areas of the grocery market. Jeff Bezos’s company is still experimenting with its cashier-less convenience store after the public launch was delayed due to technical issues. Wallmart says it’s been testing grocery pickups since 2014 and offers the service in more than 600 stores across the US. A similar kiosk concept is already used in the UK by supermarket retailer ASDA, which is owned by Walmart. Walmart is also testing another way for customers to retrieve their online orders: giant, vending machine-style pickup towers. They’re currently being used in Atlanta, Bentonville, Detroit, Houston, and Raleigh, and are designed to make collecting non-food orders quicker and easier.

Jun 06, 2017 Strategic Management North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Supports K@W's Marketing Content If retailers are hurting today, among the wounds — both self-inflicted and imposed from outside — is free shipping. On the demand side, customers are increasingly expecting free delivery and even free returns. The problem for retailers, of course, is that free shipping cuts deeply into profits. The innovation bubbled up as a way to get customers comfortable with the idea that online shopping could be no more expensive than physical visits — that it leveled the online total purchase tab with the physical-store receipt. It worked. The customer has moved online, and now retailers find themselves on the horn of a dilemma. The cost of free shipping to retailers is high, but the cost of yielding loyalty and market share to a competitor is even higher. How did retailers get here? “One of the first online retailers was Zappos,” says Wharton marketing professor Barbara E. Kahn, who is also director of Wharton’s Jay. H. Baker Retailing Center. “People had thought no one would buy shoes online, because you have to try them on, but Zappos started free shipping and free returns, so that let people buy a size bigger and a size smaller, and free shipping and free returns minimized the risk. That set up the expectation of free shipping. For most of the legacy retailers, because of the costs of the delivery and the returns, they frequently make less money online than in physical stores. The costs are very high.” Now, among the retailers offering free shipping are Dell, Kate Spade, L.L.Bean, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. Last holiday season, Target and Best Buy introduced free shipping, and retailers are reporting that the point at which they often lose an online customer is at the very end of the transaction — when shipping costs get added. So, what now? Given that online shopping is woven into habit for most U.S. shoppers, might retailers be able to cut out free shipping? “It might be too hard to walk that back now,” says Wharton marketing professor Peter Fader. “But there are so many areas costing retailers even more — promotions they run — that they should be trying to wean themselves off of.” Instead, retailers will probably have to find other ways of recouping the cost of free shipping. Ironically, the answer may lie in a phenomenon best illustrated by Amazon, which is of course the source of much of the scramble for market share. Amazon refers to its Prime service as a way to get “fast, free shipping and more,” and many customers themselves refer to the service as being free. But of course, they are paying $10.99 a month or $99 per year for their “free shipping.” People are good at creating “different mental accounts,” explains Fader. “They keep one account for membership and they are paying for membership, and that is coded entirely separately from this transaction. They are part of the club and they forget about the fee. It’s very clever on Amazon’s part, surrounding the customer with benefits that give the impression that the company has your best interest at heart. People like this.” “Free shipping is certainly one aspect of how Amazon has recalibrated our consumer brains, to be honest,” says retail futurist Doug Stephens, author of The Retail Revival. Stephens says that Amazon innovations like quick and efficient searches, intelligent recommendations based on prior browsing history, fast and free shipping and making consumers increasingly reliant on online reviews “fundamentally changed our wiring as consumers” to such an extent that “many experiences we have with other retailers seem somehow dissonant now.” “Free shipping is certainly one aspect of how Amazon has recalibrated our consumer brains, to be honest.”–Doug Stephens Fast, Cheap and Out of Control Studies and surveys show that customers increasingly want their stuff, they want it now, and they don’t want to pay extra. The number of customers who said they would pay nothing extra for next-day delivery increased to 38% from 22% between 2015 and 2016, according to a September Deloitte online survey published in the Wall Street Journal. The number willing to pay more for same-day delivery showed a similar increase in resistance, with 32% in 2016 saying they would not pay extra, up from 24% in 2015. Sponsored Content: One study found free shipping to be the top incentive to online buying, “with almost nine in 10 consumers reporting that free shipping would make them shop more online,” according to a survey by Walker Sands Communications of 1,400 U.S. consumers. “This number has steadily increased over the past two years and has become significantly more influential than other logistics considerations, even as same-day shipping becomes more prominent,” says the firm in its “Future of Retail 2016” white paper. Exactly how much is free shipping eating into profits? Jerry Storch, CEO of Hudson’s Bay Company, which includes Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, has pointed to the high costs as well as the larger, fundamental problem of e-commerce: “The economics are clear,” he said at the Shoptalk conference in 2016. “Direct-to-home has a supply chain cost three times higher than a store-based model. So, when we say the internet retailer can charge less, how can that be? Maybe this is why so many of us have so much trouble emulating Amazon’s model and making any money. It’s because it’s really expensive and it is also why Amazon [has] had trouble making money on merchandising sales. It’s a very expensive model and it’s not less expensive than the store-based model.” The expectation for free shipping, and the heightened awareness around price generally, is something retailers brought on themselves, says Fader. “The reason we are having this conversation is because it’s a race to the bottom. Anything that retailers do that calls attention to price is not in their best interest. That plays to Amazon’s strength, and most retailers can’t win that battle.” Amazon and other mega-retailers can negotiate lower shipping rates than smaller retailers, and Amazon Prime U.S. membership has doubled in the past two years, to an estimated 80 million members. Prime carries an increasing number of benefits, and Prime members spend more than non-Prime customers: an estimated $1,300 versus $700 per year, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. “Free shipping is not going away since Amazon knows that it is painful to them but much more debilitating for their competitors,” says Wharton emeritus marketing professor Stephen J. Hoch. “Amazon Prime is a two-part tariffs pricing policy, where Amazon sells stuff for close to cost and makes all their profit on the fixed membership fee, just like Costco. And free shipping is just another cost that Amazon absorbs in order to get the flat fee and longer term loyalty.” “Free shipping is not going away since Amazon knows that it is painful to them but much more debilitating for their competitors.”–Stephen J. Hoch Very specialized sellers don’t compete with Amazon and so should have little trouble passing on shipping costs to their buyers, Hoch adds. “I might also point out that, due to huge investments in logistics and IT along with massive scale, Amazon’s shipping costs are likely significantly lower than most competitors – even Walmart.” While Amazon invests in the delivery fleet of the future, Walmart has fired a low-tech salvo in the struggle between the two retailers. It recently started a pilot program in which store employees drop off online orders to customers on their way home from work. “There is really strong overlap between where our associates are already heading after work and where those packages need to go,” a Walmart spokesman told The Washington Post. How Fun Can Be Better Than Free One way in which retailers might be able to side-step the free-delivery trap is to give customers another system of options and incentives — “to try to get the customer once again to bear the cost of that last mile,” says Kahn, “so even if you are shopping online, if you pick it up in person in the store, that saves a lot of money.” Another option, she suggests, is giving customers a better price on an item if they are willing to wait until a delivery truck is already scheduled to come to a particular neighborhood. Ultimately, says Kahn, “the competition is going to be at the platform level. For example, if you tell Alexa you’re out of milk, then you’re going to be getting it from Amazon — when consumers shop for things that need to be replenished, it will be a big advantage when a voice recognition system is in the house, particularly if it gets to the point where everything is automatically delivered. Once people are locked into a system, it’s a loyalty loop; if Amazon — or Google or Facebook — can make shopping super-convenient, and deliver items easily when you need them at a competitive price, people will stop going to the physical stores for these kinds of items.” But another big way retailers can alleviate the burden of free shipping, and take on Amazon, is by doing what the best of them have done well for so long: making shopping a joyful experience. Amazon is all about efficiency. Even its bricks-and-mortar stores telegraph this ethos. Like the website, the new Amazon bookstore model is cheaper for Prime customers — again, highlighting price — and stocks only 3,000 of the most popular titles. The store serves as both a big advertisement for Prime and a tidy way for Amazon to eliminate some of its own cost of free shipping. It has not been getting good reviews. “Amazon’s first bookstore in New York City sucks the joy out of buying books,” was the headline on one recent review of the experience at the relatively small (4,000-square-foot) store on Columbus Circle. “For the most part, the layout creates clutter that mirrors Amazon’s own site, except without the ease of actually getting the book you want quickly and cheaply,” writes Thu-Huong Ha in Quartz. “They’ve taken the fun and joy and treasure-hunt aspect out of retailing, and made it into this cold, calculating science, and you just don’t want to play that game.”–Peter Fader “They’ve taken the fun and joy and treasure-hunt aspect out of retailing, and made it into this cold, calculating science, and you just don’t want to play that game,” says Fader about Amazon generally, pointing to the AEIOUs of retailing as a means of focusing on what matters to shoppers. A is for advice, which great sales people are skilled at offering; E is for experiential value, such as providing snacks or samples as customers browse a pleasant, attractive store environment; I is for interaction, as in with humans, who might be specially trained to provide different service levels for the best customers; O is for opportunities that are often missed online that misinterpret past buying histories to make inappropriate recommendations or that miss cross-selling opportunities; and U is for understanding, which traditional retailers often don’t gather efficiently from their own salespeople about what customers are looking for and how the experience might be improved. “There’s no P for price in there,” says Fader. “It’s a matter of creating a competing proposition that people just want to buzz about. Part of that is experiential, making it a joy to interact with that company, and part of it is going to be personalization — the kinds of things Amazon does not want to do that could raise costs.” In other words, says Fader, it’s about retailers sending the message to the customer: “We anticipate your needs, it’s not just about efficiency and price.” The extent to which retailers are being threatened by free shipping depends on which end of the spectrum a retailer positions a brand, says Stephens. “Right now, there are two kinds of shopping — fast shopping and slow shopping. Fast is commodity items, as in it’s 10 at night and I’m in my pajamas and I want to find what I need from Amazon. And I think there is a place for fast shopping. It’s about breadth of assortment, ease of finding it, and how cheaply you can get it.” If you go up against Amazon, then fast and free shipping is an essential arrow in the quiver, Stephens says, and Walmart is being drawn into that fight. “But if you’re a brand about slow shopping, it’s about having a rich, immersive, tactile and maybe even emotionally connected experience, and then the emphasis is taken off [of free shipping],” Stephens notes. “Some customers might abandon their cart when it comes to paying for shipping, but many will say it’s worth the difference.” Which companies have been good at differentiating themselves? Stephens believes Sephora succeeds. “You could argue that cosmetics are commodity items,” he says. “They don’t necessarily sell things that can’t be purchased elsewhere, but they’ve managed to create an experience online and in stores that is elevated compared to the Amazon experience.” He notes that Sephora has strong content, good technology in stores and “they hire true brand ambassadors – not just salespeople who are half there. They get customers to bypass Amazon and go to the store itself.” “Amazon is not the end of competition, or the end of fun. People still have a need for that. And that’s what it should be.”–Barbara Kahn Kahn agrees that experience is critical. “Amazon is positioned to take over these kinds of basic-need items. They offer large assortment, convenience and fair prices,” she says. “But I think people will still find value and fun in shopping, or they will respond to a cool new brand. The value added could be experiential or aesthetic, something different that will attract people, and consumers will go to that.” With Amazon, we really are in a paradigm shift in terms of change in shopping behavior, Kahn adds. “Long ago, Walmart broke the mold and radically changed the grocery business, and the big box stores broke the mold. But Amazon is not the end of competition, or the end of fun. People still have a need for that. And that’s what it should be. Shopping is not always about just pushing a button and then something arrives on your doorstep. People will still enjoy ‘retail therapy.’” Kahn also doubts that free shipping is going away, but says the economics of it will be hard to sustain without some mitigating factor. “I do think there will be some kind of shake out,” she says, “and then it’s maybe you get free shipping, but you are paying a subscription price, or the price is built in somewhere else. It’s like the way you are lured into a store to get some incredible discount on something for sale, and then there is a higher premium on the other things you bought along with the sale item. You get free shipping, but the margins come from somewhere else.” Supports K@W's Marketing Content Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "Can Retailers Escape the Scourge of Free Shipping?."

By MariaLaMagna Reporter Amazon AMZN, +0.24%  may have just pulled in some new customers. The retailer announced this week it will offer its Prime membership, which gives consumers access to services including free shipping and Amazon-exclusive television shows, for $5.99 a month to consumers who are on government assistance programs. Prime usually costs $10.99 a month, or $99 per year. To qualify, customers must have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which looks like a debit card. It is the card those receiving SNAP funds or cash benefits use. Retail experts have said it seems to be an effort for Amazon to compete with Wal-Mart WMT, +0.97% which already has a large percentage of consumers on government assistance among its clientele. Wal-Mart had some $13 billion in sales in 2016 from shoppers who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), accounting for 18% of the money spent on that program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Amazon will add more ways to qualify for those who participate in government programs that do not require EBT cards, a company spokeswoman said. Amazon offers a 30-day free trial period. It’s a move somewhat similar to offering senior citizens discounts, said George Barany, the director of strategic initiatives for America Saves, a division of the Consumer Federation of America, an association of nonprofit consumer organizations based in Washington, D.C. Don’t miss: 5 tech stocks for the long run This isn’t the first time Amazon has gone after customers who have lower incomes: In April, it announced a program called Amazon Cash that allows customers to add money to their Amazon account if they don’t have a debit or credit card. Some 7% of households in the U.S. do not use banking accounts at insured institutions, and this program would allow them to still shop online through Amazon. Several cellphone carriers, including Verizon VZ, +0.00%  and AT&T, T, +0.04% offer discounted service for people with low incomes through a government-assistance program called Lifeline. And individual cultural institutions, such as the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, sometimes offer discounts to those on government assistance as well. Lower-income households are a lucrative target market. The spending habits of people with low incomes are complicated and sometimes misunderstood. For one thing, it is hard for many low-income households to predict what their incomes will be from month to month, or even day to day, said Clinton Key, the research officer for savings and financial security at Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia. As a result, many families have developed sophisticated systems for budgeting and making sure they know where every dollar goes, he said. And that’s good news for Amazon, big-box stores and cell phone companies that charge regular monthly fees. For people with steady, reliable and sizable housing, buying in bulk can alleviate some of those worries, Key said. For those who can’t rely on transportation, online ordering helps. See also: A third of American families have ‘roller coaster’ finances But signing on for subscription services, which require a monthly payment, can also be difficult for families that budget carefully, Key said. One example: Many buy cellphone plans with prepaid minutes instead of a recurring monthly charge because of this, he said. And “one-click ordering” on Amazon isn’t necessarily smart for someone who needs to count every dollar. In fact, discounting the Prime membership has a “negligible” benefit for these consumers, he added. Retailers also know that lower-income customers like to splurge too, especially when it comes to special occasions. For example, families with lower incomes actually spend more on high school proms than those with higher incomes, according to Visa V, -0.07% In 2015, families with household incomes below $50,000 planned to spend $1,109 on prom, and families making under $25,000 planned to spend $1,393. In contrast, families who made over $50,000 spent an average of $799.

By MariaLaMagna Reporter Amazon AMZN, +0.24%  may have just pulled in some new customers. The retailer announced this week it will offer its Prime membership, which gives consumers access to services including free shipping and Amazon-exclusive television shows, for $5.99 a month to consumers who are on government assistance programs. Prime usually costs $10.99 a month, or $99 per year. To qualify, customers must have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which looks like a debit card. It is the card those receiving SNAP funds or cash benefits use. Retail experts have said it seems to be an effort for Amazon to compete with Wal-Mart WMT, +0.97% which already has a large percentage of consumers on government assistance among its clientele. Wal-Mart had some $13 billion in sales in 2016 from shoppers who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), accounting for 18% of the money spent on that program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Amazon will add more ways to qualify for those who participate in government programs that do not require EBT cards, a company spokeswoman said. Amazon offers a 30-day free trial period. It’s a move somewhat similar to offering senior citizens discounts, said George Barany, the director of strategic initiatives for America Saves, a division of the Consumer Federation of America, an association of nonprofit consumer organizations based in Washington, D.C. Don’t miss: 5 tech stocks for the long run This isn’t the first time Amazon has gone after customers who have lower incomes: In April, it announced a program called Amazon Cash that allows customers to add money to their Amazon account if they don’t have a debit or credit card. Some 7% of households in the U.S. do not use banking accounts at insured institutions, and this program would allow them to still shop online through Amazon. Several cellphone carriers, including Verizon VZ, +0.00%  and AT&T, T, +0.04% offer discounted service for people with low incomes through a government-assistance program called Lifeline. And individual cultural institutions, such as the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, sometimes offer discounts to those on government assistance as well. Lower-income households are a lucrative target market. The spending habits of people with low incomes are complicated and sometimes misunderstood. For one thing, it is hard for many low-income households to predict what their incomes will be from month to month, or even day to day, said Clinton Key, the research officer for savings and financial security at Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia. As a result, many families have developed sophisticated systems for budgeting and making sure they know where every dollar goes, he said. And that’s good news for Amazon, big-box stores and cell phone companies that charge regular monthly fees. For people with steady, reliable and sizable housing, buying in bulk can alleviate some of those worries, Key said. For those who can’t rely on transportation, online ordering helps. See also: A third of American families have ‘roller coaster’ finances But signing on for subscription services, which require a monthly payment, can also be difficult for families that budget carefully, Key said. One example: Many buy cellphone plans with prepaid minutes instead of a recurring monthly charge because of this, he said. And “one-click ordering” on Amazon isn’t necessarily smart for someone who needs to count every dollar. In fact, discounting the Prime membership has a “negligible” benefit for these consumers, he added. Retailers also know that lower-income customers like to splurge too, especially when it comes to special occasions. For example, families with lower incomes actually spend more on high school proms than those with higher incomes, according to Visa V, -0.07% In 2015, families with household incomes below $50,000 planned to spend $1,109 on prom, and families making under $25,000 planned to spend $1,393. In contrast, families who made over $50,000 spent an average of $799.

By MariaLaMagna Reporter Amazon AMZN, +0.33%  may have just pulled in some new customers. The retailer announced this week it will offer its Prime membership, which gives consumers access to services including free shipping and Amazon-exclusive television shows, for $5.99 a month to consumers who are on government assistance programs. Prime usually costs $10.99 a month, or $99 per year. To qualify, customers must have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which looks like a debit card. It is the card those receiving SNAP funds or cash benefits use. Retail experts have said it seems to be an effort for Amazon to compete with Wal-Mart WMT, +0.97% which already has a large percentage of consumers on government assistance among its clientele. Wal-Mart had some $13 billion in sales in 2016 from shoppers who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), accounting for 18% of the money spent on that program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Amazon will add more ways to qualify for those who participate in government programs that do not require EBT cards, a company spokeswoman said. Amazon offers a 30-day free trial period. It’s a move somewhat similar to offering senior citizens discounts, said George Barany, the director of strategic initiatives for America Saves, a division of the Consumer Federation of America, an association of nonprofit consumer organizations based in Washington, D.C. Don’t miss: 5 tech stocks for the long run This isn’t the first time Amazon has gone after customers who have lower incomes: In April, it announced a program called Amazon Cash that allows customers to add money to their Amazon account if they don’t have a debit or credit card. Some 7% of households in the U.S. do not use banking accounts at insured institutions, and this program would allow them to still shop online through Amazon. Several cellphone carriers, including Verizon VZ, +0.00%  and AT&T, T, +0.00% offer discounted service for people with low incomes through a government-assistance program called Lifeline. And individual cultural institutions, such as the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, sometimes offer discounts to those on government assistance as well. Lower-income households are a lucrative target market. The spending habits of people with low incomes are complicated and sometimes misunderstood. For one thing, it is hard for many low-income households to predict what their incomes will be from month to month, or even day to day, said Clinton Key, the research officer for savings and financial security at Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia. As a result, many families have developed sophisticated systems for budgeting and making sure they know where every dollar goes, he said. And that’s good news for Amazon, big-box stores and cell phone companies that charge regular monthly fees. For people with steady, reliable and sizable housing, buying in bulk can alleviate some of those worries, Key said. For those who can’t rely on transportation, online ordering helps. See also: A third of American families have ‘roller coaster’ finances But signing on for subscription services, which require a monthly payment, can also be difficult for families that budget carefully, Key said. One example: Many buy cellphone plans with prepaid minutes instead of a recurring monthly charge because of this, he said. And “one-click ordering” on Amazon isn’t necessarily smart for someone who needs to count every dollar. In fact, discounting the Prime membership has a “negligible” benefit for these consumers, he added. Retailers also know that lower-income customers like to splurge too, especially when it comes to special occasions. For example, families with lower incomes actually spend more on high school proms than those with higher incomes, according to Visa V, -0.15% In 2015, families with household incomes below $50,000 planned to spend $1,109 on prom, and families making under $25,000 planned to spend $1,393. In contrast, families who made over $50,000 spent an average of $799.

By MariaLaMagna Reporter Amazon AMZN, -0.01%  may have just pulled in some new customers. The retailer announced this week it will offer its Prime membership, which gives consumers access to services including free shipping and Amazon-exclusive television shows, for $5.99 a month to consumers who are on government assistance programs. Prime usually costs $10.99 a month, or $99 per year. To qualify, customers must have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which looks like a debit card. It is the card those receiving SNAP funds or cash benefits use. Retail experts have said it seems to be an effort for Amazon to compete with Wal-Mart WMT, +0.75% which already has a large percentage of consumers on government assistance among its clientele. Wal-Mart had some $13 billion in sales in 2016 from shoppers who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), accounting for 18% of the money spent on that program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Amazon will add more ways to qualify for those who participate in government programs that do not require EBT cards, a company spokeswoman said. Amazon offers a 30-day free trial period. It’s a move somewhat similar to offering senior citizens discounts, said George Barany, the director of strategic initiatives for America Saves, a division of the Consumer Federation of America, an association of nonprofit consumer organizations based in Washington, D.C. Don’t miss: 5 tech stocks for the long run This isn’t the first time Amazon has gone after customers who have lower incomes: In April, it announced a program called Amazon Cash that allows customers to add money to their Amazon account if they don’t have a debit or credit card. Some 7% of households in the U.S. do not use banking accounts at insured institutions, and this program would allow them to still shop online through Amazon. Several cellphone carriers, including Verizon VZ, -0.12%  and AT&T, T, -0.13% offer discounted service for people with low incomes through a government-assistance program called Lifeline. And individual cultural institutions, such as the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, sometimes offer discounts to those on government assistance as well. Lower-income households are a lucrative target market. The spending habits of people with low incomes are complicated and sometimes misunderstood. For one thing, it is hard for many low-income households to predict what their incomes will be from month to month, or even day to day, said Clinton Key, the research officer for savings and financial security at Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia. As a result, many families have developed sophisticated systems for budgeting and making sure they know where every dollar goes, he said. And that’s good news for Amazon, big-box stores and cell phone companies that charge regular monthly fees. For people with steady, reliable and sizable housing, buying in bulk can alleviate some of those worries, Key said. For those who can’t rely on transportation, online ordering helps. See also: A third of American families have ‘roller coaster’ finances But signing on for subscription services, which require a monthly payment, can also be difficult for families that budget carefully, Key said. One example: Many buy cellphone plans with prepaid minutes instead of a recurring monthly charge because of this, he said. And “one-click ordering” on Amazon isn’t necessarily smart for someone who needs to count every dollar. In fact, discounting the Prime membership has a “negligible” benefit for these consumers, he added. Retailers also know that lower-income customers like to splurge too, especially when it comes to special occasions. For example, families with lower incomes actually spend more on high school proms than those with higher incomes, according to Visa V, -0.21% In 2015, families with household incomes below $50,000 planned to spend $1,109 on prom, and families making under $25,000 planned to spend $1,393. In contrast, families who made over $50,000 spent an average of $799.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Amazon's decision to go after lower-income customers with a discounted Prime membership has puzzled some industry experts, but it could turn out to be a brilliant strategy. Critics say that shoppers on government assistance, whom Amazon is targeting with its new discount, are less active online and have limited access to broadband internet, smartphones, and credit cards. The discount slashes the cost of Amazon's monthly Prime membership nearly in half, to $5.99 a month, for customers who have an electronic benefit transfer card, which is used for government assistance like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps. "These consumers have always indexed lower in online transactions, and their living circumstances are often not well-suited to package delivery, and many of these consumers don't have vehicles to drive to a location to pick up packages," Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an internet consultant, told The Associated Press. "Of the long list of businesses that Amazon could target, this doesn't seem like the biggest one." But Amazon doesn't necessarily need a huge swell of lower-income shoppers to join Prime for the effort to pay off. Even if Amazon were to get a tiny fraction of them hooked on Prime, which offers free two-day shipping on millions of items, it could pay off in the long run because Prime customers are highly loyal, according to Doug Stephens, a retail-industry consultant. "Prime is the gateway drug for the heroin that is Amazon," Stephens told Business Insider. "If this can get new people into the Amazon ecosystem, it's very sticky." View photos shopping cart shopper walmartMore (Reuters) Prime customers spend 2.7 times as much with Amazon as non-Prime members, according to Greg Melich, an analyst at the research firm Evercore. And the service has an astonishingly high renewal rate of roughly 96%, meaning most customers renew their memberships after paying for the service for two years. Amazon has been highly effective in getting upper-income shoppers hooked on Prime. The service claims about half of US households, including more than 70% of upper-income households — those earning more than $112,000 a year — as members, according to data from Piper Jaffray. By comparison, a customer with a one-person household who qualifies for SNAP earns less than $15,444 a year. View photos Walmart customers vs AmazonMore (Less than 25% of households making less than $25,000 subscribe to Amazon Prime, while 60% of consumers making the same income regularly shop Walmart.Magid Retail Pulse) But Amazon has nearly tapped out its penetration in upper-income markets, so it makes sense that it would be looking for other routes of growth. About 20% of the US population receives government assistance, and most of those customers are more loyal to Amazon's retail rival, Walmart. Nearly $1 out of every $5 in SNAP benefits was spent at Walmart last year, according to Morningstar. So Amazon's strategy of going after lower-income shoppers isn't meant only to tap into a new market, but to send a message to Walmart, which has been trying to lure Amazon's customers. "Amazon is sending a message to Walmart saying, 'OK you want to try and chase our core customer? Then we can play that game, too,'" Stephens said.

Aldermen gave Walmart permission to sell liquor at the store, and they approved variances regarding the store’s signs, parking lot and fencing. Construction on the 195,000-square-foot store is expected to begin in 2018, and the store might be open in 2019, according to a project manager. Along with the request to sell liquor, Walmart received the following variances: ▪  Walmart will be allowed to have a 10-foot fence around the bale and pallet enclosure and the trash compactor enclosure. City code limits fences to 7 feet high. ▪  The store will have parking lot aisles 24 feet wide instead of the 25 feet required by code.

Ward 4 Alderman Raffi Ovian abstained during the vote and later declined to say why. Ward 6 Alderman Andy Gaa was absent from the meeting. The Walmart Supercenter at Carlyle Avenue and Green Mount Road on the east side is in a special business district, where shoppers are charged an extra 1 percent sales tax, but the proposed store on the west side will not be in a business district. The extra sales tax collected in Green Mount Commons is rebated to the developers and can be used to help pay for building the shopping center. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 4:57 Belleville City Clerk Dallas Cook discusses public safety ahead of mayoral election Pause 4:35 Belleville Mayor Mark Eckert discusses public safety ahead of mayoral election 1:54 Belleville residents discuss whether they feel safe in the city 1:41 Fischer's Restaurant general manager talks about decision to close 1:44 Belleville City Clerk Dallas Cook removed from electoral board 0:47 Burger King plans July 2017 opening for new Belleville location 1:12 Scenes from the Gingerbread 5k run/walk in Belleville 1:02 Old Salt Union performs in Belleville 1:29 St. John Bosco Children's Center expands to help more abused or neglected kids 2:03 Former Meredith Home to get new $121,000 roof Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Belleville getting second Walmart Supercenter Belleville Mayor Mark Eckert details the second Walmart Supercenter being planned for Illinois 15 at South 74th Street.

Sun protection that is both effective and affordable does exist — you can find it at Walmart, Target and even Trader Joe’s. But if you don’t know what to look for in a sunscreen or how to get the most protection out of it, you will likely waste your money and possibly increase your odds of developing skin cancer. Shielding your skin from the sun’s harmful rays need not be complicated, though. We’ve broken it down into three simple steps. So consider this your sun protection cheat sheet: 1. Choose a “broad spectrum SPF” sunscreen The term “sun protection factor,” or “SPF,” refers to a sunscreen’s level of protection from ultraviolet B radiation, or UVB rays. The American Academy of Dermatology also describes UVB rays as “burning rays” because they are the primary cause of sunburn. But the sun also emits ultraviolet A radiation, or UVA rays. The AAD also describes these as “aging rays” because they can prematurely age skin, leading to wrinkles and age spots. Both UVA and UVB rays can lead to skin cancer, too, so you need sunscreen that protects against both. Such products are often described as offering “broad spectrum” protection. Look for sunscreens with the phrase “broad spectrum SPF” followed by an SPF number on the front of the product. Under federal law, manufacturers can use that phrase only on products that pass a broad-spectrum testing procedure. If you expect to swim or sweat, also look for the word “water-resistant” followed by either “(40 minutes)” or “(80 minutes)” on the front of the bottle. By law, this phrase can be used only on products that pass a testing procedure. If you don’t want to trust the government with your skin, check out the results of sunscreen product testing conducted by independent nonprofits like Consumer Reports or the Skin Cancer Foundation. For example, Consumer Reports has deemed each of the following sunscreens a “Best Buy,” its term for products that are both affordable and effective: Pure Sun Defense Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 50 (available at Target and Walmart) Trader Joe’s Spray Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50+ (sold only in Trader Joe’s stores) Walmart’s Equate Sport Sunscreen Continuous Spray Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Walmart’s Equate Sport Sunscreen Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Walmart’s Equate Ultra Protection Sunscreen Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 50 2. Apply sunscreen correctly How you apply sunscreen impacts its effectiveness. For example, Consumer Reports’ testing has found that using half as much sunscreen as directed means you’ll get half as much SPF protection as a product offers. Start by shaking the bottle, even if the directions don’t say to. This helps distribute the active ingredients — which provide the sun protection — throughout the product, Consumer Reports says. Next, experts advise applying sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before going into the sun. As for the quantity of sunscreen, the AAD recommends using 1 ounce of lotion — enough to fill a shot glass — to cover the exposed areas of the body. You can adjust that amount depending on your body size. Consumer Reports offers another rule of thumb: 1 teaspoon per area of the body — such as the face, neck or each arm. Don’t forget areas like your ears, hands, lips and the tops of your feet. For your lips, check out the two dozen lip balms and other lip products with sunscreen that have earned a Seal of Recommendation from the Skin Cancer Foundation. Lastly, reapply sunscreen about every two hours, and after swimming or sweating. 3. Wear the right clothing To get more sun protection than a sunscreen can offer, toss on a hat or some clothing. Some textiles have been rated with a UPF, or ultraviolet protection factor, which indicates how much UV radiation can penetrate the fabric. The Skin Cancer Foundation considers a UPF rating of 30 to 49 “very good protection” and a UPF of 50 or more “excellent protection.” In general, light-colored, lightweight and loosely woven fabrics offer less sun protection than darker and heavier fabrics. According to the foundation: “That white T-shirt you slip on at the beach when you feel your skin burning provides only moderate protection from sunburn, with an average ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of 7. At the other end of the spectrum, a long-sleeved dark denim shirt offers an estimated UPF of 1,700 — which amounts to a complete sun block.” A good rule of thumb: If you can see through a fabric when you hold it up to the light, UV rays can penetrate it.

Juliana Stefek, 42, was arrested on a theft warrant on Tuesday. The charges stem from an incident last month at the Walmart on Doral Drive. According to a police report, a Walmart loss prevention employee spotted a woman who bagged several items without paying for them at a self-checkout register. The employee said the woman paid for $24 worth of merchandise but bagged $71 worth. The employee got the license plate number of the suspect’s car, which was registered to Stefek, according to a police report. Police said she was then identified by the employee in a photo lineup. Images captured on surveillance video showed Stefek wearing what appears to be a guard’s uniform at the time. A spokesperson at the Ohio State Penitentiary said Stefek has worked as a corrections officer there since June of 2015 and is on paid administrative leave, pending their investigation. .

Fallon Lowe's wants its big-box stores valued as empty buildings, not as functioning businesses. Lowe's wants its big-box stores valued as empty buildings, not as... SAN ANTONIO - A North Texas lawmaker is taking on some of the country's biggest retailers, pushing for legislation in the special session next month that would close a loophole in the tax code that has allowed Lowe's and other retail chains to cut local property taxes by millions of dollars in other states. Lowe's, Home Depot, Kohl's, Target and Walmart have sued appraisal districts across the U.S. to have their big-box stores valued as empty buildings, not functioning businesses - labeled the "dark store" appraisal theory by county property appraisers. North Carolina-based Lowe's has successfully used the argument in Michigan and Indiana, where major retailers have driven down property values and tax revenue. County property appraisers in Texas fear commercial properties across the state will shed billions of dollars in value if Lowe's prevails in a lawsuit against the Bexar County Appraisal District. The Harris County Appraisal District settled a similar lawsuit with Lowe's in November for 18 company stores in the Houston area, Appraisal District spokesman Jack Barnett said. The legal challenges have the potential to "derail the property tax system," said Michael Amezquita, chief appraiser for the Bexar County Appraisal District that serves San Antonio.

The state comptroller's office estimates Texas cities, counties and school districts will lose $2.9 billion if Lowe's wins its Bexar County lawsuit and other commercial properties take up the "dark store" legal argument, potentially leaving homeowners to pick up the property tax burden. State lawmakers sought to prevent a cataclysmic loss of property value and tax revenue this legislative session. House Bill 27, authored by state Rep. Drew Springer, R-Muenster, and backed by Comptroller Glenn Hegar, aimed to limit businesses' ability to use the unusual legal strategy when contesting their property values. The bill passed out of two committees but never made it to the House floor for a final vote. "It would've been a major step forward," Hegar said in an interview. "Now, would it have solved everything? No, but then most pieces of legislation don't ever solve everything." The bill could get new lease on life after Gov. Greg Abbott called a special legislative session starting July 18 to address property tax reform, the trans-gender bathroom bill and several other issues that didn't pass during the regular session. Springer said he plans to refile the legislation but could also try to attach it to another bill. "I will take that (Abbott's call) to mean anything that makes tax reform better," Springer said this week. The original bill's focus was narrowed in committee after the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and other business groups tried to block the bill, arguing that it was too broad and would ensnare other properties that weren't used for retail. Dale Craymer, the association's president, said the legal theory hasn't gained enough traction in state courts to merit legislation. "We were skeptical there was an immediate problem that needed to be addressed, but what came out of the committee was a reasonable way of addressing that," Craymer said. "What was initially introduced went far beyond dark stores and extended to basically almost every type of property. That was inappropriate, in our mind." Lowe's and other retailers have sued appraisal districts around Texas to try to bring down their property values. Often, appraisers have settled out of court rather than use up their meager budgets on drawn-out court battles. Lowe's is suing the Bexar County Appraisal District to cut its property values in half for 10 stores in the San Antonio area, which were valued between $80 and $85 per square foot in 2016. The appraisal district estimates those values would drop to $30 a square foot if Lowe's prevails in its lawsuit. Lowe's spokeswoman Karen Cobb said the company is unable to comment on the legislation. The retailer has said it is seeking a "fair assessment" of its properties in the Bexar County lawsuit. Popp Hutcheson, the Austin-based law firm representing Lowe's in the Bexar County lawsuit, met with the comptroller's office and the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association to oppose the bill, arguing it violated the Texas Constitution's "equal and uniform clause," said Mark Hutcheson, one of the firm's partners. Online shoppers Hutcheson declined to comment on the case, but he said retailers including Lowe's have used the legal theory to lower property values as more shoppers increasingly buy products online. Retailers, who overbuilt large-format stores in the mid-1990s through mid-2000s, are stuck with a glut of big-box properties that no one wants. "If you don't have that demand growth driving the real estate market, then you're going to start seeing some falloff on value," Hutcheson said. Lawmakers on the Texas House Ways & Means Committee limited the bill so it would apply only to retail properties. "We got to a point where the appraisal districts weren't happy and the retailers weren't happy, so we thought we probably found the right spot," said Springer, the bill's author. The move alienated county appraisers, who say the original bill was needed to prevent other commercial property owners from using the same tactic. The original legislation would have required commercial property owners to value their land based on its "highest and best use." It also included other provisions appraiser say gave it more teeth. "Once it came back to us and we saw the language, we really felt like it no longer was beneficial and helpful to the situation," said Brent South, chief appraiser for the Hunt County Appraisal District. South, who also chairs the Texas Association of Appraisal Districts' legislative committee, later added, "We were happy to see it die." The tactic has been a lucrative one for Lowe's. The home improvement chain managed to cut its Indiana property taxes by $120.8 million, resulting in a $49.9 million jump in taxes for Indiana's other residents and businesses, according to a 2015 study commissioned by the Indiana Association of Counties. Taxpayers in Michigan have returned almost $100 million to retailers since 2013 after the Michigan Tax Tribunal handed down several favorable rulings to retailers who used the "dark store" argument, a 2015 study by the Michigan Association of County Treasurers showed.

According to court documents, Gordon Nobriga made the videos between September and December 2016. The investigation started on Dec. 30, 2016, when he was stopped at the border at El Paso, Texas. Customs and Border Protection searched his phone and found "numerous videos" of men and boys using a public restroom, court documents said. Investigators said Nobriga used a "peep hole" from the neighboring stall to make the videos. Court documents said Nobriga told agents the videos were produced in a store but didn't say which one. The cellphone was then seized. The case was then turned over to the Homeland Security office in Phoenix. Agents later identified the store as a Phoenix Walmart. They looked at surveillance video and found Nobriga going in and out of the bathroom of the store and spending "hours on end" inside the bathroom, court documents said. Investigators identified two victims, with one being a 14-year-old boy, court paperwork said. Multiple victims still haven't been identified. Nobriga was arrested on May 25 as he got off a flight in Phoenix. He is a flight attendant for American Airlines. According to the court documents, he admitted to using his phone to record his victims but denied distributing the videos. Nobriga was convicted of misdemeanor indecent exposure after an arrest in 1998. He now faces 11 counts of voyeurism. KTVK TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In recent years, Amazon has made more and more of a push to combat brick and mortar competitors with same-day shipping and automatic ordering for some household needs and their latest business decision looks to be a clear shot at one of Walmart’s largest customer demographics. Amazon is now offering a massive 45-percent discount on it’s Prime subscription service for customers who are receiving government aid. While it’s not a direct discount on all Prime items, that subscription discount will open doors for people to access deep discounts and free shipping on thousands of items which makes a difference for low-income shoppers who may be paying similar prices at Walmart. This opportunity, however, means that those customers who don’t have the means to get to a Walmart or don’t live close to a location can now have necessary purchases delivered directly to their home for discount prices. Recode reports that the discounted price will be $6/month for those eligible, compared to $11/month normally — people will qualify for the lower price on a yearly basis and can qualify up to four total times for the discount. While Walmart is one of the foremost recipients of the US SNAP program, Amazon’s offer only currently applies to customers who use EBT cards which can be used electronically. However, Walmart shouldn’t feel too comfortable with that differentiation as Amazon also says they are looking for ways to expand beyond EBT eligibility in the future.

Maybe it’s just a Houston thing, but every fucking wal mart every fucking time has at least one jackoff driving through the parking lot opposite of how the parking stalls are oriented.

Walmart tests automated grocery kiosk pickup by: Natalie Dreier, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: Jun 7, 2017 - 7:47 AM OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma City Walmart is the test site for new grocery technology that could make the trip to a super center less of a headache. >> Read more trending news The box store giant has introduced an automated kiosk where shoppers, who select and pay for their groceries online, can drive up and pick up their purchases without setting foot inside the traditional bricks-and-mortar store, NewsOK reported. More than 30,000 items, from fresh produce, to meat, to dairy items, can be ordered online and picked up for free 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at the test site, Mashable reported. The cost of the groceries are the same as if shoppers left their cars and selected the products themselves, but they do have to have a $30 minimum order, NewsOK reported. Employees select the products ordered, then store the items in bins inside of a refrigerated kiosk, where a customer can then walk up to a touchscreen and punch in a code and pick up their groceries. A similar kiosk is being tested in the United Kingdom. Walmart © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Finance Search Search Donald TrumpPresident Trump’s Aides Are Urging Him Not to Fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions Comey testimonyWhat to Expect From James Comey’s Testimony UberUber’s Biggest Rival in India Says the Company Is ‘Despicable’ Congressional Hearings9 of the Most Dramatic Congressional Hearings in U.S. History Term Sheet Term Sheet — Wednesday, June 7 Erin Griffith Jun 07, 2017 500 Hello, it’s Fortune 500 day! The 2017 list is live here. For 63 years, this list has ranked the largest companies in the U.S. by revenue. Berkshire Hathaway hit its highest ever ranking at No. 2, surpassing Apple and Exxon Mobile. (Walmart is No. 1 for the 5th year in a row.) KKR got rather dramatically knocked off the list – last year it was #347; this year it’s #656. As Fortune’s Lucinda Shen explains: KKR earned some $5.5 billion from its investments in 2015, but that figure dropped to $109 million in 2016. That was partly due to a poor-performing bet in an energy exploration company, Samson Resources, and a slide in the value of KKR's shares of payment-tech company First Data Corp after a volatile start to 2016. Blackstone and Carlyle Group clock in at #503 and #869, respectively.  Icahn Enterprises, which some consider a buyout firm, ranks No. 168. A few other notable tidbits: Apple is the most profitable Fortune 500 company. New York state has the most Fortune 500 companies, followed by California and Texas. The median revenue for a Fortune 500 company is $11.4 billion. 41 of them are worth more than $100 billion. Oil prices are to blame for many of the 15 companies that fell off the list. There are 32 female CEOs, marking a new record of 6% (and up from 21 last year.) Just 18 Fortune 500 CEOs are the founders of their companies. And the biggest sector represented is utilities. We also have two feature stories on new entrants to the list. Michal Lev-Ram has a profile of Activision Blizzard’s plans to become the ESPN of competitive gaming. Gaming is hits-driven and few companies figure out how to building a lasting business in the category. This year Activision Blizzard entered the Fortune 500 for the first time and it’s only the third gaming company to ever join the list. (Electronic Arts was on it once in 2010 and Atari, twice in 1988 and 1989.) And there’s a feature story by Scott Cendrowski about new entrant Tesla’s ambitions in China. *** I’m calling the rest of today’s column UNPOPULAR OPINION WEDNESDAY. Feel free to weigh in if you disagree with the following takes on news from three potential, maybe, someday Fortune 500 companies: 🔥 Meal kits are not going to save media. Vice Media, a media company worth as much as $5 billion with a $1 billion “revenue run rate,” has launched its own meal kit business in partnership with Chef’d, a startup that creates meal kit businesses for media partners. I’m going to repeat an argument I made a year ago: The media industry loves a fad business model and meal kits is starting to feel that way. When daily deals were all the rage, everyone from the New York Times to glossy magazines and radio stations jumped into the fray with their own Groupon-killers. Those all, of course, went nowhere. Now they’re doing it again with meal kits. The Times, Men’s Health, Real Simple and Cooking Light have all ventured into meal kit partnerships. Some of them have already dissipated. In another year, I’d like to check in with Vice and the others to see where their food-in-a-box experiments have landed. 🔥 Pinterest will be a sleeper success. Raising a round of funding from inside investors is often seen as a sign of weakness. Pinterest yesterday announced exactly that -- $150 million in new funding at a valuation of $12.3 billion. The valuation represents a slight step up from the company’s last private valuation, but only because of an increase in share count. In other words, this does not look great. The knock on Pinterest is that it hasn’t moved fast enough to introduce new features, to create innovative ad products, to catch up on mobile, to increase its users. It also has been fairly quiet and hype-averse, a reflection of its media-shy founder Ben Silbermann. Pinterest was founded two years before Snap, which is now publicly traded, worth $23 billion, forecasting $770 million in annual revenue. (Pinterest expects $500 million this year, sources say.) However! People close to Pinterest say the financing doesn’t change the company’s plans to go public next year; this is just existing investors wanting to invest more. I am willing to bet that when Pinterest finally goes public, it will have better business fundamentals than Snap. Perhaps I’ve been brainwashed by bullish Pinterest investors and my own use of the service, which I find myself mindlessly scrolling through more often than Snapchat or Facebook. It’s also the one service that knows my purchase intent and directly influences my purchase decisions. Pinterest plans to use the new money to expand its visual search tools and improve its recommendations to users. The company says it has doubled revenue per search query since the beginning of the year. 🔥 215:20 is not a great ratio of sexual harassment claims to firings. Uber’s internal investigation has turned up 215 claims of sexual harassment. That’s a high number for a 12,000-person company. The news that Uber had fired 20 employees as a result was unveiled at an internal meeting yesterday and publicly leaked within seconds. More heads may roll: The company is still investigating 57 of the cases. Meanwhile Uber has not announced any progress on its COO hunt and it’s also in the market for a new CFO, having lost finance head Gautam Gupta last week. And the much-anticipated independent report from Eric Holder is expected to be released very soon. The silver lining is that Uber has snagged two notable hires: Harvard Business School Professor Frances Frei and Apple Music marketing head Bozoma Saint John. Saint John will focus on re-branding Uber as … the opposite of what it is now. She explained her decision in an interview with Business Insider: "It’s grown so quickly in such a short amount of time — and leadership and others have been so focused on growing the business — that this very moment is about changing the image of Uber and crafting what that brand story is. That hasn’t been done yet." She told Recode: “I know what I’m walking into.” IRL: I’ll be at the Fortune Venture stage at the Northside Festival in about an hour, interviewing David Pakman of Venrock.

The information you need to start your day, including top headlines from PaymentsSource and around the Web: Walmart's grocery machine: Walmart is stepping up its grocery game. In addition to a previously announced system that allows store employees to deliver groceries on their drive home, the retail giant is testing a system for using unmanned kiosks to deliver grocery orders, according to The Verge. Unlike Amazon or Shipt (see below), the system doesn't restrict the window of pickup. The kiosk is available 24 hours a day, and customers retrieve their order by punching in a five-digit PIN, according to the article. The kiosks are still in testing, and the service is free but requires a $30 minimum purchase, The Verge notes. Bloomberg News Amazon with benefits: Amazon is offering discounted Prime subscriptions to anyone with a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer card, lowering the barrier to buying groceries via AmazonFresh, which requires a Prime subscription, Engadget reports. Amazon has been aggressively expanding its presence in the brick-and-mortar space, with a focus on disrupting grocery purchasing and delivery. AmazonFresh Pickup allows customers to pick up groceries ordered online, and Amazon Go allows consumers to take items from a store without stopping at a checkout. The EBT discount lowers Amazon Prime's cost to $6 a month and includes all other Prime perks such as two-day shipping, video and music streaming; Amazon may expand the discount to other assistance programs at a later date, Engadget reports. Shipt ahoy: The online grocery contender Shipt is expanding. The Birmingham, Ala.-based company raised an additional $40 million in funding from previous backers Greycroft Partners, e.ventures and Harbert Venture Partners, TechCrunch reports. Unlike the AmazonFresh Pickup model, which lets customers set a time of their choosing to get their groceries from an Amazon location, Shipt suggests delivery windows and works with local grocery chains, according to the article, which notes Shipt and AmazonFresh are about the same size. Shipt has an annual membership fee but does not charge a per-order fee. Face off: Biometric facial recognition is being adopted in the payments industry for use cases such as Mastercard's "selfie pay" authentication system and other mobile commerce projects, and it can also be used effectively in law enforcement. South Wales Police used facial recognition for the first time to arrest a suspect, Ars Technica UK reports. The article has few details about the alleged crime, but notes there was an existing warrant for the suspect's arrest and the man's face was likely part of a database of 500,000 images. From the Web Danish fashion tycoon invests in Swedish payments firm Klarna Reuters | Wed Jun 7, 2017 - Anders Holch Povlsen, owner of Danish fashion retailer Bestseller, is buying a stake in payments firm Klarna, one of Europe's most highly valued tech startups, the firm said on Wednesday. Payments in UAE Banking System Normal, Central Bank Says After Qatar Rift The New York Times | Wed Jun 7, 2017 - Payment and remittance transactions in the United Arab Emirates financial system are operating as normal, the central bank said on Wednesday after the UAE's diplomatic rift with Qatar caused uncertainty over some banking deals. The UAE financial system is positioned to support normal transactions and the central bank will continue to closely monitor the situation and any developments, taking any necessary steps to maintain stability, the central bank said in a statement carried by official state news agency WAM. Millennials are driving the future fintech trends – and big banks will fail if they don't keep up Wired | Tue Jun 6, 2017 - The pace-setters for the coming waves of fintech are the millennials. Now entering their 30s, they’ll be the dominant demographic in the workforce in just a few years. To meet their expectations, fintech companies will have to prioritize transparency, digital first, and personalized services, which were the common themes discussed during the fireside chats at WIRED Money 2017. More from PaymentsSource Why parents favor prepaid and P-to-P Consumers who use person-to-person payment apps are twice as likely to hold a prepaid card, but the two payment methods are not always interchangeable. Markets, not governments, should drive cash's replacement Regulatory moves to reduce paper money often have confusing, and even dangerous results, writes Eric Grover, a principal at Intrepid Ventures. Apple's latest move could deepen its rift with banks Apple’s announcement of its upcoming launch of P-to-P capabilities was no surprise. But the details should come as a shock to many of the banks that have bent over backwards to support Apple Pay on Apple's strict terms. As 'gig' companies consolidate, Tipalti sees a way to untangle their tech As the gig economy expands, at least some consolidation is inevitable. As a result, companies that already have complex webs of payments, billing cycles and workflows will need a way to merge their systems with those of their acquisition targets. Canada's Interac gives Android Pay broad support Android Pay achieved a broad and rather sudden rollout in Canada this week when the nation’s domestic debit network, Interac, announced its support for the mobile payment service days after Google officially launched Android Pay there. ThreatMetrix, Gemalto partner on combined security offering In a partnership designed to protect online customers from attacks, digital security providers ThreatMetrix and Gemalto will provide holistic authentication options to an array of financial services providers.

The temperature was 82 degrees. Someone had left their two small dogs in their vehicle, presumably while they were in the store, the windows completely rolled up, car turned off. I struggled with what to do. I was fearful that if I did something to get them some air, the owner would come back to the car and potentially be angry. As a woman, I did not want to expose myself to any potential harm. What can I do in the situation? Is there a number I can call to report the abuse? — Beth S., via email   The Medford Police Department addressed this very issue May 19 with a lengthy post on its Facebook page, Beth. The post talked about whether it is OK to break a window to rescue a pooch, but it also contained information on who to call if you're concerned about the welfare of a furry friend. According to the post, "There is no law allowing or prohibiting rescuing a dog from a hot car. It just comes down to common sense." Before you break a window, police advised, consider the following: Is the dog showing signs of distress (excessive panting, tongue turning dark purple, behaving frantically, loss of bowels, lethargic)? Summon help if the vehicle is parked near a business to have the owner of the car paged. Call police at 541-770-4783 or 911 if the situation appears urgent. If the dog is showing obvious signs of distress as noted above and there is no sign of the owner, you can break the window to save the dog, the post said. "We have window-punch tools that make it easy to break a window, and we would prefer to be the ones to take on that responsibility and liability. However, we understand that we get tied up and simply can't get there in time.

MST June 06, 2017 Gordon Nobriga. (Photo: MCSO) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PHOENIX - Police arrested a man last month who spent "hours on end" in a Phoenix Walmart bathroom videotaping men and boys inside a stall, according to police documents. Gordon Harold Nobriga, 50, was stopped Dec. 30 of last year at the border in El Paso, where Customs and Border Protection agents seized his phone. They found it was connected to a Google Photos account with "numerous" videos of men and boys using a public restroom, Phoenix PD documents show. CBP contacted Homeland Security authorities in Phoenix after discovering he lived here. He was not arrested at that time. Agents were able to identify the specific Walmart store used to film the video and found surveillance video of Nobriga going into the restroom, spending hours on end there. They have not released the location of the store to the public. Two victims in the videos have been identified and interviewed, according to police, including a 14-year-old boy. Nobriga, who is a flight attendant for American Airlines, was arrested as he exited a flight at Sky Harbor May 25. He currently faces two counts of voyeurism, but could face more as the investigation continues. Nobriga said he did take the video but denied to police that he distributed it. He has since been released from custody. American Airlines released the following statement after Nobriga's arrest: “We take this matter very seriously, and have been cooperating with law enforcement throughout their investigation. Since this case is a pending criminal matter, we must refer all questions to Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Phoenix.” © 2017 KPNX-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Sky 12 over Bud Light spilled on Valley highway Police, FBI investigate Surprise homicide Family warns of "dry drowning" after son dies days after swimming Baby found in shopping cart outside food city The victims, technology to wrong-way drivers in Arizona Toddler served alcohol instead of apple juice at local restaurant 72-hour sale: Southwest fares fall below $100 round-trip Deadly wrong-way crash on SR 51 'Miracle Baby' born without nose dies A look at Gilbert's mega mansion More Stories Valley residents oddly eager to help clean up after… Jun. 7, 2017, 11:21 a.m. Your voice: Will you watch James Comey's testimony?

Mark Young myoung@bradenton.com A large swath of land in Parrish has sat ready for construction for more than a year, but officials say permitting is almost complete and a new Walmart supercenter could begin construction soon. Mark Young myoung@bradenton.com Business June 05, 2017 3:10 PM Parrish Walmart construction to begin soon after permit delays By Mark Young myoung@bradenton.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Parrish It was April 2016 when Benderson Development filed construction permits for a Walmart Supercenter that would anchor a long-planned Creekside Commons plaza in Parrish. Other than some preliminary site work on 50 acres at the intersection of Erie Road and U.S. 301, there has been no activity at the site, leaving residents wondering what happened and the rumor mill churning fast.   But officials say all is well and the 285,000-square-foot retail plaza is close to clearing its final hurdle for construction to begin. Neither Benderson nor Walmart officials returned calls for comment, but Manatee County Building and Services Director John Barnot said Walmart would not close on the property until all of the permits had been received, and one more is pending. “There is one more permit they need and that’s from (Florida Department of Transportation), which stands to reason because all of the entrances into that area are off 301, which would be issued by FDOT,” Barnot said. “They expect to have that in hand in the next few days, and I’m told that it’s full speed ahead from there.” Barnot said it makes sense that no further work has been done until all of the permits are in hand because, “The next step would be all of the infrastructure work and that’s very costly.” The project was first approved in 2008, but the Great Recession halted construction and the plans were modified in 2014 with Benderson signaling the projects readiness by filing construction permits last year. Walmart will occupy the lion’s share of the acreage with a planned 182,000-square-foot supercenter at an estimated construction cost of $10.25 million, with the entire project expecting to cost a little more than $16 million. Benderson’s site plan includes a 52,813-square-foot strip center attached to Walmart among other retail sites fronting U.S. 301. Benderson has owned the property since 2004, having purchased it for $2.12 million at the time.

(Liz Martin/The Gazette) Matthew Patane The Gazette More stories from Matthew Jun 7, 2017 at 8:33 am | Print View It’s not just small tents and business upstarts that want to sell fireworks in Iowa. Multiple big-name chains, from Iowa convenience stores to the world’s largest retailer, have eyed sales of the explosives, the state’s new firework-sales application process shows. The State Fire Marshal’s Office opened the application process last Thursday, about three weeks after firework sales became legal. Within the first five days, the office had received more than 168 applications, it said Monday. The office has issued seven retail licenses and registered 11 wholesalers. It expects to see about 1,000 sites that can sell fireworks in the state. “Our employees processed applications over the weekend, and we’ll continue to put in long hours in the upcoming weeks,” State Fire Marshal Jeff Quigle noted in a statement. By Tuesday morning, more than 1,000 applicants were listed for retail and wholesale firework sales on the website. Many of those were individual stores from the same company as each location selling fireworks needs a license. Wal-Mart, for example, had 113 stores listed while there were 59 applications for Bellino Fireworks, and more than 20 for Iowa Fireworks Co. Two Costco stores, including one in Coralville, were listed as applicants, as were multiple locations for retailers Bomgaars, ShopKo, Sam’s Club, Hy-Vee and Dollar General. Grocery store chain Hy-Vee, based in West Des Moines, will leave the decision of whether to sell fireworks to individual store managers, spokeswoman Tara Deering-Hansen said. “We do not carry fireworks through our distribution centers, though, and we will not start, even with this change in Iowa law,” Deering-Hansen said. “The stores that do sell fireworks in the states where it’s legal, they work directly with the fireworks suppliers to do so.” Three Hy-Vee stores had started fireworks-sale applications as of Tuesday. Deering-Hansen said Hy-Vee does not have a corporate stance on the sale of fireworks. A spokeswoman for Deerfield, Ill.-based pharmacy chain Walgreens said some Iowa stores have begun the permit application process, but the company is “still deciding whether or not to move forward with the sale of these items.” Starting an account or an application does not mean the company will sell fireworks this year. Forty-four Kum & Go locations, for example, started the application process to sell consumer fireworks. Spokeswoman Kristie Bell said the West Des Moines-based convenience store chain has considered selling fireworks at its Iowa stores between June 1 and July 8. With numerous cities still determining how they would handle fireworks, though, the company decided not to move forward this year, Bell said. “... Since several cities were still working through their approach to the new law, we didn’t have a clear picture of where we would and would not be able to sell them, so (we) decided against it for this year,” Bell said in an email. Casey’s General Stores, based in Ankeny, has not applied to sell fireworks. Vice President of Accounting James Pistillo said the company likely won’t sell fireworks directly in the near future. Casey’s may allow independent fireworks stands to lease property outside of its stores, however, Pistillo said. About 20 Target stores in Iowa also were listed as applicants. “With the recent change in Iowa law, we are currently working on permits and hope to offer fireworks in local Target stores as soon as we are able,” a Target spokesperson said in an email. Costco declined to comment. Other major retailers, including, Wal-Mart, Dollar General, Kmart and CVS Pharmacy, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawmakers passed the legislation this year that made it legal to possess, sell and use consumer-grade fireworks during two periods in a year. Licensed businesses can sell fireworks from permanent structures from June 1 to July 8 and Dec. 10 to Jan. 3. Those businesses can use temporary structures from June 13 to July 8. Consumer fireworks include roman candles, bottle rockets and firecrackers. Previous Iowa law only permitted the use of novelty fireworks, such as sparklers and snakes, according to the fire marshal’s office. l Comments: (319) 398-8366; matthew.patane@thegazette.com Like what you're reading?

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Amazon hit a milestone recently after the price of one share hit US$1,000 for the first time, giving it a total value of close to $500 billion. That makes it the fourth-biggest company in the U.S. in terms of market capitalization and twice the size of brick-and-mortar rival Walmart. The online retailer’s incredible growth has come from expanding into more and more areas of the economy, providing its customers with speedy delivery of everything from socks and books to lawn chairs and computers. One category it has yet to enter, however, is prescription drugs. Amazon wants to change that and dispense drugs alongside its hundreds of millions of other wares. Would this be a good thing for consumers and the health care system? The biggest online retailer’s entry into this market may lead to efficiency gains, but the cost would be dear in terms of further severing the link between patients and actual pharmacists. Research, including my own, shows that patients need more face-to-face time with pharmacists, not less. Shares of Amazon have been soaring and recently reached $1,000 for the first time. AP Photo/Richard Drew Brief history of pharmacies Pharmacies (or apothecaries, as they were once known) have existed since antiquity. The first retail pharmacy began in Philadelphia in 1729. Back then, pharmacists not only dispensed medications to patients (without a prescription) but diagnosed diseases and handcrafted drugs. In 1951, Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which prohibited pharmacists from dispensing FDA-approved drugs without a valid prescription. Mail-order pharmacies harnessing the raw efficiency of mass-filling prescriptions began to boom in the 1980s. In 2013, about 39 percent of customers said they refilled their prescription by mail order, up from an estimated 6 percent in 1990. Clearly it costs less per unit of labor for prescriptions to be filled in a centralized facility with industrial pill counting technology and with auto-refills of medication than when prescriptions are filled manually in the store by a local pharmacist triggered by a patient calling the pharmacy. Consumers say they like the convenience of mail-order pharmacies, which is likely one of the reasons Amazon is getting serious about entering the $450 billion market for prescription drugs. Amazon might be able to enhance the user experience, as well as make the process even more efficient, but there’s a cost. Drugs aren’t socks What is missing from the discussion is that prescription drugs are not socks or refrigerators. When consumers take drugs, they become patients, not just customers. While prescription drugs hold the promise of preventing disease and treating symptoms, they can maim or even kill if not used correctly. In 1993, for example, medication-related errors led to about 7,400 deaths, more than double the number of fatalities in 1983, according to a review of death certifications. Unfortunately, they’re the latest data available, but most likely the number is higher today. A key reason for these errors seems to be a lack of communication. A 2003 report noted that better communication among physicians, pharmacists and nurses could prevent 86 percent of the most serious medication errors, which suggests shifting more drug dispensation to a centralized facility from local pharmacies would worsen the problem. Studies show face-to-face encounters with pharmacists lead to greater prescription adherence and thus better outcomes. Reuters/Gary Cameron Too many people aren’t taking their meds Another thing that makes prescription drugs very different than Amazon’s typical offerings is that in many cases it’s essential that patients actually take their meds as prescribed. That’s not happening. Taking drugs in the right dosage for the right amount of time is critical to effectively cure a disease, prevent the formation of antimicrobial resistance and keep a malady from progressing. Yet on average, only about 50 percent of American patients typically take their medicines as prescribed, costing hundreds of billions of dollars in adverse outcomes and unnecessary hospitalizations each year. Furthermore, in my own research involving patients with cardiovascular diseases, I have found that people are simply not receiving the medications they need – and when they are, they aren’t following through on the required dosage, leading to worse outcomes. I’ve found that greater interaction between patients and pharmacists can help solve this problem. Other studies have shown that more active face-to-face engagement with a pharmacist improves a patient’s level of adherence to a prescription, which can lead to better outcomes. A study involving Walgreens pharmacists, for example, suggested direct drug counseling reduced health care costs by $266 on average, mostly due to fewer hospitalizations. Discarded drugs have been found in water at this landfill in Bath, Maine, with the Kennebec River in the background. AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty The environmental costs Finally, another key aspect of prescription drugs is that their waste is a big and growing problem. Unlike the clothes or appliances you order, medications can’t simply be returned to the merchant, restocked and resold to another customer. There’s no way of ensuring they weren’t adulterated or improperly stored, and the risks are too great. That means every pill that goes unused must be disposed of, which is a huge waste of money but also is a major source of pollution. In a 2015 assessment of medications turned in for disposal, more than half of the prescriptions purchased from mail-order pharmacies still contained 80 percent of more of the original pills. Even more troubling, 39 percent had every single pill originally dispensed. That compares with much-lower rates of 37 percent and 17 percent for community pharmacies. Many of the unused drugs, however, aren’t properly disposed of and instead end up in a landfill or flushed down a toilet. A nationwide study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1999 and 2000 found low levels of pharmaceuticals – including antibiotics, hormones, contraceptives and steroids – in 80 percent of the rivers and streams sampled, contaminating 40 million Americans’ drinking water. Studies have shown that aquatic animals are adversely affected by these hormones, with some male fish developing female sex organs, and there are concerns that long-term exposure to a tainted water supply can lead to more superbugs. Amazon’s success has come partly from shipping as efficiently as possible. AP Photo/Mark Lennihan Small gains for many pains Amazon is a revolutionary company that has reshaped how we shop and has helped drastically increase the efficiency of shipping small packages. This could even allow it to reduce some of the negative side effects, noted above, of remote pharmacies, such as by making it more cost-effective to ship small quantities of pills to reduce waste. But to my mind, any modest gains in efficiencies or cost savings are paid for dearly by the negative outcomes that result from medication-related errors and patients not following through on their prescriptions, while the waste of unused drugs will continue. And while this problem has been with us for a while, Amazon, due to its size and ability to quickly dominate markets, would make the situation a lot worse. Delivering a product more efficiently cannot be the only metric of success. With prescription drugs, saving lives must be considered as well.

Currently, customers who have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card qualify for the discounted membership of $5.99 per month. Prime members are eligible for a range of benefits including free shipping for online orders as well as video and music streaming, online photo storage and savings on select items and subscriptions. Prime’s typical monthly rate is $10.99, or $99 per year. The annual membership works out to about $8.25 per month, so the discounted rate represents a 27.4% lower price for those services, or a 46.3% discount on a month’s membership. The offer appears available only on a month-to-month basis. A spokeswoman for Amazon said there would be no associated discount for AmazonFresh, the Seattle e-tailer’s grocery ordering and delivery service. Prime shoppers pay an additional $14.99 monthly rate for unlimited fresh grocery ordering and delivery in areas where AmazonFresh is available. Amazon’s Prime membership is seen as an enviable demographic among retailers, but the move Tuesday could help extend Prime to additional shoppers, some of which may be participating in e-commerce with rivals like Wal-Mart Stores which offer some of the same shipping benefits at no additional cost. Walmart officials said last month that such offers were contributing to a sudden surge of sales through Walmart.com, which saw revenues rise by 63% in its fiscal first quarter. “We know when people try Prime they love it, because they save time and money with low prices on millions of items, unlimited access to premium videos and music, and fast, convenient delivery,” Greg Greeley, VP of Amazon Prime, said in a statement. “We designed this membership option for customers receiving government assistance to make our everyday selection and savings more accessible, including the many conveniences and entertainment benefits of Prime.” At launch, customers will need to qualify with a valid EBT card. An EBT card is commonly used to disburse funds for several government assistance programs including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program (WIC). EBT cannot be used to pay for membership. Customers can qualify every 12 months up to four times, Amazon said. Amazon will add other ways to qualify in the future for customers participating in government assistance programs that do not utilize EBT. There is no annual commitment and members can cancel anytime. Customers can learn more or sign up for a 30-day free trial at amazon.com/qualify.     0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Quotes in the article Walt Disney Co DIS ▼ 105.24 -0.64 -0.60% AdChoices Bond prices, meanwhile, caught a bid as the benchmark 10-year note yield hit its lowest level since the days following the U.S. presidential election. Gold prices also hit their highest level in seven weeks. "Those two markets are maybe signaling concern" among investors, said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank. "The [stock] market has been flatlining in the past few days as it waits for some clarity." Former FBI Director James Comey is slated to testify Thursday in front of the Senate intelligence committee, marking his first public comment since being fired by President Donald Trump. Comey will certainly be asked about his reported conversations with Trump and any efforts the president made to interfere with a probe on former national security advisor Michael Flynn. "The Comey testimony may give us something to talk about. I think it could be a he-said-he-said situation which could put off what can be done in Washington," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. Investors have remained vigilant about any new developments on the situation. Nevertheless, the major large-cap indexes have made on making new highs recently as pullbacks present new buying opportunities.

"It's as if the Energizer Bunny has taken over and we're just going higher and higher," he said. Investors also braced themselves for a general election in the United Kingdom set for Thursday. While a vast majority of observers still expect May to emerge victorious on Thursday, a Survation poll published last weekend placed the prime minister's ruling right-wing Conservative Party ahead by just a single percentage point. On Tuesday, the pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped 0.67 percent, while the British pound slipped 0.1 percent to $1.289.

Recent stats show District 7,  the southeast side of town has the highest crime rate in the city according to Councilor Sonya Mckinstry. That’s why Mckinstry said she's pushing for a police substation to be placed somewhere in her district listing, Skyland Boulevard near the Walmart there as an example. Mckinstry pointed out while crime has gone down significantly thanks to the crime suppression unit Tuscaloosa police launched, the amount of criminal activity still going on in her district have some worried. “Having those statistics as high as they are, that we should be able to warrant the need for a substation, it would be a tremendous asset for the community give residents a sense of ease,” said Mckinstry. Tuscaloosa police said staffing, crime rate, cost and location have to be considered before deciding to open a new substation. Copyright 2017 WBRC.

Jeannine Cherilynn Isom charged with one count of child abuse in connection to the incident. The Associated Press reported the 47-year-old woman “bought hand sanitizer and needle-nose pliers from the store on April 2, then took them into the restroom and pulled two of her 7-year-old son’s teeth.” Officers reportedly said the boy’s older brother heard him screaming and removed him from the bathroom. “It wasn’t just a parent trying to get rid of a kid’s lose tooth,” Deputy Utah County Attorney Christine Scott told PEOPLE. “This clearly rose above that and that is what made it criminal — and not something parents do when they are just trying to help their kid lose their baby teeth.” Charging documents show the boy told his brother one of his teeth was loose but the other was not. Isom told police the boy’s teeth were infected, Sgt. Josh Christensen with the American Fork police told PEOPLE. But “he was taken to the dentist a couple of days later and the dentist said there was no sign of an infection whatsoever,” Christensen said. NEVER MISS A STORY!

Apr 25, 2017 Asia-Pacific India Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Late last year, Morgan Stanley marked down the valuation of Indian internet “unicorn” Flipkart by 38%, taking it to a low of $5.54 billion compared to the peak $15.5 billion it stood at in 2015. This was the fourth consecutive markdown by the New York-based global financial services firm. Even as the media was full of reports of Sachin and Binny Bansal (the unrelated cofounders of Flipkart) attempting to secure funding from larger firms – Walmart was rumored to be interested – India’s leading e-commerce site sprang a surprise: In early April, it announced fresh funding at a post-transaction valuation of $11.6 billion. Executive chairman Sachin Bansal, who had described the valuation markdowns from Morgan Stanley and others including U.S.-based Vanguard, Fidelity and Valic as “a very uninformed opinion,” stood vindicated. “This deal helps Flipkart secure some strategic investors who can bring technology and operational expertise, something much needed to solidify its market leadership,” says Sandy Shen, research director at Gartner. “This is different from the previous rounds of mostly financial investors. So Flipkart is getting more than just the funding.” More than the valuation, it’s the credentials of the strategic investors who have come in that matter. The biggest slice of the $1.4 billion investment is $700 million from Chinese tech giant Tencent. EBay will invest $500 million. But it is also selling its local operations to Flipkart for $200 million. Microsoft brings up the rear with $200 million. “Today we entered into strategic agreements with three of the world’s biggest tech companies who join us as partners in our Indian e-commerce journey,” said group CEO Binny Bansal in an email to employees. Amazon vs. Flipkart The battle-lines are being drawn in India’s e-commerce arena. On one side is Amazon. During a visit to India, CEO Jeff Bezos said that the company plans to invest an additional $3 billion in its operations in the country to take its outlay in India to over $5 billion. On the other are Flipkart and its backers. Tencent is the largest company by market cap on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Last year, it overtook e-commerce rival Alibaba. The San Jose-based eBay may have given up its India dreams; it will be a part of Flipkart but operate as an independent company. It helps that eBay India will report to Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, who came to the firm from eBay Asia-Pacific. And Microsoft, which already has a deal with Flipkart for the latter to use its Azure cloud platform, is adding fertilizer for possible future growth in business. The deal comes at a time when the internet space in India — including e-commerce — is undergoing a major shakeout. EBay, which tried to add muscle after its acquisition of fellow e-tailer baazee.com in 2005, is seeing the flip side of takeovers today. Online marketplace ShopClues, which was planning a Nasdaq IPO later this year, has had to push back plans after a cofounder alleged fraud against the rest of the team. Image messaging firm Snapchat, fresh from a successful $3.4 billion IPO in the U.S., is being blackballed in India because of a reported statement by its CEO that he doesn’t “want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.” (The allegation was made in a lawsuit filed by a former employee in a U.S. court; the company has denied it.) The CEO of homestay platform Stayzilla is out on bail after nearly a month in jail on charges of fraud filed by its vendor Jigsaw Solutions. Jigsaw owner Radha Shekhar has written to New Delhi politicians – including the prime minister — saying that Stayzilla should be investigated “instead of letting them take cover behind the startup ecosystem.” “The real challenge for large Indian companies like Flipkart and Ola is that India’s capital markets aren’t as large and mature as those in the U.S.” –Kartik Hosanagar List of Casualties Then there is online marketplace Snapdeal, facing a financial crisis and being pushed by SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications and Internet company with major technology-related investments, into a merger with Flipkart. (SoftBank holds a 35% stake in Jasper Infotech, Snapdeal’s parent.) An email to employees by Snapdeal cofounders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal captures all that is wrong with e-commerce in India today: “Over the past two-three years, with all the capital coming into this market, our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes. We started growing our business much before the right economic model and market fit was figured out… [Today] we are combining teams, reducing layers, eliminating non-core projects and strengthening the focus on profitable growth. Let’s remember: GMV (gross merchandise volume) is vanity. Profit is sanity.” A third force seems to be emerging to challenge Amazon and Flipkart. The SoftBank Group is in talks to put in between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in electronics payments provider Paytm, making it one of the largest shareholders in the fintech startup. “The deal could increase Paytm’s valuation to $7 billion-$9 billion,” reports Mint business daily. “SoftBank’s potential investment in Paytm and another $1 billion bet on Flipkart is likely to make its chief Masayoshi Son the toughest competitor Bezos will ever have faced in India,” notes The Economic Times. “There are two parallel deals expected in 2017 that could define the way the Indian e-commerce sector moves for at least the next three years.” Alibaba of China is an investor in Paytm e-commerce. Sponsored Content: In this expansion and consolidation process, a lot of questions are being asked. Is it too early for e-commerce to take root in India? Is brick-and-mortar retail going to dominate for many more years to come? Does India need a different e-commerce model? Is “capital dumping” at the core of the problem? Capital Dumping Take capital dumping first. The three prominent voices against capital dumping are Flipkart’s Sachin Bansal, ride services firm Ola cofounder Bhavish Aggarwal, and Vani Kola, managing director of Kalaari Capital, a venture capital (VC) major. Their demand: the government should stop foreign funding of their rivals (like Amazon and Uber) and create a level playing field. “What we need to do is what China did [15 years ago] and tell the world we need your capital, but we don’t need your companies,” said Bansal at a meeting in Bangalore. Added Aggarwal: “The real fight is on capital, not innovation. The markets are being distorted by capital.” “We support free flow of capital that is not only good for customers, but also helps create jobs [and] develop infrastructure, aids the growth of small businesses, and facilitates India’s economic development,” says Amit Agarwal, senior vice president and country head, Amazon India. He has no comment on Flipkart’s capital harvesting. “As a company we are customer focused and not competition obsessed,” he adds. “All e-tailers are desperately trying to get out of this vicious cycle [of discounts]. This is not a sustainable business model.” –Ashis Mishra “Personally, I don’t buy the capital dumping arguments,” says Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions. “Small retailers who got crushed by venture-funded startups like Flipkart could have claimed capital dumping back then. Local companies have access to private equity markets and can technically raise lots of capital there if they can convince investors of their long-term potential. The real challenge for large Indian companies like Flipkart and Ola is that India’s capital markets aren’t as large and mature as those in the U.S. So Indian players will find it hard to raise the mammoth funds needed to compete with Western counterparts who commit billions of dollars to India. The solution isn’t to block investment by Western companies, but ask how we can address the capital market challenges faced by private companies.” Adds venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy in a post on LinkedIn: “Of course, the same level playing fields were not deemed necessary by the same VCs when Big Bazaar [a brick-and-mortar retailer] petitioned the government for them against Myntra [an online fashion store] and Flipkart, and when small shopkeepers asked for protection against Snapdeal.” Whether the dumping argument will itself be dumped, one thing is clear: The era of massive discounts in order to grow business has to come to an end. According to Mint, financial 2015-2016 (year ended March) saw Amazon record revenues of Rs2,275 crore (about $350 million) with a loss of Rs3,572 crore ($550 million). Flipkart wasn’t much better. It had revenues of Rs1,952 crore ($300 million) and a loss of Rs2,306 crore ($350 million). “As a company policy we do not comment on financials” says Agarwal. “That being said, we have seen a healthy growth in India. In 2016 we have grown over 100% year-on-year despite demonetization and other headwinds. For Amazon, India is one of the highest priority investments.” (Flipkart did not respond to Knowledge@Wharton’s queries.) “All e-tailers are desperately trying to get out of this vicious cycle,” says Ashis Mishra, professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore. “This is not a sustainable business model.” No Fundamental Problem “Does India need a different model: I don’t think so,” counters Hosanagar. “There is no fundamental problem with the e-commerce market in India. The case for e-commerce is strong. First, urban areas have traffic congestion issues and high real estate costs, making e-commerce attractive. Smaller towns don’t offer great product selection. The issue in India has been twofold. First, in their intense battle for marketshare, all companies have discounted too aggressively, and that isn’t sustainable in the long run. Second, investors like SoftBank and Tiger Global created a bit of a frenzy by over-investing at unreasonable valuations. These created the current issues and not any supply-demand fundamentals. I imagine all this will get sorted out in the next couple of years.” Others see problems that will take longer to resolve. “India’s online retail market is at an early stage and is lagging compared to many other markets in volume and maturity,” says Shen. “Given the not-so-well-established retail infrastructure, e-commerce is an efficiency channel for merchants to reach out to a wide audience and scale up quickly. As more businesses are moving to the digital channel in a way to follow their customers, e-commerce will see high growth down the road.” She lists some shortcomings of the market: “Some key challenges: User behavior takes time to establish for online shopping (currently more limited to the elite group); product/brand choice ranges are not great; logistics can be difficult in rural and remote areas; and digital payment is not widely established, though demonetization and Aadhaar (the universal biometric identity card) will move this forward quickly.” “India has a multiple economy — that of the metros and big cities, smaller towns and rural area,” says Mishra, who has worked on retail atmospherics and retail consumer behavior. “E-tail in metros and big cities may establish itself after reasonable consolidation in the next two-three years. Smaller towns are just having a taste of modern retailing. Online is catching up; still, it may take five-10 years to be a major force under favorable conditions. In the rural areas, no business model is available yet.” Is trust an issue? “The quality of brands has never been a problem with online retailing,” says Mishra. “Most customers are net savvy and they can search and figure out the quality. However, lack of trust is significant in terms of accuracy of the order, timely delivery, condition [of the goods delivered], ease of cancellation of order and ease of returns. The cash-on-delivery logistics for high-value items, even for lower-value items in smaller towns, is not developed adequately. The order cycle gets elongated unduly as a result. So, both the parties find it is difficult to trust each other.” In the U.S., Amazon was set up in 1994; it went online in 1995. It began by selling books. It took two decades to overtake Walmart in market capitalization – considered a measure of future earnings potential. But the difference between the U.S. and India is that brick-and-mortar retail has yet to come of age in India. In the U.S., stores are closing down (“Are Retailers Facing a Coming ‘Tsunami’?”). Now, in India, both those eras are overlapping. Avenue Supermarts – the owner of the D-Mart retail chain brand – had an IPO in India in March. The shares listed on March 21 at over 100% the IPO price, giving it a valuation higher than all the retail stocks in the country put together. The next player is the Future Group; the market cap of all its listed entities add up to Rs25,000 crore. D-Mart is more than double that. “This deal helps Flipkart secure some strategic investors who can bring technology and operational expertise.” –Sandy Shen D-Mart is among the most expensive global retail stocks (brick-and-mortar), with the price/earnings (P/E) ratio for fiscal 2018 and 2019 at around 56 times and 42 times respectively, according to brokerage firm JP Morgan. Walmart’s P/E ratio is about 17. “The world over, in developed markets including the U.S., physical retail commands over 93% share of modern retail,” says a Future Group spokesperson. “Even in the remaining 7%, more than half is captured through omnichannel operations of physical retailers. Physical retail continues to be the dominant and the most cost efficient channel in India by a huge margin.” Adds Binny Bansal: “E-commerce accounts for less than 2% of all retail in India, and the potential for online retail alone is about $100 billion.” That’s a $100 billion cake waiting to be cut. Small wonder that Flipkart’s Big Billion Day sale last year and Amazon’s Great Indian Festival earlier this year were so successful. “The question isn’t physical or virtual retail,” says a Future Group spokesperson. “Today, as consumers, we live a seamless life, and retailing, too, will be a seamless experience. Like major physical retailers, we have built significant digital interfaces. From conducting major sales events on Twitter, to a full-fledged digital wallet, Future Pay, from omni-channel portals to a large social media presence, we are transforming into a store-led digital organization.” Adds Amazon’s Agarwal: “We believe there is room for multiple formats, players and most importantly, for innovation.” Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "Funding Flipkart: Can India’s Internet ‘Unicorn’ Take on Amazon?."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 47.81 points, or 0.2%, to end at 21,136.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 20.63 points, or 0.3%, to close at 6,275.06. The S&P 500 dropped 6.77 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2,429.33, with consumer discretionary and industrials leading the losses. Wal-Mart and Boeing were the top Dow decliners. Investors were in a cautious mood as they wait for former FBI director Jim Comey's Senate appearance, the outcome of the U.K. general election, and a policy meeting of the European Central Bank, all on Thursday. The cautious stance in turn bolstered demand for assets perceived as havens such as U.S. Treasurys, gold and the Japanese yen. Haven appetite was also fueled in part on concerns about a diplomatic row between Qatar and other Middle Eastern nations. However, despite investors' caution, the equity market kept its loss to a minimum throughout most of Tuesday's session. The technology sector played a huge role in keeping the broader market afloat for most of the day. Weakness in the U.S. dollar, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index edging down by 0.3%, and some losses among U.S. equities, helped to lift investment demand for gold. But this week also has brought a rift between Qatar and other Mideast nations, helping to further boost gold's appeal as a hedge against uncertainty. Gold for August delivery rose $14.80, or 1.2%, to settle at $1,297.50 an ounce. Prices extended their streak of gains into a third-consecutive session and finished at the highest for a most-active contract since 4 Nov 2016. July silver rose 12.9 cents, or 0.7%, to $17.71 an ounce. Oil staged a rebound to settle higher on Tuesday, 06 June 2017 as traders bet that U.S. government data will show a ninth consecutive weekly decline in crude supplies, and concerns surrounding Qatar's diplomatic crisis eased. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July West Texas Intermediate crude added 79 cents, or 1.7%, to settle at $48.19 a barrel after tapping lows under $47. August Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange rose 65 cents, or 1.3%, to $50.12 a barrel. In a monthly report issued on Tuesday, the EIA raised its production outlook for this year and next. For 2018, it sees average output of 10.01 million barrels a day, up 0.4% from its previous forecast, and for 2017, it forecast 9.33 million barrels a day, up 0.3% from last month's forecast. The government agency also cut its WTI and Brent oil-price forecasts for next year. Among economic report expected for the day, the number of job openings in the U.S. rose in April to a record high, but the pace of hiring slipped to a one-year low in another sign the economy is running out of people with enough skills to fill empty positions. Shares in Apple rose 0.3% after dropping 1% on Monday. That fall came after Apple unveiled its HomePod smart speaker and other new offerings. Tomorrow, investors will receive the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index and April Consumer Credit (consensus $15.0 billion). The two reports will cross the wires at 7:00 ET and 15:00 ET, respectively.

Gold for August delivery rose $14.80, or 1.2%, to settle at $1,297.50 an ounce. Prices extended their streak of gains into a third-consecutive session and finished at the highest for a most-active contract since 4 Nov 2016. July silver rose 12.9 cents, or 0.7%, to $17.71 an ounce. Oil staged a rebound to settle higher on Tuesday, 06 June 2017 as traders bet that U.S. government data will show a ninth consecutive weekly decline in crude supplies, and concerns surrounding Qatar's diplomatic crisis eased. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July West Texas Intermediate crude added 79 cents, or 1.7%, to settle at $48.19 a barrel after tapping lows under $47. August Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange rose 65 cents, or 1.3%, to $50.12 a barrel. In a monthly report issued on Tuesday, the EIA raised its production outlook for this year and next. For 2018, it sees average output of 10.01 million barrels a day, up 0.4% from its previous forecast, and for 2017, it forecast 9.33 million barrels a day, up 0.3% from last month's forecast. The government agency also cut its WTI and Brent oil-price forecasts for next year. Among economic report expected for the day, the number of job openings in the U.S. rose in April to a record high, but the pace of hiring slipped to a one-year low in another sign the economy is running out of people with enough skills to fill empty positions. Shares in Apple rose 0.3% after dropping 1% on Monday. That fall came after Apple unveiled its HomePod smart speaker and other new offerings. Tomorrow, investors will receive the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index and April Consumer Credit (consensus $15.0 billion). The two reports will cross the wires at 7:00 ET and 15:00 ET, respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 47.81 points, or 0.2%, to end at 21,136.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 20.63 points, or 0.3%, to close at 6,275.06. The S&P 500 dropped 6.77 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2,429.33, with consumer discretionary and industrials leading the losses. Wal-Mart and Boeing were the top Dow decliners. Investors were in a cautious mood as they wait for former FBI director Jim Comey's Senate appearance, the outcome of the U.K. general election, and a policy meeting of the European Central Bank, all on Thursday. The cautious stance in turn bolstered demand for assets perceived as havens such as U.S. Treasurys, gold and the Japanese yen. Haven appetite was also fueled in part on concerns about a diplomatic row between Qatar and other Middle Eastern nations. However, despite investors' caution, the equity market kept its loss to a minimum throughout most of Tuesday's session. The technology sector played a huge role in keeping the broader market afloat for most of the day.

FORBES 10/21/10 Thursday, Wright, Wyoming Coal is loaded into a train at Peabody's North Antelope mine Thursday near Wright, Wyoming. On average, each 120 - 150 car train carries more than 14,000 tons of coal. J.B. Forbes jforbes@post-dispatch.com CORRECTED at 5:45 p.m. to include Olin. An earlier version of this post understated the number of St. Louis companies on the list. Peabody Energy fell off the Fortune 500 for 2017, but the list's St. Louis contingent remains at nine companies. Olin, which missed the cut in 2016, moved up to No. 467. Olin's revenue nearly doubled last year after it acquired Dow Chemical's chlorine business. The number of metro-area companies among the nation's largest businesses by revenue has been steady at nine since 2012. Peabody, which went through bankruptcy as a result of falling coal prices, fell to No. 533 when the new ranking was published Wednesday. Express Scripts Holding, at No. 22, remains the largest company in the St. Louis area. One of the nine area firms, Monsanto, is being acquired by Bayer of Germany, so it may not be around for next year's list. But Post Holdings, a food company that has grown through acquisitions, stands at No. 508 and might crack the top 500 by 2018.

(Trent Penny/The Anniston Star) ‘Your eyes open up’ Wellborn man aids veteran with cash, umbrella, hug By Eddie Burkhalter, Star Staff Writer, eburkhalter@annistonstar.com Eddie Burkhalter 15 hrs ago (…) Jeffrey Caldwell, who served two tours in Vietnam in the Army, stood in steady rain to solicit help from people when Wellborn resident Johnathan Wanamaker approached first with money and then with a brand new umbrella. (Trent Penny/The Anniston Star) Johnathan Wanamaker says he’s been through tough times, but that he recognizes how blessed he is. So when the Wellborn resident saw a man standing Tuesday in the rain outside the Lenlock Wal-Mart, clutching two canes and holding a sign that read “Army Veteran. Need Help. Thank you,” Wanamaker stopped and helped. “I asked him how he was doing and he said he was doing OK, and that he just needed some cash to go get a room for the night,” Wanamaker said. Wanamaker reached into his pocket and took out all the cash he had on hand —  $15 — and handed it to the man. Wanamaker’s mother was in the car with him, and had bought an umbrella a few days before. “It was raining a good bit and we gave it to him.” Wanamaker said. He also gave the man a hug. A Star photographer captured the moment on Tuesday. Attempts to locate the man holding the sign Wednesday were unsuccessful. Wanamaker works as a shift leader at a local restaurant and is studying information technology. He’s divorced and is raising his 6-year-old daughter, Claire. He works overnights a lot, and gets help from family with babysitting at times so he can study. “Being divorced, going through tough times, your eyes open up and you realize how blessed you really are,” he said. “I do believe right now I am in a good place.” It wouldn't have mattered to Wanamaker if the man was or wasn’t a veteran, he said. “I would have helped him regardless,” he said. Though homelessness among veterans declined by 46 percent between 2009 and 2016, an estimated 39,471 veterans were without a home in 2016, according to a report from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to the report, Alabama had an estimated 373 homeless veterans in 2016. That's compared to 9,612 for California and 87 for Wyoming. Veterans in need of help can contact their local VA medical center or call 1-877-4AID-VET. Staff writer Eddie Burkhalter: 256-235-3562. On Twitter @Burkhalter_Star.

Jun, 2017, 17:15 ET Share this article DUBLIN, June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2017-2018" report to their offering. Pet Market Outlook, Packaged Facts delivers all you need to know about the pet industry in one source. This year's edition includes the latest in market sizing and projections, hot new product trends, as well as data from the proprietary Pet Owners Survey. The report analyzes mergers and acquisitions, retail channel trends, and pet owner demographics and spending habits. Drastic channel shifts are at play in the pet industry. Following on the heels of private equity's big bets on brick and mortar, in the form of the industry's two pet super stores - PetSmart (2014) and Petco (2015) -- the e-commerce channel began to explode with pet product sales. Then, with brick-and-mortar sales showing weakness, PetSmart (and its private equity backers) adopted an "If you can't beat 'em, buy 'em" strategy, purchasing Chewy.com in April 2017 in what is considered the biggest e-commerce deal ever, surpassing Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com in 2016. And over on the veterinary side of things, Mars Inc. scooped up VCA Inc. in a $7.7 billion deal in January 2017, making its already sizable presence in veterinary care even more impressive. Going back to those first two deals, the PetSmart deal was one of the largest private equity deals of 2014 and the Petco deal was one of the largest leveraged buyouts of 2015.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Netflix's CEO Compares His Company to Starbucks What do video streaming and coffee have in common? Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Jun 7, 2017 at 4:23PM When someone talks about Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), you might hear it compared with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Hulu or cable. But it'd be a big surprise to hear Netflix and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the same sentence. (Unless the sentence is "I was watching Netflix in Starbucks.") The two businesses seemingly couldn't have less in common. One slings delicious coffee and whatever a Unicorn Frappucino is made of. The other serves up critically acclaimed originals and a film called Leo the Lion, which one Metafilter user described as "literally the worst thing created by humans as a species." Apparently that Metafilter user never had a Unicorn Frappucino. Seriously, Starbucks? Image source: Starbucks But both Netflix and Starbucks have a similar focus on their customers. While Amazon is trying to meet all needs with its Prime service, Netflix is looking only to provide a service its customers are extremely passionate about, in much the same way Starbucks customers are extremely passionate about their favorite Starbucks drink and locations. When asked at Re/Code's Code Conference if Netflix would ever get into streaming live sports, CEO Reed Hastings said: We're not trying to meet all needs. ... What we can be is the "emotional connection" brand, like HBO or Netflix. So think of it as [Amazon's] trying to be Wal-Mart; we're trying to be Starbucks. So, super-focused on one thing that people are very passionate about. A differentiation strategy Both Netflix and Starbucks work to differentiate their products. Starbucks is a leading innovator in the coffeehouse market with its espresso and frappe drinks. It also makes good use of technology to make ordering faster and easier for customers. It also distinguishes itself from large competitors by offering a pleasant environment to sit and drink -- a "third place," as founder Howard Schultz called it. Likewise, when Hastings was asked about sports, he noted that Netflix can't do anything to add value to what's already available through other channels. It adds value to the television- and film-watching experience by allowing subscribers to binge-watch from the beginning of a series. Subscribers don't have to worry about payments for on-demand video because everything is included in a single monthly subscription. Internet delivery doesn't add anything to the sports-viewing experience. Amazon, notably, just signed a deal to stream 10 Thursday-night football games this season. The streams will be available exclusively to Prime subscribers, but people in the U.S. can still watch the regular broadcasts on network television -- it's the same content, save a couple of commercials every hour. But Amazon isn't trying as much to differentiate its content and service from its competitors. It's trying to aggregate the best parts of everything into one service. Netflix can't hope to compete with that -- it doesn't have the money. It can, however, focus on making its on-demand experience better than Amazon's -- and everyone else's, for that matter -- just as Starbucks focuses on making its coffee-drinking experience better than its competition that's often focused on much more than just coffee and pastries. Netflix and Starbucks are niche products with mass appeal It's something of an oxymoron, but Netflix and Starbucks are niche products with mass appeal. They cater to consumers who want a premium service. They just happen to have the scale that they're able to charge a very affordable price for their premium products. Apple's iPhone would be another example of a niche product with mass appeal. It's a luxury item priced at a premium to the market, but it sells over 200 million units per year. By focusing on what it does best, and not going into things like sports or building movie theaters (the way Amazon's doing with bookstores), Netflix is able to stay ahead of the competition and keep growing subscribers. As soon as Netflix starts doing things outside of its core competencies, that's when investors should worry about the competition. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon and Apple.

Prosecutors said Monday that the 47-year-old woman bought hand sanitizer and needle-nose pliers from the store, then took them into the restroom and pulled two of her 7-year-old son's teeth. Police in American Fork, Utah, say the boy's older brother heard the child screaming and got him out of the restroom on April 2. Charging documents say the boy told his brother that one of the teeth was loose, but the other was only slightly loose. Prosecutors say the woman didn't use any kind of anesthetic. The woman was charged with felony child abuse. No attorney was immediately listed for her in court records. The Associated Press is not naming her to avoid identifying the child.

This is a budget which says that if you are the richest family in America, the Walton family of Wal-Mart, you can get a tax break of up to $52 billion through the repeal of the estate tax. But, at the same time, it says that if you are a lower income senior citizen in Vermont, you and 21,000 other Vermont families will not be able to keep your home warm in the winter because the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) would be abolished. This is a budget that says that if you are the second wealthiest family in America, the Koch brothers family, a family which has contributed many hundreds of millions into the Republican Party, you may get a tax break of up to $38 billion. But at the same time, if you are a working class student in Vermont trying to figure out how you could possibly afford college, your dream of a college education could disappear along with that of over 20,000 other Vermonters through the elimination of a number of student financial assistance programs. It is a budget which says that if you are a member of the Trump family you may receive a tax break of up to $4 billion, but if you are a child of a working class family in Vermont, you and 100,000 other Vermonters could lose the health insurance you currently have through massive cuts to the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicaid. At a time when over 40 million Americans are struggling with hunger, the Trump budget would eliminate nutrition assistance to 2,800 pregnant women, new moms, babies, and toddlers in Vermont through a 23 percent cut to the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program.  An additional 21,000 Vermonters would no longer receive the supplemental nutrition assistance they need to feed their families. The Trump budget would cut off affordable housing assistance to more than 700 Vermont families, putting them at risk of eviction and homelessness. It would cut Head Start in Vermont by $1.7 million, which could throw 140 low-income children off high-quality child care and early education.  It would kick 7,100 students in Vermont off  after-school programs. Meanwhile, at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, President Trump would provide a $3 trillion tax break to the top 1 percent over a 10-year period. This is the Robin Hood principle in reverse—taking from the poor and working people and giving to the very rich. When Donald Trump campaigned for president, he told the American people that he would be a different type of Republican. That he would take on the political and economic establishment.  That he would stand up for working people. That he understood the pain that families all over this country were feeling. Sadly, this budget exposes all of that verbiage for what it really was—just cheap campaign rhetoric that was meant to get votes—nothing more than that. The budget that President Trump has proposed would break virtually every promise he made to the working people of this country. During the campaign, candidate Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. But now that he is president, Trump has proposed a budget and health care bill that would slash Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, raid the Medicare fund by more than $125 billion, and make massive cuts to Social Security for people who have severe disabilities, children who have lost their parents, and the poor. The economic theory embraced by the Trump budget, “trickle-down economics”, is and it has always been an abysmal failure and a fraud. This is a budget written by the billionaire class and is designed to benefit the billionaire class. Nothing more. Nothing less. President Trump’s budget must be soundly defeated and replaced with a budget that meets the needs of working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor—not just the 1 percent.

Business 50 Illinois companies land on annual Fortune 500 list Fifty companies based in Illinois have landed on the 2017 Fortune 500 list. Corilyn ShropshireContact ReporterChicago Tribune Another year, another list of the country's largest and most successful companies. It's the annual Fortune 500 list, which tracks which ones are raking in increasing amounts of money and tagging those that are slipping in size, as measured by annual revenue. Overall, the roster provides a measure of how big business is doing. Nationally, Walmart again topped the list, as it has for the past five years. Also of note on this year's list is the number of women-led businesses, which at 32 female chiefs sets an all-time high. In Illinois, 50 companies made the list, and among them were some companies whose places changed dramatically. Sears, which was ranked at 127, compared with 111 last year, was also listed among the top 10 money losers. And one, Kraft Heinz, ranked 106, wasn't listed in Illinois even though it has headquarters in both Chicago and Pittsburgh. New to the list is TreeHouse Foods, based in Oak Brook. Take note: Last year's rankings are in parentheses. •17. (19) Walgreens Boots Alliance in Deerfield, moved up this year a couple of notches, thanks to an annual revenue increase of 13.4 percent despite profits declining by 1.1 percent to $4.17 billion. The company has faced speculation that its plan to acquire RiteAid could fall apart. •24. (24) Boeing, which Fortune bills as the "world's largest aerospace company," maintained its ranking. The company saw revenues and profits decline, to $94.5 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Fortune noted the Chicago-based company faced higher development costs and low oil prices, which decreases demand for new, full-efficient models. •33. (35) State Farm Insurance rose two spots this year, even as its profits sank more than 94 percent, to $350 million. Revenues inched up six-tenths of a percent to $76.1 million Last month, the Bloomington-based company said it would streamline its business, closing nearly a dozen facilities and laying off thousands of employees. •45. (41) ADM, or Archer Daniels Midland, slid a few notches this year. Revenues at the Chicago-based company dropped nearly 8 percent, to $63.2 million, and profits fell over 30 percent, to $1.2 billion. •74. (59) Caterpillar, the Peoria-based maker of construction and farming machinery, had a tough year. Profits fell over 103 percent — due in part to commodity prices — to a loss of $67 million. This year has been newsy, too. It announced its headquarters would move to Deerfield and closed a facility near Aurora, laying off 800 workers, and its downstate offices were raided by the feds. •83. (80) United Continental Holdings slid in the rankings despite the airline's stock climbing 10 percent last year. Profits fell 69 percent in 2016 to $2.2 billion due to competition and a strong U.S. dollar. •84. (81) Allstate's annual sales increased 2.5 percent to $36.5 billion in 2016, while profits dropped 14.3 percent to $1.77 billion. Blame the fall in profits and the lower ranking on a good economy and cheaper gas prices that boosted claims for the Northbrook-based insurer. •89. (95) Exelon moved up in the ranking despite a profit drop of 50 percent, to $1.1 billion, as wholesale power prices fell. Fortune noted the company is turning its focus to serving customers, which could, in the end, put a positive spin on its future. •107. (95) Deere's profits fell 21.4 percent to $1.5 billion as sales for the Moline-based company fell 7.7 percent to $26 billion, due mainly to an agricultural slowdown. •109. (94) Mondelez International's ranking plunged. It reported $25.9 billion in revenue last year, down from $29.6 billion the previous year. Profits fell 77 percent to $1.6 billion. Like other processed food companies such as Kraft Heinz and Conagra Brands, Mondelez has been challenged by growing consumer appetite for food considered natural and healthy. Other Illinois companies that made the list were AbbVie, 111; McDonald's, 112; US Foods, 124; Sears Holdings, 127; Abbott Laboratories, 135; Conagra Brands, 197; CDW, 199; Illinois Tool Works, 202; Discover Financial Services, 277; Baxter International, 281; W.W.

It's like feel like you said you'd like you wanna try out one week and it doesn't really work in in the next week you'd targeted at them make up for lost time so. Also this weekend the weather looks great so hopefully we can get very a couple of good back then and Ron Paul look the world are not hope we're also earth earlier on Nomura. Austin you mentioned the importance of running two nights in a row is it important to it's a notice how the chocolate change without any card onto nights Errol Morris is just the amount exact timing and again and again. This game at a track I'm really MET Knoxville attract proposed greater cultural rewire the land good top to bottom and if it's not answerable to protect the victim but just didn't laugh I mean. There so. I mean this is such an experience more or an iron you know in the district overlaps are still here and get our great America a year or the needle. All the luck in your thirties so. Sister comes down to experience in and activating in just knowing where we need to be and hopefully we cannot take advantage of the few days and and learn rocket that's that's the most important thing about all levels who got. Austin love talking racing review but wanna step we're from the track just a little better sound like go week or ten days ago you got an amazing experience you were over and Ames Iowa. Talk Casey's is doing a program with a Special Olympics. And are doing promotion all month of June long were your able to donate and all the Casey's stores. What's it like good to go on as an athlete to be able to go to a special Olympic event Brenda meet some of those so those athletes as well. It's an amazing experience the very humbling it's very Nixon really feel good about yourself and not. Are you said if you if you can also look for every click or anybody donate a dollar and that is Special Olympics and a it's great to go on defense were because you can really help people and and and I said it is particularly good he has its its not my experience and Romero Braden. It was it was a blast Troy and I and that it is Stanley we all went together in. It was a great power can our government here. Austin this past week you also had a chance to watch a gag inducted in the national spring car off saint. What does that mean dear family. Are used to. It was acute daughter from my fan not from only from a fan out to secure my dad that meant a lot and then. An interview at the induction this it's really cool to see his name out there are. And the people that you looked up to grown advocate and there's a different bank or on phenomenon but. I was accused argued accomplishment for my father unconfirmed mock family and something more that we aren't sure curt grow. So being watching your father get inducted into the hall of fame one Saturday to the next Saturday when your playing human foods ball how is that there. Did how are you're on team Knox told human foods ball. How does that work or don't you know yet. Tender hadn't told me the exact thing so hopefully I'm the priest and hopefully I liked each side can help out Kid Rock movement and up. I'd like to be a good time and also the and tomorrow night if we meet our most drivers and are completely good experience for everyone. Boston night the Bakken and when I go back a long way with gender I don't know followed the situation where she hasn't given you all the details I'm not sure I'm ever built a nervous and barrier hot young. And appeared Saturday nobody really wanted to units are likely ask who has. I love you so low post play good because I'm in between you can pick up where he not only if all of her hopefully not only for knocks the ball both currency knocks curled. Later on I my. Chaos single Mac today at the racetrack I saw a picture of a rock screen you had this past week and I was Benton hagel what happened with that compromise in a ditty get TUR that did Iraq's green do his job. Other countries it got to me brother eat their leaders comical Troy unmarked car or Iraq screen but I will now honest on the colored spectacles are. We're not rocks it hit me pretty hard that kind of don't deny acrid putrid but it kind of army per second I want and expect the net. Yeah I'd like you is very thankful that Barack umpire I don't know what outlawed a mud but he knocked on my career are you can usually. You know you don't think about stuff like that are happening in October prices of course I was kind of a weird fluke deal and I'm just thankful that I had Iraq and on. I guess my gosh that's for her. Courier wild stuff that's for sure what lost and I'm telling you we can't wait to watch what happens Alter the cushioned her vision going to have all the coverage those of us are not going to be able to make your from Knoxville. I know the first and more importantly your son qualifying run get a good lap and sue that takes a mug picture most unfortunate this weekend on an optional. Yes thank you very much so we can get the other Casey's General Store our front. Boy would not be big that's for sure that is Austin look Karl joining us here on the program and yes it appears the grown old big gun bash big guns mashed. Optional racially Friday and Saturday night the rivalry. And that so I I'm I'm all beat up already because it. Because what we saw Jackson in the mid west is loaded for bear and the world follows. Well indeed for. Whatever some applause from Carl can just jump up and grab the women he's running good enough yeah canceling he's it would it would be one of those didn't see that coming but if you're paying attention you could see that the gadget ads you know not enough flats and Oxley strongman Troy obviously has a lot of laughs at Knoxville I think we're gonna come on great team great combination in man that would just stuff. I just fire ever want up while there'll GMAC GMAC and have a good time without one as well so I'll break let's stop always fun talk and Austin Karl. We'll talk a lot about possible this weekend but Lucas Oil I guess just national tour. Oh boy here we go all hum. Our war we woe are we gonna have to be following races Wednesday Thursday Friday nights Tuesday nights for us sitting here following races. He but the reality loses its speed weeks he's been it's not for us it's teams but arrest now absolutely. You see as a driver and a team you look forward to this does this is what young lady do you race every night but like you said rest up. Especially if you're not run and while you're pretty way you're outlining. Our auto loan if you've posted the car and injured two along and I had Israel not to be a nightmare and it kicks off little Lucas Oil ALCS national tour seven races in nine nights the call of the civil and summer's big week. And yeah I get older doing theirs in Texas Oklahoma and Missouri. Probably gonna be a little sticky warm into the sizzling for sure just who will start off this Friday night at west Texas speedway in Lubbock Texas Saturday that route 66 motors read when Al Amarillo Texas. Our next week we'll talk about the next we do we go Tuesday double bowl wins bin Laden. Creek county speedway up in Oklahoma the amount of Missouri on Friday Randolph county next weekend. And Saturday low Lucas Oil to read when we've learned on Missouri last year's champion semi for two got two wins. During speed weeks and all of real Lucas Oil ALCS national tour action. Raison boys dot com they do a great job without the article at all stores looking to chip in the kitchen a breather well no their not catching a breather before their speed weeks. The run of three nights. In Lincoln Illinois on Friday night in now Macon Illinois Macon speedway on Saturday night. And 34 raceway in Burlington Iowa on Sunday so no rest for the stars and little mileage there are or they can say it adds up for the seller nor how they're there won't leave go there won't be a lot of models because of all contained an. But there there will be a lot of back and forth across a lot of hours out of power exactly so. Are going to be fun to watch that and racing action if you're listening to us on Thursday and we certainly hope you water it starts off tonight Yeltsin doesn't start off tonight Susquehanna street in Pennsylvania and I'll be our bumper to bumper sprint cars 30 Central Park tonight. So we've got some Thursday night racing action. Wanna mention also the king of the west series the racing on Saturday night up honorable Rex White and wants IRA Barbara Barbara Sprint's ability to park on Thursday. There at Oshkosh but gosh on Friday and Wilma I'm Saturday. And I hate the we're talking about does. Book there's speculation this might be the final sprint car race and Oshkosh. He got one of those rare Brown's community things were no one can get their heads straight and there's speculation that the yard. Track may no longer be your roamed so. There is one way to may be open gone nuts is patently small people a lot of mold that this is not a not a good idea. I saw tweet on this not gonna just read over the Joel's book urged thirst planning and zoning and boards and committees. And people and voting and they're so in that and usually this just gets three amassed and towns all love but but the good news is. Friday night and Oshkosh futures want to split hardware and maybe it's not blast on let's hope it's up last on the make sure you don't sport we are vulnerable for sprouts again tonight Sussman is really afford to run back kicks things off of Pennsylvania weekly for generation. Friday night at a club with the fast series Lerner bell river city speedway with the notion Sprint's silver dollar and Williams girl.

IKEA has only ever sold through its own websites and warehouse-showcase stores, and expanding access could poach consumers from competitive brands. This isn’t the first time Wayfair investors sold off on industry news. In April, the stock fell on reports that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was in talks to distribute for scores of furniture retailers. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has long professed its sensitivity to disruptions in the home goods space, considering moves by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Amazon to expand their product offerings. "I have [Amazon' CEO] Jeff Bezos and I have Marc Lore from Wal-Mart who have not yet competed in this space but have said, 'We are going to start getting more aggressive on furniture,’" Left told Benzinga in May. The short-seller maintains negative outlook on Wayfair. While IKEA management declined to identify retail platforms targeted for distribution and poised to heighten competition for Wayfair, a Reuters report posited Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) as potential partners.

Hannah LevintovaJun. 7, 2017 1:16 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Print selimaksan/Getty From the earliest days of his campaign, Donald Trump has opposed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Obama-era financial reform law passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.  Trump has characterized it as a “disaster” that has created obstacles for the financial sector and hurt growth. In April, he repeated his promise to gut the existing law. “We’re doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some, obviously, but getting rid of many,” Trump said in a meeting with top executives during a “Strategic and Policy CEO Discussion,” which included the leaders of major companies like Walmart and Pepsi. He added, “For the the bankers in the room, they’ll be very happy.” The Republican Congress shares Trump’s dislike of Dodd-Frank and this week, the House plans to vote on the Financial CHOICE Act, a Dodd-Frank overhaul bill that will, as promised, make banks and Wall Street “very happy” if it becomes law, while undoing numerous financial safeguards for regular Americans. (CHOICE is an acronym for “Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers and Entrepreneurs.”) The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), takes aim at some of Dodd-Frank’s main achievements: It guts rules intended to protect mortgage borrowers and military veterans, and restrict predatory lenders. It also weakens the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s ability to oversee and enforce consumer protection laws against banks around the country—upending a mix of powers that have helped the CFPB recover nearly $12 billion for 29 million individuals since opening its doors in July 2011. The bill also weakens or outright cuts a number of bank regulations enacted through Dodd-Frank to keep risky investing behavior in check in order to avoid the economic devastation of another financial crisis or taxpayer-funded bailout. “With this bill, fraud becomes easier, consumer abuse becomes easier, reckless lending becomes easier, speculation becomes easier.”  During an April hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren gave a fiery speech criticizing the measure. “This is a 589-page insult to working families,” she said. “It would unleash the same behavior on Wall Street that led to the 2008 financial crisis.” Other Democrats have joined Warren in opposing the bill, as have some institutional investors and financial experts.  “With this bill, fraud becomes easier, consumer abuse becomes easier, reckless lending becomes easier, speculation becomes easier,” says Carter Dougherty, communications director of the left-leaning Americans for Financial Reform. “The chances of another financial crisis rise immeasurably with the passage of this legislation.”  Concerns that overhauling the financial reform bill could trigger another financial crisis have also been raised by former Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank, one of the chief architects of the original Dodd-Frank act. “Consumers who have dealings with banks and other financial institutions should be very worried about [Dodd-Frank] being abolished,” he said in a February interview. “If you don’t keep the rules we have in place to restrain irresponsible risk-taking, you’ll have, at some point, another crash.” Rep. Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, has argued that the CHOICE act will protect consumers and particularly smaller financial institutions—like community banks or credit unions—that are weighed down by the costs of complying with Dodd-Frank’s regulatory structure. (FDIC data on community banks contradicts Hensarling’s point: In 2016, community bank earnings grew by $507.9 million from the previous year, and they gave out small business loans at more than twice the rate of noncommunity banks.) Here’s a glimpse of some of the main ways the Financial CHOICE Act could ease regulation of Wall Street and hurt consumers: The bill guts the CFPB’s power to crack down on banks: The CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis by the Dodd-Frank act, which gave the agency authority to enforce consumer-protection regulations on banks and Wall Street. The current CHOICE act proposes a reduction in the agency’s authority to enforce these regulations on banks, instead dispersing that power among a mix of federal agencies. This splintered model for consumer protection is similar to what existed before the financial crisis, and proponents of the CFPB have argued that this decentralized approach helped contribute to the crisis. Gives the White House control over consumer protection: The CHOICE act proposes ending the CFPB’s status as an independent agency whose director is appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. If the measure becomes law, the White House would have the power to fire the agency’s director without cause; today, the CFPB director can only be removed by the president over a small list of work-related offenses. Additionally, rules made by the agency would require White House review—a constraint that is not imposed on other banking agencies. Decimates regulation of predatory lenders: The CHOICE Act would eliminate the CFPB’s power to regulate “small-dollar credit,” including “payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans” with extremely high interest rates that are used by more than 19 million mostly lower income US households to make ends meet when they’re lacking other options. Given the interest, these loans can lead to a cycle of ever-growing debt—the majority of borrowers end up having to take out a second loan to cover the first. The CFPB proposed rules in 2016 that would have curbed abuses by predatory lenders by requiring them to ensure a borrower will be able to make payments on time, and also make repeat lending to the same people more difficult.  The CHOICE Act’s proposal to strip the CFPB of its power to regulate small-dollar credit is “a free pass for payday and title lenders to not be subject to efforts to rein in their abusive practices,” Diane Standaert, executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending, told the Los Angeles Times. Reverses efforts to curb the practice of forced arbitration: Forced arbitration clauses have proliferated in recent years, appearing in consumer contracts for virtually every financial product—bank accounts, credit cards, and more. These clauses prohibit consumers from bringing traditional lawsuits against financial institutions, requiring them to participate in private, often expensive, proceedings outside of the regular court system. The CHOICE Act would remove the CFPB’s authority to restrict forced arbitration, subsequently preventing the agency from finalizing a rule limiting forced arbitration clauses that was expected to go into effect in mid-2017. Repeals the Volcker Rule: A key component of Dodd-Frank, the Volcker Rule prohibits big banks from participating in certain risky investment activities, in order to prevent them from jeopardizing their solvency by gambling with depositor funds. The bill would repeal that rule, which Wall Street has long complained reduces revenues. In a closed-door meeting last month, Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin—an alum of Goldman Sachs, one of the banks subject to the Volcker rule—directed five federal agencies to review the Volcker rule with an eye towards easing some of its requirements.  Repeals the fiduciary rule requiring retirement fund managers to work in their client’s best interests: The fiduciary rule enacted by Obama-era Department of Labor elevates asset managers handling retirement savings to “fiduciary” status. This means they are required to place their client’s interests above their own, disclose any potential conflicts of interests, and be transparent about all fees. After attempts to delay its implementation by the Trump administration, the fiduciary rule is set to go into effect on Friday. If it becomes law, this bill would repeal the rule, halting its implementation.  Eases stress tests on big banks: The Federal Reserve requires the largest US banks that are “Too Big to Fail”—meaning their solvency is critical to the broader economy’s health—to undergo an annual stress test measuring the bank’s ability to withstand financial shock. “It’s been a cornerstone of our effort to improve supervision,” Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers in February. “It’s a key part of our regulatory process.” The Financial CHOICE Act proposes requiring banks to undergo these tests only every two years, and exempts them from the qualitative aspects of the tests, which check on internal bank processes—such as risk-monitoring, loss-modeling, and more—that help protect the bank in the case of an economic shock. Repealing the government’s ability to restructure a failing financial institution: After the 2008 financial crisis, regulators explained they were unable to liquidate failing banks without throwing the economy into turmoil—hence the need for a taxpayer-funded bailout instead. In response to this, Dodd-Frank created the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which allows the FDIC to take over a failing financial institution and liquidate it using a mix of fees collected in advance from banks as a preemptive credit line for this sort of crisis. The CHOICE Act would repeal the OLA and replace it with a bankruptcy process that is “a reckless gamble with the stability of the US financial system,” according to a letter sent last month to Congress by more than 100 bankruptcy scholars and professors from law schools around the country.   Raising debit and credit card fees: The Durbin Amendment enacted through Dodd-Frank allowed the Fed to set a limit on how much banks can charge consumers and retailers for using debit and credit cards. The amount ended up being about 12 cents per swipe. The Financial CHOICE Act proposes repealing the amendment and raising the cap on what banks can charge. Faced with pushback over this change from many retailers and some of his fellow Republicans, Rep. Hensarling said late last month that he will likely drop this portion of the bill in order to help ensure its passage Get the scoop,  straight from Mother Jones.

The clothing was offered for sale by another company, Spreadshirt Collection, and included tank tops, T-shirts and hoodies featuring a variety of pro-Palestinian messages. The clothing was offered for sale through Sears Marketplace, which offers a platform for third-party sellers to offer their wares through websites managed by Sears. The designs included a clenched fist in the colors of the Palestinian flag and statements opposing the Israeli occupation. Ynet news reported that Walmart was also selling the shirts and featured a screen capture of them for sale, but by later Wednesday they were no longer available. According to a statement from a Sears spokesman, the apparel was pulled from the site based on feedback the company received. “These items were being sold by a third-party seller via the Sears Marketplace,” said the statement, which was sent to JTA Tuesday afternoon. “Given the feedback we’ve received, they are being removed.” The statement added that Sears felt it had been “unfairly singled out on this issue,” as similar items are available for purchase from other companies, such as Amazon and Walmart. Amazon website sells many items with “Free Palestine” logo, June 7, 2017. (Screen capture: Amazon.com) Amazon sells some of the same items from Spreadshirt, as well as a wide range of other pro-Palestinian merchandise. The Sears statement notes that the company serves “a broad base of customers around the country and around the world,” and that it has 200 employees in Israel.

Today’s answer to the question, “What should budding entrepreneurs know about building a business?” is written by Dheeraj Pandey, founder, CEO, and chairman of Nutanix. Two of the most important pieces of advice I can provide to entrepreneurs are to not be afraid to be irrational when you set your goals, and that if you hope to realize these goals you need to focus on, you need to listen to and respect your team. Regarding the first piece of advice, history shows that the entrepreneurs who fundamentally changed how people work, play, and live were the ones who acted irrationally. It was irrational for Steve Jobs to introduce a new Apple (aapl) phone to compete with the powerful, established players in the mobile phone market. It was irrational for Jeff Bezos to move Amazon (amzn) beyond online book sales and build a complete e-commerce platform designed to take on Walmart (wmt) and transform the world of retail. It was irrational for Reed Hastings to move Netflix (nflx) beyond renting DVDs and challenge the established cable and satellite TV companies with streaming movies and TV shows. All of these decisions involved uncertainty, where the worst-case scenario—the possible destruction of their existing businesses—was more likely than success. You must have the courage to be irrational if you want to change the world. See also: Passion Won’t Make You Successful Unless You Have This Of course, it is one thing to be willing to set out to achieve a seemingly irrational, impossible goal. It is another thing to actually achieve this goal. On a tactical level, the saying I have found to be the most helpful is one I have used for a long time: Focus. Listen. Respect. Just as a child needs to focus on, listen to, and respect others if he or she is going to learn in school, build friendships, and achieve other childhood goals—be they earning more screen time or building a tree house—so does an entrepreneur. In particular, you need to focus on, listen to, and respect your employees, customers, and partners—in that order—if you hope to translate your seemingly “crazy” dreams into reality. No entrepreneur can change the world, or realize irrational goals, by themselves. And you will not be able to convince others to help you accomplish your crazy vision if you neglect them, ignore them, or disrespect them. In the end, your success depends on these other people—not just you.

The complexity and difficulty that comes with running a business increases as you hire more employees, gain more customers, and expand your partner network. When you get big and are growing rapidly, it’s easy to begin treating each employee, customer, and partner as another number or name in a database, rather than a crucial team member helping you realize your goal. Entrepreneurs need to be willing—eager, even—to be irrational, to court uncertainty, and to embrace seemingly impossible goals. And for them to achieve those goals, they need to focus on, listen to, and respect their employees, customers, and partners, because in the world of business, at least, no entrepreneur has realized their crazy goal without a team that was willing to work and sacrifice to realize that goal with them.

Arlene Karidis | Jun 07, 2017 New Jersey’s Sussex County has processed more than 4,000 pounds of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam since October 2016, saving landfill space and securing a local buyer for the processed material. The Sussex County Municipal Utilities Authority (SCMUA) launched this EPS recovery initiative with assistance from Augusta, N.J.-based Foam Cycle. The company produces the densifier that processes the bulky material, trained authority staff on its use and linked the organization to the end user, a picture frame manufacturer. Currently there are only 30 EPS curbside collection programs in the U.S., according to the EPS Industry Alliance. But setups like the one at Sussex County’s recycling drop off center at its landfill could be a way to collect and process more material. And this focus makes sense, believe industry stakeholders. Some states and municipalities are banning EPS either from landfill or from being used at all, while businesses are finding uses for the recycled material, if they can get ahold of it. “Our goal is to get municipalities, schools, and hospitals to purchase our system to densify foam while reducing carbon footprint and finding another way to get value from their solid waste,” says Beth Coleman, sales coordinator for Foam Cycle. The key is achieving economy of scale, which the EPS Industry Alliance believes can be facilitated through commercial recycling, now done only by a few businesses, such as Walmart and pharmaceutical companies.  Subaru has an internal reuse program, as EPS can be used over 10 times to ship motor parts. But there are challenges to building infrastructure. For one, says Betsy Bowers, EPS Industry Alliance executive director, “There is no magic formula for EPS recycling as there are widespread market applications [building, construction and packaging],” Bowers says. “Big-box retailers also have their own varied distribution and collection systems. So you have to look at how each is set up and come up with a solution.” Foam Cycle’s self-contained densifier stores and processes the material, reducing its volume by 95 percent. The company provides bins, signage and reusable polybags that go into the collection bin. Recyclers pull the polybags from the unit and foam is fed into the densifier, which grinds and melts it. It’s then molded into cubes, palletized and delivered to or picked up by processors. “We would like to be part of the initiative to use green innovation to reduce polystyrene from landfills, so we are involved all the way up to the repurposing by connecting recyclers with end use markets,” says Coleman. What attracted SCMUA was that this was a way to save landfill space and there’s an added bonus that it can sell what has historically been a burden. “From our view the recycling of EPS material was always hard. There was no market for end products, but with this equipment there is. And we have been able to work within our existing facility using our existing personnel to divert another material,” says James Sparnon SCMUA superintendent of solid waste facilities. Its job is to collect and process the foam, and soon it will add shipping to its role. From an economic perspective Sparnon estimates the authority is breaking even while also addressing a mounting environmental problem. Seattle has prohibited the sale of meat and fish in foam containers. San Francisco’s proposed legislation goes further, calling for bans on polystyrene beach toys, dock floats, mooring buoys, and packaging products. Meanwhile New York banned foam, only to have that ban overturned by courts. SCMUA is continuing to assess the Foam Cycle system, assuming it will learn more as it gets through a full weather cycle since the weather can affect participation. Plus it wants to ensure material stays dry through rainy and snowy seasons, and has worked to address this issue with protective drop off containers and canvas bags. Meanwhile, EPS Alliance, which recognized Foam Cycle with an Excellence in Recycling award, is looking at grant opportunities to jump start recovery, hoping for industry support with in-kind contributions. “We are looking at Foam Cycle’s model and trying to duplicate it in other areas,” says Bowers.

Drew Springer is taking on some of the country’s biggest retailers, pushing for legislation in the special session next month that would close a loophole in tax code that has allowed Lowe’s Home Centers and other retail chains to cut local property taxes by millions of dollars in other states. Lowe’s, Home Depot Inc., Kohl’s Department Stores, Target and Walmart have sued appraisal districts across the U.S. to have their big-box stores valued as empty buildings, not functioning businesses — labeled the “dark store” appraisal theory by county property appraisers. North Carolina-based Lowe’s has successfully used the argument in Michigan and Indiana where major retailers have driven down property values and tax revenue. County property appraisers in Texas fear commercial properties across the state will shed billions of dollars in value if Lowe’s prevails in a lawsuit against the Bexar County Appraisal District. RELATED: Payless could be closing more stores in San Antonio The Harris County Appraisal District settled a similar lawsuit with Lowe’s in November for 18 company stores in the Houston area, said Appraisal District spokesman Jack Barnett. Business Channel The legal challenges have the potential to “derail the property tax system,” said Michael Amezquita, chief appraiser for the Bexar County Appraisal District that serves San Antonio. RELATED: RadioShack closing 1,000 stores during Memorial Day weekend A steep drop in commercial property value would have costly implications for tax revenue. The state comptroller’s office estimates Texas cities, counties and school districts will lose $2.9 billion if Lowe’s wins its Bexar County lawsuit and other commercial properties take up the “dark store” legal argument, potentially leaving homeowners to pick up the property tax burden. “If all the commercial value in Bexar County dropped 50 percent, that means the homeowner’s going to have to pick up that piece of the pie,” said Springer, R-Muenster.

In a plea bargain, Steven E. Bailey of Rhinelander was convicted of second-degree sexual assault of a child and two other counts were dismissed for the July 30, 2015, incident at his former home in Tomahawk, court records said. He is to be sentenced July 25. The girl told investigators she had babysat for Bailey and his wife for about a week before the father helped her take off her clothes in a basement bedroom and had sex with her, according to the criminal complaint. The girl said the family's two sons were upstairs at the time while two daughters were with their mother at Wal-Mart, the complaint said. "Steven told her she could take a shower. She took a shower at Steven's residence and then left a short time later," the complaint said. The next day, while the distraught girl was with police detailing her allegations, she received two text messages from Bailey, asking why she didn't come to the home to babysit at 2 p.m. and if she could babysit that night "while he and his wife went out to dinner and movie," the complaint said. Shortly after the last message, police arrived at Bailey's home with a search warrant and he was arrested, investigators said. The girl told investigators that she had shared "some things had had happened in her past" with Bailey and when she went to his home July 30 she thought it was to watch his children "and it ended up being something different," the complaint said. The girl said that in the basement bedroom "she did not know what was going on at the time and she was not thinking straight," the complaint said. "She said she did not really want to do what she did."

Robert Hardister is known all too well by police in the US state of Florida, having arrested him plenty of times. But it's his ever-changing face tattoos they are having trouble keeping up with. One of the first mugshots, from 2012, shows him with barely any ink on his face but the latest snap reveals it is almost entirely tatted up. The 25-year-old from the town of Stuart is behind bars yet again after police in the town of Jupiter found him asleep behind the wheel of a stolen truck in a Walmart car park . Robert Hardister in a mugshot from 2012 (Photo: Chris Murphy) In December 2012 Hardister was arrested on fraud charges (Photo: Chris Murphy) If photos from previous bookings in Palm Beach County Jail are an indication, Hardister appears to have got most of the facial ink since late 2012. When he was arrested on an out-of-town warrant in January 2012 he sported only a tear drop under his right eye and a tattoo on the right side of his neck. Almost a year later when arrested by Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputies on a fraud charge, Hardister had added a tattoo to the left side of his neck. This mugshot was taken in February 2013, showing more tattoos Hardister’s mugshot on February 17, 2013, after an arrest on several charges including burglary shows added artwork including a star under his right eye and lettering on his neck, left cheek and chin. By the time Hardister was arrested for a probation violation, his face was almost entirely tatted up, leaving only a small area on the right side of his face without ink. Hardister after his arrest in July 2016 (Photo: Chris Murphy) After his arrest in July 2016, Hardister told police he'd borrowed the 1998 black Ford F-150 from a friend to move furniture to his new apartment and had even paid him $20, the Palm Beach Post reported.

Hardister's mug shot in September 2016 (Photo: Chris Murphy) And over the weekend, on Sunday June 4, Hardister was arrested again, while he was sitting in a stolen car. Now 25, he was arrested by an officer who was conducting routine traffic stops in St Augustine, Florida. Police had been watching a 2007 Chrysler Sebring which they knew to be stolen. Hardister has been arrested again, in June 2017 Read More Video of tattoo artist 'inking' his toddler's wrist sparks outrage - but all is not as it seems Shortly after setting up a watch on the car, Hardister approached and sat in the vehicle. Officers then apprehended him, and the suspect later admitted that he knew the car had been stolen. He also told police that he was a drug dealer and had exchanged a quantity of methamphetamine for the car. In his latest mugshot, he has a newly pierced eyebrow and tattoos that cover his entire neck. Police also discovered that Hardister was wanted in North Carolina for violating parole.

capture up to 25 questions in under 60 seconds News provided by Wyzerr, Inc. 07 Jun, 2017, 13:15 ET Share this article COVINGTON, Ky., June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Artificial intelligence start-up Wyzerr announced today the launch of an online platform to create feedback surveys that feel like games. The surveys, which the company calls "Smart Forms," can capture up to 25 questions in under 60 seconds. Wyzerr's Smart Forms were developed based on playful design principals and rules of engagement. Wyzerr spent the past 2 years piloting their gammified surveys with large enterprises like Walmart, Unilever, and Volkswagen. The key learnings from those pilots served as the inspiration for the company's new online Smart Form builder, which guides customers in creating effective feedback campaigns. The builder includes features to help direct good survey design habits, such as a health meter that turns into an angry emoticon when the platform identifies characteristics of a "bad survey." Wyzerr plans on introducing more features in the future to drive better feedback collection. "We're not just changing the user experience of a survey. We're challenging the notion that surveys must contain long-worded questions, 10-point scales, excessive explanations, and be devoid of fun in order to collect valuable data and insights," explained Natasia Malaihollo, co-founder and CEO of Wyzerr. "We're setting a new standard for data collection." According to a study conducted by a leading survey company, the average time it takes to complete a typical survey (16-25 questions) is 7-9 minutes. Yet research from OpinionLab shows that the majority of customers will not spend more than 3 minutes filling out a feedback form. Bridging the need to ask a lot of questions with an increasingly short attention span is what Wyzerr solves with its gammified surveys. Their surveys are proving effective as the company boasts an average completion rate of 70%, and currently has over 320 customers in 42 countries, many of whom are Fortune 500 companies that began using the platform in private beta last year. While the company says it will continue to develop Smart Forms, its goal isn't only to win at survey UI and UX. Wyzerr's future plans include transforming data into valuable insights through the use of artificial intelligence. "By building gammified surveys, you capture large volumes of structured and unstructured first-party feedback data quite rapidly. That becomes really valuable as training data for artificial intelligence. We can do some amazing things in real-time for businesses that have large volumes of feedback data," says Malaihollo. ABOUT WYZERR Wyzerr is an artificial intelligence company that focuses on turning consumer, employee, and customer feedback data into tasks for the business. Wyzerr's proprietary technology can adapt questions to each individuals' responses, empowering brands with richer feedback that can be acquired in less than 60 seconds per survey at the point of sale and on the go. Wyzerr is committed to ushering in a world where providing feedback is fun, fast and easy — and the resulting data is actionable and intuitive. Wyzerr, headquartered in Covington, Kentucky, and founded in June 2014, includes three minority co-founders: Natasia Malaihollo, CEO; Bjorn K. Simmons, chief strategy officer; and Stedmon Harper, creative director. The company is funded by Rough Draft Ventures, Connetic Ventures, KTech Capital, Marshall Ventures, and NKY Growth Fund.

View Profile Image: Miller/Coors Print Zima is back, & so is your nostalgia for drinking in high school Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media If you were in high school or college in the '90s (or had older siblings who were), you're about to have a major nostalgic flashback. That's because Zima, everyone's favorite lemon-lime alcoholic beverage, is back on store shelves. The clear, sparkling drink, which boasts a 5 percent ABV (alcohol by volume) ratio, will be returning to Walmart shelves on or before July 4 thanks to a partnership with Zima's distributor, Molson Coors. Image: Giphy More: 11 nostalgic goodies every respectable '90s kid took to school For those who don't remember, Zima was basically the Smirnoff Ice or Mike's Hard Lemonade of its day. It was the booze of choice for those who were just getting into drinking and hated the taste of beer — there was even a DIY hack to change the flavor that people pulled off by dropping in a Jolly Rancher, which sounds a little janky but mostly awesome, TBH. Image: Giphy But before die-hard Zima fans go getting too excited, beware: Once this new batch of Zima sells out in the U.S., it will be gone for good unless you want to try ordering it from a distributor in another country — but you should probably think twice before buying a six-pack from a random company halfway around the world (says the girl who once ordered a bottle of limited-edition seltzer on eBay). More: '90s toys & memorabilia you should gift your friends for nostalgia's sake Zima will be available through Labor Day or until Walmart sells out of its stock, so if you're craving an old favorite or just want to try something new, make sure you grab some before it disappears from shelves.

Robert Hardister, from Stuart, Fla., has been arrested plenty of times — but police still have trouble keeping up with his ever-changing appearance. The 25-year-old is behind bars yet again — this time for allegedly dealing drugs out of a stolen car in Florida. He was handcuffed on Sunday by an officer conducting a routine patrol in the St. Augustine neighborhood. His latest mugshot shows the tattooed criminal with a newly pierced eyebrow and darker hair. Last year, he was caught sleeping in a stolen truck in a Walmart parking lot. Hardister told cops he didn’t know the truck was stolen, but he was still charged with vehicle theft. He told police he’d actually borrowed the 1998 black Ford F-150 from a friend to move furniture to his new apartment and had even paid him $20, the Palm Beach Post reported. Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office; Splash News One of his earliest mugshots in 2009, when he was just 18, shows a fresh-faced Hardister with floppy hair and no ink in sight. After being arrested multiple times over the years, each snap would boast a brand new tattoo — but his latest one shows there is little room for any more work. In the past, he has pleaded guilty to a few theft charges and spent time in jail, court records show. If photos from previous bookings in the Palm Beach County Jail are an indication, Hardister appears to have gotten most of the facial ink since February two years ago, when he was arrested by Tequesta police for an out-of-town warrant. In that mugshot, Hardister sports only a teardrop under his right eye and a tattoo on the right side of his neck. Then, a year later, when arrested on a fraud charge, Hardister had added a tattoo to the left side of his neck. Hardister’s mugshot on Feb. 17, 2013, after an arrest on several charges including burglary, shows added artwork including a star under his right eye and lettering on his neck, left cheek and chin. By the time Hardister was arrested in July for a probation violation, his face was almost entirely tatted up, leaving only a small area on the right side of his face without ink. Hardister was booked into the St. John’s County Sheriff’s Office Inmate Facility on no bond.

In fact, he has mentioned this single trait more than 20 times in his annual shareholder letters since 1986. He calls it “essential for sustained success.” And for good reason. Take the nasty financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, when the S&P 500 plunged more than 55%. Only nine stocks in the index made money during that period according to our Bloomberg screen. Six of them had this advantage. What is this wealth-building stock trait? It’s a concept originally popularized by Buffett himself — an economic moat. As Buffett once put it: “A truly great business must have an enduring “moat” that protects excellent returns on invested capital. The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business “castle” that is earning high returns.  “Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company’s being the low-cost producer or possessing a powerful world-wide brand is essential for sustained success. Business history is filled with “Roman Candles,” companies whose moats proved illusory and were soon crossed.” – Warren Buffett, 2007 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter In other words, a business’ economic moat protects it from competition and often helps it earn unusually healthy profits (and potentially market-beating stock returns). While there isn’t an exact list of moats, the most common ones are easy to spot: Low-Cost Provider — A company that can provide the lowest price for the same product can essentially shut its competitors out of a market. This is the reason behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (NYSE:WMT) growth over the past several decades. High Switching Costs — These costs keep customers loyal to a product, even if better alternatives exist. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating systems, for example, are still running on more than 80% of desktops, making it a hassle for consumers to “switch” in buying and learning a new operating system. And that’s not to mention that many software programs are built to run only on Windows, creating another hurdle to switching. 5 Top Stocks to Buy in June The Network Effect — How has Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) come to dominate the market in online retail? Sellers want to list their products thanks to the huge number of buyers that shop there. And buyers visit the site to find the most options from sellers. Because of their vast network of users, no other sites rival its popularity. Strong Brand Name — The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) is one of the most dominant companies on the planet. Much of its advantage comes from its powerful brand name. That’s why even though there are literally hundreds of soda substitutes, Coke is able to dominate its competition. Intangible Assets — Patents and other intangible assets (like trademarks) can protect a company from direct competition. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, have been able to pay their investors billions of dollars in dividends thanks to their patents on drugs, which shut out competition. The Takeaway: Wealth-Building “Moats” Are a Key to Investment Success  Investing in companies with moats is no guarantee that its stock will beat the market, as plenty of other factors come into play. But considering how frequently the world’s greatest investor has touted the benefits of investing in “wide-moat” companies, and considering how well they held up during the 2008-2009 bear market, stocks carrying this wealth-building trait are worth a serious look.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Northwest Ohio retained four Fortune 500 companies for 2017, with Findlay’s Marathon Petroleum Corp. again coming in as the region’s highest ranked firm at No. 51. Marathon, with revenues of $55.9 billion, was followed by Owens-Illinois Inc. at No. 401, with revenues of $6.7 billion, Dana Inc. at No. 447, with revenues of $5.8 billion, and Owens Corning at No. 458, with revenues of $5.7 billion. Fortune announced the rankings today. The order for the region’s companies was unchanged, though Marathon fell nine spots from its 2016 Fortune 500 ranking. Dana slipped 19 spots. O-I, meanwhile, was up 17 spots, while OC moved up 22 spots. Nationally, Walmart held onto the top spot, with revenues of nearly $486 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was No. 2, with revenues of $223.6 billion. Apple rounded out the top three with revenues of $215.6 billion. The rankings are based on 2016 revenue calculations from Fortune, though the figures don’t always match what the companies report on their annual reports. For example, Marathon reported 2016 revenues of $63.4 billion, though Fortune pegged their revenue at $55.9 billion. The Toledo region had another three companies in the larger Fortune 1000 — Welltower Inc. at No. 564, with revenues of $4.3 billion, The Andersons Inc. at No. 595, with revenues of $3.9 billion, and Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. at 743, with revenues of $2.9 billion. Welltower made the biggest move of any Toledo-area company, gaining 45 spots. Contact Tyrel Linkhorn at tlinkhorn@theblade.com or 419-724-6134.

St George News 68 98/69 Fri 97/69 Sat 95/66 Woman uses pliers to pull son’s teeth in Walmart restroom Written by Associated Press June 6, 2017 Photo by Dmitry Naumov/Hemera/Getty Images Plus; St. George News PROVO (AP) — Authorities say a Utah woman pulled two of her son’s teeth in a Walmart restroom in Cedar Hills. The woman was charged Monday with second-degree felony child abuse. Prosecutors said that the 47-year-old woman – whose name is being withheld from this report to avoid identifying the child – bought hand sanitizer and needle-nose pliers from the store on April 2, then took them into the restroom and pulled two of her 7-year-old son’s teeth. Police in American Fork, Utah, say the boy’s older brother heard the child screaming and got him out of the restroom. Charging documents say the boy told his brother that one of the teeth was loose, but the other was only slightly loose. Prosecutors say the woman didn’t use any kind of anesthetic. No attorney was immediately listed for her in court records. The Associated Press contributed to this story. Email: news@stgnews.com Twitter: @STGnews Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Anyways, never, ever underestimate the stupidity of the average walmart shopper. I don’t even know why people like to shop at walmart. Horrible store with maybe, at best, slightly lower that average prices. Walmart and amazon are two places where I’ll pay more money somewhere else just to avoid shopping with them. And at the very least she paid for the pliers before using them. A lot of walmart shoppers might just “rent” them for such a purpose. lol 😉 Craig June 6, 2017 at 5:16 pm Log in to Reply My dad tied a string to my loose tooth and the other end to an open door handle.

It’s certainly the sound of summer, accompanied by the smell of the smoking, the sight of appealing char marks and ultimately, the mouthwatering taste of tender, well-seasoned beef that’s been perfectly cooked and cuts like butter. At a steak cook-off, that sizzle turns into a full-on symphony as dozens of backyard chefs show off their grilling skills in synchronized fashion. The atmosphere and camaraderie found at one of these highly competitive events is what drew business partners and buddies Ken Phillips and Brett Gallaway to pack up their aprons, tongs and grills and compete around the country. Their team name was The United Steaks of America. “You got to talk to people and be social. Let’s face it, we’re 40-something-year-old men,” says Gallaway. “What else are we going to do? We don’t bowl.” After losing in the Texas Steak Cookoff in Hico in 2009, their first event, they kept practicing and improved to placing in and even winning cook-offs in the years thereafter. The duo, North Texas residents who also own a restaurant management recruiting business, built something of a fan following and a reputation for quality steaks on the cook-off circuit. Soon Wal-Mart called with opportunities to be in commercials. While the two felt they had the formula down pat for a perfect steak, they realized cook-off rules were different wherever they went — sometimes frustratingly so. At one event, the same individual won every year because he gave the winnings back to the event coordinators, says Phillips. “Driving home from that event, I said, ‘That’s not right. We need to report him to the sanctioning body,’” Phillips says. “Then I thought, ‘Wait a minute. There is no sanctioning body for grilling competitions.’” With no set rules from event to event or consistency in judging policies and procedures, Phillips and Gallaway knew there was opportunity to make a positive change in what they, and hundreds of other backyard grill-masters, considered a legit culinary sport. They established the Steak Cookoff Association, based in Bedford, in 2013. “We contacted some different promoters and said, ‘Hey, cooks are frustrated with some of these rules,’” says Phillips. “We came up with a judging system that’s equitable and fair. That first year we got 18 different events to allow us to come in and sanction the judging.” A year later, 47 steak cook-offs became sanctioned by the burgeoning association. Last year, 87 events became sanctioned and this year Phillips and Gallaway are on track to sanction more than 120 events, some as far away as Europe and Australia. “It was like we started a wildfire,” Phillips says. What comes with officially sanctioning an event with the Steak Cookoff Association? Integrity, consistency and a fair shot, say Gallaway and Phillips. “We provide a level of security for the cooker, knowing the judge area is going to be run fairly,” Gallaway says. “Every team has the same opportunity to win. That’s what everybody wants. When I competed, I wanted to know I had a chance.” Prior to establishing judging guidelines, the judging process was not only inconsistent but took way too long, Phillips says. “Steaks often got cold because they sat there for an hour before the judges got to them,” he says. “One of our core principles was getting the judging process done quickly while the product was at its optimal condition.” Steak Cookoff Association judges even go through a training program where they are taught to form an opinion based on appearance, doneness, texture, taste and overall impression. All steaks at SCA events are rib-eyes and should be cooked to medium. Plastic cutlery is always used because, “A tender steak will cut like butter,” Phillips says. Even local celebrity judges, who often are recruited to draw attendees to cook-offs, must go through a brief training on the judging process. “But we really don’t have too many celebrity judges,” Phillips says. “The cooks would rather have trained judges.” And many steak cook-off organizers have forgotten that without the participating cooks, there would be no steak cook-off. “They’re the ones paying money to be there. They pay for their transportation, time off from work and entry fees,” Phillips says. “Rather than scold them, we ought to thank them for coming and give them gifts. We went to event sponsors and started doing that and the cooks noticed.” Today the SCA constantly receives calls from event organizers around the world who want to become officially sanctioned, so many that Phillips and Gallaway no longer the need to recruit events themselves. The two also have established the SCA world steak cook-off championship, held in late October in Fort Worth. Last year the event took place at Billy Bob’s Texas. “Cooks have gotten accustomed to the practices we’ve put in place,” Phillips says. “And our phone just keeps ringing.”   Whether grilling at home or ordering out, freelance food news writer Celestina Blok prefers her steak medium-rare. How to grill an award-winning steak Before establishing the Steak Cookoff Association in 2013, Brett Gallaway and Ken Phillips were award-winning steak cook-off champions many times themselves. Here are a few of their expert tips for grilling a great steak. Bring the steak to room temperature before grilling: “The biggest thing cooks do wrong is pull the steaks right out of the refrigerator and put them on the grill,” says Gallaway. “I like to leave mine out for two hours on an aluminum pan.” A room temperature steak will also absorb seasonings more evenly and thoroughly, Gallaway adds, as it’s not tight and cold. Go light on seasoning: “Less is more,” says Phillips. “You want seasoning that enhances the meat, not overpowers it.” Phillips and Gallaway agree sticking with salt and pepper is a safe bet, but if grilling rib-eye steaks, keep in mind that the marbling is already a bit salty. “Salt is a great flavor enhancer, but you want the steak to be the star of the meal,” Gallaway says. Add wood chunks to charcoal for a smokier flavor: While Gallaway admits he’s a Kingsford Charcoal guy, he adds a chunk of hickory wood and a chunk of pecan wood into the fire for enhanced flavor. “It adds a kiss of smoke to the steak.” Invest in a digital thermometer: Even though many steakhouses ask patrons to slice into their steak to check for desired doneness, Phillips recommends using a digital thermometer, which will avoid the loss of flavorful juices. “Having the tools of the trade is very important,” he says. “A digital thermometer can detect the internal temperature of the meat so you don’t have to cut the steak open.”　 Source: Steak Cookoff Assocation, 1901 Central Drive, Bedford, 469-693-1179, www.steakcookoffs.com Upcoming Steak Cookoff Association events Crazy Cowboy Steak Fundraiser Cookoff June 24 Texas Harley-Davidson 1 Texas Harley Way Bedford Half Moon Holidays Steak Cookoff June 30 Shiner Texas Cook ’Em High Steaks in Edinburg July 1 Edinburg Entry fees are $150 for all events.

Sections Deseret NewsInDepth InDepth The era of sales-tax-free online shopping is nearly over in Utah. Here's how it ended By Eric Schulzke @eschulzke Published: June 7, 2017 8:55 a.m. Updated: 22 hours ago 18 Comments 1 of 3 View 3 Items Mark Lennihan, AP A package from Amazon Prime moves on a conveyor belt at a UPS facility, Tuesday, May 9, 2017, in New York. Consumers in Utah, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine and New Mexico began noticing sales tax on their Amazon bills this year, creating a double take for a generation raised on the twin guarantees of free shipping and tax-free. Utah's deal with Amazon began in January, and as of March, the giant online retailer began voluntarily collecting sales taxes from consumers in all states that have one. A package from Amazon Prime is loaded for delivery on a UPS truck, Tuesday, May 9, 2017, in New York. | Mark Lennihan, AP The move by Amazon came as pressure was building in state houses, Congress and courts to allow states to require retailers to collect the tax on out-of-state sales and pass it on to state governments. The current rules were laid down by the Supreme Court in a 1992 decision regarding mail-order catalog sales that many now consider hopelessly out-of-date, and they bar states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes. As things stand, online retailers compete in two different tax systems: retailers located out-of-state pay no sales tax, while those with some link to the state must pay it. The differences between those two groups may have made sense in 1992 but no longer hold up today, as advancing software technology has made it ever easier to buy and sell — and equally easy to collect the correct sales tax, says Max Behlke, director of tax and budget policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures. With an ever larger share of retail moving online, state and local leaders are making an argument for fairness, says Behlke. Bipartisan bills that would allow states to tax out-of-state sales are moving in both houses of Congress, supported by most of Utah's congressional delegation. The lone exception was Senator Mike Lee, but Lee's spokesman now tells the Deseret News that Lee is reconsidering his position. State-level challenges from South Dakota, Massachusetts and a handful of other states are moving quickly through the courts, with a likely Supreme Court showdown in the offing. But most observers agree that Amazon’s decision to begin collecting sales tax on its own sharply alters the political and economic dynamics of the debate. Amazon is thought to have accounted for 43 percent of all online sales in 2016. Of the top 10 e-commerce retailers, only one now does not charge tax. Most of the top 10 are the online versions of physical stores like Macy's, Wal-Mart, Costco and Nordstrom. So with Amazon now on board, most online consumers already pay taxes on most purchases. And most seem to be OK with that. A recent survey of internet shoppers by Bizrate Insights found that nearly half did not consider sales tax in their purchase decision, and another 22 percent viewed it as only a minor concern. A number of major outlets are still outside the box, however. Among those sued by South Dakota under its new sales tax law are Utah-based Overstock.com, tech retailer New Egg and Wayfair, a clothing outlet. But the tax-free days for these outliers may be numbered. Being there If Congress doesn't act, the only other recourse for the states is to get the Supreme Court to reverse itself. The Supreme Court has held that only Congress can authorize taxation or regulation of interstate commerce. But if a company has physical presence, a footprint in a state, that state can tax sales made by that company in the state. The question is, how big must the footprint be, and what must it look like? What does it mean to "be" in a state? The Supreme Court laid down the current rule in 1992, in a case involving a mail-order catalog, holding that if a company had a storefront, employees, a warehouse or some similar footprint, the state could require them to collect tax on their sales. Otherwise, the state could not. As online commerce began to explode in the 21st century, states became increasingly desperate to chase down that lost revenue. To do so within the Supreme Court's guidelines, they had to get creative. For example, the failed Utah bill this year included a measure that raised the ire of so-called "mommy bloggers." To establish physical presence, it would have defined "affiliate marketers" — or bloggers who offer links to online retailers and take a share of any sales — as employees of the online retailer. Online sellers faced with that threat would simply have dropped their affiliates, hurting the blogger without helping the state, according to Evelyn Everton, director of the Utah Chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a small-government advocacy group. That threat from the online retailers was real, Everton said, not speculative. Massachusetts has a more elegant solution that leaves affiliate marketing untouched. The Bay State now holds that a company installing an app on a phone or a cookie on a computer constitutes physical presence in their state. Cookies are tiny pieces of data that remember a consumer's identity and behavior. Massachusetts argues that these and similar software form a physical presence in the state. When a retailer installs an app on a phone or a cookie on a computer, Massachusetts argues, they are in the state just as if they rented a room. Alabama, Tennessee and South Dakota are all laying down the gauntlet, urging the Court to set a new precedent. South Dakota's case is already at the state Supreme Court, where briefs are now being filed. The next step after that would be the U.S. Supreme Court, if it takes the case. And there is good reason to think that it will, thanks to a loud signal from the Court’s bellwether justice. In a 2015 concurring opinion, Anthony Kennedy explicitly called for the 1992 Quill v. North Dakota ruling to be overturned. A package from Amazon moves on a conveyor belt at a UPS facility, Tuesday, May 9, 2017, in New York. | Mark Lennihan, AP “Today buyers have almost instant access to most retailers via cell phones, tablets, and laptops,” Kennedy wrote. “As a result, a business may be present in a State in a meaningful way without that presence being physical in the traditional sense of the term.” Kennedy's call to overturn Quill stemmed partly from frustration with the failure of Congress to step in. In the 1992 decision, the Court had clearly signaled to Congress that the Commerce Clause put the ball in its court. South Dakota's case is a response to Kennedy's call for a test case to overturn Quill. "We wouldn't have done it if Kennedy had not called for it," said South Dakota State Senator Deb Peters, the bill's chief sponsor. Streamlining Kennedy was also addressing a fundamental transformation of the economy that has occurred since 1992. At that time, mail order was a limited force, and the logistics of asking small out-of-state retailers to collect taxes were immensely complicated. Asking a company to try to navigate those waters with a confusing shelf full of tax codes would have been absurd. Software today has eliminated that burden, says Craig Johnson, executive director of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, which represents state and local governments in an ongoing effort funded by around 25 states to change state tax laws to make them easier for retailers to implement. "Using a street address and a ZIP code," Johnson said, "the software can calculate any sales tax in a fraction of a second." “Quill dealt with phone and mail order based on a fact pattern from the 1980s, relying on court decisions from the 1960s,” says Utah Sen. Wayne A. Harper, who serves as a Utah delegate on the board. In the streamlining process, state and local governments have whittled away many of the arcane definitions and conflicting tax codes that have long separated counties. Today, 24 states, including Utah, have adopted tax laws that conform to the streamlined model. The proposed U.S. Senate bill would require states to adopt the streamlined model to be able to impose taxes under the new law. The goal of the streamlined sales tax project is to eliminate the regulatory burden on online retailers now asked to collect the tax, while evening the playing field for retailers who already do. An alliance State governments and bricks-and-mortar retailers have forged an alliance in the sales tax wars. Since the 2009 recession, both have felt under siege, as the economic recovery and tax revenues lagged and online retail began taking a bigger slice of the retail pie. In the three months of 2017, nine major retailers filed for bankruptcy — as many as in all of 2016. Payless Shoe Source also joined that list in April, and over Memorial Day weekend, Radio Shack closed over 1,000 stores. Other major retailers that have announced store closings this year include Macy's and Bebe department stores. This month, the Wall Street firm Credit Suisse projected that by 2022, over one-quarter of American shopping malls will close. In this year alone, Credit Suisse predicts, 8,640 retail stores will close. Bricks-and-mortar retailers don't see sales tax equalization as a silver bullet, but they do see it as a necessary first step to leveling the playing field. "Not charging sales tax is simply an unfair price advantage, on top of advantages they already have, including economies of scale and lower overhead," said Craig Sherman, vice president for Government Affairs at the National Retail Association. State and local governments feel their pain. Putting a precise number on how much revenue states lose to internet sales is difficult, NCSL's Behlke says, as online retail is constantly morphing. In the most widely cited estimate, NCSL calculated that in 2012 state governments lost $23.3 billion in sales taxes to untaxed e-commerce. Today, Behlke said estimates of lost revenue range from $20-$30 billion. In 2012, NCSL estimated Utah’s share of this 2012 loss at nearly $181 million. To put that in perspective, Utah in 2012 increased its hard-pressed public schools budget — one of the nation’s lowest on a per pupil basis — by just $117 million, much of which went to keep up with expanding grade school enrollment. So $181 million wasn’t chump change. 18 comments on this story Massachusetts, a leading rebel state, which, as noted, has defined cookies and apps as physical presence, has been collecting sales tax from Amazon since November of 2013, when Amazon opened a software development operation there. Parsing the impact of Amazon’s taxes then for the state's retailers is nearly impossible, says Bill Rennie, vice president with the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. But measuring monetary impact is almost beside the point. “Our members continue to argue for a level playing field,” Rennie insists. “If we are going to have a sales tax it needs to be evenly applied regardless of the platform. A sale is a sale.” Eric Schulzke Eric Schulzke writes on national politics and policy for the Deseret News. @eschulzke eschulzke@deseretnews.com Like that? Read this.

Although it normally costs $69, B&H Photo Video is currently offering the hockey puck-shaped player for $59. The circular dongle attaches to your TV via its own HDMI connector. It requires a constant connection to an outlet, so you'll want to make sure you have a spare outlet nearby. We found that it's a bit of an awkward setup, but given how much power a 4K machine needs to draw, it's somewhat understandable. Google Chromecast Ultra $59 B&H Photo Video The way it works is simple. Just download the Google Home app on your iOS or Android device and the app will provide you with a list of compatible apps, which you can then download from iTunes or the Google Play Store. Each app then gets a "cast" button, which you press from your device whenever you want to "cast" something to your HDTV. Your handheld isn't doing any work, it just sends a signal to the Chromecast, so you're free to use your phone or tablet while your shows play. App compatibility ranges from Netflix to Spotify. If you can live with the awkward setup, the Google Chromecast Ultra is one of the least expensive ways to give your HDTV a smart upgrade, especially if you're not on the Amazon bandwagon.

The company's mail-order operation delivered parcels before the U.S. Post office did. As the automobile became popular, it opened retail stores nationwide where it sold everything from previous versions of the internet (encyclopedias), household appliances and insurance (Allstate). With Craftsman, Sears had the tool market cornered. To top it off, it even sold and repaired cars. Think IKEA revolutionized the do-it-yourself world? From 1908 to 1940 Sears sold over 70,000 mail-order kit houses through its famous Sears catalog, which was widely known as the "Consumers' Bible." This was before the founder of Amazon was even born. Sears went unchallenged from the 1920s to the 1980s when K-Mart surpassed its sales, with the two stores later merging. Eventually Wal-Mart took over as the largest retailer in the world. When leaders have vision and they seek to grow a company, it is only natural that they use positive, manageable debt as a tool for expansion. What leaders often forget is that the consumer market as a force determines whether your vision lives or dies.   To save a failing vision, the leaders often fuel the fire of destruction by accumulating more debt. New debt props up old debt, and the new debt becomes an uncontrollable volcano. This leads to investor and executive panic, which projects weakness. They fire-sale assets, fire employees and blindly hope these decisions instill consumer confidence. In Sears' case, the company sold Allstate, Craftsman and other subsidiaries, talent left in droves and in a last-ditch effort, Sears started selling its real estate holdings. These one-time sales did nothing for income longevity. Top financial analysts already have projected time frames for Sears to file bankruptcy, and on a much deeper level of high finance someone will profit from Sears' demise. Aside from debt, what has really destroyed Sears?  It's simple. The free market is more attracted to the competition. The company lost its edge. It's not a vision that leads Sears today. It's the banks. Does this sound familiar? Some people may not know this, but there was a time when Harrisburg, once the crown jewel of the region, was an economic, talent-rich powerhouse. We had it all. While opinions vary, I maintain that residents and businesses fled because there was so much land opportunity to capitalize on elsewhere. Americans are opportunity seekers. Nationally we had the Wild West to conquer.   Locally we had the Wild East in terms of under-developed neighboring municipalities. Consumers wanted more, and the market offered more. Sears accumulated serious debt and had to compete against stronger retailers. Harrisburg accumulated serious debt and has been competing against stronger municipalities. Both Sears and Harrisburg lost talent, lost direction and were financially forced into fire-selling assets. Panic kicked in and weakness was projected. For both Sears and Harrisburg, the investors needed to be made whole first. The citizens, employees, small-business owners, merchandise manufacturers and others never had a seat at the negotiating table. Like Sears, Harrisburg is still not out of the woods. In 2019, Harrisburg will face a projected $13 million dollar income shortfall. With a boot on the citizens' necks we are given the option of enormous real estate tax increases or a charter change to home rule, where the city has the ability to tax and fee itself into prosperity.  So, aside from finances, what is really destroying Harrisburg? It's simple. From border to border, there is no projected consumer confidence and the market is more attracted to the competition. Harrisburg has lost its competitive edge.   The consumer confidence index is the most accurate, measurable economic indicator. Every projection for the parking transfer deal could not compute what the consumer feels. Residents and visitors were never part of the mathematic equation. Who doesn't want to park in the city? The consumer. Who pays the meters? The consumer. How do the bonds get paid? Through market consumption. While time of death may have already been called for both Sears and Harrisburg, is there still a way for Harrisburg to regain its competitive edge? I say yes. I believe Harrisburg could be turned around faster than anyone could imagine.    Here's a start: 1. Treat your residents and the people of the region better. They are your consumer market.   2. Open up budget planning discussions with the greatest entrepreneurial minds in Central Pennsylvania.  3. Stop issuing blanket decisions. Sincere investors or innovators can't be equated with those who are dishonest or incapable. 4. Relax your zoning, limit red tape, stop expanding limitations and stop subverting your own codified ordinances. What is good for a citizen is good for the government.   5. Stop politicizing issues that help some, but hurt others. A representative government represents all people. 6. Be leaders, not managers. No organization in the history of the world (government or business) has been managed out of a bad situation. They've all been led.  Or you can do none of the above, pass home rule in a panic and destroy what little confidence the market has left for the city. My prediction: Within five years or less of implementing home rule and doing none of the above, a new capital flight will occur and the city will be so broke that the next solution to dominate the conversation will be regionalization.  Debt, not vision will dictate that the municipalities merge together to become solvent. We've kicked the can far enough. We still have time to start a free-market exploratory and planning commission with the goal of finding an alternative to home rule. Any solution to Harrisburg's problems that doesn't put the people into the equation is guaranteed to fail. Someone needs to step up and start uniting the people. A leader needs to emerge who understands the city, understands the region and can artistically bring everyone together.  Time is of the essence.

After more than a decade of solid growth fueled first by the iPod music player and then by the even more popular iPhone, Apple finally appeared to hit a wall, with lackluster sales—relatively speaking—for other products such as the iPad and Apple Watch and a heavy reliance on upgraded phone models. But the most profitable publicly-traded company in the world is investing heavily in software and its efforts in new areas of opportunity, including automobiles, remain in development (and under wraps). But an analysis by editor-in-chief Clinton Leaf is kinder, describing the company as one of the ‘daring, upstart free enterprisers who pulled and dragged America to the front of a new global techno-industrial age.’ Tesla, Netflix, Google were all singled out as other examples of ‘new thinkers.’ The piece notes that Apple went from California garage to Fortune 500 member in just seven years, while the slideshow predicts that the Cupertino company will be the world’s first trillion-dollar company.

And like a lot of towns in this region, it’s been welcoming the warehousing industry and the jobs that have come with it. Safeway, Restoration Hardware and lots more big retailers have warehouses in Tracy. But in the age of rapid automation, how long will these jobs last? Amazon’s fulfillment center in Tracy offers a case study of the effects that robots will have on the future of jobs. While big retailers like Walmart and Target continue to rely mostly on human labor to fulfill customer orders, Amazon has deployed an army of robots to help with the task in Tracy. The Amazon facility in Tracy is huge at about 1 million square feet. And the best way to describe the experience inside? It’s like walking through a ginormous machine. For one thing, it’s really loud. “It’s the conveyance,” said Ashley Robinson, an Amazon spokeswoman. I could barely hear her above the noise. What she calls conveyance, most people know as conveyor belts. “We’ve got miles of conveyance here in this facility,” Robinson said. What is the future of jobs at warehouses like Amazon’s? (Erasmo Martinez/KQED) Three stories of conveyor belts move an endless stream of yellow plastic boxes carrying customers’ stuff. “They’re heading toward the pack stations, where they’ll be packed, a label supplied and sent out to the loading dock,” Robinson said. At a lot of warehouses, moving things is mostly a human job, but here it’s mostly been automated. And while conveyor belts are an old technology, Robinson said, “It’s all part of the symphony of Amazon fulfillment.” The conductor of that symphony? A computer. It keeps track of everything that comes in and out of the warehouse. Then it conducts the conveyor belts, humans and robots to get you, the consumer, that stuff as quickly as possible. Amazon’s robots are hard at work on the fourth floor of the warehouse, caged behind a black chain-link fence. These robots don’t have arms or faces. Instead, they look like giant orange hockey pucks. The robot’s job? To fetch the stuff customers order online. To do this, they glide around the warehouse and through a labyrinth of thousands of portable storage units. The shelves on those units are crammed with a random assortment of items: books, paper towels, board games. “I’m seeing some bottles of vitamins — it looks like there’s some ink cartridges for printers,” Robinson said. “I’m seeing a zombie bobblehead toy up there.” When the robot finds its storage unit, it glides underneath and lifts it up. Then it delivers it to a human worker who is called a picker. On the day I was there, a computer told the picker to grab what looked like a fantasy board game. It was on its side and jammed up against the shelf. The picker found it, scanned it and placed it on the conveyor belt. The robot took the shelf away and up rolled another shelf with another customer’s order. “So in a traditional fulfillment center where the associate would walk to the different items within a library of inventory, it can take hours to fulfill the customer order,” Robinson explained. “With the robotics it can take minutes.” A job that takes hours now takes minutes and fewer humans. It’s happened with every industrial revolution, and some people say we’re entering another one right now. Karen Myers is a scientist at SRI, one of Silicon Valley’s oldest research centers. I asked her: What we can expect from this next big shift? “It’s definitely going to take away a lot of jobs,” Myers said. At the same time, she says, we’re running up against the limits of technology, too. Take the picker at the Amazon fulfillment center. Myers said those skills are proving to be uniquely human. “So in computer science there’s a problem called the ‘bin packing problem,’ ” Myers said. It’s like it sounds: How do you program a robot to recognize a bunch of random objects and then pick up and stow them in a container? “Our fingers are incredibly dexterous and the current generation of robotic manipulators. They’re getting much, much better,” Myers said. “But they’re just not quite there yet.” And Myers said artificial intelligence, or the robot’s brain, isn’t up to the task. While artificial intelligence has made amazing advances in recognizing objects, it will take a while before its vision equals humans in the workplace. For example, remember that board game the Amazon picker was looking for? It was on its side and crammed into the shelf. The picker could barely see the box but she could still tell it was a board game. Myers says robots can’t do that. And then there’s the human touch. Myers says robots are great at picking up similar items over and over again. But Amazon’s business is to sell every random thing a consumer might want and that poses challenges. “If you’re going to pick up a box of Kleenex, it’s pretty light. But if you’re trying to pick up a car battery, that’s going to be really heavy,” Myers said. “And how does a robot know that china is fragile but board games aren’t?” Myers says it will be a long time before a robot has the kind of common sense that humans rely on for these tasks. “So one of the things we’ve learned is that automation is really good for some things, and humans are good for some things,” Myers said. Instead of human or machine, technologists believe that we will work more side by side. “And oftentimes by having a collaborative man-machine type setting, you can get more than just one in isolation,” Myers said. A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted that by 2030, 38 percent of jobs in the U.S. might be taken by automation. In past industrial revolutions, jobs were destroyed but new ones replaced them. Or technology helped industries grow and create jobs. It’s too early to tell how this industrial revolution is going to play out in the warehousing industry. Critics say Amazon’s technology is destroying jobs, especially in retail, but the data on that are not clear. Robinson, of Amazon, said what is clear is that Amazon continues to grow. “I can say that here in our own facility, when we opened it, we thought 1,000 people would be working in this facility,” Robinson said. “Today it’s over 3,000 employees.” Robinson said robots working with humans enabled the Tracy center to fulfill more customer orders faster. That’s attracted more customers and the need for more human workers. At least for now. Despite the robots, Amazon is becoming one of the largest employers in the U.S., driven largely by the growth in its fulfillment centers.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Michelle Lee The leader of the U.S. government's leading patent agency, Michelle Lee, has unexpectedly resigned from her post, according to multiple sources familiar with her plans. Lee, a former lawyer for Google, took over the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office during the Obama administration, and many in the tech industry — which publicly supported her work — believed that President Donald Trump would renominate her to the critical government post. But Lee instead informed the Commerce Department that she would be stepping down from the position. A spokesman for the agency did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, nor did the White House. It is unclear if Lee is leaving government entirely or headed to another position.

In April, a series of companies and their lobbying organizations — including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Samsung, and others — publicly defended Lee's tenure and asked Trump to renominate her for the agency. "This is a critical time for the USPTO," they wrote. "Patent quality, which had unfortunately been neglected for too long, is finally being recognized as critical to the strength and success of our patent system. We have been very pleased with the leadership of Director Lee, who has been committed to making sure that the USPTO creates the maximum economic benefit for American inventors and businesses." Lee also had her supporters in Congress — including California Rep. Darrell Issa, who previously said he had heard from the president that Lee would keep her job. In recent months, though, sources said that the Trump administration had started interviewing other potential candidates for the position. —By Tony Romm, Recode.net.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Beleaguered iconic retailer Sears reportedly is planning to close 72 additional stores this year, in addition to 180 locations the company had previously announced it would shutter. Business Insider reported that the company plans to shut 72 stores – most of them by September – including 49 Kmart stores, 16 Sears stores and seven auto centers. USA Today put the total at 66 and didn’t mention auto centers. The financial woes of the Illinois-based company, whose name has been a trusted retailing icon for generations of Americans, have deepened dramatically in recent months. Sears Holdings Corp., once the largest U.S. retailer, in March warned about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales, Reuters reported. However, the parent company of Sears and Kmart last month reported its first quarterly profit in nearly two years, as the retailer benefited from the sale of its Craftsman brand and a program to cut $1.25 billion in costs, amid doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern, Reuters reported. Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said those results had "clearly demonstrated" the company's commitment to return to solid financial footing. However, sales continued a years-long decline, hurt by lower demand for groceries, apparel and home appliances at the retailer's Sears and Kmart stores. Sears has been struggling to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. Sales at Sears' U.S. stores open more than a year fell 12.4 percent, while at Kmart it declined 11.2 percent in the first quarter ended April 29. The company said in April it expected a net profit of between $185 million and $285 million for the first quarter, through a cost-cutting plan, which included store closures and cutting management jobs. Selling and general expenses decreased about 16 percent to $1.27 billion in the quarter, leading to a near-third drop in total costs to $4 billion. Sears said it cut up to $700 million in costs to date since announcing the plan in February. The company in March sold its Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. for an upfront payment of $525 million. Sears, which has been closing stores and divesting businesses for years to cope with falling sales and a growing debt pile, warned in March about its ability to continue as a going concern. Sears stock did surge more than 30 percent in the wake of the earnings,  However, at least two people, including a hedge fund manager, said the stock's surge was more indicative of a "short squeeze" than a turnaround in the business. (A short squeeze is commonly defined as a rapid increase in the price of a stock that occurs when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock.) Sears stock late Tuesday at $6.61, down 17 cents, or 2.51 percent. "The stock movement does not indicate anything related to investment on the basis of fundamentals," David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital, which invests in distressed companies, told Reuters. The fund said it does not have a stake in Sears. Mark Cohen, former CEO of Sears Canada, backed the view. "There's no turnaround. Anybody who suggests that that's the case... is suffering from a loss of reality," said Cohen, currently director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. As reported by Business Insider, here is a list of the planned closures: Sears Chico, CA, store 2048 Dalton, GA, store 2615 Biloxi, MS, store 2256 Asheboro, NC, store 2645 Minot, ND, store 2152 Vineland, NJ, store 2374 Columbus, OH, store 1150 Elyria, OH, store 1310 Columbus, OH, store 1370 Franklin, OH, store 2940 Midwest City, OK, store 1261 Richmond, VA, store 1445 Columbia, SC, store 1525 Texarkana, TX, store 2567 Sherman, TX, store 2627 St. George, UT, store 2220 Kmart Dothan, AL, store 3082 Muscle Shoals, AL, store 7045 Little Rock, AR, store 3120 Bullhead City (Riviera), AZ, store 3375 Blythe, CA, store 3881 Sacramento, CA, store 4117 Manteca, CA, store 4862 Fort Oglethorpe, GA, store 3083 Calhoun, GA, store 9625 Iowa City, IA, store 4315 Marshalltown, IA, store 7583 Mishawaka, IN, store 4152 Newburyport, MA, store 9147 Elkton, MD, store 9524 Traverse City, MI, store 3009 West Branch, MI, store 3864 Cheboygan, MI, store 9245 Mantua, NJ, store 3060 Manahawkin, NJ, store 3641 Las Cruces, NM, store 3682 Alamogordo, NM, store 9119 Las Vegas, NV, store 3680 Henderson, NV, store 3857 Sparks, NV, store 4151 Liverpool, NY, store 3352 Malone, NY, store 3943 Cortland, NY, store 7134 Watertown, NY, store 7432 Wooster, OH, store 4875 Streetsboro, OH, store 9676 Tulsa, OK, store 4473 Roseburg, OR, store 7580 Butler, PA, store 4771 Belle Vernon, PA, store 7120 Indiana, PA, store 7217 Summerville, SC, store 3606 Seneca, SC, store 9320 Madison, TN, store 4093 Johnson City, TN, store 7353 El Paso, TX, store 3491 El Paso, TX, store 7347 Spanish Fork, UT, store 7425 Virginia Beach, VA, store 3560 Virginia Beach, VA, store 3801 West Allis, WI, store 3618 La Crosse, WI, store 4089 Medford, WI, store 7656 Lewisburg, WV, store 7582 Sheridan, WY, store 9074 Sears Auto Center Elyria, OH, store 6060 Midwest City, OK, store 6509 Columbia, SC, store 6013 Texarkana, TX, store 6739 Sherman, TX, store 6929 St. George, UT, store 2653 Richmond, VA, store 7505 (Newsmax wires services the Associated Press, Bloomberg and Reuters contributed to this report).

How AI is disrupting major industries Demand for personalized consumer experiences fuels AI marketing boom. Sponsored Content: Amplero on June 7, 2017 at 7:30 am More   Advances in artificial intelligence tend to provoke polarizing reactions for most people. One, a dystopian anxiety where humans huddle in fear of their metallic overlords. Or two, a utopian futurist society where humans are freed from mundane labor and complex challenges are solved by machines. Wherever you fall on the AI anxiety spectrum, the fundamental truth is that we are entering a major transformative cycle across nearly every industry. While AI is currently dominated by increased media attention and business hype, the way consumers and brands interact is quietly poised to make a tectonic shift over the next two years through marketing solutions built with AI in their core DNA. In a recent Wakefield/Demandbase study, 80 percent of marketing leaders say that AI will “revolutionize” marketing by 2020. Meanwhile, IDC research forecasts worldwide revenues for cognitive and artificial intelligence (AI) systems will reach $12.5 billion in 2017, an increase of 59.3 percent over 2016. In addition, global spending on cognitive and AI solutions will continue to see significant corporate investment over the next several years, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54.4 percent through 2020 when revenues will be more than $46 billion. On the other end of the spectrum, you have billionaire Mark Cuban stating at SXSW that “the world’s first trillionaires are going to come from somebody who masters AI and all its derivatives and applies it in ways we never thought of.” Every enterprise from Google and Netflix to Walmart and Nordstrom is making major investments in AI. But why the shift now? The proliferation of customer data volume via mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) technology like FitBits, beacons and smart appliances, and even open, public data sources have far outstripped human capability to process, generate insights and drive action. Meanwhile, today’s consumers increasingly expect highly contextual, fluid interactions with brands, which traditional marketing automation and personalization tools can’t provide at meaningful scale. The train may be driven by data, but marketers are currently tied to the railroad tracks. Although companies like Netflix, Google and Uber are often cited as the disruptive AI vanguard, traditional industries are increasingly adopting AI technology to help bridge the digital transformation gap and compete against industry outsiders threatening to grab market share. Finance and the machine The shift is already underway within banking. With banking services scrambling to meet the consumer demand for personalized online and mobile interactions, bankers believe AI will play a key role in bridging that digital gap. Four in five bankers believe AI will “revolutionize” the way in which banks gather information, as well as how they interact with their clients, said the Accenture Banking Technology Vision 2017 report, which surveyed more than 600 top bankers and also consulted tech industry experts and academics. The report forecasts that AI will become the primary way banks interact with their customers within the next three years. In addition, 49 percent of banking executives say the traditional transaction/ branch-based banking model will be dead by 2020, according to The Economist‘s 2016 report, “Retail Banking: In tech we trust.” While the concern is that artificial intelligence will take away the human component to banking, the truth is that emerging AI technologies — particularly on the marketing side — allow banks to simplify interactions and only deliver the most relevant experiences for customers. Conversely, it allows financial services marketing teams to move away from mundane data and campaign processes, in favor of spending more time on creativity and innovation. Free-to-play gaming fuels AI growth While gaming has leveraged varying levels of artificial intelligence since its inception to simulate human characteristics in non-player characters and drive good game play, the challenges associated with the free-to-play gaming model has brought AI marketing technologies to the forefront to improve the holistic player experience. Formerly, studios typically invested in producing big titles and gaming franchises that required an upfront purchase to play. In the traditional platform model, 90 percent of their revenue came from 28 percent of their users. However, in the mobile free-to-play market, only 6 to 10 percent of mobile gamers will make premium in-app purchases. In 2016, the average iPhone user spent $27 on games, out of a total of $40 on apps. While studios already cared about user engagement in the previous model, the new pricing model requires a deeper understanding of how users commit to a game. Techcrunch reports that nearly one in four people abandon mobile apps after only one use. Within this environment, leveraging in-game data to deliver personalized, real-time experiences to encourage playing time and decrease churn has become mission-critical, which has driven gaming companies to look to core AI solutions to continuously optimize the entire player experience. AI prevents subscriber churn among mobile carriers In the ultra-competitive and saturated telecommunications industry, major carriers are constantly stealing mobile subscribers from one another to bolster growth. Because of this, the primary players — Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T — are heavily investing in emerging AI solutions to help predict and prevent customers leaving for another carrier (called churn within the industry). Traditional offline predictive models are unable to provide an in-depth view at the velocity needed to actually prevent churn. New AI platforms are allowing mobile carriers to understand the behavioral signals for a customer at risk for churn weeks earlier and take preventative action to course correct the customer relationship with the brand (provide new data or pricing incentives, encourage engagement, or create enticing renewal offers). Because of the pace of the industry, the sheer volume of data available and its position as a conduit for all mobile experiences, telecommunications is a leading candidate for the industry poised to see some of the greatest return on investment from AI technology. Humans welcome While the prevailing concern around automation focuses on job replacement, we’re actually seeing a surge in creativity and innovation as overloaded marketers and data scientists are freed from the manual labor of wrangling data and building complex targeting rules. Customers should expect a creative surge over the next two years from brands they interact with as the focus shifts from traditional marketing technology to core AI solutions. And no matter where you fall on the AI anxiety spectrum, increased creativity ultimately results in not just a better customer experience, but a better human one.

Franchise Lists Search Search Donald TrumpPresident Trump’s Aides Are Urging Him Not to Fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions Comey testimonyWhat to Expect From James Comey’s Testimony UberUber’s Biggest Rival in India Says the Company Is ‘Despicable’ Congressional Hearings9 of the Most Dramatic Congressional Hearings in U.S. History Fortune 500 The Fortune 500’s 10 Most Profitable Companies Jen Wieczner Jun 07, 2017 The 63rd edition of the Fortune 500, our annual list featuring the largest and most successful American companies, was published on Wednesday. But as our roster is a ranking of corporations by revenues, there's no requirement for profitability: Indeed, 61 companies on this year's list—or 12%—lost money last year. Still, the Fortune 500 as a group grew profits 6% in 2016, collectively earning nearly $890 billion. At the high end, the Fortune 500's biggest earners boast bottom lines larger than many world economies, with profits eclipsing the gross domestic product (GDP) of countries such as Tanzania and Iceland. And some of the companies that rank among the most profitable in the 500 may surprise you, as they are nowhere near the top in terms of sales. Meanwhile Walmart (wmt), which at No. 1 on the Fortune 500 has more than twice as much revenue as any other company on the list, doesn't even make the top 10 when it comes to profits. Even without tax reform and other political changes that are expected to boost earnings further, these 10 companies are making the most money in all of corporate America. 1. Apple Fortune 500 Rank: No. 3 2016 Profits: $45.7 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 21% Though its profits sank 14% last year, Apple (aapl) still managed to maintain its status as the Fortune 500's most profitable company for the third year in a row. Indeed, even after declines in iPhone and iPad sales led its revenues to fall nearly 8%, to $215.6 billion, Apple still has more money on hand than it has so far figured out what to do with, to the tune of more than $250 billion in cash. Apple plans to return some $13 billion of that hoard to shareholders in the coming year in the form of dividends, making it the highest dividend-paying stock in the world. 2. J.P. Morgan Chase Fortune 500 Rank: No. 21 2016 Profits: $24.7 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 23% Rising interest rates, even the Federal Reserve's modest recent hikes, have given J.P. Morgan Chase (jpm) a meaningful bump. Now the biggest American bank by any measure, J.P. Morgan grew revenue more than 4% last year to $105.5 billion, while also boosting profits more than 1%. With CEO Jamie Dimon an outspoken proponent of regulatory reform, particularly when it comes to the banking sector, J.P. Morgan's earnings are likely to grow further if President Trump and Congress lift some of the capital requirements and other limitations imposed on banks after the financial crisis. 3. Berkshire Hathaway Fortune 500 Rank: No. 2 2016 Profits: $24.1 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 11% Warren Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (brk.a) jumps up two spots to its highest Fortune 500 rank in history this year, after growing revenues 6% in 2016. Though Berkshire's profits were flat for the year (with modest growth from some of its underlying insurance and energy businesses offset by a 16% earnings decline at its Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, and slightly smaller stock market profits), its more than $24 billion bottom line means it holds last year's spot as the Fortune 500's third most profitable company. 4. Wells Fargo Fortune 500 Rank: No. 25 2016 Profits: $21.9 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 23% The bank paid more than $185 million to the government and consumers to resolve its fake accounts scandal, contributing to a more than 4% decline in 2016 profits. But Wells Fargo still netted nearly $22 billion in earnings last year. One of the largest consumer banks in America, Wells Fargo (wfc) is also benefiting from higher interest rates, and its sales grew almost 5% in 2016. 5. Alphabet Fortune 500 Rank: No. 27 2016 Profits: $19.5 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 22% Google's parent company moved up nine spots on the Fortune 500 this year thanks to a banner 2016 in which sales increased more than 20%, and earnings grew nearly as much, blowing past Wall Street's expectations. The core Google (googl) search and advertising business provided a hefty cushion for Alphabet's so-called other bets, which include everything from biotech unit Calico to self-driving car division Waymo. Though such moonshots managed to generate 81% more revenue in 2016 compared to the year before, they also had higher losses, of $3.6 billion—and they still account for less than 1% of Alphabet's overall sales. 6. Bank of America Fortune 500 Rank: No. 26 2016 Profits: $17.9 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 19% Higher interest rates are likely to benefit Bank of America (bac) more than any other U.S. bank, and in 2016, the company recorded its most profitable year since the financial crisis and the second-biggest profit in its history. (Bank of America has yet to surpass its record performance in 2006, when it earned $21 billion.) Illustrating how even small Fed rate hikes can have an outsized impact on the bottom line of a company like Bank of America—which makes money by collecting higher interest payments on loans while paying out a much smaller amount on consumers' savings deposits—the bank boosted profits nearly 13% last year, even though its sales were basically flat. 7. Microsoft Fortune 500 Rank: No. 28 2016 Profits: $16.8 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 20% Though Microsoft falls three spots on the Fortune 500 this year after a nearly 9% sales decline in 2016, its aggressive cost cuts (including 7,800 layoffs announced in 2015) are paying off for the company's bottom line: Microsoft (msft) grew profits almost 38% last year, beating Wall Street expectations. It wasn't just the cutbacks that made the difference. The company also attributed its impressive earnings to its booming cloud services business Azure, which is now competitive with the huge cloud-services division Amazon (amzn) and is much more profitable than Microsoft's legacy technology products. 8. Johnson & Johnson Fortune 500 Rank: No. 35 2016 Profits: $16.5 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 23% The sprawling health care conglomerate is one of just 54 companies that have made it on the Fortune 500 every single year the list has been published. Johnson & Johnson (jnj) also managed to expand its pre-tax profit margins in both its consumer products and pharmaceutical businesses last year. That, plus a reduction in its effective income tax rate (to 16.5% in 2016, down from 19.7% the year before) due to an accounting change, contributed to a more than 7% increase in 2016 profits, while sales grew less than 3%. 9. Citigroup Fortune 500 Rank: No. 30 2016 Profits: $14.9 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 18% After carrying out a deliberate and gradual plan to shrink and simplify the company, including divesting much of its Latin America business, Citigroup (c) declared its restructuring efforts complete in 2016. That left the bank with lower revenues (down nearly 7% to $82.4 billion last year) and profits (down almost 14%), as expected, but Citi CEO Michael Corbat still felt obliged to say in the company's annual report that "our performance last year fell short." Investors didn't seem to agree: Citi stock gained nearly 16% in 2016, as the bank also returned more money to shareholders in the form of an increased dividend and stock buybacks. 10. Altria Group Fortune 500 Rank: No. 148 2016 Profits: $14.2 billion % of Revenues (Margin): 74% Altria, the tobacco company formerly known as Philip Morris, catapulted into the ranks of the Fortune 500's most profitable companies with a massive 172% increase in net income in 2016. But don't expect Altria (mo) to keep its place on this list too long: The bulk of the company's profits last year came from a one-time windfall on Altria's 27% ownership stake in beer maker SABMiller. When Anheuser-Busch InBev completed its takeover of SABMiller in the fall, Altria reaped a $13.9 billion gain, representing $9 billion—and the vast majority—of its 2016 earnings after taxes. Not counting the gains from the mega-merger, Altria grew its operating income almost 5% last year.

A court date has been set for an Arkansas man and woman accused of leaving three children under the age of 5 and a dog in a hot car, according to authorities. James Loren Buffington, 25, and Sonja Ann Marie Jarvis, 20, are scheduled to appear in court June 15. Each face three charges of endangering the welfare of a minor in the second degree and one charge of cruelty to animals, according to a Booneville Police Department report. Police responded to a report of "small children left in a hot car" at the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 1400 E. Main St. in Booneville around 5:40 p.m. May 27, according to the report. Authorities found a 4-year-old boy, a 3-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl, who all "appeared to be sweating and had extremely red cheeks," the report said. When an officer opened the car door, he said a "hot wave" of air hit him from inside the vehicle. Police said the temperature outside was 92 degrees and that the car, which was running, was blowing hot air.

A small white dog was also in the car, according to the report. Police found Jarvis, the children's mother, and her boyfriend, Buffington, inside the store. The officer told the couple that they had left children in a hot car, and Buffington replied that he had left the air-conditioner running.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:40 PM, June 7, 2017 Updated: 4:55 PM, June 7, 2017 PARIS - The board of French supermarket retailer Carrefour <CARR.PA> is set to nominate on Monday at the latest Alexandre Bompard, chief executive of consumer electronics retailer Fnac Darty <FNAC.PA>, as its chosen CEO, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. The board of Europe's largest retailer is slated to meet on Friday or Monday and an announcement could be made afterwards, one of the sources said. French newspaper Le Figaro had reported earlier on Wednesday that the Carrefour board could meet as early as Friday. Carrefour, the world's second largest retailer after Wal-Mart <WMT.N>, has been searching since October for a successor to Georges Plassat, 68, whose mandate as chairman and chief executive expires in May 2018. Bompard, 44, has led Fnac - which sells books and music - since January 2011. Fnac shares have nearly tripled in value since its stock market listing in 2013. Carrefour and its major shareholders could not be immediately reached for comment, while Fnac Darty declined to comment on the matter. Carrefour shares, which had fallen to 14 euros at the time of Plassat's appointment in June 2012, more than doubled to 32 euros in April 2015 but have since fallen back. Carrefour shares are up by around 1 percent so far in 2017, underperforming an 8 percent rise on France's benchmark CAC-40 index <.FCHI>. The stock fell 14 percent last year.

Prosecutors said Monday that Jeannine Degaston, 47, bought hand sanitizer and needle-nose pliers from the store, then took them into the restroom and pulled two of her 7-year-old son’s teeth. Story continues below video × Advertisement Police in American Fork said the boy’s older brother heard the child screaming and got him out of the restroom on April 2. The teeth were removed in pieces, not just by pulling them out, according to police. Charging documents say the boy told his brother that one of the teeth was loose, but the other was only slightly loose. Prosecutors say Degaston didn’t use any kind of anesthetic. She told police she pulled them out because they were infected. The child was taken to a dentist, who said the teeth did not need to be removed, according to police. Degaston was charged with felony child abuse. No attorney was immediately listed for her in court records. Police said Degaston has a history of mental illness.

The discounted rate is $5.99 per month. The regular annual membership is $99 per year, or $8.25 a month. But those who cannot afford to pay up front have to pay $10.99 a month for the same benefits. Amazon is offering a discounted rate on its Prime membership for people who receive government assistance. The discounted rate is $5.99 per month.

(Richard Drew / AP) Anne D'InnocenzioAssociated Press Privacy Policy Amazon is making a play for low-income shoppers. The online leader is offering a discount on its pay-by-month Prime membership for people who receive government assistance. The move, announced Tuesday, is seen by some analysts as an attempt to go after rival Walmart's lower-income shoppers. The world's largest retailer has revamped its shipping program and improved other services to drive online sales growth as it tries to narrow the gap with Amazon. People who have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer card, used for programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs, or food stamps, will pay $5.99 per month for the Amazon Prime benefits like free shipping and unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows. The typical Prime membership is $99 a year, but those who cannot afford to pay up front also have a $10.99-a-month option. Amazon designed this option to make its "selection and savings more accessible, including the many conveniences and entertainment benefits of Prime," Greg Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, said in a statement. Walmart has gained momentum in its online business, seeing its e-commerce sales soar 63 percent in its first quarter, up from a 29 percent increase the previous period. It now offers free-two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a purchase of $35. Online shoppers who collect their purchases at a store get extra discounts. And Walmart has dramatically expanded its online offerings — though it's still far behind the hundreds of millions of products at Amazon.com. Amazon's aim with the latest move is two-pronged, says Ken Perkins, president of research firm RetailMetrics. "It is part of Amazon's overarching goal to inexorably move into every corner of retail," he said. "Secondly, it is a direct move to pull consumers away from its chief retail rival Walmart, which has been far more aggressive competing with Amazon on price, offerings, delivery and building out its formidable e-commerce operations." Internet consultant Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali says Amazon's move "seems inevitable" because it's saturated a good part of the affluent and middle-class sector — but describes it as a "head scratcher." "These consumers have always indexed lower in online transactions, and their living circumstances are often not well-suited to package delivery, and many of these consumers don't have vehicles to drive to a location pick up packages," she wrote in an email. "Of the long list of business that Amazon could target, this doesn't seem like the biggest one."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 7 June 2017 | MYT 1:09 PM Amazon offers Prime discount for US customers on government aid Amazon said it would offer the US$10.99 (RM47)-per-month or US$99 (RM422)-per-year Prime service – which includes fast shipping as well as streaming of movies and TV shows – for US$5.99 (RM25) per month to those receiving government assistance including welfare and food stamps. — AFP Amazon.com Inc said it would offer a discount on its popular Prime subscription service for shoppers who receive US government aid, taking aim at a key customer base for rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  Amazon said it would offer the US$10.99 (RM47)-per-month or US$99 (RM422)-per-year Prime service – which includes fast shipping as well as streaming of movies and TV shows – for US$5.99 (RM25) per month to those receiving government assistance including welfare and food stamps.  The online retailer's move directly challenges Wal-Mart – the biggest beneficiary of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – where at least one in five customers pay by food stamps.  Prime subscriptions have been key to Amazon's retail growth strategy, as the service encourages shoppers to buy more goods, more often.  Customers with valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards receiving aid from programmes including SNAP and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programme will qualify for the discount, Amazon said. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested EU seeks to expedite police requests for data from tech firms Apple’s two futures: VR is for desktop, AR is for mobile Uber still doesn’t look like the next Facebook: opinion Opulent Paris Opera House on the hunt for startups and ‘geeks’ 5 superpowers that makes mum a hero 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Varsity community reaches out to the needy Homebuyers get rebates for properties bought during three-month period Four new caps in Bok shake-up ahead of French test advertisement Latest News Digi offers a new fleet management solution Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats Amazon error sends some shoppers to dog photo, not product page Super glitch strikes Philippine bank again Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Most Viewed in Tech Digi offers a new fleet management solution Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with borderless display could land by September Super glitch strikes Philippine bank again Ikea to try selling through third party websites Amazon error sends some shoppers to dog photo, not product page Apple’s two futures: VR is for desktop, AR is for mobile Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Chinese Apple staff suspected of selling private data Is Facebook CEO Zuckerberg making a run for the White House?

"Now, what the heck, you're probably asking, does a high-end speaker system have to do with the resignation of a famous retail CEO? Simple, they help define what's working and what's not working in this crazy stock market," the "Mad Money" host contended. Cramer began by saying that as a mall-based store, J.Crew struggled in the past few years like many of its counterparts despite Drexler's strong reputation in retail. "In the age of Amazon, where driving to the mall is an anathema to many shoppers, Mickey couldn't distinguish his goods enough to entice people into a place where they didn't want to go to begin with. Much has been made of his fashion missteps. I think those are way off-base," Cramer said. Now, mall-based retailers from Under Armour to Urban Outfitters are missing the mark because young shoppers go to the mall knowing exactly what they want instead of planning to browse and spend time there, a sign that brand loyalty is waning. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images Millard 'Mickey' S. Drexler To address one retailer whose stock has struggled of late, down 11 percent for 2017, Cramer sat down with Tarang Amin, the chairman and CEO of e.l.f. Beauty. "We believe that this is a long term growth play, and so for those who are fickle, maybe this isn't for you," the CEO told Cramer on Tuesday. "But for those who really believe in the underlying thesis here, which is we make extraordinary cosmetics, high-quality ones that are accessible to consumers, then this is a great one." While Amin addressed the fact that e.l.f.'s shares declined shortly after the company's last earnings report, he insisted that the cosmetics brand's secular growth and strong partnerships will eventually help it triumph over its troubling stock action. "We continue to have incredible growth at Wal-Mart, and then Ulta, they recently announced that they're going to be putting e.l.f into a subset of their stores as well," Amin said. "E.l.f. has been able to grow regardless of the economic cycle, regardless of what's going on in the broader category, and we'll continue to grow as we have." Mathew Lloyd | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee stands on the deck of a pilot boat in view of the Ocean Princess oil platform, operated by Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., in the Port of Cromarty Firth in Cromarty, U.K. On a day where oil hovered in a small range, struggling to lift above the $48 mark, Cramer wondered what could give crude the boost it needs. "If oil can't mount a major advance on some insane Middle East friction, real tension among the Gulf States that export 30 percent of the world's crude oil to starved markets, what is it going to take for black gold to really roar higher?" the "Mad Money" host asked. While the oil bulls may be questioning their logic, Cramer said the answer lies in a Schlumberger conference call from when it reported its first-quarter results in April: oil will rise when the deep-water oil wells start to run dry. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images A man enters the Wall Street subway station near the New York Stock Exchange. Then, with the major indices trading near all-time highs and investors looking ahead to next week's Federal Reserve meeting in which the central bank is expected to raise interest rates, Jim Cramer figured the bank stocks would be rallying. "Yet the bank stocks are not on fire here. They're actually lagging the rest of the market," Cramer said. To find out what is keeping the banks from climbing, Cramer took to the charts of technician Ed Ponsi, managing director of Barchetta Capital Management and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com. Palo Alto Networks CEO: Automation and Orchestration Finally, Cramer spoke with Mark McLaughlin, the chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks, for a checkup on the rapidly developing cybersecurity space. "What's really driving the need for security these days is increasing levels of automation and orchestration," McLaughlin explained on Tuesday. "So, particularly for smaller companies, they just don't have the resources to keep up with all the complexities of cybersecurity, so what we're trying to do and other folks are trying to do – we think we're leaders here – is create real platforms that have a lot of automation, a lot of orchestration, and a lot of leverage that drives simplicity because we're fighting a highly automated adversary so we need more automation." McLaughlin said that Palo Alto is demonstrating leadership in the space by adding new customers to its ranks, with over 2,000 new additions during the company's third quarter. "Most of them are coming from our competitors, whether it's Cisco, Checkpoint, Juniper, folks like that," he told Cramer. "We continue to take customers at a very high rate." Lightning Round: Not Quitting on this Online Name In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Shopify: "This thing's amazing. This is an online platform that is working. No one believes in Shopify except for me. I've been behind this thing for 30 [basis] points. I'm not quitting." Energy Transfer Partners: "The guy who runs it, Kelcy Warren, he rolls the dice. He feels like he's in Wynn [or] Las Vegas Sands with this company. I say absolutely not. I don't want you to touch it. Never reach for yield. It ain't worth it." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next NASHVILLE, Tenn. - China-based memory foam manufacturer Sinomax has opened its first U.S. location in Davidson County, adding 350 jobs to the area. The plant opened its first American location on JP Hennessey Drive in an old Whirlpool building that was left empty after the company shuttered its doors in 2008. "When I first saw the building it was really very sad," said Sinomax CEO Frank Chen. "There was no activity here." Chen invested $28 million into renovating the building and adding equipment that will produce pillows, mattress toppers, and mattresses that will ultimately end up in stores like Walmart and Costco. It's a massive company Chen started more than 15 years ago, when he said he had nothing to his name. "I moved to this country in 1989 after a tragedy in Beijing," Chen said. "I almost couldn't come here because I didn't have the money for the application fee." Chen left his hometown of Beijing in the wake of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Chinese troops killed hundreds of civilians in order to stop student-led protests. Luckily, Chen was accepted into the engineering program at LSU. One of his professors mailed him the $30 he needed to come to the United States. "I always say that was the first investment into this company," Chen said. "It started with $30." After earning his masters degree, Chen chose to take a risk and start Sinomax, which has grown into a major supplier for some of the world's largest retailers. Chen said his expansion into America may start in Tennessee, but he hopes to add three more plants in the future. "I'm really blessed I had the opportunity to come to this country," he said.

New Edition Biopic Brought In Tens Of Millions Of Viewers Hollywood/TV/Reality TV New Edition, Chance The Rapper To Be Honored At 2017 BET Awards By Singersroom Published on June 6, 2017 Share Tweet Comment Today (June 6), BET revealed iconic R&B group New Edition will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2017 “BET Awards.” In addition, multi–Grammy Award winning hip-hop artist Chance the Rapper will receive the evening’s Humanitarian Award presented by Walmart. In January 2017, BET launched The New Edition Story, a three-part miniseries that was also BET’s first scripted music-focused program which was a ratings smash. The miniseries profiled the New Edition journey from the little-known boy band from the Orchard Park Projects of Roxbury, Massachusetts, to one of the most successful adult acts ever in the music industry. To date, New Edition has sold over 20 million records world-wide. Chance the Rapper is a hip-hop artist, singer-songwriter and philanthropist who rose to popularity with his highly awarded and recognized mixtapes Acid Rap and Coloring Book. Chance has consistently used his musical platform to support a number of impactful educational, social and political initiatives – positively impacting both local and national communities. In 2016, Chance worked closely with President Obama on My Brother’s Keeper Challenge, an initiative of the United States Federal Government to promote intervention by civic leaders in the lives of young men of color – working to address their unique challenges and to promote racial justice. Chance has also activity fought gun violence, leading social campaigns in his home-town Chicago.

The company says it plans to appeal. Dish Network has been fined for allowing telemarketers to call people on the Do Not Call list. The company says it plans to appeal. Photo: Paul Sakuma, Associated Press Business News Roundup, June 7 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Wellness classes to end Sutter Health affiliate California Pacific Medical Center plans to end its wellness program, which includes group and individual classes with physical therapists at its Pacific Campus in San Francisco, at the end of June. About 100 people use the program, which began in 2008, according to a Sutter Health spokesman. He declined to say how much money the move would save the health system. Physician-ordered physical therapy sessions will continue. The same licensed therapists that do physician-ordered physical therapy also lead the group and individual wellness classes. Ending the wellness program will help free up personnel to do the former, Sutter said. Latest business videos Many patients use the wellness program, which include Pilates and biking classes, to prevent future injuries, according to people who participate in the program, many of whom are seniors. The pool at the Pacific Campus rehabilitation center has also been permanently closed for repairs, and pool programs have been moved to the Davies campus. Telemarketers Dish fined $280 million An Illinois judge has ordered satellite-TV company Dish to pay $280 million for calling people who said they didn’t want to be bothered by telemarketers. The court found this week that Dish “caused millions and millions of violations of the Do Not Call laws.” Telemarketers are barred from calling people who have joined federal or state do-not-call registries or who’ve asked companies to leave them alone. The Justice Department said the $280 million penalty, which will go to the federal government, California, Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio, was the biggest ever penalty for telemarketing violations. Dish Network says it will appeal the ruling. It says the penalties are unfairly large and it’s being held responsible for telemarketing done by contractors, who in some cases hid what they were doing from Dish. E-commerce Amazon offers low-cost Prime Amazon will offer a discount on its pay-by-month Prime membership for people who receive government assistance. The move, announced Tuesday, is seen by some analysts as an attempt to go after Walmart’s lower-income shoppers. The world’s largest retailer has revamped its shipping program and improved other services to drive online sales growth as it tries to narrow the gap with Amazon. People who have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer card, used for programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs, or food stamps, will pay $5.99 per month for the Amazon Prime benefits like free shipping and unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows. The typical Prime membership is $99 a year, but those who cannot afford to pay up front also have a $10.99-a-month option. Amazon designed this option to make its “selection and savings more accessible, including the many conveniences and entertainment benefits of Prime,” Greg Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, said in a statement. Walmart e-commerce sales were up 63 percent in its first quarter. It now offers free-two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a purchase of $35. Online shoppers who collect their purchases at a store get extra discounts. Economy CEOs more optimistic Leading CEOs remain supportive of some of President Trump’s policy initiatives despite his still-hazy plan for cutting taxes and recent actions by Trump that have intensified attention on federal investigations of his campaign. The Business Roundtable said Tuesday that the executives’ economic outlook has reached its highest level in three years — a reading of 93.9, which suggests continued economic growth. The association found in its survey of CEOs that plans for capital investment rose 4.6 percentage points since the first quarter, while sales expectations increased 0.5 percentage point. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the roundtable, suggested that the results reflect confidence in the prospect for overhauling taxes.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 8 June 2017 | MYT 12:52 PM Amazon lent US$1bil to merchants to boost sales on its marketplace More than 20,000 small businesses have received a loan from Amazon and more than half of those have taken a second loan from the company, it said. — Reuters Amazon.com Inc has stepped up lending to third-party sellers on its site who are looking to grow their business, a company executive said in an interview.  The e-commerce giant has doled out more than US$1bil (RM4.26bil) in small loans to sellers in the past 12 months, compared with more than US$1.5bil (RM6.39bil) it lent from 2011 through 2015, said Peeyush Nahar, vice-president for Amazon Marketplace. Sellers have used the money to expand their inventory or discount items on Amazon, he said.  Boosting sales for third-party merchants is lucrative for Amazon, which takes a cut of transactions on its site.  It also has made a business out of handling more leg work for sellers, too. They pay Amazon to fulfil their orders and boost their placement in search results, without which sellers might struggle to grab shoppers' attention.  More than 20,000 small businesses have received a loan from Amazon and more than half of those have taken a second loan from the company, it said.  Loans range from US$1,000 (RM4,263) to US$750,000 (RM3.19mil). Sellers have said interest rates are between 6% and 14%.  Rivals, including eBay Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, now are doubling down on their marketplace businesses, but loans may help keep sellers close to Amazon's orbit.  "We do tell them it's to help them grow on the Amazon Marketplace," Nahar said.  Traditional lenders shied away from small merchants after the 2008 financial crisis, which created an opening for other sources of financing. While this exposes Amazon to additional credit risk, the company has near real-time data on sellers' businesses and access to their customer reviews, which are helpful in deciding whether to make a loan.  The loan programme is invitation-only.  Amazon has issued loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan.  The company has said it would expand to other countries where it operates marketplaces, such as Canada, France and China. On the rollout's timing, Nahar said, "Stay tuned." — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Opulent Paris Opera House on the hunt for startups and ‘geeks’ Chinese Apple staff suspected of selling private data Japan Display considers deeper restructuring to catch up in OLED: source EU seeks to expedite police requests for data from tech firms 5 superpowers that makes mum a hero 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Iran attackers fought for Islamic State in Syria, Iraq - ministry Spanish manager Gracia leaves Russia's Rubin Kazan AirAsia Free Seats promotion starts tomorrow advertisement Latest News AirAsia raises stake in inflight entertainment system provider Prasarana to generate RM17bil in economic returns this year Digi offers a new fleet management solution Monorail trains built for Prasarana are ‘fit for operation’ - Scomi Market closes marginally lower Most Viewed in Tech Digi offers a new fleet management solution Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with borderless display could land by September Super glitch strikes Philippine bank again Ikea to try selling through third party websites Amazon error sends some shoppers to dog photo, not product page Apple’s two futures: VR is for desktop, AR is for mobile Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Chinese Apple staff suspected of selling private data Is Facebook CEO Zuckerberg making a run for the White House?

They pay Amazon to fulfill their orders and boost their placement in search results, without which sellers might struggle to grab shoppers' attention. More than 20,000 small businesses have received a loan from Amazon and more than half of those have taken a second loan from the company, it said. Loans range from $1,000 to $750,000. Sellers have said interest rates are between 6 percent and 14 percent. Rivals, including eBay Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, now are doubling down on their marketplace businesses, but loans may help keep sellers close to Amazon's orbit. "We do tell them it's to help them grow on the Amazon Marketplace," Nahar said. Traditional lenders shied away from small merchants after the 2008 financial crisis, which created an opening for other sources of financing. While this exposes Amazon to additional credit risk, the company has near real-time data on sellers' businesses and access to their customer reviews, which are helpful in deciding whether to make a loan. The loan program is invitation-only. Amazon has issued loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan. The company has said it would expand to other countries where it operates marketplaces, such as Canada, France and China. On the rollout's timing, Nahar said, "Stay tuned."

NEW YORK: Amazon.com Inc has stepped up lending to third-party sellers on its site who are looking to grow their business, a company executive said in an interview on Wednesday. The e-commerce giant has doled out more than US$1 billion in small loans to sellers in the past 12 months, compared with more than US$1.5 billion it lent from 2011 through 2015, said Peeyush Nahar, vice president for Amazon Marketplace.

Owens-Illinois is the highest ranked company in metropolitan Toledo in this year’s edition of the Fortune 500. Company revenues grew 9 percent last year, and O-I comes in at No. 401 on the list. THE BLADE Buy This Image Maumee-based Dana Inc. is listed at No. 447 in the Fortune 500 list. THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Owens-Illinois Inc., which saw net revenues jump 9 percent last year, is the highest ranked company in metropolitan Toledo in this year’s edition of the Fortune 500. In all, northwest Ohio had four companies on the list, plus three more on the Fortune 1,000 list, based on annual revenues. The list, in its 63rd year and released Wednesday by Fortune magazine, is widely seen as one of the benchmarks for top-tier corporate success. “There definitely is a prestige, a credibility and a reputation that comes with being on that list,” said Wendy Gramza, president at the Toledo Regional Chamber of Commerce. Having those companies in your city also boosts the region’s credibility and reputation, she said. “Having Fortune 500 companies and specifically world headquarters in our region is extremely important,” she said. “It puts us on the global stage. It helps us to diversify our economy. We love our manufacturing jobs, but we also love the white-collar jobs that can bring in recent college grads and can bring our millennials back home.” O-I, a Perrysburg firm which makes bottles and other glass containers, moved up 17 spots on this year’s list to No. 401. Its revenues were $6.7 billion in 2016. Two other metro Toledo firms also made the 2017 Fortune 500 list. Dana Inc., with revenues of $5.8 billion, came in at No. 447, and Owens Corning, with revenues of $5.7 billion, was No. 458. Dana is based in Maumee. Owens Corning is based in downtown Toledo. Compared to the 2016 list, Dana slipped 19 spots and OC moved up 22 spots. Looking more broadly across the region, Marathon Petroleum Corp. slipped nine spots, but the Findlay oil refining and marketing firm retained the top spot in northwest Ohio at No. 51. The rankings are based on 2016 revenue calculations from Fortune, though the figures don’t always match what the companies report in their annual reports. For example, Marathon reported 2016 revenues of $63.4 billion, though Fortune pegged its revenue at $55.9 billion. In years past, Marathon officials have said the difference appeared to be because of how Fortune treats excise taxes. Marathon was Ohio’s fourth largest company by revenue. The top spot in the state went to Dublin-based Cardinal Health, whose $121.5 billion in revenue put it at No. 15 overall. Kroger (at No. 18 overall) and Procter & Gamble (No. 36 overall) rounded out Ohio’s top three. Michigan’s top ranked firms were General Motors at No. 8, Ford at No. 10, and Dow Chemical, at No. 62. Nationally, Wal-Mart held onto the top spot, with revenues of nearly $486 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was No. 2, with revenues of $224 billion. Apple Inc. rounded out the top three with revenues of $216 billion. Forbes said 20 newcomers are on this year’s list, including electric carmaker Tesla, which came in at No. 383 with revenues of $7 billion. The Toledo region had another three companies in the larger Fortune 1000 — Welltower Inc. at No. 564 with revenues of $4.3 billion, The Andersons Inc. at No. 595 with revenues of $3.9 billion, and Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. at 743 with revenues of $2.9 billion. Welltower made the biggest move of any Toledo-area company, gaining 45 spots. Contact Tyrel Linkhorn at tlinkhorn@theblade.com or 419-724-6134.

The singer performed the breezy "Pink Sunglasses" off her double album The Weight of These Wings. Related Miranda Lambert's 'The Weight of These Wings': A Track-by-Track Guide Singer-songwriter tackles breakups, booze and the future in a wildly ambitious and equally impressive double album Lambert received a sartorial assist from her country-star peers, with the entire audience inside Nashville's Music City Center donning pink shades and bopping along. The Texas native seemed to relish the opportunity to let her hair down, playing up the wooziness of the track. Written by Luke Dick, Natalie Hemby and Rodney Clawson, "Pink Sunglasses" is an escapist anthem, with the narrator blocking out life's unpleasantness with that cheap titular eyeware. "The idea was to have these Walmart rose-colored glasses that you can put on and it's a shield from the world," Dick told Rolling Stone Country earlier this year. "It'd be great to have a song where somebody uses sunglasses to turn the world off." Lambert is set to perform at CMA Music Festival in Nashville on Thursday night, as the four-day gathering of country fans gets underway. The avid animal lover will begin the morning by leading a parade of dogs into Music City.  More News Watch Miranda Lambert's Stark, Unplugged 'Tin Man' Video Miranda Lambert to Lead CMA Fest Dog Parade: Ram Report How John Moreland Became Miranda Lambert's Favorite Songwriter CMA Music Festival 2017: 20 Best Free Concerts Eric Church, Miranda Lambert Songwriter Talks Hits, Strippers All Stories Topics: CMT Music Awards Don’t Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

The shirts feature a clenched fist bearing the colors of the Palestinian flag and accuse Israel of waging an occupation of Palestinian lands.   The t-shirts have angered pro-Israel supporters, some of whom have taken to Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites to express their distaste in the outfits. Israel’s Voice, a pro-Israel advocacy group, has been urging supporters to call and email Sears to ask for an explanation of why the t-shirts, which they view as anti-Israel, are being sold. “This is wrong on so many levels. There is a difference between free speech and incitement,” the group writes on its website. “This is a subliminal message to kill Israelis and erase Israel from the map. I urge everyone who supports and cares about Israel to call Sears and demand they take it off their line. If they refuse, it is time to boycott Sears, this is not OK and it’s dangerous.” A call to Sears’ parent company, Sears Holding Corporation, seeking comment was not immediately returned. _ Update 3:33 p.m.: Following publication of this report, a Sears spokesman contacted the Washington Free Beacon to announce that the items in question are being removed from the store. “These items were being sold by a third-party seller via the Sears Marketplace. Given the feedback we’ve received, they are being removed,” the spokesman told the Free Beacon. While the items will not be sold any longer, the Sears spokesman took issue with critics singling out Sears for criticism. Items such as these also are being sold by large retail chains such as Amazon and Walmart, the spokesman said. “We believe we’re being unfairly singled out on this issue given that these same items are available on Amazon, Walmart.com, and eBay,” the spokesman said. “It’s very important to note that we serve a broad base of customers around the country and around the world, and employ people around the world, including nearly 200 in Israel.” http://freebeacon.com/culture/sears-selling-free-palestine-end-israeli-occupation-t-shirts-sparking-ire/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

I did not know these other companies were selling these shirts, so I was thinking I’d get one from Sears, but they caved. Well, just have to get one from Walmart because I do everything I can to NOT support Jeff Bezos of Amazon, not that Walmart is any better I know. Perhaps, I should do some research and find a small ma and pa selling them. Reply # 1 NWO Hatr says: June 7, 2017 at 1:33 pm I want one… even if I have to get it from Wally World. That way I can start tallying up all the jew lovers in my neighborhood. 😉 Reply Bob From Wisconsin says: June 7, 2017 at 1:13 pm Sears, one of my favorite stores! Just returned a WeedWacker under warranty. Simple and easy transaction. No problems. Good place to shop. If the jews don’t put them out of business for telling the truth. Can’t have the truth coming out! People might start to think for themselves, and that won’t be good for the jews. By the way, don’t forget to BDS Starbucks commie coffee. There are plenty of local coffee shops who deserve your business, if you must.

God, I’m so sick of listening to their same old shitty rhetoric and excuses over and over and over again for anything anti-Israel or anti-Jew. Get over yourselves!!!! No once cares! As far as erasing Israel off the map, the hypocrisy is absolutely astonishing as they have used Google Maps and Yahoo Maps to erase PALESTINE off the map as now the land is called ISRAEL and not PALESTINE. Check it for yourself. How would you feel if a bunch of Russians came here and then all of a sudden, Google and Yahoo Maps marked the US as Russia without any notice, negotiation or legal dispute. Just simply erased and replaced as though it were nothing. Now you know how the Palestinians feel. It’s called GENOCIDE! Hope all Israelis burn in Hell!

But Angie Carrier doesn’t expect the valuable building the company is leaving to be empty for long. Carrier is the city’s development services director, and part of her job is working with retailers to find suitable locations for their businesses. “There’ve been some offers made on that building, I’d probably guess somebody will close on it in the next few months,” she said of the 172,000-square-foot Kmart. “There’s been a lot of interested retail that would love to go in that location and were waiting for it to open up.” Sears Holdings Corp. spokesperson Howard Riefs confirmed Wednesday in an email to the Press that the company planned to close the Peoples Street store in early September. A liquidation sale to get rid of the remaining products and fixtures will begin June 15. “We have been strategically and aggressively evaluating our store space and productivity, and have accelerated the closing of unprofitable stores as previously announced,” he wrote, before pointing disappointed customers to the brand’s online store. The parent company, struggling through years of sales declines, have announced round after round of Kmart and Sears stores closings in the last few years. Last year, the company closed its Bristol Kmart location. Early this year, Sears stores in both Bristol and Kingsport were on the list to close. In March, amid a major restructuring for the company employing 140,000, the company admitted in an SEC filing that “substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue.” The Kmart on Stone Drive in Kingsport and the Sears at The Mall at Johnson City will remain open, for now. Though the company has not turned an annual profit since 2011, CEO Eddie Lampert said earlier this month unfair media coverage of the company’s financial trouble has hurt the brands and Sears Holdings was still “fighting like hell” to turn the corner. Most shoppers in Johnson City Wednesday said they weren’t surprised the retailer was leaving, but said they were sad to see it go. “I always say people forget Kmart,” Annette Bryant said as she came out of the store. “Their prices are good, and they’re just about the only one that still does layaway.” She added that she would consider driving to Kingsport to continue shopping at the retailer. Several of the eight shoppers interviewed said there was a noticeable lack of business at the store prior to its closing announcement, but some said that was part of what drew them there. “You don’t have to fight the huge crowds you do at Walmart,” Amy Hutcherson said. “You can get in and out quicker than you would at other places.” Linda Sams wondered what business might take over the large building after Kmart is gone. “Hopefully something good will go here,” she said, mentioning German grocery chain Trader Joe’s. "I hate to see it go. I can't remember when there hasn't been a Kmart in town. I hope something comes in here quick." Carrier said she couldn’t name the companies with interest in the location, but said some were real estate brokers and other were retailers that aren’t currently in the Johnson City market. “The ones that I have talked to and the retail consultants we work with have talked to have been new to the market,” she said. “There are a lot of businesses that would love to be in that space.” Recommended for You Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The clothing was offered for sale by a another company, Spreadshirt Collection, and included tank tops, t-shirts and hoodies featuring a variety of pro-Palestinian messages. The clothing was offered for sale through Sears Marketplace, which offers a platform for third-party sellers to offer their wares through websites managed by Sears. The designs included a clenched fist in the colors of the Palestinian flag and statements opposing the Israeli occupation. According to a statement from a Sears spokesman, the apparel was pulled from the site based on feedback the company received. “These items were being sold by a third-party seller via the Sears Marketplace,” said the statement, which was sent to JTA Tuesday afternoon. “Given the feedback we’ve received, they are being removed.” Keep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email* Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Amazon sells some of the exact same items from Spreadshirt, as well as a wide range of other pro-Palestinian merchandise. The Sears statement notes that the company serves “a broad base of customers around the country and around the world,” and that it has 200 employees in Israel.

Sandoval to lead Nevada’s transformation to a clean energy economy By Foreign Affairs Publisher  /  June 8, 2017  /  Comments Off on Industries urge Gov. Sandoval to lead Nevada’s transformation to a clean energy economy       Print       Email MIL OSI Oil Gas Energy – Source: American Wind Energy Association – Press Release/Statement: Headline: Industries urge Gov. Sandoval to lead Nevada’s transformation to a clean energy economy June 7, 2017 CARSON CITY, Nev. — National business groups representing the geothermal, solar, and wind power industries today sent a letter to Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval asking him to sign a bill, AB206, expanding the state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) to 40 percent renewable energy by 2030. “Our organizations represent thousands of leading renewable energy companies in the United States who have invested billions of dollars in the country’s growing clean energy economy,” the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), Geothermal Energy Association (GEA), and Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) wrote in the letter to Gov. Sandoval. “We stress that your signature on raising the standard will affirm the state’s position as a national clean energy leader.” Nevada’s existing RPS target calls for 25 percent renewable energy by 2025. Increasing the target consistent with AB206 would attract over $3 billion in additional investment to Nevada. Fostering greater energy diversity in the state will also create consumer savings and boost reliability. The letter goes on to highlight the benefits clean energy already brings to Nevada: “In 2014 our organizations joined you and other leaders, as well as bringing our annual conferences and trade shows to Las Vegas that year, to celebrate the multiple economic successes that renewable energy development has brought to Nevada – including well over $5.5 billion in new investment and more than 20,000 Nevada jobs associated with clean energy.” “Solar, geothermal, and wind power offer low-cost, fixed-rate pricing that protects consumers from fluctuations in the fossil fuel markets. Large in-state energy users such as Apple, Patagonia, Walmart, Switch, and the Mandalay Bay Resort and Convention Center recognize those benefits, and have all made large renewable power purchases in recent years. Nevada can continue to attract similar growing, forward-thinking companies by updating its RPS.” ### AWEA is the national trade association of the U.S. wind energy industry. We represent 1,000 member companies and over 100,000 jobs in the U.S. economy, serving as a powerful voice for how wind works for America. Members include global leaders in wind power and energy development, turbine manufacturing, and component and service suppliers. They gather each year at the Western Hemisphere’s largest wind power trade show, the AWEA WINDPOWER Conference & Exhibition, next in Chicago, Illinois, May 7-10, 2018.

Jerry Brown, left, speaks at a news conference next to Jim Wunderman, president and CEO of the Bay Area Council, at Bank of America Tower in San Francisco. Wunderman is among the roughly 30 California business leaders who are in China with Brown as he promotes his climate change agenda. Jeff Chiu, File AP Photo National Business June 07, 2017 8:27 PM California businesses join, pay for Gov. Brown's China trip By KATHLEEN RONAYNE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SACRAMENTO, Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown has company on his trip to China to further his climate change agenda: About 30 California business leaders are along for the ride to support Brown's policies and build their own business deals. The business delegation is led by the Bay Area Council business advocacy organization and includes executives at transportation and energy companies, public utility leaders, academics, investors and a top executive of the San Francisco International Airport. Most paid a fee of about $5,500 on top of their travel costs to attend four days of events, including multiple private dinners and receptions with Brown, a clean energy ministerial and meetings with Chinese business and political leaders. Brown's office declined to provide an estimate on the trip cost's for him and staff members being paid for by a nonprofit group that takes private donations. "The purpose of this is really to enable California to play a global role on an issue that's of huge global consequence," said Jim Wunderman, president of the Bay Area Council, which helps run California's trade office in China. "The governor showed a lot of appreciation about having fellow Californians take the time to go to China just for a few days." Brown's five-day trip, which ends Thursday, has generated heightened media and political attention following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. Brown has pledged California's support to continue meeting emission reduction goals laid out in the international accord. He signed a new agreement this week with China aimed at boosting green technology. It's his second trip to China. A 2013 visit was paid for by Bay Area Council delegates. But this time, a different group of businesses is paying for the visit for Brown and four of his staff members. The nonprofit California State Protocol Foundation collects private donations to fund travel and other expenses for the state's governors, with the goal of eliminating costs to taxpayers. Donations to the foundation to support Brown's activities must be regularly disclosed. Documents show labor unions, a physicians group and businesses such as Walmart gave between $25,000 and $100,000 to the foundation in 2016 to pay for Brown's travel, meals and other activities. Oakland developer John Protopappas, a longtime friend of Brown's, serves as the foundation's president. Tom Willis, an attorney for the nonprofit group, said donations were not solicited specifically for the China trip. Donations in 2017 will eventually be disclosed but are not available yet. Brown spokesman Gareth Lacy said no cost amount for the trip or estimate would be provided until the governor returns from China. Willis, of the non-profit, said he also doesn't know the cost of the trip because Brown's office hasn't asked for any money yet. Ethics experts say while there's nothing illegal or wrong with using private funds to pay for the trip or letting business executives tag along it still raises questions about who gets access to the governor. "Any elected official hears more about the hopes and dreams and concerns of those who can pay to fund trips and spend time with him," said Jessica Levinson, a professor who studies government and ethics at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But, she said, taxpayers may prefer for Brown to cover the costs without their money. "Jerry Brown's going to go on this trip, and either I'm going to pay for it as a taxpayer or corporate interests are going to pay for it," she said. While in China, Brown has met with leaders in the Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces and in Beijing, and delivered remarks at various forums. Remarks on the California-China Climate Partnership at Tsinghau University early Thursday mark Brown's final event of the trip. Executives traveling with the Bay Area Council dined with Brown on Tuesday evening and attended a Wednesday reception with the governor and Beijing Mayor Cai Qi. Its executives traveled separately from Brown and most will return Friday. The council hosted last year's Clean Energy Ministerial in San Francisco and is developing partnerships in China. "We think that working with China is a good economic strategy, particularly around clean energy," Wunderman said. Also traveling alongside Brown are California Energy Commission Chairman Bob Weisenmiller, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols and several members of their staff. Their travel is paid for by the Energy Foundation, a nonprofit group that awards grants focused on clean energy. Eric Jaffe, senior manager of strategic communications for the foundation, did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment on the cost to send those California officials to China.

Politics Get live Times analysis and follow @realdonaldtrump while watching the Comey hearing Times Community News La Cañada Valley Sun News Crime Report: Three suspects damage outdoor lighting at home, then leave once they find doors locked Carol CormaciContact Reporter May 30 Attempted burglary: 3600 block of Karen Sue Lane. A man reported that he noticed when he was in his backyard on May 29 that a dozen landscaping lights were either broken or had been damaged. He contacted his gardener and learned the lights had been intact as of the gardener’s May 24 visit, so he checked footage from his security camera. On the video, three suspects can be seen in the yard between 10:51 and 11:04 p.m. on May 24, walking the perimeter and damaging the outdoor lights. They can then be seen trying unsuccessfully to open doors into the home, where the victim was most likely asleep, according to the report, then exiting the property. The man does not believe they got in anywhere, nor does it appear anything was missing. The suspects were wearing hooded sweatshirts, pants and they appeared to have gloves on. Their faces were all covered, with only their eyes visible. June 1 Identity theft: 200 block of Starlight Crest Drive. A man reported receiving a call from an employee of a business whose name was redacted from the report. His caller advised him that someone had used his personal information to try to open credit accounts with Walmart and with an unidentified airline. The man reported that similar fraudulent attempts have been made in the past to use his ID to open accounts and believes his information was accessed when a computer database of donors to a private high school was compromised several years ago. Petty theft: 1000 block of Foothill Blvd. A business owner who noticed a discrepancy in the store’s sales receipts related to lottery tickets checked a store video that revealed a suspect reached under a store counter and took three lottery scratcher tickets at 12:36 a.m. The move was made possible after the suspect, with the help of another man, distracted the sales clerk by asking if there were other sandwiches available beyond what they were seeing. While the clerk was turned away, one swept in and scooped up the tickets and put them into one of his pockets. The men, described as Latinos in their 20s, tried to purchase food with a credit card that was declined, so they then paid cash for the food items before leaving the premises. carol.cormaci@latimes.com Twitter: @CarolCormaci Copyright © 2017, La Cañada Valley Sun Theft Mother bear and cub pursued by coyotes return to hunker down in La Cañada canyon Class of 2017 bids adieu to La Cañada High ‘My dad really loved this city’: La Cañada pays tribute to Dave Spence Local Sports Politics Entertainment Opinion Most Popular Place An Ad 62°

The shirts feature a clenched fist bearing the colors of the Palestinian flag and accuse Israel of waging an occupation of Palestinian lands.   The t-shirts have angered pro-Israel supporters, some of whom have taken to Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites to express their distaste in the outfits. Israel’s Voice, a pro-Israel advocacy group, has been urging supporters to call and email Sears to ask for an explanation of why the t-shirts, which they view as anti-Israel, are being sold. “This is wrong on so many levels. There is a difference between free speech and incitement,” the group writes on its website. “This is a subliminal message to kill Israelis and erase Israel from the map. I urge everyone who supports and cares about Israel to call Sears and demand they take it off their line. If they refuse, it is time to boycott Sears, this is not OK and it’s dangerous.” A call to Sears’ parent company, Sears Holding Corporation, seeking comment was not immediately returned. _ Update 3:33 p.m.: Following publication of this report, a Sears spokesman contacted the Washington Free Beacon to announce that the items in question are being removed from the store. “These items were being sold by a third-party seller via the Sears Marketplace. Given the feedback we’ve received, they are being removed,” the spokesman told the Free Beacon. While the items will not be sold any longer, the Sears spokesman took issue with critics singling out Sears for criticism. Items such as these also are being sold by large retail chains such as Amazon and Walmart, the spokesman said. “We believe we’re being unfairly singled out on this issue given that these same items are available on Amazon, Walmart.com, and eBay,” the spokesman said. “It’s very important to note that we serve a broad base of customers around the country and around the world, and employ people around the world, including nearly 200 in Israel.” http://freebeacon.com/culture/sears-selling-free-palestine-end-israeli-occupation-t-shirts-sparking-ire/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

As far as erasing Israel off the map, the hypocrisy is absolutely astonishing as they have used Google Maps and Yahoo Maps to erase PALESTINE off the map as now the land is called ISRAEL and not PALESTINE. Check it for yourself. How would you feel if a bunch of Russians came here and then all of a sudden, Google and Yahoo Maps marked the US as Russia without any notice, negotiation or legal dispute. Just simply erased and replaced as though it were nothing. Now you know how the Palestinians feel. It’s called GENOCIDE! Hope all Israelis burn in Hell!

Brown's China trip By KATHLEEN RONAYNE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SACRAMENTO, Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown has company on his trip to China to further his climate change agenda: About 30 California business leaders are along for the ride to support Brown's policies and build their own business deals. The business delegation is led by the Bay Area Council business advocacy organization and includes executives at transportation and energy companies, public utility leaders, academics, investors and a top executive of the San Francisco International Airport. Most paid a fee of about $5,500 on top of their travel costs to attend four days of events, including multiple private dinners and receptions with Brown, a clean energy ministerial and meetings with Chinese business and political leaders. Brown's office declined to provide an estimate on the trip cost's for him and staff members being paid for by a nonprofit group that takes private donations. "The purpose of this is really to enable California to play a global role on an issue that's of huge global consequence," said Jim Wunderman, president of the Bay Area Council, which helps run California's trade office in China. "The governor showed a lot of appreciation about having fellow Californians take the time to go to China just for a few days." Brown's five-day trip, which ends Thursday, has generated heightened media and political attention following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. Brown has pledged California's support to continue meeting emission reduction goals laid out in the international accord. He signed a new agreement this week with China aimed at boosting green technology. It's his second trip to China. A 2013 visit was paid for by Bay Area Council delegates. But this time, a different group of businesses is paying for the visit for Brown and four of his staff members. The nonprofit California State Protocol Foundation collects private donations to fund travel and other expenses for the state's governors, with the goal of eliminating costs to taxpayers. Donations to the foundation to support Brown's activities must be regularly disclosed. Documents show labor unions, a physicians group and businesses such as Walmart gave between $25,000 and $100,000 to the foundation in 2016 to pay for Brown's travel, meals and other activities. Oakland developer John Protopappas, a longtime friend of Brown's, serves as the foundation's president. Tom Willis, an attorney for the nonprofit group, said donations were not solicited specifically for the China trip. Donations in 2017 will eventually be disclosed but are not available yet. Brown spokesman Gareth Lacy said no cost amount for the trip or estimate would be provided until the governor returns from China. Willis, of the non-profit, said he also doesn't know the cost of the trip because Brown's office hasn't asked for any money yet. Ethics experts say while there's nothing illegal or wrong with using private funds to pay for the trip or letting business executives tag along it still raises questions about who gets access to the governor. "Any elected official hears more about the hopes and dreams and concerns of those who can pay to fund trips and spend time with him," said Jessica Levinson, a professor who studies government and ethics at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Feb 01, 2017 Asia-Pacific China Europe Latin America North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote In a political environment skewed by fake news and “alternative facts,” the real impact of President Donald Trump’s policies is easily obscured. At the recent Tarnopol Dean’s Lecture Series on the Trump administration and the economy, Wharton experts offered their unvarnished take on the impact of these policies on the capital markets, the dollar, economic growth and job creation — and backed them with analysis based on data. After closing above 20,000 for the first time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been giving back some of its gains of late amid a flurry of Trump mandates: escalation of a trade war with Mexico, anchored by a 20% tariff on its goods; making good on a promise to exit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in Asia; and instituting a temporary immigration ban on seven mainly Muslim countries that could hurt the quality of the U.S. workforce — especially in Silicon Valley — among others. Initially, the Dow was buoyed by Trump’s proposal to substantially cut corporate taxes, roll back many regulations and spend on infrastructure. “Investors and businesses very much like the Republican agenda. Notice I didn’t say the Trump agenda,” says Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel. “Why do they like the Republican agenda? Lower corporate taxes, less regulation, lower taxes on interest and dividend income. All that is very, very good for investors.” Siegel lays out the bull case: “If there’s a significant corporate tax cut, and most people expect there to be one, that could add 10% to earnings in and of itself. So that alone, you could say, could give 10% to the stock market. In addition, you have a cut back in regulations, which is something again that both investors and businesses want, that could be another boost that some people say could be worth 10%.” He notes that those projections do not even include potential gains from infrastructure spending. “If there’s a significant corporate tax cut … that could add 10% to earnings in and of itself. So that alone, you could say, could give 10% to the stock market.” –Jeremy Siegel However, U.S. stocks have been whipsawed lately by Trump’s other orders. “What the market doesn’t like is most of the Trump agenda that is not part of the Republican agenda — clearly, big tariffs on imports, such moves as restricting immigration in a significant way, currency wars — anything like that is very anti-Republican,” Siegel says. The market has moved up “cautiously” because it is yet unsure whether Trump will follow the Republican path all the way. “I’m not going to put all my marbles there yet because anything can happen under Trump.” The bear case is that the economy will take a big drubbing if trade wars break out. Siegel says that many Republicans believe the high Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the 1930s that taxed thousands of imported goods led to the Great Depression. While Siegel himself — along with most macroeconomists — does not agree with that premise (believing the cause was monetary collapse and the Federal Reserve’s inaction), if protectionism does break out globally, it would be disastrous depending on its magnitude. “If there is a trade war, the market would react extremely negatively,” he says. “We’d be down 10% to 15%.” Coming Trade War? Wharton international management professor Mauro Guillen says protectionism is a “terrible idea.” Trade barriers have been enacted in the recent past, such as President Nixon levying a 10% tariff across the board in the early 1970s. “Every time you’re introducing protectionism, you’re hurting the consumer.” There’s also the issue of substitution. If a 20% tariff on Mexican goods was put in place, it is not certain that people would automatically buy more products that are made in America. “Some consumers and companies will say, instead of buying from Mexico, I’m going to buy from an American-based producer, or they could go to China or Indonesia, or Costa Rica,” Guillen adds. “It’s not clear how the issue is going to play out.” Moreover, many U.S. companies will have to scramble to adapt quickly to a major shift in rules. “Many other companies that source components from China will be caught off guard,” Guillen says. “They’ve been doing business, they’ve been making investments, they’ve been making decisions for a long time assuming a certain set of rules. Now, if those rules change overnight, they’re going to find themselves in a very difficult situation.” Sponsored Content: Guillen further questions the rationale behind choosing to launch a trade war with Mexico, whose exports make up about 10% to 12% of the U.S. trade deficit. “Why pick a fight with Mexico? … The problem is broader than that.” He also points out that the 18% devaluation in the Mexican peso — since Trump won the election — could offset the 20% proposed tariff. Overall, Guillen says the larger question for Trump and his policies is this: “What are you trying to accomplish?” When it comes to trade, Siegel explains that Trump’s point is to level the playing field. “We let their goods in, but they don’t let our goods in. Or they put much more restrictions on our exports than we do on their exports. It is true if we get those countries to accept more of our exports, actually both of us would be better off. … We didn’t push hard enough” to get into their markets. However, Guillen points out these trade imbalances might be true for China, but not Mexico. “There is free trade both ways.” There is talk of instituting a “border adjustment” to further boost U.S. trade, says Siegel. The rule exempts exports of U.S. companies from taxes, but also reduces the deductions they can take on imports to lower taxable income. “This is a huge subsidy to exports, a huge tax on imports and every economist says that will cause the dollar to be stronger.” Siegel says some models see the dollar appreciating by as much as the actual corporate tax rate if the full terms of the border adjustment is adopted and the impact would be “mammoth.” Since the U.S. still imports more than it exports, he believes the net impact of this move will be to boost revenue. U.S. companies that make goods domestically and sell them abroad will be winners while big importers like Walmart are the losers. “The EU did not figure out exactly when to stop [centralizing decisions] and where to let in enough [national] decision-making.” –Mauro Guillen The dollar could appreciate by about 25% if the corporate tax rate fell to 20%, and the real value of imports and exports will be unaffected as exchange rates fluctuate, adds Kent Smetters, Wharton professor of business economics and public policy who was deputy assistant secretary for economic policy under President George W. Bush. (Siegel disagrees because he says it does not take into account global capital flows.) “But here’s the issue. Even though this creates a level playing field with France and other European countries that have a territorial VAT [value added tax], getting that through the WTO [World Trade Organization] — that will be the fight,” Smetters says. Some European companies get a VAT refund. Smetters says that back then, the Clinton administration instituted its own form of border adjustment, which the Bush administration inherited. However, the lawyer-stocked WTO ruled that it was illegal, he adds. “The lawyers understand statutory incidents” and have less insight into economic policies. European Tensions Europe is facing some deep divisions over economic and immigration policies as well. “Differences in opinion are getting bigger and bigger,” Guillen says. “On top of that comes Brexit [British exit from the European Union] but the most worrying is you do have populist parties, and their [support] is growing” in the upcoming European elections. These parties tend to be anti-immigrant and favor leaving the EU. Add to the conflagration the Italian banking crisis, a worsening situation in Greece and a youth jobless rate in some European nations of 45%. At least, the people who voted for Brexit got one thing right. “There’s this dogma in Brussels [EU headquarters] that more integration in Europe is the solution to every problem. I personally believe that’s not the case,” Guillen says. “The EU did not figure out exactly when to stop [centralizing decisions] and where to let in enough [national] decision-making.” Sharing one currency — over half of EU members use the euro — complicates the matter. However, Siegel believes no country will be leaving the Eurozone – the group that shares the currency. “If Greece didn’t leave the euro, no one’s leaving the euro. The idea is ludicrous that these [populist] parties in Italy are going to lead them out of the euro. The Italians remember the Italian lira [which at one point was trading at 2,500 to the U.S. dollar].” He notes that “if it weren’t for the immigration issue, there wouldn’t be Brexit.” Immigration Reform In the U.S., illegal immigration was a key issue for the Trump campaign. Trump has pledged to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to stem the flow of undocumented workers and somehow make Mexico also pay for it. But an analysis by Smetters actually shows that deporting these workers — estimated between 11 million and 12 million overall — would hurt the U.S. economy. “Undocumented workers tend to take on lower wage jobs. … That forces native-born workers to, in fact, trade up in terms of their education, in terms of their skillset.” –Kent Smetters Trump’s plan assumes that if these workers were deported, native-born workers would take over these jobs. “That’s just simply not empirically true,” Smetters says. “When you export undocumented workers, those [typically low-skilled] jobs really aren’t replaced by native born workers” but by automation. Moreover, the presence of undocumented workers raises the wages of those who can legally work in the U.S. “Undocumented workers tend to take on lower wage jobs that don’t require English and that don’t require as much social skills. That forces native-born workers to, in fact, trade up in terms of their education, in terms of their skillset.” Smetters adds that while undocumented workers tend to have lower skill levels, a third of legal immigrants have college degrees. Guillen says immigration overall drives innovation, with immigrants launching 24% of all tech ventures in the U.S. over the past two decades. “That speaks volumes about the dynamism of immigrants at the high end and low end.” Smetters does see Trump softening his stance on immigration once he builds his long-promised Mexican wall. “If he gets that political win … everything will be more negotiable.” Ironically, the Trump proposal that could get plenty of political headwinds might be the issue of infrastructure spending. Wharton Dean Geoffrey Garrett, who moderated the talk, surmised that hardline Republicans wouldn’t want to run up the deficit while Democrats wouldn’t want to help a major Trump initiative. Smetters says one answer is to focus on repairing existing infrastructure instead of building new ones. “Repairs have the highest ROI [return on investment],” he says, noting that more than 400 Pennsylvania bridges need inspection in the next two years. If they fall into disrepair, “the disruption to transportation there could be very large.” Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "How Will Trump’s Policies Affect the U.S. Economy?."

The real reason there can even be real sustainable growth in the first place is to institute (or threaten) policies that will bring back jobs to America. The only way US economy can start growing again is to bring back jobs. This will spur on the secondary markets. Trump’s agenda is the only one that will be able to do that. The rest of the analysis is simply academic of lower taxes. Cold and hard decisions are required. It is wishful thinking to suggest that the economy can have sustainable growth without trade wars. Dave Woods The last thing we want is to bring back jobs as we knew them. With our relatively small US population, we want to help create the integration and project management roles of the future, and open our borders to create win-win relationships for service and trade roles, which we clearly need. Je Ya I would like to respond because you are a Professor and assume you are a US Citizen. President Trump, your alumni, never wants to star a trade war. He always wants a fair trade。for example, if a country charges US products 70% tarrif but US charges theirs zero tarrif, who started trade war? Trump wants to charge 70% tarrif to match theirs, is this a fair trade or trade war? If your answer is latter, it only tells that you are not US citizen, or a US traitor, or the other country’s spy. Am I right? I am not a professor but a normal US citizen who know right and wrong. Je Ya Without logics or with twisted mind to force US citizens to believe you is why Hilary lost and Democratic Party lost in entire country legal systems from President, supremium court judge, senate, house, governors and there will be more and more loses to Democratic Party. If you want to win back, first you must love America from your heart. We do not see it from any Democratic leaders and members. Love is not from your mouth, is from your heart and action. You do not love America but Trump does. This article you wrote is another evidence that you do not love America! We see it crystal clear. Edward Dodson One of the great statements in defense of free trade was written in the late 19th century by the American political economist Henry George. However, his analysis went far deeper than to merely point out the counter-productive impact of tariffs, quotas and other such restrictions. George spent the last three decades of his life fighting against landed (i.e., rentier) privilege. Under the conditions then existing (little changed today) the benefits of free trade would be captured by the rentiers as increases in the asking price for land, natural resources and land-like assets (i.e., those best described as “natural monopolies,” such as the broadcast spectrum). Yes, we do need comprehensive restructuring of how government at all levels raises revenue. Reduction in the tax rate imposed on the value of actual capital goods (i.e., buildings, machinery, technologies) is the right public policy. Reduction in the tax rate imposed on income earned producing goods or providing services is also the right public policy. We want to encourage investment in capital goods and in the delivery of high quality services. Taxes on these assets and activities imposes significant deadweight losses on economic output. Rents, on the other hand, result from aggregate investment in public infrastructure and amenities. As economists generally acknowledge, the taxation of rents not only imposes zero deadweight loss on output, the exact opposite occurs. A near-100% tax on the potential annual rental value of locations and other natural monopolies makes it financially expensive to hold such assets out of production. Land parcels in towns and cities would very quickly be developed to highest, best use. Speculation in land would no longer divert large amounts of financial reserves from more productive use. Jacquie Kangas Image and brand do matter. First impressions count for embedded impressions. The first four paragraphs of this article warn potential readers not to waste their time reading any further. It is fake news. Fake News and Alternative Facts Let’s be perfectly clear which outlets are sprouting fake news: Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, ABC, and NBC, and late comer, Knowledge at Wharton, who daily skew and obscure the real news. Market Giving Back Some of its Gains Since President Trump’ inauguration, market capitalization has increased by over $3 trillion. Fortunes have been made in that short time and businesses have benefited; albeit, all intelligent people know it will turn. To suggest that the market is giving back some of its gains amid a flurry of Trump mandates is absurd. His mandates have been alive and well since he first stepped out on to the hustings two years ago. The odd daily losses don’t even register on a gain of over $3 trillion. Trade With Mexico The U.S. trade deficit with Mexico at the end of 2016 was an astonishing $63 billion. Mexicans living in the U.S. sent $25 billion in U.S remittances to Mexico in 2015. The tally for 2016 is expected to be over $28 billion. The cost of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be $113 billion a year. Most of those illegal immigrants are from Mexico. So does a small part of the increase in the market have anything to do with new trade and immigration treatment for Mexico. Absolutely. Is it imperative that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico change. Absolutely. Escalation of a Trade War with Mexico? There is no trade war with Mexico. The policies to capture President Trump’s initiatives haven’t even been finalized yet. Trans-Pacific Partnership If your “academics” had bothered to read the, thankfully, now defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership, they would understand that it would have been an expansion of NAFTA and one-way trade and job losses out of America. More significantly, they would have understood that loose and open wording around human rights and foreign, oversight committees would have resulted in loss of American sovereignty, key issues that are tearing apart the EU. Temporary Immigration Ban Could Hurt the Quality of the U.S. Workforce, particularly Silicon Valley? The temporary immigration ban (blocked by lower-court judges who should have no jurisdiction over immigration) is a proposed ninety-day moratorium on immigration from seven Muslim countries to give the Trump Administration time to work out a common-sense and fair policy for the benefit of Americans and to keep them safe. The list of countries is the same list that the Obama Administration used for the same purposes. The countries include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In 2012, there were only 781,235 U.S. residents who were born in these countries – just 2% of all immigrants – and most of them immigrated long ago, so the outcry over a 90-day restriction is nothing short of overblown, agenda-driven, cry-me-a-river, political angling. Is Knowledge at Wharton seriously attempting to have us believe that a 90-day ban on immigration from these countries will hurt the quality of the U.S. workforce, particularly Silicon Valley. Libya? Somalia? Sudan? Yemen? 90 days? Are you kidding us? I challenge this author to come up with how many recent immigrants from these countries are in significant jobs in Silicon Valley. I have no doubt that he/she will find out that most of any recent immigrants or guest workers in Silicon Valley come from India, a country equally intent on controlling unvetted Muslim immigration. The truth, of course, is that an end to immigration from any of these seven countries won’t have the slightest adverse consequences on the American workforce, generally, or Silicon Valley. The truth is that Silicon Valley is afraid that any immigration or visa restrictions might cut into its ability to pay guest workers far less than they should be paid or that they would have to pay American workers. Immigrants from these countries are far more likely to suck up taxpayers’ funds in the form of welfare payments; and as has been shown in EU studies, the reliance on welfare extends and even grows in future generations. The stock market has risen on anticipation of the return of jobs and manufacturing to the U.S. buoyed by actual business deals and initiatives struck since Donald Trump was elected, massive, impending tax cuts for businesses and individuals, the elimination of extraneous, bureaucratic and extremely costly regulations, a conducive U.S. business environment for both entrepreneurs and larger companies, the repatriation of overseas U.S. funds, the potential for a win/win trade relationships with Mexico and other countries, an efficient, fair, and profitable healthcare system, etc. — all Trump initiatives. Mexico will eventually come to the table to work out a win/win trade deal. It has no choice; it relies on the U.S. Investors and Businesses like the Republican Agenda So says professor of finance, Jeremy Siegal, who is cowardly quick to point out that he’s talking about the Republican Agenda not the Trump Agenda, then rattles off — you’ve guessed it — the Trump Agenda. Has he ever run a business himself, I wonder. Summary The first four paragraphs of this article warns that the article is highly likely to be biased, lopsided, unbalanced, selective, inaccurate, and far below the standards one expects from an academic institution. Accordingly I have elected not to read any more of it.

Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page Denton police have filed three more charges against Earl Leroy Thompson Jr., who has been arrested in connection to multiple sexual assaults and attempted sexual assaults in the city. Earl Leroy Thompson Jr. Courtesy photo Thompson, 32, now faces three additional first-degree felony charges of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit a felony. On Friday, he was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted burglary of a habitation with intent to commit a felony. He is currently in Denton County Jail for all five charges, and his bond now totals $525,000. Thompson had confessed to investigators about his involvement in three burglaries in February and May where he intended to commit sexual assaults, police said. In a Denton police arrest affidavit, investigators outlined numerous reports of Thompson peering through apartment windows and prowling around apartment complexes from April 30 to May 31. Police also believe Thompson, a custodian at University of North Texas from September 2013 until last month, is connected to an attempted sexual assault on May 3. In that incident, a woman said a man matching Thompson's description attempted to sexually assault her at her apartment in the 1600 block of West Oak Street. Police believe Thompson could be connected to at least two other similar assault reports that occurred in October and February, according to his arrest affidavit.  Police charged Thompson with burglary with intent to commit a felony, which is a first-degree felony, partially because the maximum punishment is more severe than a sexual assault charge, which is a second-degree felony. Other reports 2600 block of North Mayhill Road — Denton police arrested a 17-year-old man on a marijuana possession charge Tuesday after he reportedly recorded himself on Snapchat threatening other teenagers with a handgun, according to Denton police spokesman Bryan Cose. Snapchat is a mobile application that allows a user to send videos and pictures to contacts. Cose said the suspect initially contacted a group of 17-year-olds in a Wal-Mart parking lot in the 1500 block of South Loop 288. The suspect's ex-girlfriend was in the group, and he started threatening to fight her new boyfriend before threatening to shoot her, Cose said. After the threats, the group drove to a nearby Hobby Lobby parking lot, where the man continued to threaten other members of the group, Cose said. He reportedly pointed a handgun at one of the group members and posted it on Snapchat before leaving the scene. Cose said Denton police were provided a screenshot of the video. While none of the members of the group wanted to press charges for the threats, Denton police later pulled the suspect over while he was driving in the 2600 block of Mayhill Road. Police did not find a weapon during a search of his vehicle, but they found less than two ounces of marijuana, Cose said. He was taken to Denton City Jail on the drug charge. 700 block of Fort Worth Drive — A Whataburger customer received a reckless damage citation on Tuesday after breaking a glass door while walking out of the business about 3 p.m., according to police. No arrests were made. The report did not include further information. 2300 block of Bernard Street — Denton police arrested a 27-year-old man on a charge of unlicensed carrying of a weapon Tuesday after he was found unconscious with his feet in the roadway, according to a report. Someone reported the unconscious man at around noon because they were afraid a vehicle would run over his feet, the report said. After police contacted the man, they took him to Denton City Jail on the unlicensed carrying of a firearm. Roundup From 7 a.m. Tuesday to 7 a.m. Wednesday: The Denton County Sheriff's Office handled 829 service and officer-initiated calls for the agencies it serves, and 34 people were booked into Denton County Jail. Denton firefighters responded to 25 medical calls, four vehicle crashes and one passenger vehicle fire. Denton police posted 22 reports online.

Nicaragua did not sign the agreement largely because it felt the agreement is not an adequate solution to global warming. Syria is not involved because of civil war and travel sanctions imposed on its leaders. However, the United States, a primary architect of the agreement, withdrew for largely political reasons. Yes, we are exceptional, i.e., in a category unto ourselves. The alleged net loss of U.S. jobs, caused by the agreement, is fictional. Of course, jobs in fossil fuels will probably decline; however, that will happen anyway due to economics – and we should help those impacted. Renewable energy resources, especially solar and wind, have become cost-competitive when compared with fossil fuels. Huge numbers of new jobs will result if we can avoid more unwise political decisions. Witness the 1,100-acre solar farm now being constructed in Chambers County, largely at the behest of Walmart, which “has a goal to be supplied by 100 percent renewable energy.” (Recall that retired Walmart CEO Rob Walton, founder Sam Walton’s son, is a leader in the Climate Leadership Council, an organization of well-known Republicans concerned about human-caused climate change.) Renewable energy is here and growing. Alabama and the United States should aggressively join in.
