Gal Gadot's arrival in "Man's World" in this summer's Wonder Woman remains a couple of months away, but she's sent some advance scouts to prepare for her arrival, with the merchandising program for the next DC Entertainment/Warner Bros. movie already ramping up in stores. Ahead of the movie's release, Warner Bros. Consumer Products has teamed with Mattel to create a line of Wonder Woman toys, debuting Friday in a first-to-market release at Wal-Mart stores nationwide, as well as on Walmart.com. As part of the monthlong program, which ends April 28, Wal-Mart will offer WW-inspired dolls and toys, including an exclusive two-pack set of Wonder Woman and love interest Steve Trevor. A further exclusive rollout of WW toys will follow in May, with products by Jakks Pacific, Funko and Fisher-Price. Additionally, Wonder Woman merchandise from licensees including The Lego Group, Rubie’s Costumes, Bioworld, New Era, Hallmark and more will launch wide through multiple retailers internationally April 7. "We’re thrilled to bring Wonder Woman front and center to retailers worldwide in support of her first solo feature film," Warner Bros. Consumer Products president Pam Lifford said in a statement. "WBCP has developed an incredible assortment of trend-right products in collaboration with our best-in-class licensees, allowing fans of all ages to express their fandom and bring Wonder Woman's empowerment, inspiration and beauty to life." Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman opens in theaters June 2.

Hunt, Sam Walton, Alice Walton, Don Tyson and Pauline Whitaker built a strong foundation of leadership and philanthropy for the region, Larry Young, CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, told a crowd of about 800 on Thursday evening (March 30). “Northwest Arkansas is a place where giving back is part of the fabric of your community,” he said. Young spoke at the 26th annual Boys and Girls Club of Benton County (BGCBC) Youth of the Year Celebration at John Q. Hammons Center in Rogers, which helped raise awareness for the Club and celebrated accomplishments of the Club’s youth. The evening was hosted by Andy Barron, executive vice president for softlines and general merchandise, Walmart U.S., and Charles Redfield, executive vice president for food, Walmart U.S. The BGCBC “serves school-aged children in the NWA area, providing out-of-school youth development and family support programs, which support in-school learning, promote health and wellness, develop honorable character and leadership and mediate emergent family needs,” according to their website. Young shared his story of being a “club” kid since 1959 when he attended the Boys Club in Springfield, Mo. He said his time there shaped him into the man he is today, and he cited three life lessons that he learned. “First, I learned that I didn’t have to be a product of my environment,” Young said. “There’s a reason I’m a believer in the American dream and it’s because I’m proof.” He said his world as a child was mostly back-breaking work on his father’s farm, but the Club opened a world of possibilities for him. Fernanda Alcantara, Boys and Girls Club of Benton County 2017 Youth of the Year winner, speaks to the crowd. Alcantara also won the state title. “Without the Club, I might never have recognized the possibilities that were beyond those wooden fences. The Club widened my perspective, introduced me to great friends and gave me role models to inspired me to do more and to want more for myself,” Young said. Second, Young said the Club taught him to “swing for the fences and punch above my weight.” Today the Club emphasizes academic excellence, character, citizenship and a healthy lifestyle. But back in the 1950s, Young said, the stress was on “the three B’s – basketball, boxing and billards.” “Basketball taught me drive, billards taught me strategy and boxing taught me the importance of taking risk, no matter the size or skill of my opponent,” Young said. “All these activities helped me build character, confidence and leadership. They also helped me decide for myself what I could achieve, regardless of what others thought I was capable of.” Young used this life lesson when Dr Pepper Snapple Group spun off Cadbury Schweppes during the economic decline in 2008. “Back then the naysayers said we didn’t stand a chance. They thought we’d be annihilated. Lots of companies went under. Many thought we would, as well,” Young said. “But we didn’t go to survive. We went to thrive. That’s punching above your weight.” Young said the final thing the Club taught him was the importance of paying it forward. “It has been five decades since I first stepped into that Boys Club, but I remember the people who gave their time to me like it was yesterday,” Young said. He told of three men who taught him lessons on being a great team manager, looking for opportunities in the ring and helping him see the big picture beyond the end of a cue stick. “From them I learned that you build your future with your hands, your mind and your heart,” Young said. “These three men, each of whom had their own lives, families and careers, reached a hand back to me to propel me forward. The value of that is beyond measure and something I’m grateful for every single day.” Young then introduced Fernanda Alcantara, the Boys and Girls Club of Benton County 2017 Youth of the Year and winner of the 2017 Arkansas State title. The Youth of the Year is the highest honor a Boys and Girls Club member can achieve. The winner is chosen because they have overcome personal challenges and shown “outstanding leadership, academic excellence and dedication to making healthy life choices.” Alcantara told the audience of moving to the United States from Mexico when she was four years old and of the personal and financial struggles her family experienced as a result of her father leaving the family. She said the Club became her safe haven throughout her childhood. “While my dad’s absence left me feeling unwanted, the Club opened up their doors, ears and their hearts for me,” Alcantara said. “They’ve given me the confidence to succeed as the leader I am today.” Alcantara is Keystone president, student body president, and in the National Honor Society. She plans on becoming a trauma surgeon in order to work with Doctors Without Borders. She would also like to work for minorities in the political arena. Alcantara said she sees the youth of America persevering the same way she has and believes they will also succeed. “Our background does not determine where we end up,” Alcantara said. “Only you determine that. You get to write your own story. We are not our past. We are not the color of our skin. We are not our politics. We are not a test score. We are potential, waiting to be unleashed,” she said.

Rural Americans turn to disability as jobs dry up Apple, Wal-Mart stick with climate promise Decisions come after Trump shaves U.S. policies Video Photo Bloomberg Emissions rise from the Dominion Resources Inc. Mount Storm Generating Station in Mount Storm, W. Va., in January. By Bloomberg News Apr 1, 2017 at 11:02 am | Print View Many of America’s biggest corporations including Apple and Wal-Mart Stores are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. “This work is embedded in our business,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win, too.” Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. “Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real,” Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. “They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does.” Business’s biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” General Electric’s CEO Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. “We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.” Mars, the maker of M&Ms, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation confirmed a sighting of Thomas, 15, and Cummins, 50, at a Walmart in Oklahoma City. The two were captured on surveillance video walking into the Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City March 15. Authorities said Cummins bought several items with cash, but nothing of significance. The surveillance images are the first anyone has seen of Thomas and Cummins since they left Columbia March 13. Thomas appeared to have darkened his hair, and Thomas looked like she had red hair in the photos, investigators said. Investigators say Cummins, who was Thomas's teacher in Columbia, Tenn., used his influence as a teacher to groom Thomas for possible sexual exploitation. He was suspended from his job after a student reportedly saw Cummins and Thomas kiss in a classroom. Cummins faces kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor charges.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News Top WBENC Consumer Companies Join Together for the First Time in Collective Initiative to Source from Women-Owned Businesses BENTONVILLE, Ark., Mar. 30 /CSRwire/ – Walmart announced today that they are one of nine corporations joining in a collaborative effort to track and report sourcing from self-identified and certified women-owned businesses (WOBs) over the next five years. This marks the first time the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the largest third-party certifier of businesses owned, controlled and operated by women in the U.S., will launch a formal initiative to publicly report aggregated spending on WOBs. Walmart helped form this unified front of major corporations, including Campbell Soup Company, The Coca-Cola Company, ExxonMobil, General Mills, Johnson & Johnson, Mondelēz International, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, in order to create a more visible movement and raise awareness for the importance of sourcing from women-owned businesses. Walmart made the announcement on behalf of the other companies involved and WBENC at Walmart’s Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) Summit in Washington, D.C., a convening of leaders from business, government, NGOs and academia to discuss and celebrate the achievements of women’s empowerment. “Creating economic opportunity and growth is central to who we are as a company,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. “We are proud to be part of this important initiative, and together we can make an even bigger impact in elevating these successful women-owned businesses. Our customers care where products are sourced, and we believe supporting women-owned businesses helps us put innovative products on our shelves while helping these businesses thrive and grow.” “Campbell is proud to join this collaborative effort in order to raise awareness and foster more opportunities for female business owners,” said Denise Morrison, president and CEO, Campbell Soup Company. “One of the core values of our company is to ‘seek the power of different’ and we are committed to assemble a supplier base that reflects the diversity of the consumers and communities we serve.” “Empowering women entrepreneurs and women-owned firms is smart business and smart economics,” said Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. “Whenever you do the right thing and give businesswomen a real opportunity to compete, this creates a positive ripple effect that allows her to strengthen her company, her family and her community. And stronger families and communities help fuel more growth and opportunity.” “Women and minority-owned businesses are critical to both their communities and our company as they spur economic development and drive growth,” said Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz International. “We are proud to support this important initiative, as we continue to strive for inclusion and diversity in our company and women’s empowerment around the world.” „Supporting women-owned businesses and diversity across our suppliers is central to who we are at PepsiCo,” said Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. “Our commitment to diversity is not only a source of pride, it is a source of strength. And it’s part of our broader commitment to what we call Performance with Purpose, our approach to building a healthier, sustainable future for all our stakeholders — from our suppliers to our shareholders to our consumers, customers, employees, and the communities we serve.” „P&G is committed to Gender Equality,” said Carolyn Tastad, group president of P&G’s North America business. „Supplier Diversity has been an important business strategy at P&G in the United States for more than 40 years. We are proud to join this initiative to empower women-owned businesses, as we believe in the power of economic inclusion. When the ownership of our supply base reflects the diversity of our employees, consumers, and stakeholders, our business grows and our community thrives.” “By participating in this initiative, these companies will help fuel innovation and growth for women-owned businesses across the U.S.,” said Pamela Prince-Eason, president and CEO of WBENC. “With women-owned businesses currently supporting the creation or maintenance of 23 million American jobs, investing in their growth means investing in more opportunities for the workforce overall.” The initiative comes at a critical time when women entrepreneurs across a range of countries report having smaller and less diverse networks, leaving them at a disadvantage for growth, innovation and ability to be relevant to a global market (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor). Walmart helped to recruit this initial group of corporations to take part in this initiative and is encouraging others to join as well. This announcement comes on the heels of the culmination of Walmart’s five-year Global WEE Initiative, which included a set of goals to help empower women around the world through sourcing, training and supporting diversity and inclusion. As part of the WEE Initiative, Walmart sourced $20 billion from women-owned businesses in the U.S. and increased sourcing from women-owned businesses internationally. Additionally, in 2014, working with WBENC and WEConnect International, a global network that connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers around the world, Walmart helped fund the creation of the “Women-Owned” logo which can be used by any woman-owned supplier certified by those organizations at any retailer to highlight their products to consumers. Today, Walmart has more than 1,500 suppliers who identify as women-owned businesses, producing everything from apparel to produce. In addition to participating in this collective initiative, Walmart announced plans to launch a Knowledge Center that will house the key tools, resources, learnings and achievements of the WEE Initiative and help serve as a guide for any company or institution in their work to empower women.

By Daisuke Wakabayashi New York Times  April 03, 2017 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic, or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Advertisement Google engineers, product managers, and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Advertisers may tolerate use of a racial epithet in a hip-hop video, for example, but may be horrified to see it used in a video from a racist skinhead group. That ads bought by well-known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTube’s business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as The Times of London and other outlets have written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising — a byproduct of a system in which YouTube shares a portion of ad sales with the creators of the content those ads appear against. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here This glitch in the company’s giant, automated process turned into a public-relations nightmare. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Google’s display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again. Consumers watch more than a billion hours on YouTube every day, making it the dominant video platform on the Internet and an obvious beneficiary as advertising money moves online from television. But the recent problems opened Google to criticism that it was not doing enough to look out for advertisers. It is a significant problem for a multibillion-dollar company that still gets most of its revenue through advertising. “We take this as seriously as we’ve ever taken a problem,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in an interview last week. “We’ve been in emergency mode.” Advertisement During the last two weeks, Google has changed what types of videos can carry advertising, barring ads from appearing with hate speech or discriminatory content. In addition, Google is simplifying how advertisers can exclude specific sites, channels, and videos across YouTube and Google’s display network. It is allowing brands to fine-tune the types of content they want to avoid, such as “sexually suggestive” or “sensational/bizarre” videos. It is also putting in more stringent safety standards by default, so an advertiser must choose to place ads next to more provocative content. Google created an expedited way to alert it when ads appear next to offensive content. The Silicon Valley giant is trying to reassure companies like Unilever, the world’s second-largest advertiser, with a portfolio of consumer brands like Dove and Ben & Jerry’s. As other brands started fleeing YouTube, Unilever discovered three instances in which its brands appeared on objectionable YouTube channels. But Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, decided not to withdraw its ads because the number of ads appearing with objectionable content was proportionally small. The average $100,000 YouTube campaign runs across more than 7,000 channels, according to the video analytics firm OpenSlate, and Unilever spends hundreds of millions of dollars on YouTube. Also, Google discovered that the ads in question appeared because of a human error in setting safety levels. Weed said it was in Unilever’s best interest to win concessions from Google instead of cutting ties. As part of its new measures, Google agreed to work with outside companies to provide third-party verification about where ads appeared on YouTube. When he broached the idea of independent verification in the past, Weed said, Google executives acted as though he had suggested the company was not trustworthy. He said the issue was not about trust, but about companies being able to “mark their own homework.” ‘No system can be 100 percent perfect. We’re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.’ He said he thought that Google would have agreed eventually, but that “the current situation accelerated their plans.” Google’s efforts are being noticed. Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it had resumed YouTube advertising in a number of countries. Google said other companies were starting to return. For the most part, Google failed to address the issue adequately before because it did not have to; the instances in which ads appeared next to objectionable content happened infrequently and out of view from the broader public. Google said that for many of its top advertisers, the objectionable videos accounted for fewer than one one-thousandth of a percent of their total ad impressions. To train the computers, Google is applying machine-learning techniques — the underlying technology for many of its biggest breakthroughs, like the self-driving car. It has also brought in large human teams (it declined to say how big) to review the appropriateness of videos that computers flagged as questionable. Essentially, they are training computers to recognize footage of a woman in a sports bra and leggings doing yoga poses in an exercise video as safe for advertising and not sexually suggestive content. Similarly, they will mark video of a Hollywood action star waving a gun as acceptable to some advertisers, while flagging a similar image involving an Islamic State gunman as inappropriate. Google used a similar approach in the past to create an automated rating system for videos, similar to movie ratings, based on appropriateness of content for specific audiences. But Google is now trying to solve a different problem. “Computers have a much harder time understanding context, and that’s why we’re actually using all of our latest and greatest machine learning abilities now to get a better feel for this,” Schindler said. Armed with human-verified examples of what is safe and what is not, Google’s computer systems break down the images of a YouTube video frame by frame, analyzing every image. They also digest what is being said, the video’s description from the creator, and other signals to detect patterns and identify subtle cues for what makes a video inappropriate. The idea is for machines to eventually make the tough calls. In the instances when brands feel that Google failed to flag an inappropriate video, that example is fed back into the system so it improves over time. Google said it had already flagged five times as many videos as inappropriate for advertising, although it declined to provide absolute numbers on how many videos that entailed. With more than a billion videos on YouTube, 400 hours of new content being uploaded every minute, and 3 million ad-supported channels on the platform, Schindler said it was impossible to guarantee that Google could eradicate the problem completely. He made a comparison to how a car company could not promise that even a new tire would never fail in the first 10,000 miles. “No system can be 100 percent perfect,” he said. “But we’re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.” Loading comments...

US President Donald Trump holds up an executive order on "energy independence" during a signing ceremony at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters in Washington, DC, March 28, 2017. Image: Xinhua/REUTERS via China.org.cn By Mark Malloch Brown Monday 3 April 2017 Share this story The relationship between business, politics, and the environment is about to become more complicated. As US President Donald Trump’s administration threatens to dismantle vital environmental protections, some of which have existed for decades, business leaders are increasingly recognizing – and acting upon – the need for environmentally sustainable policies. Trump, who once called climate change a Chinese hoax intended to weaken the US economy, has already repealed the Stream Protection Rule, which bars coal producers from dumping waste into waterways. Next on the chopping block may be the Clean Power Plan, which limits greenhouse-gas emissions from generating plants – by far the country’s largest source of CO2 emissions – with the goal of cutting carbon pollution from the power sector to 32 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Trump administration has even threatened to back out of the Paris climate agreement, to which the world’s governments committed in 2015. A decade ago, business leaders would have largely welcomed such regressive environmental policies, which can lower costs and expand opportunities, by reducing constraints on their companies’ behavior. But today, even as markets respond bullishly to Trump’s “business-friendly” pledges – not just deregulation and tax cuts, but also a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would include reviving coal – business leaders have remained cautious. In particular, they have strong reservations about a potential withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success. Some are already making their voices heard on the matter. Since Trump’s election, nearly 900 companies and investors, many of them American, have signed an open letter, “Business Backs Low Carbon,” calling on the administration not to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. These companies, which include large multinationals, believe that failure to build a low-carbon economy would jeopardize America’s prosperity. There is compelling recent research to support this view. Last month, a study by Energy Innovation showed that elimination of the Clean Power Plan alone could cost the US $600 billion and cause 120,000 premature deaths by 2050. By contrast, efforts to build a more sustainable economy would bring far-reaching benefits. A December 2016 report by the Risky Business Project, led by American CEOs and former municipal and federal leaders, shows that savings in fuel costs from an 80 per cent reduction in CO2emissions by 2050 could exceed the required capital investment by $150 billion. Last January, the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, which I chair, estimated in its flagship report that companies could unlock $12 trillion globally in revenue and savings by pursuing sustainable business models. Such models can also create up to 380 million jobs by 2030 in key economic sectors, including food and agriculture, energy, transport, health, and municipal government. In the energy sector alone, the opportunities are valued at $4.3 trillion. “ Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success. Corporate strategies are increasingly falling into line with these findings. In 2005, on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the US Gulf Coast and affected a significant regional consumer base for Walmart, the company’s then-CEO Lee Scott delivered a telling speech, entitled “Twenty-First Century Leadership,” to all company employees. Scott set significant environmental goals, as part of a broader vision for Walmart to become a more responsible corporate citizen. Today, Walmart is a leading commercial solar and on-site renewable-energy user, deriving about 25 per cent of its global energy consumption from renewable sources. (The company’s goal, set by Scott, is to rely entirely on renewables.) By increasing the efficiency of its US fleet of trucks, Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tons of CO2 from 2005 to 2015, and saved nearly $1 billion in 2016 alone. Another US company, Mars, Inc., is on a similar path. A signatory of the Business Backs Low Carbon letter, Mars is working to eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions entirely by 2040, through greater efficiency and investment in renewable energy projects like wind turbines. The company’s CEO, Grant Reid, is also a member of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission. But, while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy (a central message of our commission’s report), the private sector cannot do it alone. Government must be an active partner, helping to scale sustainable activities by creating market conditions that spur a “race to the top” and unlock the finance needed to keep America competitive and innovative. So it is not enough simply to oppose Trump’s environmentally damaging policies; businesses need to get his administration on their side, so that the US authorities create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and green innovation. Such an environment could include carbon pricing, which a growing number of businesses are pursuing internally, and tax credits for carbon efficiency. Trump’s own businesses have benefited from such government interventions. As the New York Times recently revealed, in 2012, Trump secured nearly $1 million in energy-efficiency incentives and low-interest loans from New York State. A groundswell of support from CEOs, on a nonpartisan basis, could be the key to spurring the needed action. Before the Paris climate conference, politicians knew that environmental activists wanted a deal to limit climate change; arguably, what ultimately drove them to act, however, was finding out that CEOs and boards felt the same way. Business leaders need to show Trump that they are not cheerleaders for coal, pollution, and global warming. They are determined champions of an enlightened environmentalism that is in the interest of all their stakeholders – customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities in which they operate.

The Verge The ethics of emulation: how creators, the community, and the law view console emulators If you follow emulation news, here's a story you've probably heard. Nintendo releases a brand new Legend of Zelda game for a young console. It is immediately heralded as one of the greatest games ever made. Reviewers give it perfect marks. It is, definitively, the best reason to own Nintendo's new hardware. And mere weeks after its release, when buzz was at its highest, a PC emulator was able to run that massively popular game... PC Gamer Inside the making of 'Mass Effect Andromeda' On Wednesday 22 February, there was a curious, disbelieving buzz in the studios of the video game developer BioWare in downtown Montreal. That morning, NASA had announced the discovery of seven Earth-sized, potentially life-harboring planets orbiting a dwarf star called Trappist-1, around 40 light years from Earth. Many at BioWare – home to the beloved Mass Effect series of sci-fi role playing games – felt that the timing was a little too good to be true. Glixel Amazon is dead serious about delivering your goodies by drone Almost four years ago, in a puffy 60 Minutes piece about Amazon, CEO Jeff Bezos gave us a peek at a secret project: autonomous “octocopters,” also known as giant drones. The flying devices, Bezos assured us, would cut out UPS and FedEx to deliver packages to Amazon’s customers. At the time, skeptics dismissed it as a publicity stunt and doubted that the company would ever pursue the seemingly nutty scheme.

But many news organisations have been getting in touch to ask if it is just an incredibly convincing hoax. The Independent Game over, Uwe Boll In a small, cold film studio in early 2016, the man known by the Internet as the “worst director in the world” was doing what he does, well, worst. “O.K., one more time,” said Uwe Boll (his first name is pronounced “OO-vah”), feeding lines to one of the actors in the absence of a script. “Straight in the lens: ‘. . . has been killed. By the law . . . er . . . the law enforcement? Has been shot by law enforcement.’ Yes. O.K., do it. Ready, and . . . Action!” Vanity Fair The $2 32-bit Arduino (with debugging) I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with the Arduino. But if I had two serious gripes about the original offering it was the 8-bit CPU and the lack of proper debugging support. Now there’s plenty of 32-bit support in the Arduino IDE, so that takes care of the first big issue. Taking care of having a real debugger, though, is a bit trickier. I recently set out to use one of the cheap “blue pill” STM32 ARM boards. Hackaday The reckoning: Why the movie business is in big trouble The uncertainty surrounding the film business and the direction it needs to take in order to survive is also being manifested in the corporate suites. Sony Pictures is struggling to find a replacement for outgoing CEO Michael Lynton, having cycled through likely candidates such as former Disney COO Tom Staggs, while considering more offbeat options like former Hulu head Jason Kilar. Variety Why I always tug on the ATM Once you understand how easy and common it is for thieves to attach “skimming” devices to ATMs and other machines that accept debit and credit cards, it’s difficult not to closely inspect and even tug on the machines before using them. Several readers who are in the habit of doing just that recently shared images of skimmers they discovered after gently pulling on various parts of a cash machine they were about to use.

LastPass Amazon and Walmart are in an all-out price war that is terrifying America’s biggest brands Last month, Walmart gathered some of America’s biggest household brands near its Arkansas headquarters for a tough talk. For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its “Everyday Low Price” guarantee. But now, Walmart was too often getting beaten on price. So company executives were there, in part, to reset expectations with Walmart’s suppliers...

The idea is to let people share sensory experiences over the internet.

Reports have emerged that employees in over a dozen plants knowingly packed rancid meat, covering up the smell with acid, slabs of which were then sold on to schools and Walmart. All this happened not in the U.S., though, but in Brazil, headquarters to meatpacking giant JBS. Named for its founder, Jose Batista Sobrinho, the company turns over almost as much as the next three largest U.S. beef producers—Tyson, Cargill, and National Beef—combined. In response, Egypt has already banned Brazilian beef, and U.S. Senator John Tester (D-Montana) recently introduced legislation to prevent Brazilian beef from entering into the country, even as JBS suspended meat production at 33 of its 36 Brazilian meatpacking plants. But choosing “America First” for your steak misses two far larger points. The Brazilian giant is simply striving to adopt ideas from, and buy out companies in, the U.S. meat industry. Pilgrim’s, Cargill’s pork business and Smithfield’s beef operation have been acquired by what Bloomberg once called the world’s second largest packaged food company (behind Nestlé). And even if you could stop the import of dodgy sausage, you still couldn’t avoid the bigger planetary impact of the beef industry, because it’s airborne. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), meat and dairy production alone now generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all the world’s transport combined. Much of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by industrial livestock occur indirectly, through the production of grains to feed to animals that then get fed to humans. In 2010, about one-third of all cereals on Earth went to animal feed, and the FAO predicts this figure will reach 50 percent by 2050. More feed means more land under cultivation. And feed crops like soybean, maize, and sorghum are usually grown with chemical fertilizers, themselves another potent source of greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, consumption is soaring, made possible by widespread marketing and producing meat that’s cheap to buy—even if those low prices are made possible through dangerous and poorly paid jobs, lax environmental practices, corporate subsidies, and dreadful living conditions for animals. If current trends continue, the FAO predicts world meat consumption will grow a further 76 percent by 2050. If, on the other hand, people kept their level of meat consumption to the World Health Organization’s recommended guidelines, the world could reduce 40 percent of all current greenhouse gas emissions. Unsurprisingly, this advice hasn’t been well received by the meat, fertilizer, pesticide, and processing industries. Industrial meat concerns blasted the FAO after they put out a report in 2006 on the role of livestock in the climate crisis. “You wouldn’t believe how much we were attacked,” said Samuel Jutzi, director of the animal production and health division this UN agency. The FAO soon buckled under the pressure and agreed to establish a partnership with the meat industry’s main lobby groups and shifted the focus of its work accordingly. Canadian academic Tony Weis has a term for what’s happening here: the world’s diet, food system, and food policy are being “meatified.” The corporations doing it are increasingly based in the global South, where most of the world’s future industrial meat eaters live, and those firms are doing roaring business. For example, a recent report by GRAIN shows that JBS is also the world’s largest poultry producer. The world’s largest pork producer is the Chinese WH Group, and France’s Lactalis Group is the world’s largest dairy producer. These firms, together with more-established U.S. and European ones, work hard to increase their control over the market: They blunt domestic government attempts to regulate them, they spur demand across the world, and they destroy the livestock practices of small-scale farmers in the process. Propping Up the Meat Market When Germany drafted guidelines to reduce meat consumption, demonstrating that a 50 percent cut by 2030 would be “crucial to climate protection,” the industry lobbied. Hard. By the November 2016 launch date, the country’s climate change plan had been gutted, and stripped of any reference at all to greenhouse gases in the agriculture sector. Similar stories can be told of U.S. efforts and those, predictably, in Brazil. Despite industry opposition to certain kinds of regulation, they’re very happy to suck at the teat of government subsidy. In 2013, OECD countries dished out $53 billion to livestock producers, with the EU paying $731 million to its cattle industry alone The same year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paid more than $500 million to just 62 producers (starting with Tyson Foods) in order to get meat and dairy on school meal trays, compared to just a fraction of that to fruit and vegetable suppliers. But the big guns in the industry’s arsenal are “free trade” agreements. These trade deals artificially prop up production and consumption by promoting the dumping of cheap meat and dairy into poor countries’ economies. They include clauses that eliminate protections for local farmers from foreign competitors. They also make it illegal to grant preference to local suppliers or products and they make government regulations subject to investor-state dispute settlement under which a foreign company can sue governments that adopt social or environmental legislation that they think undermines their profits. Contrasting the broader carbon footprint of factory farm animals vs animals from small-scale, mixed farms using a systems lens. Not all meat production is the same, of course. Small scale mixed farmers and herders who graze animals on land where crops often cannot be grown are the sustainable old-guard. Their production and consumption systems contribute relatively few greenhouse gases, while improving family nutrition and livelihoods and forming an integral part of people’s cultural and religious traditions. But even if they’re better for the planet, small-scale farmers and ranchers don’t have the political clout that industry has. Factory farms are the most rapidly growing segment of meat and dairy production, accounting for 80 percent of the growth of global meat and dairy in recent years. Industrial livestock production has grown at twice the annual rate of traditional, diversified farming systems, and at more than six times the annual growth rate of production based on grazing. Change is Possible Yet it’s not unimaginable to shift, at scale, away from industrial meat. Last month, Friends of the Earth and Oakland Unified School District published the result of a unique two-year experiment. The district reduced animal protein on school menus by 30 percent while increasing fruit, vegetables, and legumes. When kids ate meat, it came from local organic producers. The result: a 14 percent reduction in the school’s food carbon footprint and $42,000 savings in the cost of the meals. Perhaps most remarkable: the children reported increased satisfaction with the healthy, regionally sourced meals. The Oakland school initiative is smart and, unlike the U.S. meat industry’s practices, deserves to be shared and spread widely. But we can’t just default to letting our children solve climate change for us. Voting with one’s fork or school menu is important, but that alone won’t restore small-scale production, and it won’t detoxify agricultural politics of corporate influence. Larger-scale policy change is vital. Some governments—including Sweden, the Netherlands and China—have started formulating recommendations that people eat less meat in the interest of reducing climate emissions. De-meatifying the world will require more from legislators, and more from consumers. It will mean rejecting the meat-marketing and the fertilizer, feed, and fossil fuel industries, too. It will mean pushing back on the trade agreements of which these industries are so fond—and doing so without backing into the nationalism of the right. (It is striking that earlier this year we saw a Trump supporter go head-to-head against the U.S. meatpacking industry in defense of sustainable beef.) The rift between the left and the right around climate change turns on whether you think industrial meatification is an unintended consequence of the food system or its embodiment. If it’s no accident that today’s food system exploits animals, humans and nature, then it’s clear that a radically transformed system—one that moves beyond capitalism—is what’s needed. Buying America First won’t save us from the worst of Big Meat. But it looks as if there are manyranchers, educators, and small-scale farmers who are ready to take a more radical stand. If consumers are ready to boycott Big Meat for good, permanently choosing to support sustainable animal raising by paying more for it, there’s hope for us all.

As U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration threatens to dismantle vital environmental protections, some of which have existed for decades, business leaders are increasingly recognizing – and acting upon – the need for environmentally sustainable policies. Trump, who once called climate change a Chinese hoax intended to weaken the U.S. economy, has already repealed the Stream Protection Rule, which bars coal producers from dumping waste into waterways. Next on the chopping block may be the Clean Power Plan, which limits greenhouse-gas emissions from generating plants – by far the country’s largest source of CO2 emissions – with the goal of cutting carbon pollution from the power sector to 32 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Trump administration has even threatened to back out of the Paris climate agreement, to which the world’s governments committed in 2015. A decade ago, business leaders would have largely welcomed such regressive environmental policies, which can lower costs and expand opportunities, by reducing constraints on their companies’ behaviour. But today, even as markets respond bullishly to Trump’s “business-friendly” pledges – not just deregulation and tax cuts, but also a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would include reviving coal – business leaders have remained cautious. In particular, they have strong reservations about a potential withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success. Some are already making their voices heard on the matter. Since Trump’s election, nearly 900 companies and investors, many of them American, have signed an open letter, “Business Backs Low Carbon,” calling on the administration not to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement. These companies, which include large multinationals, believe that failure to build a low-carbon economy would jeopardize America’s prosperity. There is compelling recent research to support this view. Last month, a study by Energy Innovation showed that elimination of the Clean Power Plan alone could cost the U.S. $600 billion and cause 120,000 premature deaths by 2050. By contrast, efforts to build a more sustainable economy would bring far-reaching benefits. A December 2016 report by the Risky Business Project, led by American CEOs and former municipal and federal leaders, shows that savings in fuel costs from an 80 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 could exceed the required capital investment by $150 billion. Last January, the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, which I chair, estimated in its flagship report that companies could unlock $12 trillion globally in revenue and savings by pursuing sustainable business models. Such models can also create up to 380 million jobs by 2030 in key economic sectors, including food and agriculture, energy, transport, health, and municipal government. In the energy sector alone, the opportunities are valued at $4.3 trillion. Corporate strategies are increasingly falling into line with these findings. In 2005, on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast and affected a significant regional consumer base for Walmart, the company’s then-CEO Lee Scott delivered a telling speech, entitled “Twenty-First Century Leadership,” to all company employees. Scott set significant environmental goals, as part of a broader vision for Walmart to become a more responsible corporate citizen. Today, Walmart is a leading commercial solar and on-site renewable-energy user, deriving about 25 per cent of its global energy consumption from renewable sources. (The company’s goal, set by Scott, is to rely entirely on renewables.) By increasing the efficiency of its U.S. fleet of trucks, Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tons of CO2 from 2005 to 2015, and saved nearly $1 billion in 2016 alone. Another U.S. company, Mars, Inc., is on a similar path. A signatory of the Business Backs Low Carbon letter, Mars is working to eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions entirely by 2040, through greater efficiency and investment in renewable energy projects like wind turbines. The company’s CEO, Grant Reid, is also a member of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission. But, while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy (a central message of our commission’s report), the private sector cannot do it alone. Government must be an active partner, helping to scale sustainable activities by creating market conditions that spur a “race to the top” and unlock the finance needed to keep America competitive and innovative. So it is not enough simply to oppose Trump’s environmentally damaging policies; businesses need to get his administration on their side, so that the U.S. authorities create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and green innovation. Such an environment could include carbon pricing, which a growing number of businesses are pursuing internally, and tax credits for carbon efficiency. Trump’s own businesses have benefited from such government interventions. As the New York Times recently revealed, in 2012, Trump secured nearly $1 million in energy-efficiency incentives and low-interest loans from New York State. A groundswell of support from CEOs, on a nonpartisan basis, could be the key to spurring the needed action. Before the Paris climate conference, politicians knew that environmental activists wanted a deal to limit climate change; arguably, what ultimately drove them to act, however, was finding out that CEOs and boards felt the same way. Business leaders need to show Trump that they are not cheerleaders for coal, pollution, and global warming. They are determined champions of an enlightened environmentalism that is in the interest of all their stakeholders – customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities in which they operate. - Project Syndicate < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

By Laura Woods | April 2, 2017 Previously World Series-Winning Teams With the Highest and Lowest Payrolls 1/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 2.0 / hyku They sit on top of the business world today, but many prominent CEOs started at the bottom. Good old-fashioned hard work and an unstoppable desire to succeed helped them rise through the ranks from entry-level employee to head honcho. Navigating your own ascent up the ladder might feel long and discouraging at times, but you can do it. Take a look at these 15 CEOs' first jobs, and get inspired to climb the career ladder. 2/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Loren Javier Bob Iger He's ruled The Walt Disney Company as its chairman and CEO since 2005, but Bob Iger's introduction to the company wasn't nearly as glamorous. He graduated from Ithaca College in 1973 and promptly went to work as a weatherman for a local news station. A few months later, he landed a job in New York City as a studio facility supervisor for ABC — Disney bought the network in 1996 — and the rest is history. His integrity, humble nature and genuine appreciation for creative talent helped him get to where he is today, according to a 2016 Variety article. 3/16 Show Thumbnails Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com Ursula Burns In 1980, Ursula Burns landed an internship at Xerox. And by 2009, she was the CEO. She held this role until 2016, when Xerox split into two separate companies. Burns is currently chairman of the board of the document technology company, but she'll retire in May 2017. Originally an engineer, her career took a pivotal turn when she accepted a job as executive assistant to the then-president of marketing — a developmental role for high-performers. Burns called this a "risky job" in a 2013 interview with Bloomberg, because her engineering skills weren't needed. Despite the gamble, this bold move clearly paid off. 4/16 Show Thumbnails ©Bama Paula A. Marshall Paula Marshall has been the CEO of baked goods company Bama Companies — her family business — since 1984. Immersed in the company from a young age, her first official role as an employee was a production line job as a teenager. For the next 12 years, she held various jobs in the company, until her father retired and named her CEO. At the time, it was less common for a woman to take the reins of a company, but Marshall stepped up and has since led the company to impressive growth. Use Marshall as an example, and don't let doubters hold you back.

He worked his way up to chairman and CEO in 1981 and remained top dog until 2001. In a 2015 LinkedIn post, Welch said doing two things all the time will lead to personal growth in an existing company. "The first is over-delivering on results within the values criteria that your boss sets for the team," he said. "…The other quality that makes you promotable is constantly working to make your boss smarter." 6/16 Show Thumbnails ©General Motors Mary T. Barra When she was 18 years old, Mary T. Barra joined General Motors as a co-op student in the Pontiac Motor Division. After 34 years with the company, she landed the role of CEO in 2014 — and chairman in 2016 — becoming the first woman to helm a major car corporation. Barra spoke candidly about her career in a 2016 interview with Esquire. "The people looking over their shoulder and wondering about their next job are the least successful," she said. "There's no decision you should ever make that would embarrass you if it became public." 7/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons CC BY 3.0 / Shane Bevel Doug McMillon Some CEOs' first jobs turn into powerful careers more often than you might realize. Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., has been leading the retail giant since 2014. This is especially impressive since his first job with the company was an hourly gig loading trucks at a distribution center during his teenage years. The youngest-ever CEO to fill Sam Walton's shoes, McMillon has held various roles with the company, including assistant store manager and a buyer trainee. Eventually, he went on to hold senior management roles in every Wal-Mart business segment, making himself invaluable. 8/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Fortune Live Media Doug Oberhelman In 1975, Doug Oberhelman landed a job in the Caterpillar treasury department, with the goal of paying off his car and student loans. In a 2013 interview with Leaders magazine, he said if someone would've told him he'd become the company's chairman and CEO in 2010, he would've thought they were crazy. A genuine passion for the work kept him with the company for 41 years, until he stepped down as CEO at the end of 2016. Oberhelman remained executive chairman through March 31, 2017. 9/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons CC BY 4.0 / Office of the President-elect Rex Tillerson Becoming U.S. Secretary of State meant Rex Tillerson had to change employers for the first time in more than 40 years. Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation since 2006, he joined the oil and gas company as a production engineer in 1975. Prior to commandeering the boardroom, Tillerson developed his leadership skills by holding several senior roles in the company. If you have sky-high career ambitions, holding various roles throughout the company will allow you to develop a well-rounded knowledge of company operations. 10/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Intel Free Press Brian M. Krzanich Intel CEO Brian M. Krzanich joined the company as a process engineer in 1982, but he made an error 25 years ago that almost got him fired. In a 2017 interview with the Fortt Knox podcast, Krzanich explained what he did. "I wiped out the output of an entire factory for a week," he said. "I'm lucky to be employed at Intel, sometimes I say." Rather than letting the mistake take him down, Krzanich used the situation to change the company for the better, etching out his legacy. He was appointed CEO and elected to Intel's board in May 2013. 11/16 Show Thumbnails ©Walgreens Boots Alliance Jim Skinner In 2012, Jim Skinner stepped down as McDonald's CEO and vice chairman, but his 41 years with the company weren't all so prestigious. Following a 10-year stint in the Navy, he landed a job as a manager trainee in 1971. Even CEO first jobs aren't always amazing, but you have to start somewhere, Skinner said in a 2012 interview with the Quad-City Times. "You must be willing to go to work," he said. "In that job, you must add value to that company and gain experience and be committed to the brand. You do the best you can to grow that brand." 12/16 Show Thumbnails ©Fidelity Investments Abigail Johnson She was born into the family business, but Abigail Johnson — Fidelity chairman and CEO, and one of the richest women in the world — worked her way to the top. Although she's the third generation to lead the financial services firm, Johnson wasn't handed her leadership role. Her tenure with Fidelity started in high school, when she spent a summer answering customer service calls. She eventually returned to Fidelity in 1988 as an analyst, but she quickly transitioned into a portfolio management role. Over the years, she got to know the company by working in most of its main areas, which prepared her to take over for her father as CEO in 2014. 13/16 Show Thumbnails nd3000 / Shutterstock.com Justin Copie Justin Copie joined technology company Innovative Solutions as a co-op student while attending the Rochester Institute of Technology. After 13 years with the firm, he took on the role of owner and CEO. Prior to the transition, he spent five years being groomed by former owner and CEO Bob Titus. His thirst for knowledge is likely what led him to the top. "I always want to progress," Copie said in an article on the company website. "I always want to move forward… I'm still learning and I'm always seeking more information and trying to figure out what fits (and) what doesn't…" 14/16 Show Thumbnails ©Hill Holiday Karen Kaplan Not all first jobs evolve into company leadership, but Karen Kaplan's did. Now the CEO of Hill Holliday, a prominent advertising and communications agency, she originally joined the company as a receptionist to earn money for law school. Instead of doing the minimum to get by, she put 100 percent effort into the role, which skyrocketed her career. "I was going to be the best damned receptionist in history and that's how I approached the job," she said in a 2014 interview with Fortune. "I took it really seriously. I didn't just bide my time out there." 15/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons - CC BY-SA 3.0 / Gage Skidmore Samuel Palmisano In 1973, Samuel Palmisano landed a sales job at IBM and, 30 years later, he became chairman, president and CEO. He reigned from January 2003 until December 2011. Palmisano cited "phenomenal resilience" as the key to a successful career in a 2015 interview with The Washington Post. Beyond that, he emphasized the importance of forming good business relationships. "You don't have to be brilliant to run a company, but you have to be a good people person," he said. "You have to be able to lead, to cajole. You have to care. That's what you have to do." 16/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Fortune Live Media Alex Gorsky He's the chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, but in 1988, Alex Gorsky started his career as a sales representative for Janssen Pharmaceutica — a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary. He spent years in various sales, marketing and management roles. This, paired with his West Point education and six years in the U.S. Army, helped him develop leadership skills that took him to the top. "People are not looking for a perfect leader," Gorsky said in a 2014 interview published on Knowledge at Wharton. "They want a leader who cares about them and is going to help them try to be better."

The Tennesee Bureau of Investigation said it obtained surveillance footage from an Oklahoma City Walmart that showed the two shopping on March 15. "Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but did not purchase anything else of significance," the TBI wrote in a news release. "The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing." Cummins, 50, has been accused of kidnapping former student Thomas, 15, in the wake of a school investigation into their relationship. He was thought to be armed. As police continue to search for the duo, here's a full timeline of recent events in their case, with information from the Tennesseean, ABC News and CNN. Jan. 23: A student at Culleoka Unit School sees Thomas and Cummins kissing at school. "It wasn't like a make-out kiss, just a peck on the lips," the student said in a statement. Jan. 24: The student asks Cummins about the relationship. He tells her he was a father figure and best friend to Thomas. The student goes to administrators about the kiss. Jan. 25: The school district begins an investigation, interviewing the witnesses, Thomas, Cummins and their peers. Jan. 27: Culleoka takes Thomas out of Cummins' class. Cummins and Thomas also go on a field trip together, according to the Thomas family attorney. Jan. 31: Police tell the school district Cummins is under criminal investigation. The district sends its paperwork on the duo to law enforcement. Cummins is told not to let Thomas into his classroom. Feb. 1: Thomas' father learns of the kissing claims. He calls the school and demands to know what's going on. Feb. 3: Thomas spends a half hour in Cummins' classroom. Cummins is reprimanded. Feb. 6: Cummins is suspended from the school district without pay. The Thomas family attorney says the girl's phone history shows she's continued to contact the teacher. March 5: Cummins does an internet search for "teen marriage," according to the TBI. March 7: Cummins is seen in a Walmart buying hair dye, though the TBI later finds it "was not connected to any plan to change his appearance or that of Elizabeth Thomas." March 10: Cummins tries to find out how his car may be tracked by police. March 13: Elizabeth tells a family member she'll be home by 6 p.m. that night and if she's not they should call the police, according to another sibling. She gets dropped off at a restaurant in Columbia at about 8 a.m. Cummins is seen getting gas at the same time in the same area. Thomas is listed as missing at about 1 p.m. local time. By 3 p.m. local time, Thomas is thought to be in Decatur, Alabama. March 14: Cummins is fired and charged with sexual contact with a minor. An amber alert goes out for Thomas. March 16: TBI spokesperson Josh Devine tells reporters the duo could "frankly, be anywhere at this point." March 17: Cummins' wife, Jill Cummins, gives a news conference. "I had no idea my husband was involved with anything that has led to all this," she says. "My heart breaks for the family of Beth Thomas. Tad, this is not you ... Please do the right thing and turn yourself into the police and bring Beth home." March 23: Investigators check "in on a possible lead" in Texas, according to DeVine.  March 24: The school district announces plans to create a task force to update its policies for telling parents about "any range of potential student and/or faculty/staff incidents." March 29: The TBI translates its amber alert notice into Spanish as authorities tell reporters the couple could be in Mexico. March 30: Investigators reject rumors that Thomas and Cummins have been seen in Memphis, Tennessee. March 31: Law enforcement officials announce the first confirmed sighting of Thomas and Cummins — on March 15, in an Oklahoma City Walmart. Both have different hair colors than they previously did.

Both offer instant streaming movies, but Netflix requires a membership while VUDU is more of on-demand service. Both have loads of titles and releases, but which one is best for you? Read on to find out! Background Netflix has become the No. 1 provider of on-demand Internet streaming media and DVD-by-mail rental programs. Membership for Netflix includes either a DVD-by-mail rental program or unlimited streaming, with the option to have both for a higher membership fee. VUDU only provides an Internet streaming media option that features on-demand service so you only pay for what you watch, making it a video-on-demand program. User Friendly Netflix members will find that it’s quite easy to rent DVDs by mail or watch streaming movies, TV shows and more. Once you sign up online, whenever you want a movie, you go online and search for the movie title/show name and begin watching (that is if you have streaming membership). Those who have only DVD rentals choose their “wish list” and then get movies mailed to them. With no due dates, users can keep movies as long as they want before returning and starting all over again with their next desired movie. With VUDU, you get to stream directly to your VUDU-friendly device any time you’d like to watch movies. Just connect your HDTV, Blu-ray player, computer, or PlayStation 3/Xbox360 to the Internet and select VUDU as an option. Sign up for a free account and then browse through their selection of titles and then watch. You only pay per movie since it’s on-demand based. Winner: Tie since both are fairly easy to use. All you need is the Internet and you’re on your way to movie enjoyment! Compatible Devices Netflix offers quite a wide variety of compatible devices users can choose from. Its streaming service is available on devices, including: Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, iOS devices, some Android-based phones and tablets, the Windows phone, a few Internet-connected Blu-ray players and even some Internet-connected HTDTVs, TiVo or Roku, D-Link, home theater systems form the likes of Panasonic, LG, Sony, Samsung and Insignia. A great perk is that you can easily connect multiple devices to one account and then jump from device to device, while still leaving off at the same point you did on the last device. VUDU also has a bunch of devices where its services will work, such as PS3, Xbox 360 (it requires an Xbox LIVE Gold Membership, though), computers (PS and MAC) and even Apple’s iPad.  VUDU also asserts that it’s “available on virtually every Internet-connected Blu-ray player and HDTV on the market.” Winner: Netflix, obviously, offer more compatible devices so it’s a no brainer here! Titles Everybody knows that Netflix has quite the assortment of titles in its service. With more than 100,000 movies and TV shows on DVD and Blu-ray (even unrated and NC-17 ones) and “tens of thousands” of titles available for streaming (both TV and movies, along with many HD options), users can find old favorites and discover new ones.  VUDU users have access to 20,000 titles (and growing), including titles the same day they hit DVD. VUDU also claims it has the “most HD titles on demand” with more being added weekly. Their biggest claim to fame against Netflix is that they offer titles faster than Netflix would, stating that it takes Netflix 28 days later to have a new release on DVD and up to seven years for it to hit its streaming service. Winner: VUDU wins here since it offers new releases a lot faster than Netflix. Membership Perks VUDU was bought by Walmart back in July and this provided a huge step for the company as it launched VUDU streaming directly on Walmart.com for instant viewing. VUDU also offers a $5 credit for newcomers and offers HDX quality that makes viewing just like it is in the movie theater, featuring 1080p True Digital video and rich Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound. Users can now also use the website of America’s largest retailer as yet another outlet. Netflix allows for a month’s free trial so that new users can test out the service. Winner: Since Netflix offers unlimited streaming along with DVD rentals, there is a bit more bang for buck, and wins here. Content Netflix’s ability to land some big deals with movie companies has afforded them a wide assortment of content, from TV shows to movies. Since they’ve landed some pretty good content deals, users will find a great selection of TV shows from the likes of CBS, ABC, FOX, NBC and BBC libraries. Deals with Sony, NBC Universal and DreamWorks Animation (which is exclusive, but doesn’t start until 2013) also provide a large variety of content. But VUDU also scored some major content deals, too! They’ve been able to establish content licensing contracts with all major movie studios, as well as more than 50 smaller and indie studios, and that means a large library that might not be as large as Netflix, but is definitely on its way there. Winner: Netflix steals it here by having a wide assortment of TV shows and older movies that can’t be so easily found nowadays. Speed of Service VUDU’s minimum speed requirements for its services is: 480p: 1 Mbps for SD; 720p: 2.25 Mbs for HD; and 1080p: 4.5 Mbps for HDX. Netflix recommends that its users have a minimum speed of 500 kbps (0.5 MB) to get maximum results for its service. Winner: Tie Quality VUDU offers movies in HDX, which delivers the highest quality true High Definition 1080p content available from any Internet, broadcast or satellite on-demand service. It also provides rich Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound and offers many HD titles. Netflix also has HD movies and is capable of streaming 1080p video. Winner: VUDU’s had the edge with its HDX and 7.1-channel surround. Limitations Netflix users saw a price hike for using both streaming and DVD-by-mail rentals, which many might consider a limitation. Since VUDU’s services are on a per-movie basis, you can easily rack up a high tab if you go movie crazy. Winner: Netflix has less limitations for the money; they just offer more. Price Netflix charges $7.99 for unlimited streaming movies OR unlimited one-disc at a time rental service ($11.99 for 2 unlimited). For those that want both, they’ll have to dish out $15.98 a month. Netflix also offers Blu-ray discs for an additional $2 a month. Unlike Netflix, VUDU is s available without a monthly subscription or contract with some movies available to rent for just $2 for 2 nights. But some movies can cost up to $5 a pop (HDX is the most expensive option, but usually it’s SD for $3.99 and HD for $4.99). You can also opt to purchase the video and this various per movie. Winner: Netflix’s monthly charge doesn’t look so bad compared to VUDU’s per-movie charge. Overall Winner Netflix wins! VUDU might be quickly crouching on Netflix’s tail, but it still hasn’t overtaken the popular movie rental service. Its low monthly fee and numerous titles proves it can’t be beat!

Rental movies are continually interrupted for downloading. Very aggregating. I wanted my money back. Too bad. Good selection of movies. – but no good if they are continually interrupted. Reply SwampGator89 on Vudu sucks. I will never use Vudu again and recommend that nobody does. I actually purchased several movies from Vudu and the buffering throughout one movie was so bad, I couldn’t watch it (but had no problems with Fantango, Apple TV, Hulu, Netflix). I tried contacting Vudu to get a refund but Vudu makes it impossible to get in tough with it for any reason. So I challenged the charge through my credit card company who got no response from Vudu as well (Vudu was given every opportunity to respond, but just ignored it). So my credit card company refunded me the charge for the 1 movie purchased that I couldn’t watch, and Vudu responded by suspending my account so I can’t watch any of the 8 other movies purchased from Vudu. It’s fraud and I’ll be taking the appropriate action against Vudu. Reply Lee on I will never ever again use VUDU…I signed up with VUDU last year and received a coupon code. I then used it to watch a movie. With in less than a minute I realized that I’ve already seen the movie so I then immediately turned it off and called VUDU to see if there was anything that can be done since I didn’t watch the movie. I was advised that they would give me the credit back to my acct. since I didn’t watch the movie. I was very pleased to hear this. I really don’t use VUDU often so a couple of months later I ordered a show from VUDU expecting it to use my code, instead it used my PayPal acct. I called VUDU, spoke to the rudest supervisor who basically called me a liar. Not only did she say that I never received a credit but also told me that I never ordered the movie from them. I will never again use VUDU & I will advise everyone against using them as well. Reply shadoe on The most stupid article I’ve ever read. Vudu wins always cause they have tons of new releases and lots of more movie and TV availability. If you buy something on vudu, its yours to keep. Where on Netflix, you can’t do that. matter fact Netflix be removing TV shows and movies and vudu doesn’t. Netflix is for broke people who don’t wanna pay for movies, so they just watch whatever’s available. you could connect vudu with amazon and Disney anywhere. You can’t do that with Netflix. Who ever wrote this article must be a Netflix fan boy.. Never compare vudu with Netflix. go do some more research before writing a article. Reply Dennis on Actually, Vudu loses hands down. For less than the price of two streamed movies in HD from Vudu, I can have a new DVD everyday from Netflix for a month. Thirty vs two. Duh. Reply Venod on *****BEWARE the RENT IS ONLY JUST 24 HRS. My Money so wasted I purchased 2 days before I could watch. ***** Reply Jpnh on I’m surprised no one has gone more into availability of content. Netflix will add or drop shows seemingly on a whim. If I see something available, I always want it available. That’s where I like Vudu, where once I buy content I can feel confident that I will always have access to it. Reply SortingHat on Wow! I guess it’s not autism that makes me not like unknowns. I was always wondering the differences and I guess that wins it for me having Vudu be more stable then Netflix on what it offers even though you pay as you go which is good if you only watch movies once in a while. Reply Eruc on I’d be curious to know how these services stack up against each other today, two years after this comparison was made. Anyone know or willing to put it to the test? Reply Bobsk8 on Vudu, you need 2.25 MBS for HD, I don’t get that on my DSL. I have no problem watching HD on Netflix. Reply Conor James on I think Vudu actually should win the compadiable devices catagory, since you can download the movies you bought to devices such as the ipad, allowing you to watch your movie without an internet connection. Reply Stephen Riss on You are drop dead goregous!!! Reply Bridget on Netflix is good for the day to day movie/tv watching. I dont have cable and use a combination of Netflix/ HuluPlus/ Network TV. When I want to rent a movie I use Vudu/ Amazon depending on who has the cheapest rental fee. Vudu is JUST another option for having a cable like experience without the cable like price. VERY budget friendly and you can watch the movie as many times as you want in a time period. Reply SortingHat on We used to use Amazon but recently their player has screwed up and now want to charge 100$ a year after a few times of watching it. But that aside their player is one to be desired. If you like to rewind movies you can only do it 2 times or it will freeze up requiring the *player* to be shut down in a control alt del way and forced to turn on the movie all over again and have to find where you left off. If you like captioning it will say *On* and their onboard captions do not work. :( I like captioning as I don’t keep up with fast paced movies very well. Reply Vudu Convert on I was a long time netflix user. The availability of new titles is what killed it for me. I just signed up for Vudu today. I like how they will offer newer titles way faster than netflix. If people are honest they will agree netflix has way more movies but the majority of them are ones you wouldn’t watch anyway. You will find yourself wanting to watch recent releases while netflix shugs their shoulders LOL! Reply sledge hammer on my xbox live ran out today,and yet my vudu is on thru the xbox right now.netflix wont even let you in to browse without the xbox live.although it may be cuz i have digital copies and movies i already own in the vudu service. Reply Johnny on Very nice summation. Thanks Kristie Johnny A Reply johnny on Very nice summation – Thanks Kristie Johnny A Reply Tango on minor problem with netflix, they usually only have season one maybe season two of a show and the rest of the seasons are never available. I have to watch them on Hulu plus. Reply Big Michael Kank on Really nice review, i learned alot of it, thank you. Reply My4prnsses on Why pay for each rental individually with Vudu, unless you RARELY use it.  For those of us who are tired of the cable and satellite prices, Netflix is the answer.  If I want to watch network shows, they are available to watch for free.  The only reason I ever use Vudu is if I want to watch a new release because it is cheap-unless I rent from Redbox for $1.29. Reply shadoe on You sound broke Reply mike kahk on U type like a n1993r. Reply Biggmike40 on Kristie is gorgeous Reply Bluesaltyocean99 on who wants to pay per movie on Vudu…I have been a member of Netflix since it started, I have the cheapest plan…less than $16.00 a month for unlimited streaming movies…I think it is the better deal… Reply Gadget Gator on Depends on if you want better quality or not. The VUDU videos are amazingly good and start up instantly. They have a growing selection of 3d titles as well which look great. Also for someone that only watches a movie once in awhile, the VUDU option would be more cost effective. It just depends on how much content you consume and what quality you want it. Reply Angelina Stevens on Vudu will be bought by Google in the near future. That’s been predicted and it’ll be better. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Food Pick Six 6 beers you should try this month Including a cucumber Florida weisse and a saison from Trader Joe’s By Andrew Gill @andrewgill Apr 3, 2017 12:00 AM Illustration: Nick Wanserski Illustration: Nick Wanserski Pick Six is The A.V. Club’s monthly recommendations for the beers we’re currently digging. This month’s picks turn a hopeful eye toward the promise of spring, while keeping a sweater handy for those days that are supposed to reach 70 degrees but top out at 49 (I’m looking at you, Chicago). There are some spring-appropriate ingredients in these beers, including rose hips, raspberries, lemongrass, juniper berries, cherries, and cucumber. 1. Revolution Brewing Anti-Hero IPA is a beer that Chicagoans apparently order more than any brew besides Miller and Coors (at least at places that use BevSpot cash register software). While that news initially shocked me, it made sense once I thought about it—after all, I do usually buy super fresh cans of it whenever I shop at Target. It’s a straightforward, modern, 6.5 percent ABV (alcohol by volume) IPA with strong hop flavor that veers ever so slightly to the fruit side of the pine-to-citrus spectrum. One of the fastest-growing breweries in Chicago (and the largest independent brewery in Illinois), Revolution is now available in six states, including New York and Massachusetts. 2. Green Flash Brewing Fearless Fifty is a saison brewed for Trader Joe’s 50th anniversary celebration. In light of Wal-Mart’s recent legal trouble over selling fake craft beer, Green Flash’s model seems to be a good one for selling grocery store exclusives. At 5.5 percent ABV, this farmhouse style with subtle flavors from rose hips and sweet orange peel is easy to love. If you see it at Trader Joe’s, be sure to stock up since they don’t plan to brew this one again. 3. Two Roads Brewing Road Jam Raspberry Wheat was a pleasant surprise when it showed up on my doorstep via UPS direct from the largest craft brewer in Connecticut. I’d never had a Two Roads beer before, and this 5 percent ABV wheat ale with raspberry and lemongrass could have been a cloying mess of a fruit beer. Instead it was a light and refreshing drink, with tartness from the lemongrass and subtle bitter flavor from the raspberry. 4. Coppertail Brewing Company Slam Piece Florida Weisse is a delicious example of the Sunshine State’s most significant contribution to brewing culture—a riff on the Berliner Weisse infused with local produce. This 3.5 percent ABV brew isn’t the original Florida weisse (J. Wakefield Brewing is credited with inventing the style), but it was the only native Florida beer to medal at the 2016 Great American Beer Festival. In this case, the local produce is cucumber, and the beer managed to taste tart and accentuate its sweeter flavor profile. This is a truly remarkable beer. 5. Ommegang Rosetta Kriek isn’t actually brewed by the Cooperstown, New York brewery. Instead it asked the brewers at its Belgian sister brewery, Liefmans—a more than 300-year-old establishment also owned by Duvel Moortgat—to do what they do best: blend a fruity cherry beer with a Flemish brown aged on cherries for three years. For American beer drinkers, that’s great news because Ommegang distributes this 5.6 percent ABV beer in 43 states, making it much easier to find than many Belgian imports. It’s a perfect beer for April—on the cold days the layers of flavor provide plenty to ponder indoors, and on warm ones you can focus on the fecund and fruity flavor of cherries. 6. Off Color Brewing Bare Bear Sahti is another beer that can work in warm or cold weather depending on how you look at it. The Off Color website says this 500-year-old Finnish style is traditionally brewed in home saunas, which are equipped with filters made of juniper branches that the beer passes through en route to fermentation tanks. The Chicago brewery approximates this method by adding juniper berries and oak staves at different points in the brewing process. The result is a 7 percent ABV beer reminiscent of a rye saison that vaguely reminds you of gin. If you’re near Chicago, this one should be fairly easy to find, but if you’re not it’s still worth asking around for—Off Color now distributes to 26 states.

The banksters are back Posted on April 3, 2017March 31, 2017 by GS Early Views: 1 0 Shares It should come as no surprise that a guy from New York City, who has run a major global real estate development business, knows more than a few well-placed bankers. And when that guy becomes president of the United States, it’s his chance to give them their due. Now, before you get your hackles up, this isn’t a Trump-bashing piece. All presidents come to Washington and end up helping their state’s businesses. Reagan’s defense and anti-ballistic missile defense system build-up helped many of the aerospace companies and computer firms in his home state of California. Clinton helped make Tyson Foods one of the biggest chicken producers in the world. And Wal-Mart was also a big beneficiary of Clinton largesse. So it comes as no surprise that Wall Street has unpacked its bags on Pennsylvania Avenue. Like the former CIO of Goldman Sachs as Secretary of Treasury. Lose the middlemen Still in denial about the bankers having a heyday in DC as well as NYC? Here are the six-month returns of some of the top banksters that ushered in the financial crisis and were bailed out by you and me: Goldman Sachs: 44 percent JPMorgan Chase: 34 percent Wells Fargo: 27 percent Morgan Stanley: 36 percent Citigroup: 29 percent The S&P 500: 9 percent These big banks have outperformed the broad market 3- to 5- fold since the election. And it’s no coincidence. But this isn’t about morality. It’s about business. Actually, I’m kind of glad we’ve gotten rid of some of the ossified political hacks that were the middlemen for their corporate overlords and now we’re dealing directly with the overlords. At least it’s a change of pace. Investing is about performance. It’s about understanding what’s happening, regardless of your politics or desires and objectively observing what is going on. And then finding the opportunity there. That’s what I’m doing here. Do I like the debt-driven culture these banks have promoted? No. Are they a buying opportunity? Yes. But I think there is a better place to go with your investment dollars in this sector. Regional banks. Why regional banks? Because now that the banks are on their feet again and regulations will be in limbo for years to come, they have the chance to start blowing up the next big bubble. And I’m guessing that will be consolidating all the healthy, conservative regional and local banks. You see, the smaller banks weren’t the ones that caused the financial meltdown. They weren’t the ones lending to credit risks on one side of the trade while bundling those risks, selling them off and then shorting them on the other. Regional banks lend to local businesses, homeowners and individuals. They don’t have an arbitrage desk or a trading division. They make money the old way – pennies on the dollar, over and over again. For the “banksters,” as Bob Livingston calls them, they represent piggy banks full of responsible cash that will help their balance sheets (and stocks). It will also help the big boys leverage those assets into more trading money for their institutional side. Remember, the big banks cut their trading operations significantly once the bottom fell out of the global economy. But those days are gone and it’s back to business as usual, better business than usual. This is also a great opportunity to consolidate the banking landscape. If they gobble up enough smaller players around the country, they also rebuild their Too Big To Fail size while also becoming major players in small towns and big cities across America. Think about it like the auto industry. Here is a list of the defunct car companies in the U.S. that have been culled into the Big Three. Top targets Before I get to my investment picks, I want to say that the biggest statement you can make against the banksters is to move your business to smaller banks. I stopped using big banks decades ago and I have never felt cheated at keeping them as far away from my money as possible. Two other attractive qualities to regional bank stocks: Even if they’re not acquired, they’re still the best way to invest in the financial sector in the long term. If they are bought out, they will command big premiums, meaning big payoffs for investors. Without further ado, four solid stocks to look at are, BB&T, Fifth Third Bancorp, U.S. Bancorp and Burke & Herbert Bank and Trust. All these are rock-solid regional banks that will prosper on their own or profit handsomely from any takeover. — GS Early This entry was posted in Financial Foresight and tagged Bank.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Special Report: Sabal Trail: Pipeline brings natural gas and protests Opinion Commentary: Power to public-school principals, not Betsy DeVos’ protesters Education Secretary Betsy DeVos visits Valencia College in Osceola County U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has made her first solo trip out of Washington D. C. and went to Osceola County to tour the Valencia College campus. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has made her first solo trip out of Washington D. C. and went to Osceola County to tour the Valencia College campus. Guest Columnist Privacy Policy Extended plane trips can confer a unique opportunity in the human experience: completely candid discussions with a neighbor/passenger. Knowing the visit is finite might help seatmates comfortably spill otherwise vulnerable thoughts the pursuit of the grandest phenomenon in life, the truth. Recently I enjoyed just that — a refreshingly open discussion with a trial attorney — on board a 747. As the flight bore on, in our amicable and forthright dialogue, he made an outright confession: Not many trial attorneys are friendly to our president, and this fellow was no exception. But in a moment of rhetorical disarmament, he acknowledged that Donald Trump uttered a profundity at his recent State of the Union address: “Education reform is the civil-rights issue of this generation.” Not allowing a disadvantaged mother the choice of sending her child to the school where she best sees fit is morally reprehensible. Then he said it. He actually implicated the teachers unions for their chokehold on Democrats, not permitting their captors the liberty to vote their conscience. I nearly fell into the aisle. I then collected myself and did my part with a vulnerable deposit to the dialogue: Free markets, when legal boundaries are well marked and enforced, have done more to elevate humanity than any government initiative. Walmart has done more for the poor than any other entity. Trump’s early inclinations to be a protectionist rankle libertarians. Said differently, protectionist policies raise costs. Moreover, Trump passed over free-market gurus for top spots in the administration, favoring Wall Street ilk instead. “Disappointing,” I offered to the curious attorney. Back to education. Over the last eight years, the federal government has poured hundreds of billions into public schools. And yet our public school students are not learning more. Enter Betsy DeVos, change agent on behalf of the children, for school choice. Her recent Central Florida appearances at St. Andrew Catholic School in Pine Hills with Trump, and at Valencia College, were the sounding bell for education transformation. One of the things she ought to do is more fully engage and empower principals of public schools. Ever notice how athletic coaches in sports and CEOs in business get so much attention? It’s because the effectiveness of any organization can appropriately be rolled up to the one individual in charge. He/she sets the culture, which sets results. Bill Belichek for the dynastic New England Patriots; Steve Jobs for iconic Apple; Oprah for Harpo Inc. Yet in recent memory, principals have been given short shrift within our national dialogue about childhood learning. They matter. Principals need more power. In last year’s Teacher’s Plus poll, nearly 75 percent of public school principals in California admitted to having to fire a young teacher, who was more qualified, rather than a senior teacher. Do you hear that nonsense? It’s called Last One In, First One Out, and it must stop, in the name of common sense. LIFO is a swamp gadget, designed by teachers’ unions, to keep backwater in place, undrained. The attorney sipped his club soda, nodding in agreement. Bob McClure, president of Florida’s free-market think tank, the James Madison Institute, puts it this way:“Hire great principals, pay them well, give them the tools to do their jobs and then get out of their way. Americans will be positively amazed at how quickly students start learning more.” Consider asking your local public school principal this question: “If you could wave a reasonable magic wand, what would you ask for, to enable your students to learn more?” If you receive a response that is less than inspiring and august, like I did, then something’s wrong — the consequences of which we’ll continue to endure. Also consider watching the movie, “Lean on Me.” Morgan Freeman’s performance is powerful as a struggling public school principal; the message is illustrative of the important theme our secretary of education should expound upon. Finally, I studied the face of a recent protester, standing in front of DeVos' vehicle, prohibiting her entry to hold office Day 1 and make change. It appeared the individual enjoyed being the victim of the situation, as handcuffs were appropriately affixed. I asked my temporary companion, who also vividly remembered the incident, "Was that protester really for the children?" Wryly, he smiled back. We then said goodbye. John L.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for the S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links at the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1) The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2) the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now. These days only, I generated close to $36k so far with nothing but my computer and some free time, however i have a full-time nine to 5 job. Even everyone new at all to this, can make $50/per h undoubtedly and the income may go much very high over time... This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they? Adil Tajgeer Looks like a 256gb card and some on ear akg bt headphones Scott Looks like AT&T's BOGO deal requires a TV package :( TechGuy22 sounds good really expensive but if i can sell my s7 edge for around 300 then i'd be good Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ WITH an additional line mind you. looks like a great device....but has battery improvements been made?? seems this will have the same lackluster battery the S7's had. Not that they were horrible, in my eyes, they couldve/shouldve been better. TechGuy22 also bootloader better not locked PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan It is, if you want that don't bother with Samsung TechGuy22 the exynos will be unlocked. the s7 edge is unlocked running remix rom Corey W. Man that $50 Gear S3 is a killer deal even with the $5/m for 24months, that's only a $170bucks headpiece747 Too bad Verizon is not offering that I would get the S8 and S3 in a heartbeat if they did. Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market. Marty The back looks like my Note 5. Nothing different. kapilmachi S8 is all about the front side. Marty ...except for the fingerprint scanner. Analyst_NYC So if i am already an AT&T customer, I can get buy 1 get 1 free (bill credits)? ArrTooDeeToo Meh Margaritas Ante Porcos Still no word on TouchWiz? Did they make it lighter or does it still suck as always? TouchWiz is the only big thank in Samsung phone that makes me look the other way. Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability? Good_Ole_Pinocchio #Unlocked https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f4745c019aae7e3c05746af0e61186e5fb91f093c06fdbaea6e834c1cf1ea30a.png Barron Roth Any downside to getting this version? Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean it's fully unlocked and has the bands for all carriers...... But the unlocked S7 still doesn't have nougat....So theres that. Leonardo Baez You will get updates faster on an unlocked device than a carrier one Good_Ole_Pinocchio No. The US Unlocked models still don't have nougat. All the carrier variants do. Leonardo Baez I bet you that will be an upgrade OTA on the first week after unboxing it Good_Ole_Pinocchio Bro I'm taking about the unlocked S7 from last year lol. Daniel Tiberius Yeah that used to be the case but not anymore. :-( Mike O Probably the best... but those are looking at a May release. Eddy Nelson Lopez Look at the model number, if it ends with the letter U do not buy it if you care about software updates, if the variant ends with the F then do buy it, that's the best variant to receive Software updates and rhe Fastest thanks to the exynos processor. Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year. Eddy Nelson Lopez You're right, the U is the bad variant, the X is the variant they use for Demo purposes at the stores. Leonardo Baez Quick and dirty preview from Casey Neistat. (He works closely with samsung and got a preview sample unit) https://youtu.be/n0makpckS8c Maybe is the unfinished firmware or something else.... but the image quality of video and pictures looks better in the iPhone. Maybe something that can be corrected with an update? Jay Quir Not going to lie I have recently thought about going from cricket to att because of their direct tv cell phone plan bundle. Yet still trying to see if it will save me money in the long run. Anyone have that plan and dont mind saying how much they pay a month for it? Ailín Ó’S Irish pricing (probably same in the rest of the EU.) S8: €799.99 S8+ €899.99 Interestingly there's a network here (3) which will sell the phone 8 days before general release if someone preorders. Must be preordered by 12/4 however which means the phone will be available on 20/4 instead of 28/April. Richard Markert 95xU news? Mr. Robot "Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173" I strongly doubt there's much interest in the S8 by 20173 ;-) brgulker Is it just me, or is that fingerprint sensor in just about the worst possible spot imaginable? Who likes fingerprints all over their camera lenses!?!?! Bonedatt It's just you 😉 Wildcard Funny, if this were a HTC phone, you guys would have been killing them over the pricing Bonedatt Yea but htc screwed themselves. Always one step forward two steps backwards. They just started listening again to their customers. A little too late if you ask me, but I wish them well. I'm a fan of their designs. dblock Really on the fence about getting one of these. They appear to be quite nice, but I don't know if I want to lock myself into Verizon or not. Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus? I had to double check, but it looks like they're ripping off Apple's naming scheme now? Cakefish What suffix or prefix would you give the larger model? Daniel Tiberius Ultra!! Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using. Suresh Aryal There was Galaxy S2 plus years before iPhone plus. AQ Samsung previously used + on the S6 for the larger screen version (S6, S6 Edge & S6 Edge+) because you could get a 5.1 inch S6 with the Edge screen back then. Dllemm It would help their credibility if (A) they were upfront about pricing and (B) acknowledge that most people use phone cases in their marketing and build the back of their phones more rigid. Daniel Tiberius Anyone know if I can still use Jump On Demand on T-Mobile for this? Flo R.

It's terrible... G6 or S8?! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Ju kidding me mon? S8 or S8 Plus. G6 is nice, but not worth $750. iluvthesoftsoft One Plus 3T, and save $300-$400. Bonedatt OP3T... That's the equivalent (processor wise) to the G6. Eddy Nelson Lopez I can't believe people still buy phones from US carriers, that's the stupidest idea you can have, just buy the european variant at full price and forget about US carriers controlling your software updates and Just use a pre-paid company like Simple Mobile. lomsha You do that and let others make purchases as they wish.

Both the progressive pro-immigrant and rightwing anti-immigration parties and movements propose easy answers and attack their adversaries with political invective. Both left and right engage in a losing war, based on historical omissions, abstract and muddle-headed assumptions and destructive proposals. I will proceed by outlining a framework to understand the political, economic and security implications, which form the centerpiece for confronting immigration. The Past and the Present A serious discussion of immigration begins by focusing on the centrality of time and place, encouraging the flow and absorption of immigrants. In the past, immigration flourished during periods when countries experienced: (1) rapid productive growth; (2)increasing labor demand; (3) trade unions and organizations capable of integrating new (immigrant) workers and protecting the on-going wage rates and conditions for all; (4) cross sectoral labor co-operation and solidarity lowering conflict between immigrant and native workers; (5) inclusive, equitable welfare programs; (6) local, not global wars and (7) violence confined outside of the US and the EU. During these periods, most immigration was confined within Europe and North America or between them. These conditions could not eliminate competition and conflict but they limited its nature and time frame and allowed for successful integration. If these conditions formed the basis for relatively peaceful immigration, their absence has intensified conflict amidst an increased flow of immigrants. This process has produced deep political problems. Progressives, who cite past ‘Ellis-Island’ type immigration experience and ignore the unfavorable current socio-economic conditions, are in denial. They dismiss the vast socio-economic and political changes, which have occurred and which make the absorption of new waves of immigrants extremely difficult. Mass Immigration and Imperial Wars The vast majority of refugees today are on the move because of Western wars. These wars are ‘total’ wars, designed to obliterate civilian, as well as military institutions and structures. In the last two decades, the US and EU have launched seven wars devastating the lives of once-cohesive and productive families, their homes and farms, jobs, institutions and security. Millions have been driven into exile. The vast majority of new immigrants are refugees from countries targeted by the US-EU and their suffering has no visible end. During and after the Second World War, refugees suffered greatly, but were generally absorbed or repatriated and integrated into re-constructing their homes and societies. These favorable transitions were aided by an acute post-war labor shortage (over 40 million, mostly men, were killed in WWII) and the economic demands of post-war reconstruction. Western peace movements in the post-WWII past were effective and succeeded in limiting the scope and length of wars. Such peace movements no longer exist. Wars today are designed to be endless and total – in terms of the destruction of civilian infrastructure and national institutions. Over the past 2 decades, the peace movements have disappeared. This is largely because the US and EU increasingly rely on the use of devastating bombing campaigns by their air and naval forces, which sharply limit Western casualties. Most anti-war movements were sustained by domestic anger at their own soldiers returning in ‘body bags’. Current domestic economic conditions have sharply deteriorated. Capitalist regimes have imposed brutal economic policies increasing unemployment and low paying temporary job. Joblessness approaches 50% among young workers in Southern Europe – regions flooded with desperate refugees. Moreover imperial policies have shifted steadily to increased military spending for wars while imposing austerity measures, slashing social programs at home. In this context, new immigrants, especially refugees from imperial wars, compete for diminishing public resources and drastically reduced wages. Their competition effectively drives down the wages for all workers – sharply increasing the conditions for brutal exploitation. The intense competition over jobs between native workers and immigrants is the result of capitalist wars and deliberate domestic economic policies to pay for these wars. This creates greater insecurity and hastens the downward mobility experienced by workers and the lower middle class. In the past, such pressures and conditions led to workers protest, resistance and class conflict. Today, trade unions cease to unify old and new workers into a strong organized force to confront the worst excesses of capital. Trade union membership has declined precipitously. The union bosses have exchanged militancy and independence for self-serving alliances with capitalist politicians. Trade unions do not protect the basic interests of workers and their families – they follow the lead of the ‘progressive’ pro-immigrant parties which are an arm of the militarist capitalist ruling class. The workers are not racist when they resist further deterioration in their income and living standards: They are trying to protect their jobs, benefits and social programs for their families – in an environment of increasing insecurity and capitalist exploitation. In the recent past, workers could rely on stable jobs and increasing wages because of the strong manufacturing domestic economy. These same workers, who are now labelled as ‘racist’, generally accepted immigrant workers at their plants and in their neighborhoods and schools. But this was in the decades before droves of refugees and destitute immigrants fleeing US-EU wars and destruction came to be viewed as threats to their livelihoods and children’s future. Unlike the past, when international capital brought extracted raw materials back to the imperial country to be processed by local manufacturers, today US and EU multi-nationals have relocated their industries to overseas low wage countries, undermining jobs and living standards at home. Commercial importers and retailers, like Wal-Mart, re-employ the displaced workers with offers of minimum pay, no benefits and contingent work. ‘Free Trade’ is not really ‘trade: Rather it is the easy outflow of investment and jobs and the retention of profits overseas in tax-havens. US government-subsidized, high-tech corporate agro-exports have decimated ‘Third World’ farmers, forcing mass immigration of displaced peasants who then form a base to compete with domestic workers and lower the wages in the US and EU. Progressives falsely argue, ‘ex post facto’, that migrant have merely taken the poorly-paid, unpleasant jobs that local workers rejected. The reality is more complex: In a previous era, most immigrants quickly moved into decently-paid jobs and were generally accepted by US workers. Once, US meat packers were well-paid workers supported by militant unions. Over time, the unions lost key labor struggles and capitalists reduced wages, in some cases by fifty percent. What had once been well regulated and strictly protected workplaces deteriorated dramatically. This decline was accompanied by the influx and hiring of low wage immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Today, the meat packing industry is among the most dangerous work environment where even immigrant children are employed. The same pattern of deteriorating wages and conditions and replacement by immigrant labor has occurred in landscaping, construction, the garment industry, transport, retailing, plumbing etc. What has most recently pushed millions of young workers to migrate from their homes are the series of destructive imperial wars. These devastated the domestic security situation, erasing any functional national military and police structures as well as the possibilities for jobs and a stable future for young people. Former military commanders and soldiers, whose families have been torn apart by imperial US-EU wars and stripped of all dignity, have little choice but to join resistance fighters, such as ISIS in Iraq, or join the waves of refugees. The US and EU invasion forces and puppet regimes have systematically destroyed any secular, democratic, nationalist or socialist parties and movements in the targeted countries, in their drive to divide once cohesive nations into tribal client states. In their place, violent Islamist and ethnic resistance movements have sprung up to fight the invaders and their puppets. This is the natural and predictable result of the imperial policy of destroying modern states on a massive scale. Since multiple imperial wars in contiguous countries have destroyed all hope for refuge and new lives within the war-torn region, the new violent Islamist movements have adopted their own ‘international strategy’. Since the imperial wars were launched from distant imperial capitals in Washington, London and Paris, using bombs and missiles, the Islamists have little alternative but to base their military and terrorist strategies within civilian populations, leading to massive casualties. The violent jihadi attacks against civilian targets in the West are not specifically religious or directed at capturing economic resources or power. The objective is to gain political influence among the growing and marginalized immigrant population in Europe and to undermine the capacity and willingness of the EU and US to continue these endless wars. In the neglected immigrant neighborhood, there will be growing numbers of sympathizers for the ‘attackers’. This will increase demands by angry and frightened citizens in the West who have increasingly accepted the nationalist political solution of ‘draining the lake’ (immigrants) to catch the ‘fish’ (terrorists). Anti-immigrant politics and anti-terrorist police activities become inter-mingled with growing domestic economic insecurity and the sense of cultural and national displacement experienced by traditional homogeneous working class communities adjacent to large enclaves of immigrants. Increasingly severe ‘austerity’ policies, imposed by neo-liberal governments, greatly inflame the situation. The so-called, liberal pro-immigration parties and movements ignore the fragile socio-cultural fabric of the local communities. They have done little to protect vulnerable communities from capitalist policies of literally dumping immigrants into areas and regions which cannot support or absorb them. The political leaders of pro-immigrant parties are generally far from these communities and immune to growing competition for scarce jobs and resources. For many politicians, bureaucrats and even NGO administrators, ‘their immigrants’ are domestic workers, cooks, baby sitters, gardeners, who directly serve the most comfortable strata of society. In contrast, the masses of uprooted refugees and immigrants live close to local workers, compete for jobs and share crowded clinics, social services and schools – under conditions of increasing scarcity. The ruling class collaborates with highly domesticated trade union officials and certain ‘coopted’ second generation immigrant leaders to ‘pacify’ this domestic discontent through multi-cultural programs and mandatory diversity training sessions for workers and neighborhoods, without ever having to actually confront the class issues of deteriorating living standards and the loss of future job prospects for the children of local workers. Working and lower middle class communities will naturally close ranks on ethnic, regional and religious bases, because they lack principled class leaders. They are susceptible to the appeals of nationalist-populist or anti-immigrant leaders and politicians, despite these parties long association with the hard right. With the notable exception of French leader, Marine Le Pen, who skillfully combines a deep understanding of French socio-economic trends with her restrictive immigration policies, the majority of Western populist and anti-immigrant politicians channel the widespread resentment over downward mobility among native workers to blaming ‘the immigrants’. The virulent media attacks and charges of ‘racism’ made by liberal politicians and intellectuals against the downwardly mobile workers, who have been devastated by neo-liberal policies and the broad consequences of imperial wars, do nothing to combat imperialism and class exploitation. They certainly do not help the immigrants. Denunciations of the marginalized American workers and rural citizens, who voted for US President Donald Trump, by the middle class intellectuals, living in the more comfortable and urbanized coastal states, show a deep misunderstanding of the fundamental changes occurring in the country. In Europe and the US, employees and activists, connected to liberal NGOs, flock to immigrants like carrion birds, carving out their own little careers ‘educating’ immigrants and entreating the local residents of deteriorated neighborhoods to join in ’sharing’ the dominant ruling class-directed celebrations of ‘diversity’ ( or the ‘multi-culturalism of suffering’). Conclusion Immigration in the 21st century is significantly different from past waves of migrants. It is highly manipulative to compare the current displacement of millions of war refugees with ‘Ellis Island’ in the US or the post-WWII situation of massive reconstruction in Europe. Immigration today is a direct product of imperial wars, where murder, injury, terror and deliberate shredding of social institutions have forcibly displaced tens of millions of people – the immigrants. Meanwhile, in the imperial countries, crass capitalist exploitation, the export of capital and jobs, and austerity have aroused the anger of workers and lower middle class employees, whose living standards have sustained significant losses. The forced merger of two enormous waves – the millions of dispossessed refugees and migrants and the marginalized and increasingly threatened workers and citizens in the West has become the key focus of the deepening conflicts of capitalists and workers in the US and the EU. Progressives and reactionaries alike obfuscate the fundamental class issues by diverting public attention to the issue of ‘racism’ and ‘immigrants’. In the long run, the West must face this dangerous phenomenon by organizing broad and militant anti-imperial peace movements to prevent the wars that produce these waves of desperate migrants. Trade unions, co-operatives and local or national social movements must organize the under-employed, unemployed and underpaid workers to combat the loss of jobs, the pillage of national wealth, massive capitalist tax evasion and the de-industrialization of the national economy. Banks must be nationalized, and education and health care should be publically funded and replace the current massive public budgets for war. Immigrants, who decide to settle in their new countries, should seek to fully integrate, reject dual citizenship and dual loyalties and denounce organizations that act as “fifth columns” for overseas ethno-religious states of all persuasions. Uprooted people must ultimately choose to remain and fight over flight. They must engage in resistance to imperial occupations in their homelands instead of choosing abject submission and indignities abroad. The role of citizens in the West is to support these struggles by opposing the militarists among their own political leaders. There are no easy answers for mass migration but there are clear causes and proposals for the future. ← Media’s Orwellian Newspeak To Justify Violence – OpEd India In Africa: Can The Tortoise Catch Up? – Analysis → James Petras James Petras is the author of more than 62 books published in 29 languages, and over 600 articles in professional journals, including the American Sociological Review, British Journal of Sociology, Social Research, and Journal of Peasant Studies.

Vudu Disc-to-Digital goes mobile: scan your DVD collection and convert it to digital for a fee [Updated] Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/23 6:12am PDTMar 23, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares142 Applications News Update 1: 2017/03/23 4:23pm PDT The app changelog is now up: WHAT'S NEW **Introducing Mobile Disc to Digital – Convert from your phone!** Use your mobile device to convert your Blu-ray and DVD discs into Vudu has offered a Disc-to-Digital service for a while for those who wanted to convert their physical DVD and Blu-Ray movie collection to digital. However, the service either required you to pop into a Walmart with all of your discs in hand or download the app on your computer and insert discs one by one to verify that you own them. Now, the option is available on mobile. Through an update to the Vudu app, which doesn't seem to be live yet, Vudu users will be able to scan the barcode off their DVDs and Blu-Rays and let the app offer them the digital version in return. There are a couple of catches though plus a fee to pay. First, the service only has about 8000 movies in the catalogue now, so you may run into one or many that aren't yet supported. For example, Disney's movies aren't available, but you shouldn't have problems with Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, or Warner Bros. Second, you have to physically be at your billing location because the app will request a GPS verification to make sure you're at home scanning your own collection and not strolling through a store and scanning everything on the shelves. Third, there's a limit of 100 titles per year per account, which seems like a reasonable way to avoid potential abuse from those who manage to get around the location limitation. As for the price, it costs $2 to convert a DVD to SD or a Blu-Ray to HD, but $5 to upgrade a DVD to HD. One complimentary conversion will be offered for Vudu users to try out the service.

Available beginning today, March 23, at 12:00 a.m. EDT, Mobile Disc-to-Digital turns DVDs and Blu-rays into digital movies* with a simple scan through the Vudu app. These movies can then be viewed on hundreds of Vudu-enabled devices including televisions, Blu-ray disc players, gaming consoles, streaming players and through the Vudu app on phones and tablets. Over the past several years, Vudu has seen increased demand for its offerings that bridge physical and digital entertainment, including its in-home Disc-to-Digital service and InstaWatch, which automatically sends customers a digital copy of eligible DVDs or Blu-ray discs purchased at Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. “The average movie collector owns nearly 100 DVDs and Blu-rays.** We know these customers have invested a lot into building their physical movie collections,” said Jeremy Verba, general manager, Vudu. “As more and more customers create digital libraries, we are constantly looking for ways to help them unlock additional value from the movies they already own.” Mobile Disc-to-Digital works on iPhones and Android devices and is available for nearly 8,000 movies from Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Additional titles will be added in the coming months. Movie fans can convert a DVD to SD or a Blu-ray disc to HDX for $2. To upgrade DVDs to HDX, it will cost $5 per title. All Vudu users will receive one complimentary first-time mobile conversion. Mobile Disc-to-Digital conversions must take place at a customer’s home / billing address. Mobile Disc-to-Digital works in three easy steps: 1. Scan – Navigate to Disc-to-Digital in the Vudu app and scan the barcode on the physical disc case. 2. Convert – Choose SD or HDX. Submit one title or scan all of your movies before submitting. 3. Watch – Watch your movies on any Vudu-enabled device. “Like Walmart, at Vudu we’re always striving to save our customers time and money,” added Verba. “Our Mobile Disc-to-Digital service is a key part of Vudu’s broader effort to make digital entertainment access simple and convenient.” For more information on Vudu, visit www.Vudu.com. *Customers need a free UltraViolet account in order to use Mobile Disc-to-Digital **Fox Media & Tech Tracker - 2016 About Vudu With more than 100,000 titles that can be watched on movie lovers’ favorite devices, Vudu gives users anytime, anywhere access to favorite movies and television shows.

Justin W Same thing that prevents you from walking into a store and scanning an on-the-shelf DVD you haven't purchased: nothing. F4LL0U7 The GPS feature prevents you from doing it at the store, but you could take a photo at the store and then do it at home. I don't really care enough to go through that hassle, but I'll definitely do the one complimentary conversion to try out the service. Impulse_Vigil I'm curious what does the location feature check for... Cause my billing address is a P.O. box a couple miles from my house. Zorn85 ...well presumably it will check to see if you are at the billing address, which you wouldn't be if it's a PO Box. They may not even accept PO Boxes as billing addresses for that very reason. Impulse_Vigil Vudu does, at least in general, it might error out for the purpose of this service tho. Hasn't gone live so can't very well try it and find out... Gregory What's a billing address? Brett What's a horse shoe? What does a horse shoe do? Are there any horse socks? Is anybody listening to me? Gregory You might be joking, but I genuinely have no idea what a billing address is. Internet search reveals that it's "an address to which you receive your credit card statement", but I've never seen a "credit card statement" in my life either... Matt Do you know what a shipping address is? Demitrius Harris Everybody knows that... clearly, a shipping address is a speech given to an audience of ships. Clearly. My1 well putting credit cards aside, you probably have to register with an address in case any bills or whatever may arrive, and the app will check whether you are at your registered address. F4LL0U7 Everybody my age pees their pants, it's the coolest disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O The address your credit card is registered on. tehboogieman UPCs for DVDs and Blurays are easily available online just like almost any movie that's on this list, Don't even need to go anywhere. I guess it's a way for pirates to launder their movies, but hardly seems worth it to pay for something a person is willing to "steal" Justin W Ah, missed that part of the article. Still, it's quite stupid to assume this would stop anyone from trying to get discount movies, as others have mentioned UPCs are available pretty much universally online. Impulse_Vigil You still need to pay per disc, so I imagine between the 100 movie cap and the cost they've crunched the numbers on possible losses... If you're going to all these trouble you'd probably just pirate it thru p2p anyway. Demitrius Harris Some people rather not steal, no matter the cost or savings. Impulse_Vigil You're misinterpreting my comment, I never justified stealing or pirating... Shoot I commented I'd be trying this out, I *still* buy BDs and even CDs. What I'm saying is that the companies behind this are aware there'll be a certain amount of people trying to game the system and they probably already crunched the numbers on potential losses... Plus they know that pirating a movie online is still much much easier, so they don't need to put so many safeguards on this system... Not that many people are gonna go around scanning barcodes with pretend addresses in order to steal online copies of a movie. Demitrius Harris Thank you for clarifying and yes, I misunderstood what you meant. HeyRadar Honestly, $2 (or $5.00) is a fair price for a media-less video anyway. Why digital and physical copies stayed the same price, was just price fixing. My1 I would agree if this is offline and without annoyances, but I have experienced too much of the bullshit happening there to believe that that would happen. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Or you could just do it yourself at home using Handbrake. FernandoRocker But you could theoretically stream the Vudu movies from anywhere, not just locally. Impulse_Vigil Yeah that's one advantage... Uploading a bunch of rips to a cloud account or streaming them from home is certainly possible but more of a hassle. slayer91790 Then that's were Plex comes into play. mog386 But with handbrake you can't get hd versions of your DVDs. With Vudu you can get the HDX copy for a bit more. Which is perfect if you have a giant DVD collection that you never got rid of... Like me. Matt But you can't take a picture of a dvd in a store and put the picture into Handbrake. Shagnscooby Headline probably shouldn't imply you can do your whole collection for free when you only get one. A bit click-batey. DEKKER Read again: "for a fee". marcusmarcus2 I hate how articles headlines are click-batey when I don't read them. How dare they. Reading is hard. /s SHunter Couldn't you jus go to the store and start scanning barcodes? Just price checking! /wink cajunflavoredbob Settings > Developer Options > Enable Mock Locations Yes. Yes you could. You could also do a Google Search at home for the DVD box art, which would get you the barcode at home. If they block mock locations, root users can move the mock location app to /system. However, for all this hassle of trying to game Vudu as a service, you could also download the films illegally and not be restricted to Vudu's service. Point is that there are always ways around the artificial road blocks set up by media companies. Illegal is illegal. Choose your poison. Nathan J Well, you're still paying $5 for HD or $2 for SD. The fact that you supposedly bought it on DVD doesn't really matter. I mean, does it really? You could have bought the disc used for however low. You could have borrowed it from a friend. The idea that they made money on the first sale of the DVD is beside the point. They're selling you access to a DRM-locked digital file for $5. It's not an unfair price for the consumer, and it's straight profit to the rightsholder. I don't think you can really cheat them, since you're paying either way. Unless it's the free copy, which I'm guessing Vudu pays for. But they're paying regardless, and they don't see a single rusty red cent of the DVD's initial sale, so it doesn't matter (much) to them. Or at least it shouldn't. My1 you dont even need mock location, you also could just take a picture of the DVD with barcode and take a picture of that picture to scan the barcode, or you check google images. teh Jax Now I just need this to work on my HDDVD titles! jm9843 I did this in-store one time and they treated it like a DVD. So the 'conversion' to HD was a little more expensive ($5 instead of $2). teh Jax No shit?! That's pretty awesome! brararsh At first I read it as "Scan your DVD collection and convert it to digital for FREE". My Bad. :) Max Johnson Me too. Why the heck would I want to do it for a 'fee' when I can do it for free myself. enoch861 Well your first conversion is gratis. So there's that. Jeff Beck Keep in mind if you convert 10+ movies at a time you get a 50 percent discount, bringing the cost down to $1 a movie or 2.50 for an HD upgrade if you are using a DVD copy. I converted all the titles I could from my own library a couple years ago. I love not having to use discs anymore and my collection is available almost anywhere through VUDU. marcusmarcus2 Nice catch. Robert Preston It appears they sadly ended that promotion, finally. Josh The standard (long standing) 50% off for converting 10 titles at a time has now expired. Now, newcomers to D2D who use the mobile app to convert titles, get 50% off of 10 for their first conversion only. Previous users get 100% off their first mobile conversion, for a single title. Chris Griffin "Ok." - Plex users mjholtzem So it looks like this service is backed by UltraViolet, so that means discs that you convert with this service should be available on other UltraViolet clients such as Flixter right? enoch861 I believe so. But don't quote me on that. mjholtzem Any clue how that might work with "hdx" titles? enoch861 On other services it'll show up as HD since Vudu is the only one that has "HDX". As far as I can tell any Blu-Ray is redeemed as an HDX title. All my Blu-Rays I've redeemed (with the UV code) show up as HDX. mjholtzem If that's true this is actually pretty compelling Josh Yes, about UltraViolet and Flixster Video. Richard Branches Wish we could have this in other countries, I remember Vudu was planning to go internationally starting with Mexico but it didn't work out, which is sad 😞... Josh When I travelled, I was able to get it working with a VPN connection. Also Hola Unblocker worked in Chrome. Leonardo Baez Limitation of 100 titles per year.... But I have a 450 titles collection. (Dvds plus blurays) Jeff718 Pay again to have access anywhere without carrying around a DVD player. Nathan J Anywhere? So you can download the files for offline use and watch on an airplane? Or anywhere you have unmetered broadband access? Because there is a pretty big difference there. Not trying to be snarky here. I am unfamiliar with the Vudu service. I do have a couple movies up there. Since I started buying Blu-rays, a couple of them have had the digital HD option. (Pro tip, never do Google. They only offer SD copies. Found that out the hard way with Independence Day. Digital HD copy? Google is an option? Oh, Google only offers it in SD? And I can't change my mind and use Vudu instead? Well that sucks!) ProvoAggie They do allow offline playback. You can download them using the app on your tablet, phone or PC. br_hermon I doubt it but... does VUDU allow you to download the files locally so you can store them and play them via VLC, Kodi, etc? Is there DRM? or is it proprietary, and you can only view them on VUDU's servers (streaming)? Japzone It's just like all the other VOD services like iTunes, Google Play, etc. You stream from them, and they have a few apps that support offline playback. Plenty of DRM layered on as required by Hollywood. Jeff718 I toss my cases and put my discs in a binder. Am I screwed if I want to use this service? HeyRadar You may not be able to use the smartphone app, but you can still use the service using a PC, or taking your discs to Walmart. Course, you could probably find the UPC on the internet. Josh Note that the in-store Walmart conversion service ends on April 1. Mr. Robot Sounds like there's no conversion involved. This company just sells you those movies in digital form for a lower price because you already own the physical discs. But the article misses some important information, f.e. what format you get and if there's DRM or not. I bet there is. Japzone It doesn't miss anything. This is clearly about Vudu, a popular VOD Streaming service owned by Walmart. Everything is streamed and DRM protected, with some apps that support offline playback. Just like every other VOD Streaming service out there that deals with Hollywood content. Mr. Robot Sorry, not everybody who reads AP is from the US. I have never before heard of this service and as I said, the word "conversion" is a bit misleading IMO. And even after your answer I still don't know the format. Is it h264, hevc, VP9? Japzone There is no user accessible format. The content is accessed like Netflix. You stream using their website or apps, and the apps have a DRM protected offline function so you can store videos offline for a flight or trip. The user never gets direct access to the files. Sorian >400 dvds and blu-rays.... yeah... that's expensive for now. RyanT I'd say about half of my collection came with digital copies, would be nice to eventually have the other half digital as well, not to mention upgrading those awful old DVDs. Motoinsistor It's live now, just showed up for me in settings pfmiller Doesn't work for me. Tried my free conversion and it app just "captures" your UPC before you even have a chance to line up the barcode. Even if you manage to get the barcode lined up in time it always reports that it can't find the UPC. Michael Scapp I tried this today, and I got an error message every time. Still buggy, hoping it gets better with updates. My1 is this thing US only? would be great to convert my anime collection over. but probably the digital version is either online only and/or riddled with DRM Skeeter P I added some the first night. Now I tried to add more and it keeps saying location has to be same as billing address. It won't work. I didn't move from night before?? Powered phone off. restarted. checked location Button nothing helps. Any ideas?

(TBI)   (TBI)Elizabeth Thomas and Tad Cummins are seen in this composite photo. (TBI)   (TBI) View 1 more image (Newser) – The wife of Tad Cummins, the Tennessee teacher suspected of kidnapping his freshman student, has filed for divorce. WHNT reports marital misconduct and irreconcilable differences were listed on the complaint filed Friday by Jill Cummins, who was married to Tad for 31 years. Cummins, 50, and his student Elizabeth Thomas, 15, have been missing since March 13 and were last caught on camera in an Oklahoma Walmart; the video was taken March 15 and released Friday. Jill, who Heavy reports works in the same school district as Tad, pleaded to him directly in a press conference in March, asking that he return the girl safely. "Tad, this is not you. This is not who you are. We can help you get through this," she said. "No matter how far you've gone and what's happening right now, God's grace is sufficient for you, and he wants you to come home." According to WSMV, Jill's lawyer issued a statement Friday asking the media to respect her privacy as she navigates this trying time. "The filing of the divorce complaint is the first step to removing Jill from this situation. Jill will attempt to move forward with her life. This is a difficult time for her and her family." (The DA says it's possible Cummins is now in Mexico and posing as a missionary.)   View 1 more image My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   10% Hilarious 12% Intriguing 37% Depressing 20% Brilliant 10% Scary 12% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 58 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 58 comments GreenLED Apr 2, 2017 11:29 PM CDT Another disgusting Christian who's willing to write off child rape.

As US President Donald Trump's administration threatens to dismantle vital environmental protections, some of which have existed for decades, business leaders are increasingly recognising - and acting upon - the need for environmentally sustainable policies. Trump, who once called climate change a Chinese hoax intended to weaken the US economy, has already repealed the Stream Protection Rule, which bars coal producers from dumping waste into waterways. Next on the chopping block may be the Clean Power Plan, which limits greenhouse-gas emissions from generating plants - by far the country's largest source of CO2 emissions - with the goal of cutting carbon pollution from the power sector to 32 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Trump administration has even threatened to back out of the Paris climate agreement, to which the world's governments committed in 2015. A decade ago, business leaders would have largely welcomed such regressive environmental policies, which can lower costs and expand opportunities, by reducing constraints on their companies' behavior. But today, even as markets respond bullishly to Trump's "business-friendly" pledges - not just deregulation and tax cuts, but also a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would include reviving coal - business leaders have remained cautious. In particular, they have strong reservations about a potential withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success. Some are already making their voices heard on the matter. Since Trump's election, nearly 900 companies and investors, many of them American, have signed an open letter, "Business Backs Low Carbon," calling on the administration not to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. These companies, which include large multinationals, believe that failure to build a low-carbon economy would jeopardise America's prosperity. There is compelling recent research to support this view. Last month, a study by Energy Innovation showed that elimination of the Clean Power Plan alone could cost the $600 billion and cause 120,000 premature deaths by 2050. By contrast, efforts to build a more sustainable economy would bring far-reaching benefits. A December 2016 report by the Risky Business Project, led by American CEOs and former municipal and federal leaders, shows that savings in fuel costs from an 80 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 could exceed the required capital investment by $150 billion. Last January, the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, which I chair, estimated that companies could unlock $12 trillion globally in revenue and savings by pursuing sustainable business models. Such models can also create up to 380 million jobs by 2030 in key economic sectors, including food and agriculture, energy, transport, health, and municipal government. In the energy sector alone, the opportunities are valued at $4.3 trillion. Today, Walmart is a leading commercial solar and on-site renewable-energy user, deriving about 25 per cent of its global energy consumption from renewable sources. (The company's goal, set by Scott, is to rely entirely on renewables.) By increasing the efficiency of its US fleet of trucks, Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tonnes of CO2 from 2005 to 2015, and saved nearly $1 billion in 2016 alone. Another US company, Mars, Inc., is on a similar path. A signatory of the Business Backs Low Carbon letter, Mars is working to eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions entirely by 2040, through greater efficiency and investment in renewable energy projects like wind turbines. The company's CEO, Grant Reid, is also a member of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission. But, while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy (a central message of our commission's report), the private sector cannot do it alone. Government must be an active partner, helping to scale sustainable activities by creating market conditions that spur a "race to the top" and unlock the finance needed to keep America competitive and innovative. So it is not enough simply to oppose Trump's environmentally damaging policies; businesses need to get his administration on their side, so that the US authorities create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and green innovation. Such an environment could include carbon pricing, which a growing number of businesses are pursuing internally, and tax credits for carbon efficiency. Trump's own businesses have benefited from such government interventions. As the New York Times recently revealed, in 2012, Trump secured nearly $1 million in energy-efficiency incentives and low-interest loans from New York State. A groundswell of support from CEOs, on a nonpartisan basis, could be the key to spurring the needed action. Before the Paris climate conference, politicians knew that environmental activists wanted a deal to limit climate change; arguably, what ultimately drove them to act, however, was finding out that CEOs and boards felt the same way. Business leaders need to show Trump that they are not cheerleaders for coal, pollution, and global warming. They are determined champions of environmentalism that is in the interest of all their stakeholders - customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities in which they operate.

Hartford Magazine Home Living Spring Cleaning's Dumpster Dilemma: Should It Stay Or Should It Go? The Dumpster Dilemma DAVID HOLAHAN It is not exactly Sophie's Choice, but agonizing for my wife and me all the same. Should we toss our only child's eighth-grade notebooks, like garage-variety trash, into the dumpster parked in our driveway? He doesn't need them anymore — he is nearly 30 — but still. How about his great green "Hulk Hands," which yet proclaim, "Hulk mad!" when pressed emphatically against another's proffered cheek? There are hundreds of such decisions for people like us with way too much stuff. It's not nice stuff, stuff that would inflate our net worth when applying for a loan. It's just a lot of stuff. And this isn't our first dumpster, or second. In our defense, there is some construction waste in this one, from a basement renovation project, and neighbor Rob graciously topped it off with some of his basement detritus. Returning a dumpster with any air in it is borderline un-American; I recently helped another neighbor fill his to the brim. We also left a perfectly good glass desk for the taking at the top of the driveway, where it remains at this writing. It's been a while between dumpsters. But when accessing the washer/dryer in the basement became akin to navigating the Minotaur's Labyrinth, it was time to clean out the Aegean Stables — to mix mythic metaphors (try saying that three time fast). However, which stuff would we mere mortals toss? Years back my wife and I deliberated long and hard over whether to keep the NordicTrack that neither of us had used in more than a decade. It went. This time around we ponderously pondered the value of a mess of Walmart-quality cross-country skis that we hadn't donned since the '90s. Global Warming notwithstanding, they will remain. Part of our problem is that we have plenty of room for stuff. Besides a full basement, our property has an ancient barn and a stone garage with an attic that the previous owner, an old farmer, packed with things that might come in handy. A contemporary of his once explained that everyone in the neighborhood knew Ignacy would happily accept any and all castaways, whether banged-up garage doors or rusty scythes without handles. He had survived the Great Depression and wasn't leaving anything to chance. After clearing out Ignacy's substantial legacy, we began establishing our own. As credit card-carrying members of the throwaway society, we buy way more things and rip through them faster than Ignacy's generation did. My parents, for example, had the same bed for more than half a century. My wife and I have gone through a number in half that time. And like Ignacy, we, too, have acquired things over the years that we thought for some reason or other might become useful at some time or other for something or other. In hindsight many of these decisions seem indefensible, like accepting the "gift" of that glass desk that friends no longer (or never) wanted — and that, as yet, no one else seems to covet either. Nor does all of the stuff that has to go live in the basement or out in outbuildings. Our books and CD collection are overflowing all over the living room, not to mention dozens of vinyl albums crammed into a cupboard. The continuing existence of said LPs is essentially moot (and mute) since we don't own a record player anymore. We'll keep them, of course. Only a Philistine would throw away a perfectly good collection of songs by that one-hit wonder Bob Lind. The books present more of a dilemma. Is throwing away a book, even one that is torn, faded and dog-eared, the same as burning it? We filled many boxes and dropped them off at the local library, where the staff was less grateful with each sortie. And how about books we haven't read and don't want to read but should have read, like "Ulysses." This opus must be self-pollinating because we have four copies, all in pristine condition, as if none of us had laid a hand on them. Of course, a landfill is arguably too good for some titles: like "Done Like Dinner," a book of recipes by a pro hockey brawler. The unpublished novelist (me) slam-dunked the published pugilist's opus into the dumpster with extreme prejudice. But others were saved, including an account of the feuding Hatfields and McCoys authored by my great-grandfather. A book of poetry that includes one written by my mother is a keeper, of course, even though it seems to have been liberated from a library in upstate New York. Hulk Hands are still here, too. Not for our son's sake, but for ours. Copyright © 2017, Hartford Courant Obits e-Newspaper Breaking Sports Video Politics Community Most Viewed 47°

The TBI confirmed Thomas had been spotted at a Walmart in Oklahoma City in the first official sighting of the 15-year-old and the man believed to have abducted her. Surveillance video showed Thomas alongside Tad Cummins, a former teacher who authorities suspect kidnapped her, in the store March 15. Fifty-year-old Cummins, who appeared with significantly darker hair, could be seen purchasing food. The surveillance clip also appeared to show Thomas with red hair — a departure from the lighter hair shown in TBI issued photos. Read: Elizabeth Thomas Knew Something Bad Would Happen Before Disappearance  This is the first official sighting of the two. Numerous others have produced false leads. Cummins is believed to have kidnapped Thomas March 13, just after a student reported seeing him kiss her inside a classroom. The school had been investigating the relationship between the student and teacher since before they disappeared, but both denied anything inappropriate was occurring, according to CNN. Authorities told the public recently that the relationship between the two was “not a romance.” “She is 15, a child. He is 50, a grown man. She’s a high school freshman. He’s a former teacher. This is, and was, not a romance,” TBI director Mark Gwyn told reporters Tuesday. “This was manipulation solely to benefit Tad Cummins. This is not a fairy tale. This is a case of kidnapping.” In the days following her disappearance, Thomas’ brother came forward to say that she had an inkling something bad was going to happen when she left the house March 13. James Thomas told reporters that his sister said she was heading out that afternoon, but that if she wasn’t home by 6 p.m., someone should call the police. “She didn’t think she was going to be gone that long, I guess, because she did expect to be home by dinner that night,” he told reporters. TBI urged the public to be on the lookout for a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license tags reading 976-ZPT and to report any relevant information to 1-800-TBI-FIND.

The modest James S Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House fills with about a hundred journalists, half in the fixed seats, half standing in the aisles or at the back. Each lunchtime there is an expectant murmur, like a theatre audience before curtain up. TV reporters stand at the front, each speaking directly to camera and contriving to ignore the others standing inches away. Seconds after they sign off, in walks the star of the show: Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. The thickset 45-year-old will often begin with a genial pleasantry – “Hope everyone had a great weekend, seriously,” he said last Monday – that belies the vituperative fusillades set to follow. Many men and women have stood at the podium but there has never quite been anything like this for event television. Deflect and distract: Sean Spicer pivots to Obama in escalating Russia scandal Read more “Sean Spicer has gone almost to a hundred days with standing room only and I find that many people stop me on the street and say, ‘I saw you on Sean Spicer’ as if they’re saying, ‘I saw you on Doctor Who,’” said John Gizzi, chief political correspondent at Newsmax, one of the conservative outlets now regularly called upon to ask questions. This was a vintage week for viewers. On Tuesday, Spicer expressed his frustration by saying: “If the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that’s a Russian connection.” He also clashed with reporter April Ryan, admonishing: “Please stop shaking your head” – a churlish comment that earned rebukes from Hillary Clinton and several journalists (Ryan herself tweeted: “Lawd!!!!”). The following day Spicer gave Ryan the opening question, perhaps in coded apology. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Let the tweet speak for itself’: Spicer on Trump’s Freedom Caucus attack – video On Friday he repeatedly berated reporters for focusing on Donald Trump’s alleged links to Russia rather than the president’s allegation that Barack Obama’s administration leaked classified information about him. Maggie Haberman of the New York Times tweeted: “This is the most SNL yet of these briefings” – a reference to TV comedy show Saturday Night Live, in which actor Melissa McCarthy parodies Spicer’s gum-chewing aggression with a motorised lectern that wreaks havoc. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘I don’t talk so good’: Melissa McCarthy impersonates Sean Spicer on SNL More haunting words came from David Frum, a senior editor of the Atlantic and former speechwriter for George W Bush. “The Spicer show is so fascinating precisely because he remembers when he used to have a conscience,” he wrote. “And the memory troubles him.” Spicer has been in a harsh spotlight ever since the first full day of the administration, when he stormed into the briefing room and angrily insisted that the crowd size at Trump’s inauguration was bigger than Obama’s, which it was not. Since then, some distracting neck ties and verbal tics have emerged. On Friday he used the word “interesting” 10 times in an hour. A week earlier he lectured reporters – “You guys are so negative!” – over the healthcare bill, which collapsed within hours. Another day he told them: “At some point, I would implore, urge, beg some of you to use some of your investigative skills.” But perhaps Spicer’s most trusty line, covering for an unpredictable and itchy-fingered boss, is this: “The president’s tweets speak for themselves.” ‘It’s like mimicry’ It also emerged this week that Spicer is well-off. Financial disclosures released by the White House showed he held investments in McDonald’s, Walmart, Coca-Cola and Exxon Mobil and appears to have taken out four mortgages in the first 60 days of 2017, acquiring Trump’s taste for property deals. Small hand of government: Trump's aim to shrink the state pleases conservatives Read more Indeed, at times he appears to be channeling his pugnacious master. Michael Cornfield, associate professor of political management at George Washington University, said: “The stuff with April Ryan replicates what Trump did on the campaign trail. It’s kind of eerie in that respect. It’s like mimicry.” Cornfield said he has been watching press secretaries since Ron Ziegler, spokesman for Richard Nixon, but Spicer is unprecedented: “If we’re talking about how do we try to find a context to understand Spicer, we either have to go to fiction or we have to go to his boss, because a long line of predecessors behaved very differently from this guy. “Past press secretaries have shaded the truth or even lied but it’s usually just been on one subject or two. Spicer gives out misinformation on everything. The other big difference is how aggressive his behaviour is, which Melissa McCarthy has spoofed terrifically. He attacks. “The others when they have to shade the truth have been defensive, which is not to say they haven’t been antagonistic – they have – but Spicer is a soldier and he’s attacking people.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mike McLintock, played by Matt Walsh, in Veep. Photograph: HBO Even in TV comedies such as Veep, Cornfield said, there is not quite anyone like Spicer. “When Mike McLintock, the press secretary played by Matt Walsh, has to say something untrue or he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, it’s always played for comedy. He gets flustered. But when Spicer gets flustered, there’s this level of antagonism and aggressiveness that’s not fun.” Frank Rich, an executive producer of Veep who is also a writer-at-large for New York magazine, agreed that Spicer’s daily briefings are a unique phenomenon. “Like everything else associated with Trump, including the president himself, watching is a form of entertainment,” he said. “Some people hate-watch it, I guess some people watch it with admiration, some people in my case watch it in the way one might watch a train wreck in the presidency. “It’s been fascinating. It’s certainly something no one alive has ever seen in Washington before and it’ll be interesting to see how every fictional version of Washington on television, including the one I’m involved with, looks in relation to it to viewers.” Spicer’s conduct has also generated comparisons to authoritarian regimes. In January Andrew Beatty, White House correspondent of Agence France-Presse, nodded towards the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, tweeting: “Honestly, covering Mugabe was more straightforward than this.” This week, Beatty explained: “Just in the sense that any question is considered an affront and their automatic response is to fight, which for the Russia investigation, for example, exacerbates the sense that they’re covering something up … they fuel suspicions by behaving suspiciously.” ‘It’s a TV show, you’re playing your part’ The White House press corps have tussled with the new administration over changes they believe limits access and transparency. In February, Spicer’s decision to hold an off-camera briefing with a select group of reporters – with several outlets barred – sparked an intense backlash. Concerns have also been raised about the growing prevalence of off-camera briefings at the White House, which in previous administrations have typically been reserved for when the press secretary is travelling with the president and must brief reporters aboard Air Force One. There has been speculation that Spicer prefers it when Trump is not watching. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump speaks with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in the Oval Office with, from left, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, vice-president, Mike Pence, chief strategist, Steve Bannon, Spicer and then national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Beatty said: “You can tell the difference in his behaviour on days when Trump is holding a meeting at the same time as the press conference. He’s much more relaxed, much more subdued, joking around, and you can see some days at the beginning he was getting notes and his behaviour changed when he received the notes. There were a couple of times when he left the podium very abruptly.” Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under Bush from 2001 to 2003, believes televising the briefings is part of the problem. “Just because it makes for juicy TV doesn’t mean it’s good for the republic,” he said, noting that the behaviour of both parties – the press and the press secretary – is by nature more theatrical when the cameras are rolling. The end result, he argues, is that the press secretary has to be “exceptionally guarded”, knowing the president is watching: “You have to look for moments or openings to deliver a juicy line with panache. Trump and Spicer’s remarks about British ‘wiretapping’ are absurd – and dangerous Read more “And reporters, knowing their colleagues and editors are watching, become more confrontational. The conversation can often be convivial, but when it’s live on TV it becomes far more adversarial. It’s a TV show, you’re playing your part.” Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary for six years under Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush, said there is another key factor in how the briefings have evolved under the new administration: the president and his extraordinary war with the media. “The one everlasting fact about the briefing, in whatever form it takes, is that it always reflects the president,” he said. “Certainly the biggest factor with President Trump is that he has a totally different attitude about how to conduct himself, the role of the press, and the fact is he is a combative president and therefore his press secretary is also combative.” Fitzwater was quick, however, to recall a conversation he once had with one of the doyennes of the White House press corps. “Helen Thomas used to tell me, ‘Remember, Marlin, that the only thing we care about is the president and your value is only in your ability to reflect the president.’” Topics Sean Spicer Donald Trump Trump administration US politics Republicans US press and publishing analysis Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

With new logos, Perimeter cities join the branding boom Many of metro Atlanta’s corporate giants, from Coca-Cola to UPS, attract customers with instantly recognizable brand logos. In turn, cities marketing themselves as hometowns for such businesses are trying to stand out with their own brands, with new city logos popping up everywhere from Perimeter Center to Peachtree City. Dunwoody and Sandy Springs are among the local cities that have recently created new city logos at considerable cost in time and money that they figure will pay off with economic development. The new Sandy Springs city logo. “A city is a business,” said Sharon Kraun, communications director at the city of Sandy Springs, which recently spent more than $175,000 on a package of six logos and related illustrations for its government and its City Springs downtown redevelopment. “We are a business. We are attracting other businesses to come.” The city of Atlanta is the old-school holdout, its post-Civil War emblem of a phoenix reborn from ashes remaining essentially unchanged from its adoption in 1887. That logo appears everywhere, including on the city’s economic development handbook that tries to sweet-talk businesses into moving to Atlanta and staying. But the city also built a distinct economic development authority, Invest Atlanta, that has a modern logo of a stylized “A” in the blue-and-green color scheme that is popular in recent city logos. The Atlanta phoenix logo. Atlanta also had a “New Coke” moment of a branding change gone wrong, according to former Mayor Sam Massell, who now heads the Buckhead Coalition. During his administration in the early 1970s, he said, the city introduced a redesigned phoenix intended to look modern and cosmopolitan, as Hartsfield-Jackson airport began running its first non-stop international flights. The logo didn’t fly, he said. “We weren’t really international,” Massell said. “We were talking bigger than we deserved.” Getting a city’s brand spot-on is “just a hard, hard job,” Kraun said. Indeed, the new Dunwoody and Sandy Springs brands are in part replacements for previous logos that didn’t work so well. The new Dunwoody city logo. In Dunwoody in 2010, the city and the Convention and Visitors Bureau paid a branding company $105,000 for a logo that was immediately derided as a confusing copycat. It featured a star that looked like an asterisk and became known as the “Walmart logo” for its similarity to the discount retailer’s symbol. As much as the City Council wanted to change the logo, it was even more eager to avoid spending more money on another one. This year, three Dunwoody residents who head marketing and branding firms — Jay Kapp of Kapp Koncepts, Mike Martin of Jackson Spalding, and Heyward Wescott of Custom Signs Today — did pro bono work to produce a new logo. Their final design is the city’s name in blue with a curving green brushstroke beneath it. “We went with a very safe design,” Wescott said, while Kapp added, “We didn’t want to see the city go through another round of a logo that people didn’t like.” A big difference city logos have from corporate counterparts is that they must try to represent an entire diverse community and their costs must be justified politically to city residents. Dunwoody was able to say its new logo was free, but the design team said their volunteer effort had a market value of around $30,000. The City Springs district logo. Sandy Springs took some heat for spending nearly $100,000 on its new city logo, the primary version of which is three blue-and-green brushstrokes. That was on top of $77,000 spent on branding its new “City Springs” downtown area anchored by a $220-million public-private development — a name that private developers are already imitating. Kraun said it’s true that various websites will design a custom logo for $500. But, she said, cities get what they pay for, including market research, vetting of designs and creation of alternatives and spin-off logos to use in other formats. Sandy Springs got six separate designs and a branding guide to using them. “If it was just to draw that one icon, yes, a hundred thousand dollars would be a lot,” Kraun said. “The cost for us was not just that icon. … It’s not just something you put on a T-shirt.” Sandy Springs presented its branding companies with complex challenges. Its previous city logo, depicting a river and trees in shaded colors, was popular, but it was a nightmare to use in different sizes, colors and applications. The replacement had to be not only more flexible, but also had to match well with the new City Springs brand — an abstract, fountain-like image — that, in turn, has a more specialized goal of drawing residents and customers to downtown. The $100,000 included several designs integrating the new city logo with other images for such special uses as the parks department and the city’s new performing arts center, which is set to open next year. One of the new illustrations is specifically for economic development marketing materials. It shows the city logo wrapped around the Concourse Center’s King and Queen skyscrapers, the icons of the city’s Perimeter Center big-business hub. That is not an official logo, but an image that may be used in marketing materials as well as serving as an inspiration for other versions later. An illustration created for Sandy Springs economic development marketing, showing the city’s new logo combined with the King and Queen skyscrapers. The cost included “how we were able to take something so iconic and wrap it with the brand,” Kraun said. “From an economic development perspective, we’re tying all the pieces together.” Businesses ultimately base their location decisions on measurable factors such as demographics, community amenities and tax incentives. Does a city logo really matter? Are cities creating them mostly because everyone else is? Kraun likened the value of a city brand to a basic rule in the public relations business: “‘No comment’ is a comment. No logo is also a logo. … It’s a calling card.” Kapp said the logo serves as a foundation for a city to build its brand value upon. “A logo is what you make of it, how you use it,” he said. “Of course you don’t want a logo with [the cartoon typeface] Comic Sans. But what’s in a brand? The reason Coca-Cola is as well-known as it is, is not because of a logo.” About John Ruch Mail | More Posts (1034) Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Morgan William knows that. The biggest shot of her life left her hand, and then floated like a song up to her dad. "Play with me, Mr. Donnie," William used to say when she was three years old. "Play with me." William is the point guard for Mississippi State who made the winning basket against Connecticut on Friday in the Women's Final Four. Many are calling it the biggest shot in women's basketball history, and regardless of whether or not William and her Bulldogs defeat South Carolina on Sunday night in Dallas for the championship, her buzzer beater in overtime against UConn will go down as one of the game's most memorable. Coach Geno Auriemma and his UConn Huskies had won 111 games in a row before being undone by the 5-foot-5 point guard from a working-class suburb in Birmingham. If she wasn't the darling of March Madness already, William now enters the national championship a star. She learned the game from her stepfather, Donnie Rory, who, at 44 years old, died from a massive heart attack less than two months after William led Shades Valley to the 2014 AHSAA Class 6A girls' basketball state championship. William thought about quitting the game after that, according to her high school basketball coach. It's a good thing for America she did not. We would be less without her. William, all 5-foot-5 of her fearless frame, is from Irondale. Down the road a piece is the childhood home of another famous basketball player with an indomitable spirit, Charles Barkley. William and Barkley are now east Birmingham basketball royalty just like Bo Jackson and Jameis Winston are the kings of west Birmingham football. Every great athlete has something in common. They all had someone who showed them the way. Florence Bond made her son, Vincent Edward Jackson, bring home good grades before he could step on the football field. For Winston, it was his father, Antonor, who pushed him to greatness as a quarterback. A mother and grandmother, Charcey Glenn and Johnnie Mae Edwards, molded Barkley's attitude. For William, it was her stepfather, Donnie, who walked into her life when she was little more than two years old. All little Morgan wanted to do was bounce the ball with the man her mother, Monica, was falling in love with. "Play with me, Mr. Donnie," Morgan would say. "Play with me. And Lord knows there were enough balls in the house for it. You know those cheap plastic balls that stores used to pile into the wired-framed bins? Little Morgan had to have a ball every time she went with her mother to the Beacon Drive Walmart in Irondale. "From the point Morgan could start talking, every time we went to the store she had to have a ball," said her mother, Monica. "I had a living room full of those. Morgan had to get a ball everywhere we went, and the ball was bigger than her." There were balls in the kitchen. There were balls in the bathroom. There were balls in the halls. Everywhere in the house, Morgan's plastic balls were underfoot. When Donnie first visited Monica at her home, the first question he asked was, "'Why you got all these balls?'" He would learn soon enough. "Play with me, Mr. Donnie," Morgan would say. "Play with me." And so he did. And from that moment the two never stopped. Donnie was a former fullback for Samford, so he knew a budding athlete when he saw one. Locked inside Morgan's little frame was something special, and gifted. He knew before anyone else. Morgan's lack of height and size didn't bother him. After all, Donnie had heard it all before. Growing up, everyone told him he was too small, too, and that label fueled him. He trained harder than his peers, and earned a place at Samford. So it would be the same with Morgan, this tiny girl with an unconquerable spirit he understood all too well. Mr. Donnie began coaching Morgan when she was three years old. During her first basketball game, she stole a ball in the backcourt and scored in her own goal. "And she thought she had done something," Monica said. "My husband said, 'This is going to be a long journey.'" Morgan would later call Mr. Donnie her "coach," but that was after all those AAU games with the Alabama Tar Heels, and all those early morning, 5 a.m., training sessions, and all the cone drills, and chair drills, and wind sprints up hills and box jumps and road trips. Morgan's love for basketball turned into a family affair. "I mean, the whole family made sacrifices for Morgan to be where she is today because when a lot of people were taking summer vacations, we were doing basketball," Monica said. "We were paying for training, and just doing everything to help her be great." Donnie brought two children into his marriage with Monica, so Morgan had siblings to help her hone her skills. For many years, Morgan's older brother, Jalen, was her biggest rival. The two played for hours and hours every day on the basketball goal in their driveway on Janet Lane. Then, one day, Jalen decided he wasn't going to play with his younger sister anymore. He would just stick to cheering her on. "It was back in high school," said Jalen, who is now 21 years old. "I won the last matchup when I was 16, and after that I stopped playing because I knew I probably wasn't going to win again. I had to cherish that moment." Morgan was a three-time all-state point guard for the Shades Valley Mounties. Like his father before him, Jalen wants to be a coach. And he will be, too. He's headed to South Alabama after the Final Four to be a graduate assistant for the Jaguars. Jalen can't stop thinking about his father this weekend. No one can. Donnie has been there every step of the way -- when Morgan scored 41 points against Baylor to reach the Final Four on the anniversary of his death, and when she found space at the elbow with time ticking down against UConn. They know Donnie is there with them, always. He is the angel that played ball with a little girl. "It was just all that he did for us, and how he cared for us not only on the court with sports but all the lessons he taught us," Jalen said. "They just continue to show themselves. He would be so proud right now." Joseph Goodman is a columnist for Alabama Media Group. He's on Twitter @JoeGoodmanJr. Regional Scoreboard College Football | MLB | NFL © 2013 STATS LLC.

No financial terms were disclosed. Among the regional eyecare groups that Acuity has acquired are St. Louis-based Crown Vision Center and Pittsburgh-based Eyetique. PRESS RELEASE DALLAS, March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Riata Capital Group (“Riata”) today announced the formation of Acuity Eyecare Holdings (“Acuity” or the “Company”), a company that will own and operate leading North American eyecare groups and optometry practices. Acuity launches with a strong platform following the simultaneous acquisition of three regional eyecare groups: Crown Vision Center, based in St. Louis, which was ranked by Vision Monday as the 26th largest eyecare group in the United States based on locations; Eyetique, based in Pittsburgh, which was ranked the 30th largest eyecare group in the United States based on locations; and International Eyecare Center, based in Quincy, Illinois, which serves rural communities in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. Acuity begins operations with 61 locations across five states. Acuity will also own a large, full-service digital lab operation, The First Look Lab, that is located just outside of St. Louis. Riata intends to expand Acuity into a market-leading eyecare platform through the acquisition of additional regional eyecare groups and independent eyecare professionals. The formation of Acuity is the second platform investment of the Riata principals in the eyecare sector. From 2011 to 2015, certain of the principals organized and led the very successful acquisition of Vision Source, a market-leading network of independent optometry practices across the United States. Under the leadership of a very seasoned management team, Vision Source grew from 2,300 to over 3,150 locations, making its network of member optometrists second only to Walmart in terms of number of locations. Vision Source was sold to Essilor USA in late 2015, generating strong returns for its investors. Jeff Fronterhouse, Co-Managing Partner of Riata, said, “We are excited to build upon our strong network of relationships, experience, and track record in the eyecare industry to create Acuity Eyecare. We understand the pressures, as well as the opportunities, for optometrists as the industry continues to evolve. As such, we see the formation of larger and vertically integrated corporate entities leading some smaller and mid-sized providers to consider partnering with groups like Acuity that can provide capable business, financial, and commercial support, allowing optometrists and their staffs to focus on meeting the eyecare and product needs of their patients.” Mr. Fronterhouse continued, “The combination of these three successful eyecare groups, that together have experienced higher rates of sales growth than the overall market, provides Acuity with a strong initial base of operations in the Midwest region. Our focus going forward will be to support these groups, as well as others that join Acuity, with the tools and resources necessary to provide their patients with full-scope professional eyecare and the highest quality product assortment and value.” Acuity is led by an experienced and successful management team, including Chief Executive Officer Matt Matthews, the former CEO of Crown Vision; Chief Financial Officer Doug Shepard, the former CFO of Eye Care Centers of America, Chief Merchandising Officer George Gebhardt, the former CMO of Visionworks, Vice President of Corporate Development Bret Davis, the former SVP of Business Development for Vision Source; and other senior executives from the leadership teams of Crown Vision, Eyetique and International Eyecare. Additionally, Acuity has assembled a board of directors consisting of experienced and very successful executives from the industry that will bring valuable insight as Acuity looks to expand. Mr. Matthews noted, “We are excited to be a part of the Acuity platform, which is well-positioned for success with the support of Riata, an experienced capital partner that brings a deep set of industry relationships. In addition to the existing leadership teams at each of the three businesses, we have an impressive team at Acuity that brings substantial experience in important areas including medical eyecare, digital manufacturing and lab management, merchandising, supply chain, finance, and IT. We look forward to the exciting growth opportunities ahead for Acuity.” Glenn Askew, a Riata Partner, commented, “Acuity is well-positioned for growth, and we will look to further expand the Company’s footprint in the Midwest and other regions organically and through the acquisition of additional market-leading eyecare groups and independent optometrists in attractive markets.” In connection with the transaction, HPC Puckett & Co. provided financial advice to Crown Vision Center, Eyetique and International Eyecare Center.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals General  ⋮  Mobile Dark Days Ahead For YouTube After Australian Government Joins Advertising Boycott By Zara Ali Mar 31, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google is witnessing dark days after its inappropriate ad-placement received a major backlash from popular brands like L’Oréal, PepsiCo, and others. Latest entry in the exit string is Australian government which has announced the suspension of all of its advertisements from YouTube. Today, the Australian Government is withdrawing “all non-corporate campaign advertising” from YouTube. This decision is a repercussion of YouTube placing ads on extremist channels and videos that support terrorist activities. Recently, US-based brands like Wal-Mart, PepsiCo, and AT&T discontinued their ad partnership with YouTube along with some UK-based brands like The Guardian. Related Download All New Stock Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ Wallpapers Advertisements from Department of Health to Defence Force recruiting ads by Australian Government will no longer appear on the video-streaming website. However, this does not include ads from government-backed corporations like Australia Post. Australian Government is not the first one to assert suspension; even British Government followed the same drill to oppose YouTube’s inconsiderate ad placement tools. Google also released a statement earlier, stating that it will work on its ad-placement techniques to make sure that this behaviour does not continue but just a statement is not enough to keep the brands hooked. British Government suspended its ads after they were featured on videos from Klux Klan leader David Duke. Advertisement Commenting on the decision to withdraw ads from YouTube, Australian Special Minister of State Senator Scott Ryan said, it would block taxpayer money from “inadvertently flowing to unsavory organizations” via YouTube. “The Australian Government… will continue to request updates from Google on the steps being taken to mitigate risks,” he added. Sighting the bulk exit from its ad programs, Google says that it is already performing an “extensive review.” Of its advertising policies. And it expects to “give brands more control over where their ads appear.” Related April Fools’ Day Heads Up! Don’t Fall For These Too Good To Be True Pranks By Tech Brands Given the exodus from YouTube advertising, we hope that Google thoroughly reviews everything that is wrong with its ad-placement tools and policies. If it fails to make amendments, then we can expect more brands to take the exit route as the display of ads on extremist videos not only harm the brand image, but it also funds money to trouble groups.

Developer Charles Abshere and consulting engineers Pan American Engineers are seeking a variance to right of way requirements necessary for the tract, which Abshere plans to divide into three separate commercial lots. The lot at the corner, formerly a convenience store/gas station, is under contract to Murphy's Oil, a gas station chain affiliated with Wal-Mart that has plans to build a new facility. Stripes formerly had a store on the site. As part of those development plans, the council approved construction plans last week for 200 feet of 8-inch sanitary sewer line that would ensure sewer is available to all three commercial lots. But Community Services Director Richard Rogalski said engineers also withdrew consideration of the construction plat for the lots development for further consideration. The problem is that city development codes specify street right of way width of 120 feet on principal arterials and section line roads, and West Gore Boulevard and Sheridan Road fall within that requirement. Meeting those stated requirements would mean an additional 20 feet along West Gore Boulevard and 5 feet on South Sheridan Road would have to be dedicated as right of way. Abshere and his engineers have asked for a variance on those requirements because of the impact that loss of land would have on the development. But city planners have said they cannot recommend a variance of that magnitude on West Gore Boulevard, noting the likelihood that the City of Lawton will need that utility easement for a waterline being planned in the future. Planners instead offered a compromise: a 5-foot right of way easement on both Sheridan Road and West Gore Boulevard and another 15 feet of public utility easement along West Gore Boulevard. Parking space could be built over the utility easement, Rogalski said, adding that is a fairly common occurrence. Substantial structures, however, are banned from such easements because the city retains the right to remove anything over utility lines, should repairs or replacement need to be done.

Sunday Apr 2, 2017 at 12:01 AM By Colette Paré-Miller When Alan DeBoer was running for State Senate, he had a reputation as a sociable guy who donated to many local charities, but residents had three major concerns. One was that the biggest corporations and richest individuals already dominate politics. Did it really make sense to send someone like him to Salem, instead of someone who would represent working families, family farmers, seniors and young people? The second concern was that he spoke only in generalities and never could be pinned down on his positions. And the third was that he always had an excuse for why he couldn’t support practical solutions to problems we face — but never had solutions of his own. Unfortunately, those concerns have been reinforced by DeBoer’s two guest opinions in the Mail Tribune since he took office. In the first, published Feb. 19, he complained that too many constituents have contacted him, taking up too much of his time, and he said we just need to “trust” him. When constituents traveled to Salem to talk to him about the affordable housing crisis, he scheduled the meeting for a time when only his staff would be available and he could avoid answering their questions. He also has not found time to heed constituent requests to support bills to make sure all children have health coverage, or that all women have full reproductive health coverage, or that all working people have paid family and medical leave in case of a serious personal or family illness or to care for a new child. But “just trust me” and “I don’t have time for you” apparently is not an answer he gives to the corporate special interests who contributed more than $600,000 to his campaign. Those contributors included not only Walmart, Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America, and the American Insurance Association, but also global fossil fuel companies like Chevron, Phillips 66, British Petroleum and Natural Gas PAC. Sure enough, his latest guest opinion (March 26) carries water for those giant polluters who do not want to see a faster transition to clean energy sources like solar and wind. Nor do they want to see Oregon adopt a program that is working in other states that makes the largest polluters pay for excess emissions and uses the money to invest in clean energy jobs in regions like ours. The bill DeBoer refers to in his column, Oregon’s Clean Energy Jobs Act (Senate Bill 557), would generate $700 million a year from the largest polluters to create good-paying clean energy jobs and save people money on energy bills. It would make solar more affordable, improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses, and increase the availability of affordable housing near bus lines. A similar program in nine northeastern states has already created 16,000 jobs while emissions and energy prices have dropped and economic growth has outpaced the national average. Last year in California, for more examples, that state’s program meant grants to farmers for more energy-efficient irrigation technology that will save billions of gallons of water, and 750 low-income families in the San Joaquin Valley received rebates to replace older, inefficient vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles. Unable to deny the public benefits of this approach, DeBoer’s friends at Associated Oregon Industries, which represents the largest polluters, have turned to what might be called “fake news.” They produced a “study” that calculates the program’s cost based on assumptions that ignore both how it actually works and what the benefits would be. It is probably no coincidence that as soon as the study came out, DeBoer published his guest opinion with similar “fake news. ” Since he couldn’t criticize the Clean Energy Jobs Act itself, he tried to sow doubt about it by writing about problems with an entirely different and separate state program — the Business Energy Tax Credit (BETC). Ironically, the problems with BETC stem from too much corporate insider influence in Salem. DeBoer has yet to show that he is the right person to help fix that problem in state government on any subject. Finally, DeBoer’s guest opinion expresses concern about school funding. He doesn’t mention that he was a leader in spreading misinformation about Measure 97 that would have required the biggest corporations to pay their share and would have prevented pending cutbacks. On each of these issues, DeBoer has a ready excuse for why he can’t support reasonable solutions but has yet to say what he would propose instead. Except to continue to do whatever the biggest corporate special interests want. — Colette Paré-Miller of Medford grew up in Southern Oregon and is a supporter of the proposed Clean Energy Jobs Act.​ About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Reader Services Subscriptions Subscriber controls Contact us Submissions Photos Events Letters to the editor Corrections Announcements Obituaries Story ideas Since you asked Alerts Email Alerts RSS Feeds Text Alerts Advertise Media Kit Home Products and services Ad rates Advertising contacts Mail Tribune Daily Tidings The Nickel Shop Our Valley Blogs Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

SUNDAY SCHEDULE • 11:30 a.m. - Scott Norton Q&A • Noon - Painting and charcoal techniques • 1 p.m. - Kids cosplay contest • 2:15 p.m. - Sean Schemmel Q&A • 3 p.m. - William Zabka Q&A • 4 p.m. - Adult Cosplay Contest Dressed as a fictitious hunter with an intimidating sniper rifle as a weapon, Tom Fulenchek was struggling to keep his cool and not let his outfit fall apart. "Sewing, hot glue, crafting items - a lot of Hobby Lobby and Wal-Mart stuff," Fulenchek said, describing how he put his costume together. "I was just thinking, 'Stay confident, don't lose any of the parts and pieces.'" His cosplay as Mordecai, a character from the video game "Borderlands," placed first after competing against 38 people in the cosplay contest at the 2017 Victoria Comic Con on Saturday at the Victoria Community Center. "My favorite part is seeing the people and their creativity. I never know what to expect," said Bryan Hons, organizer of the convention. Hons said there were about 3,500 people at the event throughout the day. Radio personality and DJ John Pedierna was the host of the cosplay contest and said there were about 500 people on the stands cheering the competitors on. Fulenchek has attended the event for four years since it first opened, and while he has cosplayed before, it was his first time participating in the contest. It took the 30-year-old electrician about 24 hours to create his cosplay, with the supplies for it costing him $150. "I felt pretty confident making this outfit," he said. "I was taking pictures with people, and they kept asking me, 'Why don't you enter?'" Fulenchek likes how different Victoria Comic Con is from other local events because it allows the younger generation to connect and interact with other people. Grace Guera, 14, who attends Victoria West High School, came determined after not placing in the cosplay contest last year. Grace placed third with her cosplay of Rose Quartz from Steven Universe. She said the audience gave her a great experience on stage. "I felt overwhelmingly positive and couldn't help feeling any happier," she said. "Having that many people cheering for you is exhilarating." Leo Sanchez, 20, of Palacios, was among the 500 on the stands. Sanchez said he is usually not the cheering type, but with the supportive hollering coming from the crowd, he could not help but join. "There was a wide variety of cosplays, and people can get pretty into it," he said. "Even some people that dress the same can take a different twist on their characters, which I like." Sanchez said he liked the contest so much he might participate in the future as a Star Wars character. He was positive he would return next year. Sunday will be the last day for Victoria Comic Con, where there will be more cosplay contests for kids and adults to enjoy. Pedierna said the event is something everyone should experience. "Even for people that don't know much about it, it's really cool to see," Pedierna said. "It's important to support local events in Victoria, especially ones with new ideas and exciting things."

HEARTLAND CREDIT UNION is the latest to join the list with plans to open a branch this fall at Sixth and St. Joseph streets, just south of the Route 66 Hotel & Conference Center in the village of Southern View. It will be the fifth Springfield location for Heartland. "We often survey our members, and it's always come up they'd really like to see a facility in that area of town," said Susan Gleason, vice president of marketing for Heartland. "We've always kind of kept our eyes open for a good location." Site work has begun for a full-service branch, including a drive-up. Gleason said the branch would have five employees. Heartland also has branches on West White Oaks Drive, Sangamon Avenue, South Grand Avenue and inside Memorial Medical Center. Gleason said the goal is an October opening. Southern View Village President Nora Petrosky noted that United Community Bank and Marine Bank have long had branches near the busy intersection. The village approved a zoning change for Heartland Credit Union. "It's a good area for us," Petrosky said. Peoria-based CEFCU just opened a full-service branch north of Wal-Mart on Sixth Street, which is in the city of Springfield. Traffic at Sixth and Stevenson ranges from 28,700 vehicles a day south of the intersection to 32,000 north of the intersection, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation. *** One is a hotel. The other, an outlet mall? Construction crews in the past few weeks began moving dirt on the south half of the LEGACY POINTE development at MacArthur Boulevard and Interstate 72. Hannibal, Missouri-based Ehrhardt Hospitality has filed plans with the city of Springfield for a four-story, 80-room Springhill Suites hotel just south of Engrained Brewing Co. A message left at the company headquarters last week was not returned. Ehrhardt first outlined its plans while seeking site changes from a local zoning board in September. Ehrhardt also developed three hotels on South Dirksen Parkway -- Comfort Suites, Candlewood Suites and Residence Inn. Permits continue to come into the city for the long-delayed OUTLETS AT SPRINGFIELD, including now foundation work for the planned outlet mall along the southern edge of Legacy Pointe. Developer David Ober of Pennsylvania-based Global Outlet Management has declined to discuss specifics. The plan for an 80-store outlet mall first was announced in the fall of 2012. *** Groundwork has begun at 2117 Clear Lake Ave. for the 11th Dollar General store in Springfield. Company spokeswoman Laura Sommerville said an early fall opening is planned for the discount retailer. She added that the store would be similar in format to other Dollar General stores in Springfield and would have six to 10 employees. The site is east of the Clear Lake overpass near Clear Lake and Wheeler Avenue. *** THE JACKSONVILLE AREA CONVENTION & VISITORS BUREAU has started a "First Friday Jacksonville" program to highlight local businesses. A variety of locally owned shops will be featured in the first event this Friday. There also will be art exhibits and craft demonstrations. Various businesses will participate each month. A Facebook page has been created for the event, http://bit.ly/2oaEeLs. Additional information also is available from Andy Mitchell with Our Town Books, 245-2665. *** CRAZY 8 children's clothing, shoes and accessories opens Monday with a new boutique format at White Oaks Mall. The store relocated to the lower-level Dick's Sporting Goods wing as part of the change. According to the company announcement, the new look includes updated light fixtures, flooring and aesthetics. Crazy 8 opened at the mall in 2011. Parent company Gymboree Corp. operates more than 300 Crazy 8 stores nationwide. The website is crazy8.com. *** Demolition crews have cleared the site of the former Days Inn, 2900 Stevenson Drive in Springfield. The 160-room hotel had been vacant since closing in 2011. The hotel was on property leased from City Water, Light & Power. Officials at CWLP say they are considering options for the site. *** Ribbon-cutting for the Sherman Area Chamber of Commerce: THE VILLAS SENIOR CARE COMMUNITY, 100 Marian Parkway; new therapy facility and private suites. *** Walls have begun going up for STARCREST CLEANERS at 2025 S. MacArthur Blvd. Plans announced last summer included a cleaning and drop-off facility, and a coin-operated laundry. Starcrest, based in Bloomington, has locations in Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and Nebraska.

Reporter: Tonight, the search intensifying for that Tennessee teacher and the student he allegedly kidnapped almost three weeks ago. Investigators releasing video of the first confirmed sighting of the pair. I feel at least hopeful that I've seen her. Reporter: 50-year-old tad Cummins and 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas captured on this Walmart surveillance camera in Oklahoma City on March 15th, two days after they disappeared from Columbia, Tennessee, almost 700 miles away. The new pictures showing only small changes to their appearance. Thomas' hair dark and red. Cummins' gray facial hair now brown. She looks subservient to him, walking behind him, looking to him. It's a very scary image. Reporter: The two disappeared after Cummins was accused of having an inappropriate relationship with his teenage student. He was putting a lot of planning into disappearing. He searched "What size mattress will fit in the back of a Nissan rogue?" Reporter: Authorities telling ABC news, Cummins packed warm weather clothes, shorts and t-shirts, but now think he could be anywhere. For Elizabeth Thomas. Reporter: Today, in Tennessee, green ribbons at a festival in town, a reminder of the search, and tonight, a symbol of hope. Elizabeth, if you can hear me, please come back to us. Reporter: And there is a $10,000 reward for information that leads authorities to the teen. Investigators say it is important that the tips keep coming. It just takes one to make all the difference, Tom. And again, that video, two weeks ago, yet they still can't find where these two are. All right, Eva, thank you.

SHARE Blotter, April 3, 2017 By Staff Sunday, April 2, 2017 Drunken driving suspected A 59-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man could each face felony drunken- driving charges in separate incidents on March 24 and March 25, according to arrest records. Cindy Lee St. John was arrested near Kansas Avenue and South Rim Drive on March 24 after a caller reported at 8:30 p.m. that a Ford Mustang was “continually changing speeds and driving into oncoming traffic,” according to an arrest affidavit. When Grand Junction Police officers pulled St. John over, she rolled down a back window first, then “repeatedly pressed the door unlock button instead of the button for the window,” the affidavit said. St. John, who police found had five driving-under-influence convictions between 1992 and 2012, told an officer she had smoked marijuana two hours before driving, and refused to perform roadside maneuvers, the report said. In a separate incident the next day, Ricky Hicks was arrested at 2881 North Ave. after two callers reported a drunk man in a blue van at Wal-mart, an arrest affidavit said. When approached by officers, Hicks said he didn’t have a license, registration or proof of insurance. Officers could see three vodka bottles – one full, one empty and one partially empty – on the passenger seat and floorboard, the report said. Officers found seven alcohol-related incidents in Hicks’ background between 1987 and 2014, the report said.   According to the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office: ■ Deputies took a theft report in the 3200 block of C½ Road on May 1, 2016. ■ Harassment was reported in the 3200 block of East Hall Court on Saturday.

I wish someone would file some federal argument to bring before him the whole clouded title fiasco – all across the country this problem will persist forever until someone addresses it. Reply ↓ screen screamer April 2, 2017 at 7:14 am It would seem that the title problems in this country could be summed up as fraud. Clearly BOA had Ms. Green sign off on paperwork long after she had expired and BOA had taken payment of her paupers insurance. The fact that, I believe, and correct me if I am wrong, that all States Attorney’s had signed off on an agreement amongst the large banks to settle claims against them relative to the foreclosures for a paltry $25 billion, meant that home owners are forced to run the gamut by themselves. Add on the insult to injury of not prosecuting these large firms gave them the green light to continue this behavior without remorse as pointed out in many instances by Mr. Black amongst others. With the mention of BOA wanting to appeal this decision means this nightmare is no longer over for these folks and hopefully they may be vindicated in the end. I would also mention that the article does not say anything about their credit score, which of course has been damaged brutally. Hopefully this has been addressed in this case. As an afterthought, I wonder what the credit score of say BOA might be and whether or not we should extend to them the same courtesy when they come groveling to us for their next installment of cash. Would they be worthy of consideration of a massive loan or should we act like a free market society, the kind of which we have never known in our lifetimes, and let them go belly up and revoke their charters to do business. Of course if that happens, we may even rid ourselves of the drug trade that runs rampant in our neighborhoods, but that is a completely different subject matter. Reply ↓ DJG April 1, 2017 at 4:44 pm From the middle of the article by David Dayen: –This unusual candor hints at executive culpability for foreclosure fraud. “The judge signaled something very important here, which every regulator knows,” said Eric Mains, a former FDIC official who left the agency to fight his own foreclosure case. “This kind of corrupt culture can only be maintained with knowing approval from the top executives.”– And this paragraph encapsulates why I think that so much of the bloviating about Trump as the bad businessman is in bad faith. This paragraph shows how many businesspeeps in the U S of A operate. (Carla Fiorina spring to mind?) So much of the tantruming and fainting among the critics of Trump is a false front: American businesses are poorly managed because there has been so much to steal for so long. Trump isn’t all that exceptional. Reply ↓ craazyman April 1, 2017 at 7:40 am Polar Bears in Scotland Fleeing Melting Icecap? — You’ve been April Fooled! Check out what it actually says in the Link.

Every year brings news of sightings close to towns, and even some break-ins at farm buildings. Apparently when the sea ice breaks up they get stranded on one of the ice sheets and float south until they hit the coast of Newfoundland where they scrounge around for food until they head back north or are airlifted out by the authorities.

Reply ↓ RabidGandhi April 1, 2017 at 8:08 am The Paraguay Reichstag Fire is more complicated than what we get from the basic note from DW. First, it should be noted that the proposed term limit extensions were supported both by the current president and by the followers of the president his regime deposed, mildly leftist Fernando Lugo. So boiling this down to an Us Leftists vs Them Oligarchs ain’t gonna work here. Secondly, there is this from curent Minister of Interior Tadeo Rojas, who after trying to ‘splain why his security forces had fired on the crowd with rubber bullets, said the following: Security personnel from some congress members were the ones who started the provocation. Some members of congress came with the intent to start trouble. After the forces were repressed, they came forward with peace overatures, but at the outset, they were the ones who started it. Mandy Rice-Davies applies, but keeping in mind that the Right generally benefits from any democratic disruption, only a cynic would think yesterday’s events had much to do with term limits. Reply ↓ RabidGandhi April 1, 2017 at 8:17 am It’s a slippery slope; if the UK gives Spain back Gibraltar, then Spain will want back Torremolinos, then Benidorm… [canned laughter] Joking aside, the Gibraltar threat is a pretty paltry bargaining chip, mainly because no one will take it seriously.

Reply ↓ visitor April 1, 2017 at 12:54 pm Gibraltar will not be an issue with respect to reintegrating Spain, it will be an issue with respect to the free flow of goods and people with Spain — since Gibraltar is even more vitally dependent on that border remaining open than the UK itself with respect to the EU. The reason is simple: Ceuta and Melilla. As soon as the discussion about returning Gibraltar to Spain will come up, Morocco will immediately raise the issue of getting back those Spanish enclaves. And other countries will support Morocco in its claim — for who wants to allow a single country, even a NATO one, to hold both sides of the strategic Gibraltar straight? Besides, the Gibraltarians (?) might not want to become Spaniards. So yes, the EU will plainly threaten to isolate Gibraltar and let it wither if the UK does not relent on some other points — but it will never ask for Gibraltar back, for this leads to way too many complications. Reply ↓ RabidGandhi April 1, 2017 at 1:32 pm Your point assumes a basic respect for logic that lamentably does not exist in the real world– or at least in the world of nationalist European diplomacy. To see this astounding ability to simultaneously hold two contradictory thoughts I invite you to find a Spaniard and discuss both Gibraltar and Ceuta/Melilla, as you will enter a new realm of cognitive dissonance. Secondly I suggest you ask a Cypriot how congenial the EU is to territorial claims, as it has now been two decades since we were promised that the beneficent EC would never stand a part of its sovereign territory to be occupied by a foreign power. It’s not that your logic is incorrect, but rather that you are looking for logic where none exists. Reply ↓ visitor April 1, 2017 at 2:47 pm The deficiency of EU diplomats does not matter. As soon as a serious discussion on redrawing borders around the Gibraltar straight flares up, the other non-European permanent members of the UNO Security Council will weigh in right in the footsteps of Morocco. The Spaniards’ fancy notions of the national realm will not count, as the decisions to be taken will be way above their pay grade. And the remaining 26 EU countries will in the end decide that that Gibraltar affair is too bothersome, so screw Spain and let us postpone the matter to some indefinite future negotiation — just like for Cyprus… Reply ↓ RabidGandhi April 1, 2017 at 3:09 pm The point is that it is whose territory that is being infringed upon by whom that matters, not appeals to some mythical subjective Westphalisan principles. Thus Spaniards infringing upon Moroccan territory is thoroughly acceptable, while the UK infringing upon Spanish territory is just as Westphalian: because of this accepted European hierarchy. Based on this utter contempt for rule of law by Europe, there is no reason to ever expect that respect for the EU and its lofty (/snark) principles may somehow trump longstanding European hierarchichal precedent. Reply ↓ visitor April 1, 2017 at 3:42 pm I fully agree with your exposition of the territorial situation of UK vs. Spain vs. Morocco and the corresponding precedence of affirmed legitimacies. Nevertheless, I repeat my argument: the real world powers will not accept that one country physically controls both sides of the Gibraltar straight. Morocco’s demands of sovereignty against the remnants of the Spanish colonial past will serve as a perfect vector/conduit/justification with a nicely plausible “rule of international law” packaging for the USA, Russia and China to prevent that situation from happening. Then, whatever internal pecking order is in effect within the EU will simply not matter in that geo-strategic game. Reply ↓ St Jacques April 1, 2017 at 9:56 pm AFAIK Gibraltar’s legal situation is still controlled by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) that was signed at the end of the War of Spanish Succession. Remember, the Grand Coalition (which included the UK, Netherlands, Austria, Spanish Habsburg loyalists, et al) seized Gibraltar as a base for a (failed) attempt to replace the new Bourbon dynasty of Spain (represented by the grandson of Louis XIV) with the Austrian Habsburg pretender connected to the previous Spanish Habsburg line. In the end, the Bourbons got to keep their new Spanish throne and Gibraltar was offered to the British as a consolation prize to get out of the war. This is why Gib can not be legally made part of the UK, since any change in it’s status requires it to be handed back. Anyway, isn’t the Rock’s main industry money laundering for the global elite and corporations, no? I don’t see that in the case of Cueta/Melilla. Reply ↓ St Jacques April 1, 2017 at 10:28 pm I forgot to make explicit the point that Gibraltar’s money laundering business is made possible by its special legal status, while Cueta and Melilla are legally just part of Spain and as such are under the same Spanish and EU laws as any other part of Spain. Hence, I get the sense that this gnashing of the teeth at Spanish perfidy really is driven in large part by those financial interests.

I give him credit for at least taking the market based healthcare to its logical conclusion if you consider health care a market, i.e. it has to have the same rules as a book store, with some penalties for trying to game it. But for those of us who think of health care as both a right AND a public good there are some distinct issues with the whole how do you afford health care if you are not considered poor in a society that has vastly low poverty levels. Nor does it even consider the ability of our for profit medical community to commune on price fixing, and not to mention having some dicey medical statistics to support its right to punish people because you don’t like their lifestyle. IOW, it is past time to jettison any idea of health care as a market. This plan included.

There’s no one he likes to dump on more than those wanton diabetics who refuse to convert to his church of the formerly unhealthy eaters, except possibly illegals who partake of the generous gift of american healthcare for free. Here’s an alternative to his “whereas and shall not plan.” Every provider charges the same price for the same service–the Medicare price. You can have your “free market competition” based on service and results, and adjust your business expenditures accordingly. Nobody has more money to spend than anybody else. If you feel better having an insurance company ration your coverage and write the checks for you, you can pay them for the service, but they can’t pay any more than any other plan. Drug companies can’t charge any more than the lowest price they accept for the same drug anywhere on the planet. The lowest price. Let the drug companies, pharmacy benefit managers and any other hangers on fight it out on how the “profits” are distributed. Not my problem. Strip the ama of its stranglehold on credentialing providers and specifying who can do what. Emphasize primary care specific to local conditions and problems, and put an end to the price-setting by over-abundant, preening specialists deciding how much their services are worth. End all medical / pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising without delay or exception. That ought to shake things up a bit. Reply ↓ cripes April 1, 2017 at 1:03 pm Katniss: I like how you think.

I’ve been watching Walmart “refocus” on ecommerce sales for at least a decade now each time with the declaration that “this time we’re serious”. The strategy always seems to be the same; free shipping on in store pick ups! Which ignores the fact that I don’t want to go to Walmart in the first place which is why I’m ordering online. You don’t necessarily shop from Amazon because it has the lowest prices. You shop from Amazon because they make it incredibly convenient. I can do it from home, from work, on the bus commute, in the middle of a conference call. As an online retailer Amazon really has the “first place to go to” space locked up. I don’t see how Walmart can beat that especially given the perception and actuality of their stores being just really depressing places to be. Couple that with; Amazon isn’t even a retailer, they’re a logistics company. A really good logistics company. Anyone who has shopped online a lot has to have noticed how many other e-retailers ship from Amazon warehouses. So they have multiple revenue streams other than pure retail to rely on not including their hosting services. How can Walmart compete against that? I’m not saying this to laude Amazon. We all know their problems with warehouse employees and their drive to automate every last position they can. But… as crappy as Walmart jobs are, at least they’re jobs. If Walmart succumbs to Amazon how many more unemployed do we then have with no prospect for them of getting something better to replace it? Copy and paste for Amazon vs Macy’s or Sears or the malls in general. It seems this is a dire situation with impending death of a large number of physical retailers and I have no idea on how they’re supposed to compete much less come out on top. God help us all of Amazon decides to go all out on selling something like autos and pushes that sector off a cliff as well. Sorry for the rambling and lack of coherence.

But those self-service kiosks are crammed together, there is no room to put all your groceries and purchases up so you basically have to get yourself another cart and transfer goods from one cart to the other. But they don’t really allow room for two carts – one of your carts will have to block another kiosk. So basically there are kiosks that can’t be used, especially when Walmart is busiest. Since you are bagging yourself, it takes longer, the scanner doesn’t recognize mark-downs, and in general, it is a pretty crappy experience.

Hell, Meridian has slowly consumed most of the local health care on top of it. There really just aren’t many options at all. Add in to this; where do I find the time?

Amazon and its shareholders are more content to skirt by on little profits or losses It seems to me, that the greater risk of either stawk cratering is Amazon. From the linked article: One piece of the battle, executives say, is an Amazon algorithm that works to match or beat prices from other websites and stores. Former Amazon employees say it finds the lowest price per unit or per ounce for a given product — even if it’s in a huge bulk-size pack at Costco — and applies it across the same type of good on Amazon, even when the pack size is much smaller. So let’s imagine Costco is selling a pack of 10 bags of Doritos for $10 — or $1 per bag. Amazon’s algorithm notes that one bag is $1 at Costco and, in turn, lowers the price on Amazon of a single bag of Doritos to $1. That is a great deal for customers — something that is likely driving the decision at Amazon, where an obsession with customer value dominates its strategy. But now, Amazon is selling individual items at Costco prices while not getting the same wholesale price that Costco enjoys. In short, it’s going to be really hard for Amazon to turn a profit on those goods. . . . . . In some instances, Amazon is willing to lose money for some period of time on a product it feels it has to have. Jeff Bezos’s company knows, after all, that it has to continue to increase its selection in non-perishable grocery goods if it is going to really challenge Walmart in the $800 billion category. But, more so than in the past, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure on manufacturers of goods that the online retailer is unable to sell for a profit, executives say. Separate from the algorithm, brands are also facing the realization that their products that are sold profitably in stores may become unprofitable online when shipping costs are factored in. Unprofitable items are known inside Amazon as CRaP products — the acronym stands for “Can’t Realize a Profit.” And Amazon is not afraid to kick off big and small brands alike. A new name for business idiocy, Amazon CRaP Reply ↓ different clue April 3, 2017 at 2:06 am Well . . . people who want their favorite analog meatspace stores to survive will do their shopping at those stores.

Reply ↓ From Cold Mountain April 1, 2017 at 10:26 am On “The Anti-Trump Movement In North Carolina Has The Potential To Flip The South”; This is pure neoliberal self praise and delusion. I live in Chapel Hill, NC (for 17 years) and the separation of wealth here is disgusting. People here call themselves progressives but are fine with developers building “luxury apartments” to solve the housing crisis. Those apartments are going for $1600 for one bedroom. They only care about social issues, but not the poor. The Research Triangle Park is in two bubbles; one is a neoliberal bubble and the other is a debt funded college bubble. When the second bubble bursts, and it will, it is going to be deviating here. Note that Julia Craven, the author, was a student at UNC Chapel Hill, graduated in 2014. So I can only assume she is trying to keep the neoliberal dream alive to help pay off her debt. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 1, 2017 at 1:54 pm One bedroom apartments for $1600? Who rents those? What is essential? Food, including safe drinking water. Health Care. Shelter. Those should be free before free college tuition. The college bubble (debt funded or not,, because robots, H1B visas and job outsourcing) benefits not the students, but those getting paid now via the bubble, with promised money (yes, think of the fantastic careers after graduation) for the students tomorrow. Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 1, 2017 at 6:32 pm One bedrooms in my formerly middle-class neighborhood go for much more than that.

Reply ↓ allan April 1, 2017 at 10:49 am Why old-fashioned highway rest stops are disappearing [USA Today] For more than half a century, old-fashioned, no-frills highway rest stops have welcomed motorists looking for a break from the road, a bathroom or a picnic table where they can eat lunch. But in some states, these roadside areas are disappearing. Cash-strapped transportation agencies are shuttering the old ones to save money, or because they don’t attract enough traffic or are in such bad shape that renovating them is too costly. Or, the stops have been overtaken by tourist information centers, service plazas that take in revenue from gasoline and food sales, or commercial strips off interstate exits. … But advocates of maintaining traditional rest areas say even if motorists are offered flashier options for pit stops, the ones that sprung up as highways did are still needed for driver safety and convenience. Some view them as a tranquil, environmentally friendly alternative to crowded service plazas and commercial strips. … Tranquil? Environmentally friendly? Who are these people? Don’t they know that we were put on this Earth for our three score and ten (plus or minus) to contribute to the GDP? Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen April 1, 2017 at 11:22 am This is a travesty. As an experienced road-tripper, I can state, without equivocation, that there are no better restrooms than those one finds at rest stops.

I can pack my own snacks and drinks in a cooler for a lot less money and a whole lot better nutrition, but you’ll have to pry those clean, fresh air flooded restrooms with tons of available stalls, plenty of soap and hand dryers, and friendly fellow travelers out of my cold, dead hands.

And why the steady increase in the power of the Imperial Overlord? “What makes that such a difficult task is average citizens being deliberately insulated from the effects of militarism. As Daniel May recently wrote in The Nation, ﻿”We don’t want to pay for missions that lack a clear rationale, so the money is borrowed from future generations. We refuse to allow our soldiers to be killed, so the government attacks its enemies with flying robots and outsources much of the fieldwork to private contractors. We don’t want to face the cost of our foreign entanglements, so a smaller percentage of our country is asked to serve, and serve longer.” The horror of Trump’s foreign policy won’t be as immediately obvious to Americans as his domestic failures. And yet any successful resistance to his administration will necessarily have to address it alongside all the other more proximate grievances. The only viable defense against his overreach is a dramatic rebalancing of governmental power. Resistance will mean changing the presidency as it currently functions. Simply being “anti-Trump” isn’t enough.” Note that DeFazio has submitted a “joint resolution” that would at least restore the simulacrum of Congressional control over war-making and commitments of troops — https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/75/text?q=%7B%22search%22:%5B%22War+powers+resolution%22%5D%7D&r=1%22War+powers+resolution%22%5D%7D&r=1 I don’t see this kind of issue on any of the radar screens of the “Stop Trump” efforts that seem all personalilty and little policy except “preserve the status quo and my little corner of the place.” Reply ↓ RabidGandhi April 1, 2017 at 12:29 pm Plus ça change. By 1964 the United States had for all intents and purposes completed the destruction of South Vietnam, obliterating the agricultural countryside and installing a thoroughly compliant puppet regime. In those pre-“Vietnam Syndrome” days (when the US was not so “inhibited” against boots on the ground overseas), there was no covert war as there would be in Central America a decade later; the US obliteration of Indochina was published openly on the pages of the New York Times. There was no antiwar movement because the children of those New York Times readers were not yet in danger of being drafted into what would later be deemed a “mistake” or an “excess of American goodwill”. And when an antiwar movement did eventually arise years later, the problem was not the massacre of over 3 million human southeast Asians; rather the main demand was to save “our boys” from a senseless war. So to the issue of Donald Trump’s reprehensible foreign policy: of course there are not going to be any complaints from the élite, be they red or blue. Because they have solved the problem of the Vietnam Syndrome: maintain the previous destruction of impoverished people abroad without involving the ruling classes at home. Sure we will see copious Kabuki regarding anything El Donaldo does, but just as one does not expect figs from a briar bush, don’t let’s expect resistance from the #Resistance. Reply ↓ Katharine April 1, 2017 at 2:19 pm There was an antiwar movement in 1964, and it was about the wrong of what this country was doing to others.

Reply ↓ RabidGandhi April 1, 2017 at 3:00 pm Katharine, please talk more about this, because the “newly minted radicals” you mention have now become the heroes in the dominantly accepted history, Meanwhile, here’s Chomsky who early on was actually there too: It was not until 1964 when there were the beginnings of real, large-scale escalation that I started trying to talk about it. And it was very hard. I’d give talks in somebody’s living room let’s say, or maybe in a church where there were four people you know, the minister, the organizer, somebody who wanted to kill me, and a drunk who came in off the streets. And this, here, right here, at MIT, if we wanted, there was small group of students interested, we wanted to have a meeting on Vietnam, it would have to be on Vietnam, and ten other topics you know, in the hope, of maybe bringing, filling half a classroom. And it went on like that for a while. In 1965, a friend, and a artist friend and I be trying to organize a national tax-resistant movement, which we did, but we couldn’t get a lot of participation. And a year later, in 1966, more active resistance began, support for draft resistance, other kinds of resistance, and went on from there. By 1967, ’68 it had built up into a substantial movement. But remember, that’s after five, or six years of invasion. To those watching how today’s Liberals jump in front of parades, this should be nauseatingly familiar.

A fella who was frustrated that the Pentagon would not go along with his plan to implant eye-screws in the outer thighs of all GIs, to which wire loops would be attached, with the other ends connected to screw eyes in the troops’ wrists, to limit the swing of the troops’ arms to the regulation 6 inches to the front, 6 inches to the rear as they marched… We actually live on a very large island, don’t we?

The Vault 7 releases, of which only a very small percentage are released thus far, are extremely important, and it would be better to link directly to WL’s press releases on wikileaks.org and to more reputable sources commenting on the releases. Assange’s press conferences and interviews would also be good to link to; I have personally learned a great deal from watching them. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorApril 1, 2017 at 5:07 pm We did link to the Wikileaks release, that’s our first link. And that is what the release said. The longer version of the headline contains a direct quote from Wikileaks: Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer code to hide the origins of its hacking attacks and ‘disguise them as Russian or Chinese activity'”.

And where suns peep, in every sheltered place, The little early buttercups unfold A glittering star or two–till many trace The edges of the blackthorn clumps in gold. And then a little lamb bolts up behind The hill and wags his tail to meet the yoe, And then another, sheltered from the wind, Lies all his length as dead–and lets me go Close bye and never stirs but baking lies, With legs stretched out as though he could not rise.

Interaction with doctors has major placebo effects. And I would not consent to being treated by a robot” Today I went to the funeral of a friend who was mistreated by a human doctor. Eventually we will come to see human doctoring with the same horror as medieval bleeding practices. Just as children today easily transfer human attributes to their robots we adults will eventually and imperceptibly do the same as the machines learn to be us. Reply ↓ Cujo359 April 1, 2017 at 3:53 pm In many places, American medicine is so transaction-oriented these days it might as well be done by robots. When doctors don’t have the time to listen to patients and get to know them, you’ve essentially reduced practicing medicine to a decision tree anyhow. AI? Heck, old-fashioned procedural programming could accomplish that. Reply ↓ nihil obstet April 1, 2017 at 5:58 pm I don’t find major placebo effects from any encounter with the medical industry. To the doctor as well as to the rest of the players, I’m primarily a source of profit. I do not have the information to protect myself; after all, not knowing the problem is why I’m seeing the doctor. In some cases, I get what seems to me the best care. In most cases, I hope it is. And in some cases, I’ve seen that I was being pushed into simply the most expensive care that imposed time, money, and anxiety costs on me. But for all, the emotional effect is bad. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorApril 1, 2017 at 6:06 pm The fact that medicine is a medieval art and there is no scientific research behind many if not most procedures does not change the fact that interacting with a live human being about your ailments is in and of itself therapeutic. And one of my mother’s good friends, himself an MD, died of a hip replacement. Got an infection they could not control. Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 1, 2017 at 8:15 pm Also, touch is healing. There’s quite a bit of science to back that up. Modern human society has siloed how, when and why humans get to touch each other in ways that are very detrimental to human physical and mental health. We are social animals. We need to physically interact with one another to be happy. The fact that this innate drive has been channeled by imperial cultures into men only getting to touch other men when they’re fighting or competing, and with women in power imbalanced, transactional sexual encounters fuels so much destructive behavior. If we had a jobs guarantee, we could improve citizen health just by having people offer hugs and handholding to other citizens. That’s part of what the pet obsession is about. There’s all this need to nurture and touch that gets channeled into creatures one can control. Reply ↓ rdu April 1, 2017 at 6:36 pm I talked with an actual doctor, unlike the people who write these kinds of articles. They said the hardest part of the job is that it is a lot like being a detective. Knowing the right questions to ask in order to get the right information — a lot of which involves observing and responding to nonverbal social queues. We are nowhere close to having a computer or robot being able to replicate that. Reply ↓ Mark P. April 1, 2017 at 8:33 pm And yet AI is already dramatically better at diagnosis than human doctors. We’re going to see an expansion of the role of nurse-practitioners. But I don’t see why anybody would want or think the human component in medical treatment could or should be entirely removed. It’s one of the last industries where employment is growing in the developed world and it should continue to be — if there’s not a global civilizational crash by 2100, the global medical-industrial complex could conceivably reach 20-30 percent of planetary GDP. I hang around the biotech/therapeutics crowd from time to time, and it’s moving very fast. For just one instance, regenerative medicine or directed organogenesis — growing new organs — is already enough of a thing that people are taking the cell engineering technologies developed there and starting companies that apply the same tech to what’s called the post-animal bioeconomy — synthesizing meat. Point is, if regenerative medicine comes on line, by 2035 we’ll see the developed world’s population of centenarians rising; fast forward to 2100 and it’s quite possible that there’ll be hundreds of millions of people one-hundred years or older. This will be at the same time as, short of some magic geoengineering solution, people will be fleeing the equatorial regions of the world because some of them will have become too hot to inhabit and coastlines everywhere will be flooding over. Pace Bill Gibson, not only is the future unevenly distributed, it’s going to become even more so.

Reply ↓ cripes April 1, 2017 at 3:55 pm >RabidGhandi “There was no antiwar movement (in 1964) because the children of those New York Times readers were not yet in danger of being drafted” It gained greater size and momentum by 1967, but that’s not exactly true. At age six with my commie parents I carried an anti-Vietnam War sign, dragging at my feet, up 1st ave in front of the United Nations. I still remember the lunatic faces outside the police barricades screaming “Die, you commie scum” as we marched. The Progressive Labor Party and Young Socialists organized this as the May 2nd Movement. In March, 1965 the Vietnam Day Committee at Berkeley, California, brings out 100,000 people to participate in draft card burning. By 1967, a majority in polls opposed the war and thought it was a losing proposition (assuming the pollers asked if USA would “win”), likely due to the antiwar movement efforts. By 1968 hundreds of thousands were turning out in California, New York, DC, and taking over campuses: Berkley, Columbia, where I also participated at age 10. I’m not romanticising the 1960’s. The war dragged on until the 1973 “withdrawal” and ended with the 1975 fall of Saigon. Colin Powell and others committed grave war crimes and destroyed three countries in the process. The wonder is that Vietnamese patriots never exacted revenge at American malls and transport facilities. Anyway, the anitwar started small and quickly grew to challenge the entire War effort. More than we ever saw with the destruction of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and now Yemen. Would that we had that level of organizing today. Cheers.

Reply ↓ Mark P. April 1, 2017 at 8:50 pm ‘…she, the most prepared presidential candidate in history, lost to the most buffoonish candidate in history, despite having over a billion dollars at her disposal.’ Eh. Reliable word is that she and Bill encouraged Trump to run in the Republican primaries, because they thought Trump would split the Republican base and forestall a more politically viable Republican candidate — as the Clintons understand political viability — emerging. So, that makes Trump only the second-most buffoonish presidential candidate in history, doesn’t it? Truth is, from Hillary’s incompetent attempt at healthcare reform in 1993 — and Bill’s nauseating ‘you get two for the price of one’ line — to her incompetent stint as State Secretary when she blew up Syria and caused the deaths of a half-million people just so it would look good on her resume when she ran for president, she has been disastrously incompetent at everything she’s ever done, except grifting. And even there she keeps getting caught. Reply ↓ kimsarah April 2, 2017 at 2:38 am Have you been reading Russian propaganda sites?

Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 1, 2017 at 6:49 pm CalPERS’ Pension ‘Myths’ Busted California Political Review. From the article: The average full-career pension for a CalPERS retiree is actually $71,402, Ring showed. From a Motley Fool article, May 1, 2016: Income Category 2013 AGI Top 1% > $428,712 Top 5% > $179,759 Top 10% > $127,694 Top 25% > $74,954 Top 50% > $36,840 Bottom 50% < $36,840 … So, the question is that: Is that $71,402 correct? A retired person, hopefully mortgage fully paid, children all grown up, and especially if covered by Medicare already, has more money per year in retirement than approximately 75% of the earners in the nation? If that figure is correct, we need huge wage inflation for wage earners to catch up with those who no longer need to earn wages. And for private sector retirees, triple or quadruple their current Social Security payments (I think I am projected to receive about $1,500* a month when I retire in 10 years…if I am lucky enough to be able to afford that). *Not enough for $1,600 one bedroom apartment today, in some places (many places?). Time for “Free Senior Apartment” Will our over-80 senators give that a thought? Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorApril 2, 2017 at 12:52 am Even if the figure is accurate, it’s seriously misleading because….how many people stay in a job for their entire working life to get full benefits? The state troopers are the most likely ones. Also, government employees now on average are more highly educated than private sector employees, so you’d expect correspondingly higher retirement pay. Moreover, these pension benefits were explicitly traded against wages. Until the post crisis era (and let us not forget a lot of municipal and state employees were fired in the wake of the crisis, back to my full benefits point), everyone understood what the deal was: you could go into a private sector job and get more pay, but with more risk. The gap between what MDs in university hospitals and lawyers working as judges, prosecutors, or in state/local legal jobs versus their private sector counterparts is ginormous. So basically these people voted for low risk, their bet paid off, and everyone is mad at them. Reply ↓ Jess April 2, 2017 at 1:30 am The huge difference here in CA is that back in the 1990’s the state, under pressure from the unions, unilaterally made a retroactive increase in the pension formula from 2% of final salary times years worked to 3%. Initially is was only for law enforcement, but soon pressure from the unions saw it expanded to many more classes of workers. Immediately, pensions increased by 50%. A $40K pension overnight became a $60K pension. At higher pay levels it was even more obscene: $100K pensions became $150K. And, of course, there was no going back to have jurisdictions retroactively put more money into the funds. In addition, up until a couple of years ago when the voters passed a pension reform measure, imminent retirees could scam the system in all kinds of ways. Massive overtime was a favorite, esp. among law enforcement, because it boosted the final year salary figure on which the pension was calculated. We currently have sergeants and regular officers in our local PD who earn as much annually in overtime as they do in base pay. The next city over had 3 meter maids who make $140K a year. Same for unused vacation pay. Say you were entitled to 3 weeks vacation at $2K per week. You skip the vacation, work and get paid for those three weeks, then have the $6K you didn’t take added to your pension formula. Then there’s the COLA adjustments, which found some retirees, after a few years, taking home more in a pension than they earned while working. And more than a few jurisdictions entered into sweetheart deals with unions where they also paid the employee’s AND employer’s contributions to SS, resulting in an average additional $19K/yr for those retirees. And to top it off, until outlawed by the aforementioned pension reform measure, workers were retiring on Friday and coming right back to work on Monday as independent contractors doing the same job and getting both their regular wages and their retirement. Others retired, collected their pension, and went to work for related departments in other jurisdictions. And all of these things that are no longer permitted cannot be retroactively changed, so the damage done before is still eating into budgets every month and every year. My mother retired after 25 years with a modest CalPers pension plus SS from her previous work in the private sector. She went batshit crazy in her later years over what she considered the scandalous manipulation of the retirement system.

In this new role, he will report to Andrew Gumpert, Paramount’s chief operating officer. “I’m thrilled to bring aboard a seasoned executive like Dan, who was the force behind some of the most important pay-tv licensing deals in our industry,” Gumpert said. “He has a proven track record of growing the business while discovering the ideal distribution platforms for content. I look forward to working with him to maximize our revenue opportunities for Paramount’s films, series and catalogs.” Cohen previously spent 20 years at Disney/ABC where he most recently served as executive vice president of pay television and digital sales for home entertainment and television distribution for The Walt Disney Studios, where he distributed catalog and properties including Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, ABC and Disney Channel to businesses around the globe. While at Disney/ABC, Cohen secured two significant pay television deals – Netflix in 2012 and Starz in 1999 – negotiating exclusive, multi-year deals and licensing agreements. He also contributed to the launch of the studio’s subscription VOD service and Disney Family Movies, and led negotiations with iTunes, Amazon, Google, Walmart’s VUDU and Microsoft for the studio’s cloud-based digital movie service, Disney Movies Anywhere. “The television licensing business is constantly evolving, with new content platforms emerging,” Cohen said. “I’m privileged to help Andrew and the incredibly strong domestic and international teams in place at Paramount take full advantage of all the new and traditional opportunities.” Cohen has also served as vice president of program acquisitions and scheduling for Tele-TV Media, vice president of film acquisitions and co-productions for Showtime Networks, and held roles at Viewer’s Choice, Palmer Cablevision and Post-Newsweek Cable.

Representative Karlee Macer of Indianapolis sought to add a criminal count of “indiscretion” to the Implied Consent law that would make it illegal for an adult over the age of 23 to be involved with child under 18-years-old. Macer pointed to a 2016 IMPD investigation into three women who prostituted a 17-year-old girl, a case that was complicated by the teenager’s personal relationship with a 30-year-old boyfriend. “Which is why I knew it was so important to start this conversation and really move forward on the age of consent in the state of Indiana with the detectives and the great people who are doing the jobs behind the scenes of protecting our children and seeing this day in and day out,” said Macer. The accused women accepted plea agreements last month, negating a trial and the potential vulnerability the victim would face. If questioned on the stand, she would face questions about the distinction between her consensual sexual relationship with a man 13 years her senior and the customers she said she was coerced into having sex with for money. Indiana’s age of consent is 16, one of the youngest in the nation. Other states consider 17 or 18-years-of-age to be the appropriate age to make a decision about sex with an older partner. “The gap in age of consent that we see around the United States…is different across the board,” said Macer, “but certainly here in the state of Indiana it is 16 and 17-year-old's who are very vulnerable because pimps and people who are preying on our children particularly through social media websites and other forms of internet access they are preying on them because they understand the age of consent is that it is completely acceptable for 16 and 17-year-old's in sex.” In 2012, a 17-year-old girl told investigators in Martinsville that for two years she had been involved in sexual relationships with two different school district coaches, resulting in terms of probation and sex offender status for the men. It was based not on the child’s pre-consent age, but rather their positions of authority in the school system. Authorities Friday released video of a Tennessee teacher, presumably on the run with a 15-year-old student he was caught kissing at their school earlier this year, at an Oklahoma City Walmart. Tad Cummins, 50, and Elizabeth Thomas, 15, disappeared last month in what investigators classify as a kidnapping though evidence indicates the teenager may likely have been a willing participant in the plan. Macer said she was unsuccessful in convincing fellow lawmakers that a line of distinction could be drawn between significantly older adults having sex with pre-adult teens and what she called, “young love.” Her proposal would not penalize persons under the age of 21 if their partner is within four years of their age. The westside democrat and mother of two said she anticipates her proposal being referred to a summer study committee where additional testimony from experts in the behavioral community will help convince lawmakers to close the consent age loophole during the next legislative session.

That move, prompted by reporting in The Times of London, began a broader advertiser exodus that has now extended to the US, amid concern that the technology giant is not doing enough to prevent brands from showing up next to offensive content. The issue has been particularly poignant for publishers, who have been adversely affected by the way most online ads work. Automated technology allows companies to advertise on numerous websites in an attempt to cheaply and efficiently reach specific people based on their browsing habits. There was irony in The Guardian’s having to pull the ads, given that attracting more paid subscribers is a way for it to mitigate the fact that many companies do not need to pay to directly advertise on its news site, Hamish Nicklin, the chief revenue officer of Guardian News & Media, said. “We were trying to bridge the gaps in our ad decline, and the decline was caused by YouTube and Google’s dominance in the space — only to have to slow down our potential acquisitions because of the very same tools and products,” Nicklin said. As of March 24, the publisher had yet to resume marketing with Google, which takes a percentage from the ads placed on YouTube and the over two million sites in its display network, though it was “very likely” to reinstate search ads soon, he said. Major advertisers including AT&T, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart yanked marketing dollars from Google recently after reports showed their ads on YouTube videos promoting hate speech, terrorism and racism. While Google apologised and outlined steps it would take to guard against those situations, it has also defended itself by pointing to the volume of content it oversees. That has not appeased advertisers, who wonder if they are indirectly supporting hate speech, particularly as social media-savvy watchdogs prove able to turn one inappropriate appearance into viral, brand-damaging moments in and of themselves. “We needed to react very, very quickly,” Nicklin said. “We knew the next day that our brand, which is fundamentally important to us, was about to be splashed over the Times front page for all the wrong reasons.” Ad agencies have seized on this moment to emphasise their value as middlemen between brands and the likes of Google and Facebook, which have become two of the world’s most valuable companies through online ad sales, and to attempt to pressure the Internet companies into providing them with more access to closely guarded data and metrics. He added, “I certainly don’t think YouTube is the only one here that’s got challenges. I think it’s relevant to every single ad tech company that buys inventory at scale that’s very, very targeted at low costs.” Nicklin said there was a fine balance between relying on Google as a partner and “using them as an advertising tool in our own right.” “We’re all reliant on Google in this ecosystem,” he said.

Amazon's international losses are mounting. Will its latest acquisition help it turn the quarter? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Apr 2, 2017 at 12:06PM Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) dove into the Middle Eastern market for the first time ever this week. The e-commerce giant said it would acquire Souq.com, the largest online platform in the Arab world with 8.4 million unique products for sale and operations in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, though TechCrunch reported the price tag at $650 million, below the $1 billion Souq.com was valued at in its last funding round. Amazon said it expected the deal to close by the end of the year.  Souq.com CEO Ronaldo Mouchawar. Image source: Souq.com Souq is the latest in a long history of mostly successful acquisitions for Amazon. Among the other online retailers Amazon has taken over are the popular shoe seller Zappos and Diapers.com-parent Quidsi, where Amazon just announced it was laying off hundreds of employees. Another notable move was the company's purchase of Kiva Systems, which makes robots that move shelves and has helped boost efficiency in its warehouses. While Amazon's acquisition strategy has helped consolidate its lead in e-commerce and drive growth in other areas like cloud computing, video streaming, and audio books, the company's results in international markets have been less impressive. In 2016, Amazon post an operating loss of nearly $1.3 billion outside North America, and that loss nearly doubled from the year before. At $44 billion in revenue, Amazon's international segment is about half the size of its North American division. Over the last three years, international growth has also significantly lagged growth in its home market, even when the effects of a stronger dollar are stripped out. During those three years, Amazon has also suffered a total operating loss abroad of more than $2.6 billion. Amazon has been operating outside North America for nearly 20 years, but even for a company whose mantra is "long-term," investors would be remiss if they didn't question whether the company's international segment will ever generate profits. A tough nut to crack While plenty of American companies have found success and billions in profits abroad, including tech giants like Apple and Alphabet, it's been tougher going for retailers. Target recently abandoned its Canadian operations; several retailers, including Home Depot, have pulled out of China, and even Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with subsidiaries in major international markets like the UK, China, Brazil, and Mexico, has struggled at times to replicate its success at home as operating margins are thinner outside the US. About a quarter of Wal-Mart's revenue comes from abroad. For retailers, entering foreign markets means massive investments in real estate and supply chain infrastructure. Even an e-commerce company like Amazon still needs a network of fulfillment centers to serve its overseas customers. It has over 100 such warehouses in the US, which have allowed it to offer services like Prime Now and Amazon Fresh, but matching that density abroad won't be easy. The company's competitive advantage often lies in the fast delivery that its Prime membership program offers, which helps explain why it's profitable in North America but not internationally.  Amazon has stepped up its focus on foreign markets. After losing out to Alibaba in China, the company has pledged $5 billion in investments in India, challenging local companies like Flipkart and Snapdeal, as well as Alibaba. It also recently made Prime Video global, offering rock-bottom prices in markets like India and undercutting Netflix in the process. However, in the vast majority of those countries where its video streaming service is now offered, the two-day delivery that Americans associate with Prime is not available.  Will the Souq deal pay off? Buying the biggest e-commerce company in the Middle East seems like a smart move, and will certainly accelerate Amazon's growth in that corner of the world. But investors need to be mindful that Amazon is in a much earlier stage of development abroad than it is in the US. The company is still making investments to drive growth, and seems less concerned with profits. While Prime has reached a penetration rate of about 50% of US households, that rate is much lower overseas. It's unclear at this point if Amazon will ever be consistently profitable in the international segment. A weaker dollar would help, but the company also faces a number of challenges unique to the international market including infrastructure, different cultures and regulations, and local competition. With Souq joining its portfolio, expect Amazon's international revenue growth to continue, but profits will likely remain absent for the foreseeable future, as the company's scale overseas is still far from what it is at home.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Carter President Donald Trump is poised to sign legislation to overturn Federal Communications Commission rules forbidding internet service providers from selling data they have vacuumed up about the online habits of their customers. Privacy groups are understandably perturbed. But I wonder whether all the brouhaha is just shouting at the horse to come back long after he’s left the barn. Yes, it’s a little disturbing that Verizon and AT&T will be able to start behaving like Google and Facebook. But Google and Facebook are already behaving like Google and Facebook. They recognize what we ourselves refuse to see: That we are no longer entirely human. We may not (yet) be sporting wired implants, but with so much of life spent online, we are increasingly integrated into the digital world. Our smartphones and tablets and computers long ago ceased to be our servants. They are also not our masters. Whether we are at work or at home, in the street or in the car, at school or on vacation, the devices that were once our tools are now our partners and our symbionts. The day has become unimaginable without our ability to connect at leisure. We march through the world shedding digital information with every step we take. Whether we are browsing online or browsing in a store, our symbionts surround us and embrace us ... and steal from us. We like to call the bits we leave behind “our” data, but the truth is that what we shed in our online travels we also abandon —if not as a matter of law, then as a matter of practical fact. Most of the time we do little to protect our leavings. We dribble data in our path and never look back, on the cheery assumption that nobody will ever want to examine what we have tossed aside. For the internet behemoths —Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google—the data constitute a treasure-trove. Their business models are built around finding ever more complex methods of mining what we leave behind for information that advertisers will buy to target us, anonymously but effectively. Yes, the algorithms work imperfectly—all of us have stories of being served ads for products we hate—but they work. The giant internet service providers— Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. in particular—look enviously upon the ability of other tech companies to monetize our digital trails. The ISPs peer greedily into their vaults, packed with data potentially even more detailed than what Google and Facebook collect, and wonder why the companies whose signals ride their fiber optic networks can exploit this vast collection and the owners of the network cannot. In their version of the story, the ISPs try to dip their toes in the water, and a Washington establishment that sits in awe of Google and Facebook reacts with horror and bans them from the beach. With the FCC rules out of the way, it’s everybody into the sea. This isn’t the end of privacy. Privacy ended already. The FCC rules about to be cast aside, like many other regulatory and legislative barriers, represented mere fingers in the dike. Nowadays a Wal-Mart or Nordstrom’s might use your mobile phone, connected to the store’s Wi-Fi, to follow you around the store, combining browsing habits with buying history to personalize offers that are then sent straight to the phone. In his fascinating if disturbing book “The Aisles Have Eyes,” Joseph Turow sharply criticizes this practice, but also tells us where it came from: the need to compete with Amazon, which with its reams of data about customers can both target ads and price discriminate minute-by-minute. If the brick-and-mortar stores couldn’t find a way to exploit similar technologies, they would be left in the dust even faster. A National Security Agency data center opened three years ago in Utah is estimated to be able to store several exabytes (a quintillion bytes) of data, and although the organization is no longer allowed to store most data on our telephone calls, privacy advocates believe that considerable information about our internet usage might be preserved there. (I am not saying they’re right.) And don’t forget the hackers, who do a lot more than occasionally raid the database of a retail shop. Now that it is possible to scan every port on the internet (the IPv4 space) in mere minutes, any connected device is likely to be attacked. If the device is poorly protected, it will be hacked. Not might be. Will be. Last year, the Atlantic magazine constructed a virtual wireless toaster to see how much time would pass before an attack was launched. The toaster, which mimicked an actual device connected to the IPv4 space, went live at 1:12 p.m. The first hacking attempt came at 1:53 p.m. By midnight the virtual device had been attacked more than 300 times. And our big privacy worry is that Verizon and AT&T will now be allowed to behave like Google and Facebook? We lost long ago the battle to be able to protect the data we shed in our wake as we move through the world. The FCC rules were a desperate throw, and, in the long run, perhaps not an important one. It’s time we better armed ourselves. We can delete our cookies when we are done browsing, and we can travel mainly to websites using HTTPS rather than HTTP protocols. But experts agree that such measures are only partly helpful. Using “do not track” commands probably doesn’t help at all. Most likely we will see another online civil war, such as the one being fought now between users of ad-blocking software on the one hand, and, on the other, websites that support themselves with advertising income. I expect that we will see more apps like TrackMeNot, which runs in the background in your browser, intermittently sending out random search queries, in an effort to make it harder for anyone who might be tracking you (including your ISP) to assemble accurate personalized information. In the end we should expect little return from our efforts. We will go on shedding data and others will go on scooping it up. We made the big decision when we chose to live in symbiosis with the internet. Remember your high school biology: In a symbiotic relationship, both parties profit.

Marciarille WCEG Blum Center NBER Biography Delicious Facebook Facebook Google Plus Twitter Grasping Reality with All Tentacles: bradford-delong.com: « | Main | Weekend Reading: Simon Wren-Lewis: Lessons from Brexit » I See John Cochrane Has Tried to Make an April Fools' Day Joke of Sorts About ObamaCare No. I do not know why John Cochrane decided to turn himself into a partisan Republican clown back in 2007—willing to say whatever, at that moment, he thinks will win applause from the current crop of Republican politicians; and claiming since, among other things, that: the government's taxes, purchases, and debt have almost no effect on the flow of spending through the economy; the government's taxes, purchases, and debt have so great an effect that total spending is roughly proportional to the national debt (yes, the exact opposite--go figure); Ben Bernanke's policies to keep the economy from falling deeper into debt are likely to produce an inflation explosion; if the Federal Reserve wants to lower inflation it should do so by taking active steps to lower interest rates; the—my favorite—claim that if only we would adopt the policies of "Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and other House members" who are "championing economic growth", not a 3%/year or a 4%/year but rather 17.5%/year "additional growth for 20 years" is within our grasp—a spurt of growth after which we would be so rich that relative to us Germany and Japan would then be to us like "North Korea versus South Korea, or East Germany versus West Germany". the ObamaCare Exchanges—in a prediction made at the end of December 2013—were on the point of imminent collapse, where "imminent" meant "the next six months": "Next spring [i.e., before June 21, 2014] the individual mandate is likely to unravel when we see how sick the people are who signed up on exchanges, and if our government really is going to penalize voters for not buying health insurance. The employer mandate and 'accountable care organizations' will take their turns in the news. There will be scandals. There will be fraud..." And this April Fools Day—April 1, 2017—we have another. Now Cochrane claims that when he back in December 2013 predicted the imminent—within six months—unraveling of the ObamaCare exchanges, he "did not think hard about how long it would take before writing '2014'". He beclowns himself twice in this one short phrase: He did not write "2014". He wrote, in December 2013, "next spring". He wants readers to think that he just pulled a year out of the air—that he might just as well have written "2017" or "2020". But that is not what he did. He thus lies about his prediction of likely collapse before June 2014 being something he "did not think hard about". The entire point of his piece was to energize people for immediate action to deal with the imminent ObamaCare disaster. The title of the column was "what to do when ObamaCare unravels". His opening was that that moment—December 2013—was a "historic opportunity for change." And he beclowns himself further by writing about how now it has come true: that as of April 1, 2017, the ObamaCare Exchanges have collapsed: John Cochrane: The Obamacare Unraveling: "OK. Mea Culpa. I got '2014' wrong... ...The insurers pulling out of exchanges, the swaths of the country with only one insurer left, the policies that are nice cards in your pocket but don't actually pay for much, the skyrocketing premiums... it all took three more years... There are honest and honorable professional technocrats who are tracking the state of the ObamaCare Exchanges. John Cochrane is not one of them. I do recommend the extremely sharp and hard-working David Anderson and Charles Gaba. And the current consensus of the state of the ObamaCare Exchanges is, I think, best captured in this piece by the very sharp and knowledgeable Craig Garthwaite and John A. Graves: Craig Garthwaite and John A. Graves: Success and Failure in the Insurance Exchanges: "President Donald Trump and large fractions of the Republican majority... campaigned on an explicit pledge to repeal and replace the ACA... ...At least part of the impetus for these promises is a general belief that the ACA’s state-based insurance marketplaces are unworkable and are resulting in higher prices and fewer choices. In 2016, the ACA marketplaces facilitated coverage purchases for approximately 13 million people nationwide. But many prominent national insurers have struggled... UnitedHealth... Aetna.... Smaller and more focused insurers are earning profits in the new market and are aggressively entering new geographic areas.... Centene and Molina have both had financial success in the ACA marketplaces.... These two insurers have historically operated in the Medicaid managed-care market.... New plans had substantially lower premiums than their local competitors... were more likely to have experience with Medicaid managed care but less likely to have direct experience in the markets they entered. This finding is consistent with the existence of a functioning market in which firms that were initially successful are moving into new geographic areas.... The available data reveal patterns of market entry and exit that are consistent with natural competitive processes separating out firms that are best suited to adapt to a new market. We believe that efforts to reform or replace the ACA should therefore proceed with the knowledge that highly publicized market exits are a poor and probably inaccurate signal of a failing market. That is the consensus assessment of honest and honorable professional technocrats who are doing their best to watch and understand what is going on with these very complicated issues of societal mechanism design. I am thus left with no desire to change a single word of the post I wrote back in June 2014, back when when John Cochrane first beclowned himself with respect to the ObamaCare Exchanges. The unprofessionalism of Cochrane's piece back then astonished me. Truly. From three years ago, verbatim: Thursday Idiocy: A Correspondent Who Wishes Me Ill Makes Me Read John H. Cochrane Edition (June 2014): A commenter who wishes me ill sends me to something I had not seen before: John Cochrane (December 25, 2013); What to Do When ObamaCare Unravels: "The unraveling of the Affordable Care Act... ...presents a historic opportunity for change. Its proponents call it “settled law,” but as Prohibition taught us, not even a constitutional amendment is settled law--if it is dysfunctional enough, and if Americans can see a clear alternative. This fall’s website fiasco and policy cancellations are only the beginning. Next spring the individual mandate is likely to unravel when we see how sick the people are who signed up on exchanges, and if our government really is going to penalize voters for not buying health insurance. The employer mandate and “accountable care organizations” will take their turns in the news. There will be scandals. There will be fraud. This will go on for years... Did it happen? Was any reputable health economist back last December saying that the individual mandate would unravel "next spring"? If so, they escaped my notice. What the real ObamaCare critics were saying was that the individual mandate was likely to unravel "someday"--as it is likely to unravel somewhere, someday, for pooling equilibria are genuinely subject to instability. But that day looked last December--and looks today--to be decades or generations off. As John Gruber convinced Mitt Romney in the mid-2000s, the pooling equilibrium is, for the moment, stable if backed by an individual mandate, and provides the best way to keeping a competitive private health insurance market that can provide comprehensive care functioning. John Cochrane goes on, convincing me that he has never learned anything about health finance and health insurance markets--has not even read Arrow (1963): We need to permit the Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Amazon.com and Apples of the world to bring to health care the same dramatic improvements in price, quality, variety, technology and efficiency that they brought to air travel, retail and electronics. We’ll know we are there when prices are on hospital websites, cash customers get discounts, and new hospitals and insurers swamp your inbox with attractive offers and great service.... Only deregulation can unleash competition. And only disruptive competition, where new businesses drive out old ones, will bring efficiency, lower costs and innovation... And I wonder: What regulations does Cochrane think have been blocking insurance companies and HMOs from innovating and bringing "disruptive competition" to the health-insurance market for the past generation. Has Cochrane bothered to learn anything about why Southwest has been successful? Wal-Mart? Amazon? Apple? Kaiser? And has he bothered to learn anything about why Kaiser has been able to successfully disrupt health insurance markets in northern California but not elsewhere--although it has tried, and tried hard? And low and behold, barely a sentence after his call for "deregulation", what does Cochrane do? Why, he calls for a whole new set of regulations! A new set of regulations which would impose burdens on health-insurance companies that would make all their actuaries gibber in fear: Health insurance should be individual, portable across jobs, states and providers; lifelong and guaranteed-renewable, meaning you have the right to continue with no unexpected increase in premiums if you get sick... Would you give any 21-year-old a quote for health insurance that gave them the option to renew "with no unexpected increase in premiums" for the rest of their life? Plus the option to see any provider they wished? And, if you were sitting in Bermuda, would you offer backstop reinsurance to any company that did offer 21-year-olds such quotes? Would you as a reinsurer want to be on the hook to cover the eventuality that their actuaries got it badly wrong? It sounds to me like Cochrane is the kind of naive gull who believes the vacation condo complex when it promises that it will always repurchase the condo at the original purchases--for the only circumstance in which you would want to exercise your option is one in which your counterparty is gone: in which the condo complex has already gone bankrupt. It really does not seem to me that Cochrane has thought any of this through. Here's a bet that I do find attractive: I will bet that Cochrane will devote no more time to rethinking his position and marking his beliefs to market on health insurance now that his prediction of imminent adverse-selection meltdown has, itself, melted down than he has devoted to marking-his-beliefs-to-market on monetary policy in view of the continued failure of the U.S. to become "Argentina"--no more time and effort than he devoted to coming up with his position on health insurance in the first place. Any takers? And, of course, his April Fools Day joke shows that I was right: no marking-of-beliefs-to-market at all. I won that bet, didn't I? Still not thinking about issues, but rather pumping out whatever he hopes will win applause from Republican politicians, no? When I look at the map of current competition levels on the ObamaCare Exchanges: I draw four lessons: (1) The ObamaCare Exchanges appear healthy and competitive—normal entry and exit, no ultraviolet catastrophe of runaway premiums and adverse selection—companies either making money or investing in building brand and market share—in regions of the country where 75% of people live. (2) There are problems in the Neo-Confederacy. If you (a) have a poor population, (b) have an unhealthy population, and (c) by not expanding Medicaid overload the Exchanges with more poor people desperate for coverage because they know they are likely to get sick, then you can damage the ObamaCare Exchanges: you can raise adverse selection problems in the ObamaCare Exchanges to a level in which only a single monopoly insurance seller can make money. (3) The lesson? You can damage the ObamaCare Exchanges if you really try. But even in the Neo-Confederacy the ObamaCare Exchange market appear to be what we call contestable. (4) It is still the case that, unless people work very hard to break them, the adverse selection meltdowns in the ObamaCare Exchanges look decades if not generations away. I now think it more likely than not that Covered California will still be around in 2050. However, I am just somebody trying hard to get the analysis right—not somebody who thought ObamaCare as enacted was the greatest thing since sliced bread nor somebody at all adverse to universal catastrophic insurance as the baseline guarantee. I am not a clown desperately trying to please a group of dishonest and grifting politician-ideologues by providing whatever talking points I think they want at the moment. As Larry Summers said recently: ObamaCare is the most conservative path to near-universal coverage starting from where the U.S. was in 2008. If the ObamaCare Exchanges fail—if adverse selection takes down private insurance markets even when they are buttressed by the subsidy pool—the only live options left are forms of single payer. Real Republicans—real conservatives—want the ObamaCare Exchanges to work in order to preserve space for market competition in health insurance and thus to reap some of the benefits of decentralized markets as societal planning and allocation mechanisms. It is only fake Republicans, and fake conservatives, who not only want but seek to pretend right now that the ObamaCare Exchanges have collapsed. And why do they do so? As I see it, they do so for no reason other than that they are the creations of the Kenyan Muslim socialist, never mind that Larry is right in his claim that they are an essential part of the most conservative path to near-universal coverage open here in America.

The sign at the edge of No Man's Land is for a truck pulling a low boy, which is the wrong sign for a tractor-trailer. That's like putting a "bridge out" sign just three feet from the big splash. The two advance railroad crossing signs on Old Nome Road show no problems with the crossing. The two advance warning railroad signs on US 90 and the one the other side of US 90 on Thompson Road don't show any problems BECAUSE THEY ARE MISSING, which is against the law. Whoops, I forget railroads and their state handmaidens have no law. So why not electric sign boards with an Evel Knievel launch-pad warning? Better yet, put the crossing to level specs and charge the railroad three times too much like they do us. Robert Pines, Sullivan, Mo. ---------------------- Girl Scouts give thanks Jasper Girl Scouts Brownie Troop No. 131023 would like to thank Jasper for its huge support of this year's cookie sales. Our girls sold 3,707 packages of cookies, raising over $2,500 for our troop. This money allows our girls to have life-enriching experiences, and we plan to take full advantage of all Jasper has to offer and put this money back into our community. We have several activities planned for our troop in the coming months and over the summer, with most of them being right here at home. Last week we visited the Jasper Fire Department for a tour and learned about fire safety. We will spend Earth Day at Martin Dies Jr. State Park picking up trash on the trails and learning about environmental protection. We have a weekend of camping at KOA planned as a reward for all the girls' hard work over the past year, and a fun evening of painting at Whimsy Works of Art, all funded by the support of our cookie program. The Eastern Thicket Community of Girl Scouts has 13 troops in it from the area, with over 140 participating girls. We are so proud of each of our girl's efforts but none of this would have been possible without the support of everyone who purchased a box of cookies or made a donation. Cookie booths help teach the girls how to manage money and customer service, and they also help them build confidence. Our girls would also like to thank Boot Barn, Tractor Supply and Wal-Mart for allowing us to host our booths at their businesses. Beth Brock, Co-Troop Leader, Jasper ----------------------- Appreciate our doctors Throughout the year, physicians perform vital diagnostic work and provide medical and surgical care to patients. Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas are grateful for the dedication and hard work of more than 350 primary and specialty care physicians who serve on our medical staff. National Doctors' Day, first celebrated in 1933, is an excellent opportunity to celebrate the efforts of our medical professionals. This year on this special day, we set aside time to honor the men and women who help ensure that the best care is available in Southeast Texas. This designated day, March 30, allowed us to show our gratitude to these very special people for the skill and compassion shown to us and our loved ones. These remarkably busy individuals do more than care for our medical and surgical needs - they are our neighbors, civic leaders, the coaches of our children, volunteers and our friends. Individually and collectively, physicians play the pivotal role in the overall health and well-being of our community. Southeast Texas is blessed with outstanding physicians who constantly give of themselves. Please take time to say "thank you" to our physicians for devoting their lives to this healing ministry, for answering the call to care and serve and for making a positive difference in our lives.

The Marine Corps veteran had three small children at home to take care of. “I was very nervous,” he admits. But the owner of MD Bush Co., a local electric company at the time, and an area banker assured him he could run the company and make a living. Dickey was good at the electrical trade and often impressed the owner. “I’d helped him on some projects that were too big for him,” Dickey said. “‘I never saw anybody that good,’ he said.” To really run the company that he renamed Joe Dickey Electric, Dickey had to create new customers, expand his services and survive some trying times in his personal life that affected his business. Six months after he purchased the electric company, Dickey’s wife died from pneumonia, and Dickey got a staph infection that had him off work for more than 40 days. When he had recovered from his loss and the infection, he went to the bank to get a loan. “I couldn’t even breathe when I went in there,” he said. “I was so scared.” Dickey was able to get the loan to help keep his business alive, and he got back to work. “I did small commercial and residential [work],” he said. “I hired extra men and did a lot of commercial.” In 1960, with his business partner Jerry Sabrin, Dickey opened a Dickey Supply storefront in North Lima. The company opened other supply shops in East Palestine, Lisbon and Wellsville. Eventually, Sabrin and Dickey sold off the supply shops in the 1990s. A generator specialist shop also was opened and later sold. Dickey’s focus also has been on putting the customer first, no matter the size of the job. He started as a residential contractor, and those customers told him he did such a good job he should do the work on the factories they ran or worked in. Projects completed by Dickey Electric through the years include Youngstown Sheet and Tube, Compco, Packard Electric, the Mahoning County Justice Center, Youngstown State University, Giant Eagle, Walmart, Fellows Riverside Gardens, an amusement park in South Korea and the body shop at the General Motors Lordstown Complex. “They’ve gone from 12-man shop to over 300 people,” Dickey said. “They’ve done work all over the U.S. and Puerto Rico.” Dave Dickey, chief executive officer of the company and Joe Dickey’s son, has always known he wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps. “He was always the first one in the truck,” Joe Dickey said. “He knew everything by the time he was 6 or 7.” “I would hold the flashlight and run and get the tools,” Dave added. In 1993, Dave took over the business as president. “I wanted to grow the company into the industrial sector,” Dave said. “I wanted to go into the steel plants and heavy automotive. We went into that during my tenure. The whole company is based on Dad’s theory of customer service and customer satisfaction.” Earlier this year, Dickey Electric announced that 25-year employee Eric Carlson would take over as president, Dave became CEO and Joe is the chairman of the company. Carlson is an electrical engineering graduate from Youngstown State University whose father, the late Gary Carlson, worked for Joe. who asked Dave to bring Eric on board. “The first job I did here, I cleaned out the old dirty mill,” Carlson said. “The neat thing is I never had another job.” Joe refers to Carlson as an “energetic young man,” who has helped the company tap into markets it wasn’t in before. “We have a lot of great younger leadership,” Carlson said. “Our management team is strong. Our electricians are strong. It’s a true testament to what we are able to do based on the people we have.” Other stories of interest BUSINESS DIGEST || Trump, Paul tee up health care discussion Cleveland vintner turned away from counterfeiting Chevrolet Cruze makes 2017 list of top 10 car picks Don't Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive daily news directly in your inbox.

Linda Doane / NWBA Says Tony Sanchez: “You think you’re alone in this world, but there’s a lot of people with your story.” TownNews.com Content Exchange They stuck around hoping to get up a few more shots, to get out on one last fast break for the year, to work up that final good sweat of the season. Really, they just didn’t want to leave the court. The Tucson Lobos Wheelchair Basketball team had become so much to them, in such short a time, that this couldn’t be it, could it? But they’d eaten the last of the pizza, and handed out the last of the team spirit awards — on a squad like this, team manager Mia Hansen says, the field for Most Inspirational Player goes three deep — and they’d put a nice little bow on one important season. Just months ago, the team was on the verge of folding; two veteran members who served as organizers and coaches had moved away from the state in the previous months, and there was only a half-dozen or so left with any interest. Hansen, a local community organizer and past president of the Festivals and Events Association of Tucson, was already a volunteer for the team, but she offered to give even more time. Within weeks, morale changed, friends reached out to friends, loaner wheelchairs gave first-timers an opportunity to play, and before they knew it, the Lobos were up to 20 players. They would start the season ranked 35th out of 53 teams in their division and finish it ranked 18th, a drastic improvement, and a cause for both celebration and disappointment, as only the top 16 teams were invited to the National Wheelchair Basketball Tournament in Louisville. Hansen saw the sunken shoulders. March Madness meets March sadness. And yet, there was genuine enthusiasm for next season, and a renewed hope for the Lobos team members, both on and off the court. Walking out to the parking lot that night, Hansen was pleased with how everyone had come together, and for the future. Then she got a phone call. It was the National Wheelchair Basketball Association, calling to tell Hansen that two teams could not commit to the tournament, with an invitation for the Lobos to join the field. “A few of us had stayed behind to play just a little more basketball together, and Mia comes running back in, ‘I just got off the phone with Buddy Barnes!’” first-year Lobos center Karl Yares said. “I knew what was going on right then. I was tingling.” There would be more basketball. “They were so excited,” Hansen said. “Literally flipping out — one kid got excited and did a roll with his chair.” ••• If you think the Cinderella story ends there, well, you’re right. The Lobos traveled to Kentucky on Wednesday and played — and lost — two games on Thursday before dropping another game on Friday morning. They finished the tournament Saturday with a 2-2 record, good for 11th. But if you think some tournament in the middle of America is going to determine the fate of this group, you’ve got another thing coming. Cinderella already has her glass slippers, even if it’s only one. “This has been huge for me. I was missing this,” said Yares, 30, whose left leg was partially amputated after a car accident last year. “Being in a hospital bed for a month, trying to build back strength, trying to figure out how to be a one-legged guy. … And just to find a group of people who you know have been through at least a similar experience and in some cases much more difficult. There’s a lot of strong people here.” The team was started about 10 years ago, but maintaining a thriving club sport proved difficult. The team was primarily made up of former UA wheelchair basketball players and members of a Sierra Vista club team that had dissipated. By the beginning of the season, however, things were looking bleak. Arthur Parson, a 63-year old Army veteran with experience in more than a dozen National Veterans Wheelchair Games, volunteered to coach. He’d been heavily involved with the team in Sierra Vista, where he lives, and he loved coming up to Tucson just for the exercise and camaraderie of it. Parson had gotten his start in wheelchair basketball with the Arizona Wildcats program in the mid-1980s; during his stint in the Army, he developed bone cancer, which required the amputation of his right leg in 1976. Wheelchair basketball became a passion for Parson, who is also a preacher. “It gives me an opportunity to meet so many people with disabilities, to figure out how they get around, how they see things, how they deal with life,” he said. “I’m a religious person, an ordained preacher, and I get the opportunity to speak with guys about their lives, and their spirituality. It’s important for them to know that someone loves the lord and really cares about them.” In the Sierra Vista Herald, Parson was given one terrific nickname. The Godfather of Roll. And if anybody needed to hear the gospel according to the Godfather, it was Tony Sanchez. ••• At age 22, Sanchez was an overnight supervisor at Walmart, living in Avondale. This was 2001. He says he never drank or drove, but one night, he said, “For some dumb reason, I decided to get behind the wheel drunk.” He was headed home early one morning, lost control of his vehicle and hit a truck from behind. The car flipped several times, and Sanchez was left with a broken spinal cord. The driver of the other truck lost control and hit a pole. He was killed instantly. Sanchez was arrested and charged with manslaughter and given a sentence of nine years, nine months. He served eight years, five months, then was released on parole. In many ways, this was a life sentence. Sanchez lost his wife, his mobility, his autonomy. Worse, even. “The worst part of it … I ended someone’s life,” he said. “I didn’t know that person. That still lives with me every day. It’s hard to live with that in the back of your mind. But I live for my kids. I watch them grow up, and I teach them the dangers, and I try to get my story out. From one day to the next, your life can change completely.” Released from prison in December 2010, Sanchez was aimless. The Tucson High graduate had purpose in his life — to raise his two kids — but not much direction. Mentally, emotionally, spiritually, he was losing the battle. In 2014, he’d had enough. Sanchez, 37, reached out to the Arizona Spinal Cord Injury Association, and a woman in Phoenix referred him to Pete Hughes, who played for the Lobos. “Other than my kids, I had nothing to do, and since I’ve been introduced to the sport, I have another purpose for my life,” he said. “The wind hitting my face, being part of a team. I played baseball in the lower leagues, and it was great playing for a team. Twenty years later, to start playing with this team, it’s almost a religious experience.” ••• Mia Hansen is floored. “This is amazing,” she says, surveying a moving tapestry of taped-up hands and spinning wheels, 16 courts in all, taking over the Kentucky Exposition Center. “Seeing our team take the court, to be a part of this tournament — I got teared up.” She knows what this can do for someone. “It’s life-changing for them, and for me,” she said. “It is reaffirming my belief in the power of sports. I grew up playing sports in a small town in Oregon … and so did my brother.” She pauses. “Throughout our life, we played sports, and then my brother dove into a river and broke his neck and became a quadriplegic at the age of 21.” Mark Hansen became an avid wheelchair rugby player and advocate for wheelchair athletics, and, his sister said, “He was such a wonderful inspiration for me, and that’s the main reason I do this. I saw him go from the total depths of depression, my life is over, to having something to grab on to.” Speaking by phone from Louisville on Wednesday, when she traveled ahead of the team to set things up, she marveled. “Pulling into the hotel, there were wheelchairs everywhere and people with every sort of ability you can imagine. … For so many of our players, this is bigger than life. They’re wanting — needing — somewhere to socialize and to be together.” ••• For men like Yares and Sanchez, there may be nothing more important. “It’s been an awesome ride actually,” Sanchez said. “It looked like it was going to fall apart, and Mia stepped in, a lot of team members started recruiting people, and everyone loved it. Next year, we’re hoping to get two teams going. It’s a really exciting time.” Sanchez has been so inspired by his new life that he has become a founding board member for Southern Arizona Adaptive Sports. He hopes to get a grant to go back to school, and one day work with people struggling with this kind of transition. “You think you’re alone in this world, but there’s a lot of people with your story,” he said. Yares echoed the sentiments. “It’s been an absolute tornado,” he said. “I started the year with a loaner chair, and it was hard pushing, and when we went to our first tournament in Phoenix, we were pretty ragged. The progress we’ve made, it is astounding. We’re a different team than we were in October.” To think, just months ago, he was walking around the Pima College campus on crutches, his spirits needing crutches themselves. A team member, Shane Rodabaugh, approached him out of nowhere. Now Yares sees a different future ahead. A complete future. “In a way, it makes you feel whole again,” he said. “It kind of makes you feel powerful, to be part of a group, with a singular goal. We get mad at each other, scream at each other, and then we just try to do better. When things go well, we definitely congratulate each other, too. This, you don’t feel so confined. “It really does make you feel whole.” This article originally ran on tucson.com.

By Philly Mag Staff  |  April 1, 2017 comment on this post iStock As an adult, it’s interesting to look back on my family’s financial situation growing up. If there were money concerns, my father and mother, a patient-transport assistant and a certified nursing aide, respectively, never struggled in front of my three brothers and me. I was raised in South Philly, and I can’t recall ever being told we didn’t have the financial means for me to participate in sports or after-school activities. It was a comfortable upbringing. Snapshot: Family Expenses Home: $200/month for a three-bedroom house (subsidized) Transportation: $180/month for SEPTA pass and tokens for kids Education: $190/month for Catholic school (two kids) Child care: $124/month for youngest daughter’s after-school program Groceries: $500/month Dining & takeout: $50/month Clothes, tech, other: $100/month Vacation: $0 Savings: $600/year Puts aside $25 from each paycheck I didn’t attend college, but my parents helped me financially in other ways after high school. When my children were born, they helped with child care and gave me money from time to time. Now, my son is 18 years old and goes to Kutztown University, where, luckily, he pays in-state tuition. He didn’t always know he wanted to go to college, so I didn’t save for it. He received financial aid, and then I took out a loan, which he’s also on, for the remaining portion. I help him apply for as many scholarships as possible. Seeing how much it costs to attend college nowadays, I’ve already started saving for my daughters, ages nine and 13. My children’s quality of education is important to me. I send both of my daughters to Catholic school because the local public school isn’t great. There are additional costs, like uniforms, but the tuition isn’t that bad. Plus, they offer an affordable after-school program for my youngest daughter that lets me pick her up at 6 p.m. after I get off work. I’ve been in my current job for five years but have held similar positions most of my adult life. I’d like to make more money, of course, but I try to take it day by day. It would be easier to not have to worry about putting aside enough money for bills throughout the month. I’d prefer to pay all of them on the first of the month and then use the second check to have a little fun. On the rare occasion there is money left at the end of the month, I might get my hair done or buy an outfit online, where I can search for a deal. I have very little debt — maybe $150 from unpaid bills I blew off when I was younger. I’m trying to clean that up by putting a little toward those when I can. I save for retirement through my 401(k) at my company, but I also try to save on my own with a separate account. My biggest financial concerns are general monthly expenses, like cell-phone bills, utilities and groceries. There are three of us on my family plan, but my youngest daughter will need a phone next fall, because her older sister won’t be at school with her. Groceries are a killer, but I do have strategies to offset that. I shop only twice a month and buy in bulk at BJ’s Wholesale Club, or I’ll go to the Walmart Supercenter because they’re cheaper than the supermarkets near me. I want to teach my children the importance of being financially independent and cutting costs when it’s possible. If I were a person who smoked cigarettes and was putting money toward those every day, that would absolutely be an expense I would cut. I used to frequently eat out for lunch, but I completely stopped. I’ll use vacation days and stay in Philadelphia, but it’s been years since I’ve vacationed outside the city. My kids know that if there’s something they want and I won’t pay for it, they can put aside money and buy it themselves. It’s about saving when you can and working hard so you don’t need to depend on other people. — As told to Marina Lamanna First published as “Living in Philly on … $18,000” in the April 2017 issue of Philadelphia magazine.

The Strange Persistence of Guilt More Opinion »   So what if President Trump wants to deport Big Bird? We’re struggling with terrorism, refugees, addiction and grizzlies besieging schools. Isn’t it snobbish to fuss over Trump’s plans to eliminate all funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corp. for Public Broadcasting? Let me argue the reverse: Perhaps Trump’s election is actually a reminder that we need the humanities more than ever to counter nationalism and demagoguery. Civilization is built not just on microchips, but also on arts, ideas and the humanities. And the arts are a bargain: The NEA budget is $148 million a year, or less than 0.004 percent of the federal budget. The per-capita cost for Americans is roughly the cost of a postage stamp. The humanities may seem squishy and irrelevant. We have a new president who doesn’t read books and who celebrates raw power. It would be easy to interpret Trump as proof of the irrelevance of the humanities. Yet the humanities are far more powerful than most people believe. The world has been transformed over the last 250 years by what might be called a revolution of empathy driven by the humanities. Previously, almost everyone (except Quakers) accepted slavery and even genocide. Thomas Jefferson justified the “extermination” of Native Americans; whippings continued in American prisons in the 20th century; and at least 15,000 people turned up to watch the last public hanging in the United States, in 1936. What tamed us was, in part, books. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” famously contributed to the abolitionist movement, and “Black Beauty” helped change the way we treat animals. Steven Pinker of Harvard argues that a surge of literacy and an explosion of reading — novels in particular — “contributed to the humanitarian revolution,” by helping people see other viewpoints. There is also modern experimental evidence that reading literary fiction promotes empathy. The humanities have even reshaped our diet. In 1971, a few philosophy students, including an Australian named Peter Singer, gathered on a street in Oxford, England, to protest the sale of eggs from hens raised in small cages. This was an unknown issue back then, and passers-by smiled at the students’ idealism but told them they’d never change the food industry. Looking back, who was naive? Today, keeping hens in small cages is illegal in Britain, in the rest of the European Union and in parts of the United States. McDonald’s, Burger King, General Mills and Wal-Mart are all moving toward exclusively cage-free eggs, because consumers demand it. Singer, now a Princeton University professor, is a wisp of a man who defeated an agribusiness army with the power of his ideas and the muscle of the humanities. (Singer has a terrific recent book, “Ethics in the Real World,” that wrestles with how much we should donate to charity, and whether wearing a $10,000 watch is a sign of good taste, or of shallow narcissism.) In short, the humanities encourage us to reflect on what is important, to set priorities. For example, do we get more value as taxpayers from Big Bird and art or music programs, or from the roughly $30 million Trump’s trips to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort will cost us when he’s tallied nine visits in office (he’s already more than halfway there)? That’s also more than the cost of salaries and expenses to run the National Endowment for the Humanities, not including the grants it hands out. Do we get more value from billions of dollars spent on deportations? Or from tiny sums to support art therapy for wounded veterans? Then there’s our favorite bird. The Onion humor website reported: “Gaunt, Hollow-­Eyed Big Bird Enters Sixth Day Of Hunger Strike Against Proposed Trump Budget.” In fact, Big Bird will survive, but some local public television stations will close without federal support — meaning that children in some parts of the country may not be able to see “Sesame Street” on their local channel. In 2017, with the world a mess, I’d say we need not only drones but also Big Bird, and poetry and philosophy. Indeed, our new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, apparently shares that view: He carried Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations” to Iraq with him. It’d be nice to see Mattis drop off “Meditations” for the new commander in chief. And maybe present the first lady a copy of “Lysistrata.” Look, I know it sounds elitist to hail the humanities. But I’ve seen people die for ideas. At Tiananmen Square in China in 1989, I watched protesters sacrifice their lives for democracy. In Congo, I saw a tiny Polish nun stand up to a warlord because of her faith and values. The humanities do not immunize a society from cruelty and overreaction; early-20th-century Germany proves that. But on balance, the arts humanize us and promote empathy. We need that now more than ever. Nicholas Kristof is a columnist for The New York Times.

A set of keys also was missing. The last known time the car was in the dealership's possession was Dec. 8, 2016, during the last inventory, according to police. The missing car is valued at about $25,000. Possession of marijuana, Country Club Boulevard: An officer stopped a car about 6 p.m. March 21 after smelling marijuana coming from the car. The driver had no operator's license and the Euclid Police Department had issued a warrant for him. However, they were unwilling to travel to North Olmsted to pick him up. Police recovered some marijuana and charged the driver with possession of marijuana. Disorderly conduct, Brookpark Road Extension: Police were called to Guitar Center about 1:20 p.m. March 25 by the store manager about an unwanted visitor. The store manager told officers he witnessed a man urinate on the outside of the building before coming inside. The manager pointed out the suspect, who admitted to his deed. Officers arrested the man for disorderly conduct. Petty theft, Great Northern Mall: Macy's store security called police about 8 p.m. March 25 about a male shoplifter they had in custody. An employee reported the man concealed several men's ties and walked out of the store without paying for them. He was caught by security. The man is charged with petty theft. The ties were valued at $170. Lost and found, Brookpark Road: A Bay Village woman came to the North Olmsted Police Department about 10:50 a.m. March 21 to report she thought someone stole her wallet while shopping at Walmart. She said she thought she had the wallet with her when she entered the store, but it then disappeared. Police and Walmart security watched video recordings of the woman in the store but didn't find any clues. However, the woman got lucky later in the day when a store employee found her wallet and all its contents still in place. Police believe the woman may have set the wallet down by mistake while shopping.

Too many of those mountain state veterans struggle to find work and end up homeless. The West Virginia University Veterans Organization along with other area groups put on the O.P. Good to Go Drive on Saturday at the University Town Centre Walmart in Granville.   The drive, in honor of Corporal Tyler Burroughs, raised food and supplies for homeless veterans. Christopher Morris, organizer, said Morgantown has far too many homeless veterans. "Really correct the problem with the homeless veterans, which is really that they're too proud to take the help that they need," he said. "and we're really trying to fix that."

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next COLUMBIA, Tenn. - A vigil was held in downtown Columbia for 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas. Friends and family held the vigil Sunday evening where many spoke and prayers were prayed. They said they hope she comes home soon, and they hope she’s safe. “Many of us haven't slept in weeks,” said Caleb Banks, a friend. “We are creating light and hope. The candles represent hope,” said Rachel Irby, the organizer of the vigil. Elizabeth and her former teacher, 50-year-old Tad Cummins, disappeared on March 13. Monday was set to mark three weeks since they went missing. “We just need you home, and we love you and the house is empty and quiet without you,” said Elizabeth’s sister, Ninita Thomas. According to the family's attorney, Elizabeth had confided in a sibling that Cummins convinced her she has no future in college. The attorney added that the friend who dropped Elizabeth off at Shoney's the day she went missing said Elizabeth had mentioned wanting to be taken home. Friends handed out green ribbons at the Mule Day parade on Saturday. Ribbons have still been on display on the square in Columbia. They said they hope she sees it and realizes how much support and love she has at home. The pair was captured on surveillance video at a Walmart in Oklahoma City on March 15, but there have been no other confirmed sightings of them. It was unknown what vehicle they may be traveling in.

Next week the US president will have an informal summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the resort. Photo: AFP When the Chinese and US presidents meet next weekend at Donald Trump’s “Southern White House” at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, both sides will play down the angry rhetoric of recent months, especially about trade. The tensions will remain. If anything, Washington’s failure last month to repeal and replace Obamacare makes it more, not less, likely that the US administration will embrace tax changes its opponents regard as deeply protectionist and damaging to relations with America’s largest trading partners, especially China. On examination, the criticisms are largely misguided. But that will do nothing to lessen the friction. Quite how much Trump really cares that the Republican party’s proposed replacement for Obamacare failed to pass in the House of Representatives is debatable. During his campaign, he strongly suggested that he would have preferred a more socialised form of health care. The advantage of the proposed bill to the White House was that it would have freed up fiscal resources to help fund a policy that the president really does care about: tax cuts that he believes will place him alongside Ronald Reagan as a pro-growth economic reformer. The real reason China won’t exert economic pressure on North Korea The trouble for Trump is that the Republicans in Congress insist that any fiscal reforms must lead to a balanced budget within 10 years. That means if the president is to cut the corporate income tax rate from approximately 35 per cent to 20 per cent as he wants, he must come up with an alternative source of revenue. One option would be to impose outright tariffs on imports. But that would inevitably lead to retaliation and damaging trade conflicts with America’s most important economic partners. The other option would be to press ahead with proposals put forward by the House Republicans for a so-called “border adjustment tax”. This would impose a tax on imported goods and services while providing tax rebates for exporters. To critics it is no less protectionist and destructive than simple import tariffs. But in practice it would be little different from the tax regimes in force in America’s largest trading partners, including both Germany and China. Under its current system, which relies heavily on taxing corporate income, the US taxes production. In contrast, most other big economies apply value-added taxes (VAT), which means they rely more on taxing consumption. This discrepancy has some curious effects. If Daimler in Germany builds a Mercedes car and exports it to the US, the Stuttgart-based manufacturer receives a full VAT rebate from the German government. And when the car is imported into the US, it is subject to no federal taxes. In contrast, if General Motors builds a Cadillac in Detroit and exports it to Germany, the company is taxed on its US production. Then the car is subject to VAT when it is sold in Germany. In effect, German cars in the US are sold free of tax, while American cars sold in Germany are double-taxed, which is why you never see Cadillacs on the Autobahn. Far from being a protectionist measure, as its critics allege, the proposed US border adjustment tax is intended to level the uneven playing field imposed on American producers by the current US tax regime. And rather than damaging international trade, most economists believe the border adjustment tax would have no impact on trade volumes. That is because in theory, the US dollar would strengthen in the foreign exchange market just enough to offset any trade advantage gained though the adjustment in tax rates. Why China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ plan is doomed to fail But theory is a slippery thing. The rebate of a 20 per cent corporate tax rates on exports, and the imposition of a 20 per cent tax adjustment on imports, would imply the US dollar should strengthen 25 per cent against the currencies of America’s major trading partners. However, many economists believe the US dollar is already overvalued by around 25 per cent. In consequence, the application of the proposed border adjustment tax would see the US dollar move overnight from a 25 per cent overvaluation to fair value. This would result in a major gain in competitiveness for US-based companies that would boost domestic production, discourage imports and incentivise companies to relocate to America – exactly the outcomes Trump promised during his election campaign. None of this means the proposed tax reforms are a foregone conclusion. The big US retailers like Walmart, which sell mostly imported goods, are resolutely opposed to the measures. And they carry a good deal of political heft, especially in the Senate. And, of course, the idea of a border adjustment tax will attract vehement criticism from foreign leaders, including Xi Jinping (習近平). However, given that backers of the proposed reform are not planning to do anything that America’s trading partners, including China, do not already do, any protests next week at Mar-a-Lago should be taken with a pinch of salt. ■ Tom Holland is a former SCMP staffer who has been writing about Asian affairs for more than 20 years Tom Holland recent articles For Hong Kong’s housing squeeze, the easy fix is ... 26 Mar 2017 24 Comments The reason China won’t exert economic pressure on North Korea 19 Mar 2017 14 Comments The shadow looming over Hong Kong’s pumped up asset prices 13 Mar 2017 7 Comments Abacus Tom Holland Newsletter Sign-up Asian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.

Gruesome scenes as Colombia mudslide death toll hits 210 03-Apr-17 233 MOCOA: Survivors described gru ... With Trumpcare good and dead for the time being, the administration and Republicans in Congress have a new goal they think will be much easier to accomplish: tax reform. "Now we're going to go for tax reform, which I've always liked," President Donald Trump said shortly after the Friday demise of the GOP effort to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's signature health care law. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, too, said that the implosion of the ill-fated American Health Care Act frees up the GOP to "proceed with tax reform." Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin even predicted on Friday that reforming the U.S. tax code would be "a lot simpler" than trying to get rid of Obamacare. But there are plenty of reasons tax reform is going to be just as hard a lift for Republicans as health care turned out to be. If Trump was shocked - shocked! - to discover that health care policy is complicated, just wait until he wades into a debate over the tax code. For starters, the failure of the GOP's health care bill actually buggers up the numbers for its tax reform effort all on its own, because repealing Obamacare was actually a gigantic tax cut in itself, offset by hundreds of billions of dollars in spending reductions, largely to Medicaid. By doling out those tax breaks - which would have mostly helped out the very richest Americans - and paying for them, if you will, by eliminating money that provides health care to lower-income people, the GOP intended to move the baseline for tax revenue in a more favorable direction, thus allowing it to reduce the budget hole blown by its tax reform bill. Now, though, the GOP either has to leave the taxes in Obamacare in place, or remove them but find something other than gutting Medicaid to cover up the resulting cost. Have fun with that. And there are other cost complications that could also beguile the tax reform effort. Republicans plan to use the process known as budget reconciliation to pass their tax package, which means Democrats won't be able to filibuster it, but also that can't have a deficit-increasing effect outside of a 10-year budget window. So Republicans will either have to sunset their tax cuts after 10 years, ala the Bush tax cuts, or they have to find enough offsets via eliminating other deductions, credits or tax giveaways so as to make their package deficit neutral. Considering that outside analyses of tax plans proffered by both Trump and congressional Republicans show they would lower revenues by trillions and trillions of dollars in those years beyond a decade, that's a whole lot of offsetting to be done. And therein lies the biggest problem the GOP is going to have: Everyone loves the idea of tax reform, but no one likes losing the tax break from which they benefit most. In theory, the idea of lower, simpler taxes always sounds appealing; in practice, once Republicans get into the nitty-gritty about which loopholes and other bits of nonsense they want to eliminate in order to not completely eviscerate federal revenue, lobbyists are going to descend upon them like mother bears protecting their cubs. This is particularly true on the corporate side of the tax code. While nearly everyone in Washington bemoans that the U.S. has a high corporate tax rate on paper, they tend to yadda yadda past the fact that U.S. corporations actually pay pretty average rates compared to the rest of the developed world thanks to the smorgasbord of goodies left for them up and down the code. And every one of those giveaways has a corporate heavyweight behind it willing to go to the mat. Just look at the Republican suggestion that the U.S. adopt what's known as a "border adjustment tax" to help offset some other corporate tax changes they want to make. Retailers such as Walmart and Target, along with domestic energy companies, went nuts - they even put out fun ads about it! Does anyone think Trump - who apparently got bored with health care after a few weeks and was relieved to see the GOP's whole effort implode in on itself - is really going to get invested in the details of a tax overhaul, which can be just as mind-numbing? He likes big trucks, not discussion about the deductibility of state and local taxes or the costs of depreciation rules. And he'll have corporate bigwigs whispering in his ear about how whatever tax break is on the chopping block is actually vital to America's greatness. So the fault lines within the Republican caucus on tax reform will certainly be different, and maybe even much shallower, than they were on health care, but they're there all the same.

Beauty Inc. (NYSE: ELF) has filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its secondary offering. The company priced its 8.34 million shares at $27 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 1.251 million shares. At this price, the entire offering is valued up to $258.96 million. The underwriters for the offering are JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Piper Jaffray, Wells Fargo, William Blair, BMO Capital Markets, Cowen, Stifel and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. This is one of the fastest growing, most innovative cosmetics companies in the United States. ELF Beauty has challenged the traditional belief that quality cosmetics are only available at high prices in select channels. The company offers high-quality, prestige-inspired beauty products for eyes, lips and face at extraordinary value, with the majority of its items retailing for $6 or less. These price points encourage trial and experimentation, while the commitment to quality and a differentiated consumer engagement model engenders loyalty among a passionate and vocal group of consumers. ELF Beauty believes its success is rooted in the innovation process and ability to build direct consumer relationships. Born as an e-commerce company over a decade ago, it has created a modern consumer engagement and responsive innovation model that keeps products on-trend and consumers engaged as brand ambassadors. The consumers provide real-time feedback through reviews and social media, which enables ELF Beauty to refine and augment its product portfolio in response to their needs. The company leverages its fast-cycle product development and asset-light supply chain to launch high-quality products in as few as 20 weeks from concept, and 27 weeks on average. The products are first launched on elfcosmetics.com, and distribution is generally only broadened to its retail customers after ELF Beauty receives strong consumer validation online. The company believes this has led to consistently strong retail sales per linear foot of shelf space. This is also one of the fastest growing cosmetics brands at Target, Walmart and CVS. The net proceeds from this offering are going toward the selling stockholders. Shares of ELF traded up 3.1% at $28.47 Friday morning, with a consensus analyst price target of $31.00 and a 52-week trading range of $23.73 to $32.54.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business Front & Center: Jamie Birch invests in people to make his e-commerce business successful SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 2017 Jamie Birch is the founder and CEO of JEBCommerce. He talks about his business in Coeur d'Alene on March 24. (Kathy Plonka / The Spokesman-Review) By Michael Guilfoil For The Spokesman-Review Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Five facts Business started: 2004 Employees: 27 Clients: e-commerce websites Annual revenue generated for clients: $110 million More information: jebcommerce.com; (800) 208-6215 COEUR D’ALENE – Child psychologists say it’s not unusual for 3-year-olds to confuse what’s real and make-believe, and for 5-year-olds to consider themselves experts on everything. Eventually, though, most youngsters develop empathy and discover that others have opinions worth considering. Jamie Birch recalls going through those stages … as an adult. His make-believe stage manifested itself during one of his first job interviews after college, when Birch boldly claimed internet skills he didn’t possess. His know-it-all phase peaked soon after launching his own company in 2004, when Birch’s enthusiasm disguised his inability to comprehend profit-and-loss statements. And empathy? That came years later, once Birch acknowledged he had much to learn and sought advice. One upside of that decision was having his internet marketing agency – JEBCommerce – cited by Entrepreneur magazine as having among the best small-company cultures in America, based on collaboration, innovation, communication and work environment. During a recent interview, Birch discussed his professional coming of age, along with foosball and his favorite self-help book for business owners. S-R: Where did you grow up? Birch: Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. S-R: What were your interests? Birch: I wanted to be an architect. The only merit badge I remember from Boy Scouts was my architecture badge. S-R: What did you do to earn that? Birch: Not as much as you’d think. (laugh) I had to create a blueprint for my family’s house, interview an architect, and draw a building I admired. S-R: Did you have a favorite class in high school? Birch: I was the layout editor of our school paper. I don’t know if it was because of the journalism or because I got a hall pass to be anywhere, anytime. S-R: What was your first job? Birch: I had a paper route when I was 10 or 11. Then I worked on a tree farm, which was awesome. They gave me so much freedom. I got to drive trucks and tractors when I was 12. They’d tell me to go mow some pasture, and I’d be gone for eight hours. S-R: Any other careers? Birch: Before starting college, I framed houses, was a DJ, and worked for my dad at Nalley’s. Eventually he said, “You’re either enlisting in the Army or going to school, but you’re getting the hell out.” So I went to college. S-R: Where? Birch: Central Washington. After changing majors a couple of times – first biology, then kinesiology – I earned a degree in finance. S-R: Was there a moment that changed the direction of your life? Birch: Yes. In 1999, my dad sent me an article about the dot-com explosion, and it included a photo of some 20-year-old kid driving a fancy Bugatti. That’s when I decided to focus on a dot-com career. My parents had moved to Sandpoint, so I looked for jobs in North Idaho and came across one for something called a “search-engine guru.” I didn’t know what a search engine was, but I was a cocky 24-year-old, so I applied. When I got to Post Falls, they asked me two questions: how was the drive, and whether I thought I could do the job. I said the drive was fine, and, yeah, I could do the job. They hired me, sat me in a room with a card table and a PC, and said, “OK, get us search engine rankings.” S-R: And you had no qualification? Birch: Absolutely none. But back then nobody knew what the internet was. I figured if I had aptitude I could write my own career. S-R: How long did it take for you to gain traction? Birch: Months. But by then the dot-com bubble had begun to burst. S-R: Where to next? Birch: After a brief detour to Seattle, I went to work for Coldwater Creek in Sandpoint, and was there four years. S-R: Doing what? Birch: Affiliate marketing, email marketing, paid search – anything to do with digital sales. Eventually, I realized I could do the same thing for a bunch of companies, so I started freelancing on the side and networking. I spoke at conferences, wrote for magazines and online publications – anything to gain clients. A year later, I left Coldwater Creek to launch JEBCommerce. S-R: How has the company evolved since 2004? Birch: In the beginning, it was very much about sales. Now it’s about people. S-R: Explain. Birch: Early on, I tended to go through employees very quickly. My whole focus was survival and gaining clients. Eventually I realized the people here were more important. Now, almost all my time is spent on employee development, mentoring and coaching. We still do amazing work for our clients. But everyone here can also use their job as a means to improve their professional and personal lives. S-R: Let’s go back to the early phase. Describe that. Birch: I was a disaster – hyper-reactive … always in emergency mode. I tried to force my will on people, which was ruining their lives. When they quit, I figured they just couldn’t hack it. Another problem was poor financial stewardship. I have a degree in finance, yet I couldn’t read a P and L. Ours was so awful that one potential suitor looked at it and said, “This doesn’t mean anything.” S-R: What turned the company around? Birch: I read a book called “The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don’t Work and What to Do About It.” The basic message is that you need processes and systems. We relied strictly on talent back then. Every time a new client came on board, we had to start from scratch. Today we have a 300-page playbook of how we do business. S-R: How about the financial stuff? Birch: Four years ago, I finally admitted I didn’t know what I was doing, and started working with a financial coach. My leadership team and I meet with him by video every two weeks, and our entire staff meets with him once a week online to talk about employment development. S-R: What services does JEBCommerce offer clients? Birch: We acquire customers, analyzing their behavior, suggest ways to optimize our clients’ websites, and make those changes. S-R: Describe your biggest division – affiliate marketing. Birch: We help arrange relationships that attract customers to our clients’ websites. For instance, if you’re into home remodeling, there’s a set of websites you go to for information. We identify which customers our clients want to get, where they go online, and then we approach those properties and say, “We have a product your audience would love. Let’s negotiate a way to get exposure.” Instead of paying for advertising up front, our clients pay a commission after they receive product orders. S-R: What’s an example? Birch: We connected an Idaho-based fitness and supplement company with a YouTube blogger – alpha m. – who reviews fitness products. After about three days, alpha m. became our client’s top affiliate, outperforming other partners that had been running our ads for a month or more. That generated significant revenue for our client, and commissions for alpha m. S-R: As e-commerce evolves, what challenges lie ahead? Birch: Fifty-four percent of incremental sales online last quarter happened on Amazon. A huge swath of online shopping is moving from direct sales to Amazon, Walmart and eBay, which impacts the number of people who shop directly on our clients’ sites. S-R: What do you like most about your job? Birch: I love helping people grow and change their lives. S-R: What do you like least? Birch: Finances. (laugh) S-R: What are you most proud of? Birch: The (Entrepreneur magazine) culture award. S-R: What are examples of good and bad office culture? Birch: Accountability is good. Gossip is bad. S-R: Your website mentions your employees enjoying foosball and Nerf wars. Are those examples of good office culture? Birch: Five years ago, people were playing ping-pong and foosball all day long. Today we realize that good culture is about providing an environment where employees find fulfillment. We like our people to come in, kick butt, learn and grow, and then get out. I don’t want them playing foosball for an hour and then having to work until 7 o’clock. S-R: What has this job taught you about yourself? Birch: That there are many things I thought were true that weren’t. S-R: Is there anything you wish you’d done differently? Birch: Sure. But I really like where we are, and I don’t know how we would have gotten here any other way. S-R: Your website says eight languages are spoken in your office. What are they? Birch: Hungarian, Spanish, English … um … eight languages? (laugh) We had a ringer who spoke like six different languages, but they’re not here anymore. We probably need to update our website.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News Best Bet for IRAs: OptionsHouse vs. Capital One There may be no better way to save for retirement than by opening an IRA . With all the tax benefits of a 401(K), and all the freedoms of an ordinary brokerage account, IRAs offer investors an opportunity to control their own financial futures. But selecting a brokerage for your IRA isn’t always as simple as it seems. Today, we’ll look at two discount brokers, OptionsHouse and Capital One , to review what they offer IRA investors. Commission prices Of all the ways to buy and sell stocks, doing it online through a discount brokerage is inherently less expensive. In the table below, you’ll see that OptionsHouse and Capital One price most trades at less than the cost of a combo meal. Brokerage Stocks and ETFs Stock Options Mutual Funds OptionsHouse $4.95 per trade $4.95 + $0.50 per contract $20.00 per purchase Capital One $6.95 per trade $6.95 + $0.75 per contract $19.95 per purchase Data sources: Company websites. The differences in pricing comes down to just two dollars per trade, a relatively small margin for most investors. But Capital One’s higher prices come with an asterisk: The company provides the option to place trades that are not time sensitive and pay just $3.95 per trade. Its so-called ShareBuilder program can be used to purchase stocks, ETFs, and funds. You can also set it to buy automatically for you. One small secret of the brokerage industry is that prices aren’t always concrete. In fact, many brokers’ special offers for new clients include commission-free trades and cash bonuses that are added to your account balance. These bonus offers are effectively discounts on the standard price. Mutual funds, ETFs, and commission-free choices Not every action in an IRA account comes with a cost. In fact, it’s common for brokerages to waive fees on a selected list of ETFs and mutual funds. Brokerage Total Mutual Funds No-Load, No-Transaction-Fee Funds (NTF) Commission-Free ETFs OptionsHouse More than 12,100 None 5 (O’Shares) Capital One More than 1,100 More than 400 None Data sources: Barron’s , company websites, and representatives. Depending on the role funds play in your portfolio, you could potentially save thousands of dollars in fees by investing in commission-free ETFs and no-load, no-transaction-fee mutual funds. At around $20 per investment, investors who use Capital One and OptionsHouse to make repeated fund purchases every month for a year would pay approximately $240 in fees just to buy their favorite mutual funds. Some brokers have more free funds than others — compare some popular brokers here . Minimum deposit requirement for IRAs You won’t have to empty your life savings to open an IRA with Capital One or OptionsHouse. Both brokers feature no minimum-deposit requirements, which means you can open an account with the balance in your change jar. It also means that you can get started now, rather than save up in less lucrative or tax-inefficient accounts before opening an IRA. No-minimum IRA brokers help you save for retirement without destroying your piggy bank. Image source: Getty Images. Investing in foreign stocks and ADRs If foreign stocks strike your fancy, OptionsHouse and Capital One both enable their investors to trade American depositary receipts (ADRs) from their online accounts. You can think of an ADR as something like a foreign stock ticker that trades on an American exchange. Many of the world’s largest companies have them. However, if it’s important that you trade directly on international exchanges, you’ll have to settle for a different broker. International trading capabilities are only offered by a select few discount brokerages . Mobile trading apps Do you have a tablet or a mobile phone? If you answered „yes” to that question, you’ll be pleased to find you can trade from anywhere with an internet connection. Here’s how each broker’s users and customers rated their mobile trading apps, as of March 15, 2017. Brokerage Apple App Store Google Play OptionsHouse 1.6 stars 3.1 stars Capital One 2.5 stars 2.9 stars Data sources: Relevant app stores. IRA account fees and service charges IRA fees are common, but many are avoidable if you know some tricks. Maintenance fees (for having an account) and inactivity fees (for trading too infrequently) are some fees that are more common than others. But there’s some good news here: Neither OptionsHouse nor Capital One charge either kind of fee, so investors don’t have to sweat that their IRAs will be nickel-and-dimed by unexpected and recurring charges. OptionsHouse vs. Capital One: A review Depending on how you invest, OptionsHouse and Capital One could potentially be a good fit. CapitalOne’s ShareBuilder service can be a good way for new investors to get started, given its lower costs, and the fact that it can also be used to purchase no-transaction-fee funds completely free on a recurring basis. OptionsHouse might be a better fit for people who trade more actively, or who plan to trade options more frequently. Ultimately, it’s all about how a broker’s offerings align with your portfolio.
