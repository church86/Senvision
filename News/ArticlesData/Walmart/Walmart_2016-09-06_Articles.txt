The lawyers are Judith Scott, general counsel for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Richard Griffin, general counsel for the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB). They spoke at a recent symposium in Washington on labour law. They described what is now the fastest-growing movement among low-wage workers — the “fight for 15 and a union,” which is being led by SEIU.Scott recalled that it started in November 2012, with 200 fast-food workers in restaurants in New York City. They struck for the right to unionise without employer harassment. “Now it’s spread to thousands of workers in at least 30 cities,” Scott said. “And workers in six countries overseas have launched solidarity movements. “We in the SEIU didn’t send people into small cities in Arkansas, but we got calls from fast food workers there. ‘We’re on strike,’ they said. ‘What do we do now’?” The first priority of the movement, which Scott said also restored the right to strike in many locations, was not to win union recognition and collective bargaining. Instead, workers made gains through winning new legislation. The results have been dramatic: raises in minimum wages in cities and states across the US. For example, fast food workers in New York City and New York State won legislation raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour and the establishment by Governor Andrew Cuomo of a commission to investigate low-wage workers. They did this through building political power. To illustrate the importance of low-wage workers organising into unions and fighting for political clout at the same time, Griffin cited the movement of Wal-Mart workers to unionise into the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). The campaign has as one of its objectives the establishment of nationwide wages and hours standards to cover Wal-Mart workers. However, the UFCW has had to fight store by store. The US Supreme Court several years ago barred it from a nationwide class action suit charging wage and promotion discrimination against female workers.“The organising process has been slow and fraught with obstacles,” Griffin said. “There’s a steady stream of cases, and handling them efficiently is a challenge.” The NLRB has convicted Wal-Mart officials at least 288 times for violating the rights of workers. But those convictions did not influence Wal-Mart to change its anti-union practices, Griffin said, because the penalties involved are so small. All Wal-Mart had to do was to shell out some back pay and post notices in its stores and warehouses informing workers of their rights. Wal-Mart continues to disregard these rights with impunity. Griffin said: “The National Labour Relations Act has not necessarily been flexible enough to accommodate workers.” What’s needed is new, stronger legislation to protect workers’ rights. Such legislation has been blocked by big business and the Republicans. To effectively fight back, Scott said, workers from many different industries must join together. “In the service sector of the economy,” she said, “we are looking at putting together fast food workers, retail workers, port truckers, Wal-Mart workers, warehouse workers, home healthcare workers, and adjunct professors.” “It’s important not to suffer from a lack of imagination,” she said. Griffin concluded: “The fight for $15 and a union has the same strategy and mobilisation tactics as Black Lives Matter, the environmental justice movement and the campaign for LGBT rights. “Sooner or later,” he predicted, all four movements “will have a convergence on their issues,” with all four supporting each other.

But the connections continue to follow her: Emails from when she was secretary of state that were publicly released Friday show that she met privately with top Walmart executives in 2011 and that the agency assisted the company's effort to buy a South African retail chain called Massmart despite union opposition. Federal Election Commission filings show that Alice Walton and Sam Rawlings Walton, respectively Sam Walton's daughter and grandson, each gave $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund in late 2015 and early 2016. The fund is a joint project of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic committees of 32 states and Puerto Rico that allows wealthy donors to provide the maximum allowable donation to all 35 entities at once with one check. The records also show that Alice and Sam Rawlings Walton each gave the Clinton presidential campaign $2,700 in 2015, the maximum allowed under federal law during the Democratic primary. Sam Rawlings Walton's wife, Tillie Walton, gave another $2,700 during the primary. Alice Walton also gave $25,000, the maximum allowed under federal law, to the super PAC "Ready for Hillary" during the 2013-14 cycle. Clinton family allies such as political strategist James Carville run the organization, now called the "Ready PAC." Also from the Washington Examiner McCrory overcomes bathroom bill, wins re-election North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory won his re-election bid over Attorney General Roy Cooper Tuesday night in the highest profile gubernatorial contest in the U.S. McCrory's victory came despite backlash to the highly-criticized bathroom bill he pushed for and defended throughout the past eight months. The bill, known as House Bill 2 (HB2), created a firestorm after it was passed in March, which forced transgender individuals to use the bathroom of their biological sex, not the gender they identify as. Cooper's campaign was centered around a repeal of HB2, arguing that it "writes discrimination into our law," adding that it has been a "disaster" for the state's economy. By Al Weaver • 11/09/16 5:14 AM The Walmart Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation each has given between $1 million-$5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to its website. A search of election commission filings didn't show any donations by the Walton family to Republican nominee Donald Trump's campaign. The various donations run counter to the widespread perception of the Waltons as staunch conservatives. Clinton's ties to the Bentonville, Ark., retail chain go back to 1986, when she joined its board of directors while serving as the state's first lady. She remained on the board until 1992, when husband Bill Clinton ran for the White House. Sam Walton himself had called Clinton and asked her to serve on the board, she recalled in a 2004 speech. At the time, the company was being criticized for its lack of diversity. A 2007 Los Angeles Times story reported that it was Alice Walton, who knew Clinton socially, who suggested her as a board member. Also from the Washington Examiner With Trump as president, what's next for the Republican Party? The Washington Examiner examines the future of the Republican Party. By David M. Drucker • 11/09/16 4:57 AM Clinton received $18,000 annually for serving on the board and a bonus of $1,500 for each board meeting she attended, a 2006 Associated Press story reported. The Clinton family amassed $100,000 in Walmart stock by 1993, which was put into a blind trust after Bill Clinton was elected president that year. The Clintons flew on the Walmart corporate jet 14 times during 1990 and 1991. Labor leaders in particular hate Walmart for its anti-union stance. The company employs more than 1.3 million people in the U.S., making it the nation's largest private-sector employer. By all accounts, Clinton never challenged that stance during her time on the board. Instead, she reportedly pushed the company to hire more women and to focus on environmental issues. She was a public booster of the company. "I'm always proud of Walmart and what we do and the way we do it better than anybody else," she said at a 1990 stockholders meeting. "She was not a dissenter," said Don Soderquist, vice chairman during Clinton's tenure, told the Los Angeles Times in 2007. Clinton has distanced herself from the company in recent decades. He tenure on the Walmart board gets a single passing mention in her 2003 memoir Living History. She returned a $5,000 donation from Walmart's political action fund in 2008 after it became an issue in the Democratic presidential primary that year. She said at the time that the company's policies "do not reflect the best way to do business and the values that I think are important in America." Her campaign did not return another $20,000 in contributions from Walmart executives and lobbyists, though. As recently as 2014, she held a book signing event for her second memoir, Hard Choices, at a Little Rock, Ark., Walmart. Bill Clinton defended her board tenure in a 2008 interview with ABC, saying that they "lived in a state that had a very weak labor movement ... She knew there was no way to change that, not with it headquartered in Arkansas." Correction: This article originally incorrectly attributed Samuel Rawlings Walton's $2,700 donation in 2015 as having been made by his father, Samual Robson Walton.

Barber $28.87 Women’s Tank Top $18 Women’s Raglan Hoodie $35   Working-Class Struggles in Southern California Symbolize Blue-Collar Blues Across America Posted on Sep 7, 2016 By Bill Boyarsky   Daniel Anseko Vaina, an independent truck driver, on a highway bridge overlooking the Port of Los Angeles. (Bill Boyarsky) It should be named “the exploitation highway.” The path begins at the Los Angeles Harbor and extends about 100 miles east to the warehouses that process goods for Wal-Mart, Amazon and other retailers. These products are unloaded from container ships from Asian manufacturing plants, where labor is much cheaper than in the United States. Here, far from the noise of the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton brawl, are painful examples of what this presidential campaign should be about—$10-an-hour working people struggling to raise their families out of poverty, straining to send their kids to school, falling through holes in the safety net. At the port, truck drivers—classified as “independent contractors”—wait in long lines to pick up loads. Driver Daniel Anseko Vaina told me he might get $185 a load to carry a container of Wal-Mart merchandise. From this, he subtracts $35 for fuel, $60 for the transportation company from which he leases his truck and another 5 to 10 percent for insurance, leaving him with less than $50 or $60 a day. Advertisement Square, Site wide The trucks carry the containers to warehouses. Most are east of Los Angeles, in the area known as the Inland Empire. There, goods are stacked, often precariously, on pallets, and then sped to sorting tables. Warehouse workers told me they receive about $10 an hour for dangerous work that offers no health or retirement benefits. One pallet knocked down Alejandra Lopez, 56. The company sent her to a clinic, which approved sending her back to work, despite extreme pains in her abdomen. She couldn’t make it. An attorney helped her get workers’ compensation, which paid for surgery. She cried as she told me her story. I met these workers while pursuing another story. We’d been talking at Truthdig about whether white blue-collar manufacturing workers, left behind in the current economy, would vote for Trump. But Latinos are now the largest single ethnic group in California, especially in the southern part of the state. Manufacturing jobs are declining. The white blue-collar workers I interviewed earlier in my career have diminished in number, along with the auto, aerospace and other manufacturing plants that once employed them. Instead of the story I set out to cover, my attention was caught by an article by professor Juan Lara of the University of Southern California: “Warehouse Work: Path to the Middle Class or Road to Economic Insecurity?” That was connected with another story of working-class economic insecurity: that of truck drivers, deprived of regular pay, classified as independent contractors—as if they owned a business. Together, they amount to a story: the exploitation of hard-pressed working people, no matter their ethnicity. Barb Maynard, a communications consultant for the Teamsters Union, which is trying to organize the drivers, introduced me to Vaina, a truck driver who goes by the nickname Seko. We drove around the edges of the Port of Los Angeles, which occupies 7,500 acres of water and land. The adjoining Long Beach Port sprawls across another 7,600 acres. The shipping industry says these two ports account for nearly half of the sea cargo coming into the United States. Classifying drivers such as Seko as independent contractors is a good deal for the trucking companies, which he said don’t have to pay salaries or benefits (drivers are paid by the company that receives the shipment upon delivery). Rather, money comes to the trucking companies from the drivers’ lease payments and parking fees for their trucks. The drivers buy fuel and supplies from the company—at the company store, you might say. As Tennessee Ernie Ford sang in “16 Tons,” “Saint Peter, don’t you call me ‘cause I can’t go. I owe my soul to the company store.” The companies say the arrangement gives the drivers the life of independent business people, able to choose their hours and working days. But the drivers’ days don’t allow for much independence. Seko said drivers begin lining up at the port at 3:30 a.m. to get a chance for a load when the gates open two hours later. “I start out at 5 or 5:30,” said Seko, who drives his truck until 3 a.m. Drivers circle the docks filled with containers, but there’s no guarantee of a load. “There’s no work,” the dispatcher could say, Seko told me. The warehouse workers have a different kind of bad deal. I met them through Sheheryar Kaooji of the Workers Resource Center, which is organizing warehouse workers to pursue rights guaranteed by law, such as safety and wage protections. He arranged for me to meet with five warehouse workers at the center, located in Ontario, Calif., a small city near the warehouses. They spoke Spanish and another resource center worker translated. They earn $10 an hour, the minimum wage. “Today, I made enough for my ride to work or to pay the babysitter,” said Marian Garcia, 45. She pays for her daughter’s transportation to college. To earn extra money, Garcia sells clothes and pots and pans bought off the internet. Warehouse work is dangerous. “There are so many injuries and accidents, you end up paying [your wages] for medical expenses,” said Rafael Sanchez, 54. “Boxes are stacked high, and there are injuries when boxes fall on top of you. Stacks topple over.” Speed for the quick movement of goods is all-important. “They used to time us,” said Sanchez. “We stopped that. Now they stand in front of you and stare. You will feel the pressure.” The workers are up against a business community fixated on recovery from the recession. I talked to Christopher Thornburg, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting and Development at the School of Business Administration at the University of California, Riverside. According to him, take-home pay for workers is understated. “Median earnings in the Inland Empire … is running $42,000 a year,” he said, adding that that’s what warehouse workers receive. But USC professor De Lara noted that that figure includes management and high-skilled jobs. If you count just unskilled, blue-collar workers, the annual pay is $22,000. For women, it’s $19,000. Generations ago, there were strong unions—the autoworkers, steelworkers, machinists, longshoremen and others. But an unfriendly judicial and regulatory system has made it almost impossible for unions to organize drivers classified as independent contractors or warehouse workers in scattered facilities, each with a different owner. That should be part of the presidential campaign. It took courage for the workers to meet with me. The bosses could retaliate by cutting their hours or not giving them work. I asked why they’d agreed. One said, “We want our children to have a better life.” Another told me, “The reason we are struggling is not just for our children, but for everyone who works in a warehouse.” I was stirred by those words and touched by their stories. They were far different from anything we’ve heard in the presidential campaign.

All you read me. Peace or no way we're moaning and 48. Right now on Sports Radio WEEI. I six point 77797937. Targets of football gonna get in the baseball here in the in a second. And we'll hear from Jimmy drop below coming up in this hour eleven through life you've talked in the media. That's onus would rather he's been through but he did buy that vehicle you're much. To operate one thing before we get a two Brothers are watching you use a baseball where it's been talking about how well we. Hard Knox is this year. So they get the the fifth episode last night. And it it was by far the best but only because. LaMarcus Joyner is totaled don't. We aren't dinosaurs again the journalists don't work Wal-Mart yup he wants or at Wal-Mart he's not gonna start the which role coach so he's on Eric reader hello welcome to Wal-Mart the election. And he he's walking out into the field and and so well. A Fisher Jeff Fisher asked him if he had overslept and he responds don't even warm. Right now then got another scene in which east sit there restocking of the secondary coach he said the rams can have their money man. And it goes on and on I work hard and if I'm not gonna start medical work. I did it. Ultimately full plate escape from money. I don't play but I don't go to each candidate I did notice I watched that show anymore it's. Her brother footballers. At a rock of love that watch all six the other day REI got a mollid ethic is seven may be actually of that show. Could ever want it easy watch a lot of parties to join an additional. You always has also been on the boat is always doubt and the hot hand tonight Paula welcome right now. The cameo. In it to wherever the football we're gonna win any awards. But it's nice to Atlantic. About it in my eye candy not the bathing suit on a mom's life on. Forums that he needs a lot. Of drugs sex and and so limited nudity he had a terrible people hope disguised orchestra on TV. You look like a complete idiot you're lucky. Talented pitcher lucky to be able to play in the National Football League and certainly becoming but the series. The only totally serious I know he was totally serious where's it hit from Arkansas. Through that horrible market. Is where where they started quarters up out of that Bob's discount whatever it like it's the worst part of it isn't as Wal-Mart started the Arkansas the port as the Jeff Fisher has the most going to be donors. Report won't know is that wal mart's stock here that can. Or could argue it should you're basically starting you're part of our nickel package and getting used a nickel awful so you're going to be out there unlawful illegal. It started and have decent. Website it says Wal-Mart shopper or shall all the pictures of all of it. We you're gonna go to Wal-Mart and outages oddities that exists with Wal-Mart shopper through this you think he can walk into Wal-Mart behead him issue the first week. It doesn't well to be huge sweep floats. If you don't like away or not. He's out of there is an American. Gay don't make me dead come out. Just that you would you rather like. That your hand off work just. It just. And stories. Are let's get to well let's get to the Red Sox. Com. How many things I can be. Warned about. With a it's harder to death. Project that probably sell it for what you got to go back to how many times have you changed your opinion I haven't changed my towards your ritual and it would defeat since I did you change your opinion when we're seller goes out there and he's competing for Cy Young years at Peking is going to be. A Boston they vastly overpaid in the war with the thinking. Going out and paying him just because he was 26 years old. He may be coming into the peak of his career should start results when you start a book I'm gonna get the book at them get to I'm. So I get the personal couldn't be more wrong about ports and I can't tickets or for a while Hanley Ramirez. Though wrong he has not been at the level. Or anywhere close to that or solo I thought it was going to be total Boston it was going to be disaster but they are for disaster. He is been fine he's been better than fine he hasn't been an issue. Eight if I think this secret his offensive numbers believe it or not. Ehrlich second or third for first base in this position itself a democracy well he's been terrific and I was wrong got one out of the room did you brought it up. That's when he bombs 89 stakes. So I bet that's that's stationary to 84 right in septa said. Of these days of it in 3035 whatever but he beat me twenty to 25 and driving coast on the out of the O 280 commit these. He's been better than I ever ever ever thought you would think so I say I'm wrong about that when he went to Clay Buchholz. The thing was I didn't want to give him away I think you wanted to give them what you with a year ago a year ago you wanna get away this year on the but I started like boat people that houses Don when the season start of it. While we do this again about god so. I never thought that he would be able to come back because. Specially since he's been up and down and throw multiple open he's back as the stars back the ball but he's back as part of me I always feared. That teaches us. Mentally tough now to be able to fight through this and say F you know I'm gonna show you how good idea. And I got to give credit that bouncing around like that. If you're a guy that's fairly weak if you have some issues some you don't. Self esteem issues or whatever. That's enough to knock you down to the point where you can't go out there and do what you need to do. He's defying all of us would get more critical I never saw the stuff. In a three year that's virus. It would give him a white practice news I don't wanna give that equity was in that rotation. They're visible -- no ball play buckle to history but we talked about we noble buckle to sister talked about the negative but I understand why is that pissed you off. Don't we talk but the positive enough. And it's we if you really know his history. And you know they've run is in there. What he'll be the best pitcher and your staff. As it happens every single year. Mean look at the last couple years when all three years for six years whatever it is look at it. There's always 1112 game stretch. When used lights out. It just happens it quite frankly last year if he took Alec the second start of the year was pretty much all year long before he got hurt Emmys can turn every year. We forgot about the positive. And when he's on a twelve game run if you pull them out of their rotation that we re week four that you missed eight or nine outstanding starts every user gets hurt. We have very goes over that run we'll get our number. But there's no about sort of saying is that there was above and half left right so. And it is and is ideal but it clip buckles gonna be good for awhile get hurt and suck for awhile. Why not do that from April to July yeah. And at the guide in August September haven't run which is what he's in the middle of what you brought in bright he brought in Rodriguez. How's it look like right now I think that that they wish they put Stephen right and it DL stint or little. A rehab start. I'm gonna have second thoughts and says the did you look all this crap these gold right now read that coughing up to big league baseball games in the pennant race. What would normally has birth signs raider tendinitis. At at night and nobody thought they were seated autos are you so get two opinions by about that nothing but double dealing with the pain. That might get a little injection in there and your fine ability to want to come back. To me like they wanted to in my review is hundreds hundreds of late is that exactly my deal with the buckles was. You know you always do that you had skilled yet talent. Just knew it was a ticking time bombs are going to be an injury overs because she was gonna mentally implode when you just on reliable in combustible just waiting for it to happen. But based solely on the Agilent dot he can do that even going back to his wife up in the book big topic and active and nothing Elvis speak. Click anything you raising money to have a charity event in a mocking his wife but you could get any worse but he's close and his job is getting demoted. I would say that under the circumstances. I'm not gonna say he's mentally competent and strong but he's handled this it's like Steve brought yes I did a bit lucky that you write and. See I I always thought that he had these runs and that. Because if you go back to 2013. They don't win. Without that run he had where he won his first what 91011 games something like that so he's always had these runs we know that. The key was tough enough. To be able to mentally tough enough to be able to battle back when they're tossing him now. He was basically don't mop up guy get out of the bullpen and you know got he's a mentally collapse yeah authority right wrapped and you know they were trying to penalty at all over the league to see if they can get something back. And he just couldn't get enough back to make it look good. Now we're at the point power at the point. Blue wrap this up while blacks are given credit on this one where you're looking to pick up what is that thirteen and half million bucks for next. Yet but it's not for me it's not for the reasons of keeping. It's. You know if you see what he does yeah the last few weeks. And Richard it was gonna be freeagent. Out of matches at Dodgers might try to lock him up if he could finish as strong as well before leaving gets to a over chills not they're click buckles the best pitcher and free agent market got market the best pitcher to free agent market you have for thirteen and a half million dollars. Why wouldn't you pick that up. And move. What was the sidewalk it's not good for clay. Right because you turned on the option it's nice little deal we pick up the options go one year deal doesn't help him out but as an organization what would you pick and a. I think you would write in mobile up. And he's got enough so now outs. Questions about it this is a thorn in September of think he's going to be fine so this is a team that's gone over the if you look at from the all star break and so that's a fairly large sample. The one thing that we feared the most in the first of the season I certainly it was there's going purchase. Starting pitching has been literally as good as any team in the American League right in the eighth inning. Believe that it maybe he'll let the recent killer. Well it in and not timely hitting in that lol we are going to at least a bit wary least of their worries. It really it if you if you're looking at the rotation for the for the policies which is something else we feared. You feel better about David Price don't you you certainly feel good about report cell round consistent. In the you're looking at your third in your fourth I mean based on. Roger is when Eduardo Rodriguez feels under percent and he feels good physically. He's got pitcher is is it too early hours it isn't just back and forth to give it back on it did Joseph Kelly train. We agree on bottom and jokingly told that a bit harder to secure votes are to throw us off. As I've I don't you never got up but I'll let you get out like jump back god is there room for one please blessed with a gold mine and I think it all else. And yet get the eighth inning. What the other day. There's just last night and it was like man I came in the eighth inning. And it was 99 it was 99 it was off speed 85 than it was 99. At it was a great eighth inning. Uga Uga vote two weeks year. And yeah you rotations is set. In my mind you at five guys right. Thanks comic view you appreciate the effort got to believe that that much damage happened the next liked it if you look at slide recently it's like back in the second base. I don't champ that a little bit but for the love of god. Europe pitcher which shall automatically us. But he does know a little bit of disarray and I think it missed the whole year because of that little woman's body it's not as not just Baghdad rotation this I don't know it a mile product out. It's a nice city here in the next week or so you go low leverage restart didn't. They'll bad start to give you something and Kelly and with your coaching gets in there so you'd. Like I would get some what's gonna step up some what's gonna figure this thing out musical are still in the mix. Vicious cut ziglar. Johnny can use them. Christ. I'll just say in right I mean I don't get this why did at a guy bigger ambient avid avid user I don't get the bleep out of get the sequence and I really don't summary doesn't believe in yeah. I don't know what it is he doesn't see him as of these are written into the Portland god right right and that's what it was it was isn't a sixty get a big a car whatever you're right but anyways. They got low but it time here. And they get to mark Joseph Kelly was a guy that you could sit here. You know what took so long. Honestly TC until the last cup outings while it was this now on this roster. The last two weeks of August that's a good deal them brought him back September 1 minute Kelly the last two weeks of August that's really gonna help the couple games Olympic cup from up. It was a tired that's what you do right shelf for weeks at a rest. You know and then send them back a much a let's get to my accountant who. Is striking out at every single at bat. Which at seven in a row or something like that it's had its neighbors Angela. He's really. You you could see it and I'm not a lesson misses. The kids coming in here in a tough situation. He's coming in it was gone through the cultural change over the last year and then you're asking him to go win there and suddenly they're developing a book on him. You could see it is struggling with a curve ball. Check the safeties Chris Kidd hit curve ball. And today and hear her at all and every fastball he gets us outside the strike zone you you can see it is that the book yet I can't market. And they and they know exactly what he is right now so what do you do with them you don't wanna give up obviously advocate he's got too much optional. Scott and memo of all. He he certainly looks like a player off the the scandal was confident he does appear he's on an extra calories before long programs. This is my bit it's and he came up in a dispute. You know because many more polished on the bases the ball almost in the field he's got a better idea the zone when he she'd been attendee up the playing. In the slipping John Husseini handles everything ready handles power fastballs he handles those sinkers away changeup curve ball. Is he left the up there is Paula fastballs in and he didn't sliders the other way you change it the other way or fastballs way the other way just covered all play. You know social Q2 what got a can do. Nokia's get a fastball. Well let's see begin to break a ball off it and let's begin to quick book you go right to a breaking ball simple yet. Up pull the trigger on hangers. He can't lay off the ones in the dirt like I said he's not get a learn how to hit a curve ball overnight this level that it just wake up tomorrow San Diego or in Toronto but second curve ball it starts with being laid off want. They'll lay off of it and don't miss the fastball curve also deepens don't right now he's missed a fastball he stuck in between he's in trouble so you sit appropriate for days. Now I give him go to test and I give below is the occasional star. Maybe it's one game at Toronto maybe it's not I don't know come back home give them a stark primary date anthrax in our own two days off I just. Now gonna bring it back a little bit you denounce the world these are start their basement every day or night got a real back. And he got to play Trevor shock poll tonight a team accused fight for his job. The night before eagle three for five of three for six when a bomb five RBIs. And into the field for three days. And you get left now. Now I don't know. That's not always stop at left is here at their base. We just it drives me go to remotely testing you want but you're going to take that doesn't sit CO2 both colts wouldn't say big hit a you know it it's their allegiance didn't matter where we want to type of giving you the answer I think they're bros list with animal you along. It's good that starting middle because they're gonna need at the skits of the fall calls his art in new report hi art. I don't. But it. Climate on the lookout no issue. Why do we are rationing and we're a little bit tender right. Oh I college actual oh the twentieth. News. I would that would bring up a clash in in the in the latter I don't know it beaten. You would if all your scene he's written a book warning. Well that's why it's not because of him. He came up because of the guys the big league level or get it done Bradley not hitting Bogart's anything. Well it. Didn't play enough or hitting OR that's why it's insane it wasn't him it was more of. He used to mention the other ticket for a price yet that this rally there I think. Day yes but he wasn't. He was not meaning for the longest time so they needed bats and he was killing it in triple. As Ben attendee was and that's why they brought him OK a double he was killing. So and they brought him rabbit disrupt traffic shock is the reason why he came up. Be honest with. Liggett Trevor shot the left handed bat was swayed in about consistently and well won't cut that would never be apparent Q what he's going. But he wasn't he wasn't out he was struggling now. He started to make about a contact and it to call the kid up and up she goes three for sixty and it with a bomb but if he was doing his job accountable and up in the first place. It's garlic Buchholz accused doing his job early on it still have a job in his rotation. Like Napa art I can totally understand my ball to those guys came to the big X. It makes all the sense in the world they were hitting and now you've got National League games were it's difficult to put David Ortiz into the lineup. Needed even more I mean take David Ortiz out of that lineup you could say it's it's a lot different. A lot different. I'd six point 77797937. 1145. You will hear from Jimmy drop life from fox. On air online via FaceBook Twitter and it's grab more of or wade were loading and 48 right now. Sports Radio WEEI. Why are growing Fauria talk a little baseball mixing in with the football they're from much illegal ruffle. But he thinks that. Polls show. We'll have that is in a few minority or better way it is really. Tightening up if you look this is going to be an unbelievable month between the start of the football season. And a month in which the Red Sox are going to have to fight and claw their way. Into the postseason because it is really tightening up right now the blue jays in the Red Sox or tied for first place in the elite Baltimore's only game now. We have to worry about right now is if you don't win the division. You're on a battle would Detroit and Houston. For a wild card spot. And by the way the Yankees have been playing some decent baseball as well though they're three and a half out in a while cardinal to get good enough you think David after. No I don't but the but the problem too is that you know the month of September he played division. I think these the best division. And amass the best team. Texas might be that but is our topic Texas. Houston plays the the eighties we saw that you want to let three should've won three three to pay the angels sock. In the that it twins the White Sox in in your division. You gotta go play the race who we've seen him in that they get good pitching. They got to explode bullpen did pick up some power they can be chipped in L and yankees playing outstanding right now yeah they are so you know that it's to have. It's one of the issues that you feel the Red Sox and you look at Theo. No real these last few games here we don't really have any easy once complained. Terry and I'm still amazed I was saying this weeks ago and I'm still saying especially with the improve. The improvement of the of the starting pitching. At the Red Sox are are tied in the division and still. You know a spec away from not even make it into the post season there at the offense there's a lot of recent look at starting pitching. What does not come down to the bullpen. And the manager. Basic music that he ever to break if a driving emergency brakes on a little bit if elect eagle pretty good regulate I should go better ship and I guess also emerged breakdown Diego. It's called emergency brake from now he smelled so it's not follow him for what Michael it's not him I don't these good manager you know is in the last few games they lost is nothing on him I mean Kimberly comes in a way back some most loss that's the right move record nuts about it he should know old. He can't come in now actually recently he's been doing just fine weaving in and see situation he's got a committed an ugly situation what is. But he but he hasn't done well in the past so you should know what's on him that's. Ansonia only shoot at me it's on the play that's on him but he brought ziglar yes particulars of milk cart you don't do you put a big poster in the back of jobs and apple over shoulder and I got out of Boca it's not significant is it and it's love affair with Pedro. And this Ramallah I hear the music coughed up games that cost them games that's why this. Did that they shouldn't be tied it before five games up on us. In the scheme of things in the annual look at those you'll look at those games and you've got to have some remote rightly everything's got chemical perfectly right there's going to be up you know a 5050 decision like I you know you just guessed wrong. It to me it's it's. Africa's rich is that the team league got to win the games this poster yes. That's a sick coughed up games I'll sit there it's July. But it it is they've they've coughed up games in my mind yes under sixty twos can be gained had a crappy team whose pitcher who's best pitchers. Just great Oakland then San Diego which got the lost those two games. But could endorse good scoring runs right but there's other I'm talking both those games and struggled games that given way. Whether the bullpen late had a couple of at a couple like you know block off error wins or losses are revival out. Up up eight to nothing and used again. They're they're been some bizarre games I just look at them and look at the offense look at the starting pitching now. And I would say they have the best starting pitching in the division. The bullpen is shaking put rentals ball. They're having all sorts of issues right now duke and shoot Toronto gives up of the lead me eight the other day an open trial of the truck and bought typical. Ticket the auto soda and ticketing problems all year long night before they lost the Yankees Angela read an article without read a Boston Globe with a Errol. Is that it's offered to wait too inconsistent. The coaches great offense but you inconsistent. And that's where ya what the Red Sox score all those runs c'mon score one run the next few nights I take two teams this would be a shame and it would be a disaster. If this team did not make it to the policies. It would give you what I'm away I know that I know that's that's out of saying it's insists this is scary when you look at where they are in the stand. And it's you could win the division. Or you could be totally out of this that. And housing and you know looking at New Yorkers looking up a run you know they've been on two and as you know where the rat I mean this is a team that was basically selling everybody. Is getting rid of advice of put pretty well for a team that's. The league gave up by so listen we're focused on next year and all the studs evident can't afford any stumble all know I had only lip slightly point one aliens well screen well the two teams of mean I believe it in the in the east like you said their that's the best division so you can have three teams Boston Toronto and Baltimore. I mean and you gotta look at the wild card in your rear grip against. Detroit it's a Boston Toronto Baltimore when you must have obesity just goes to Houston New York Kansas City. But the point is that Detroit. You know you recently played Baltimore right grind it out in a four game series and it Blaine Minnesota. It and eagle from Baltimore to New York who's playing great baseball and they go to Chicago White Sox right. Or Houston I think they're kind of they're on the outside but still there rated gas. Same thing you grind in a Baltimore Toronto and New York or playing good both side order Tampa Bay was kind of sneaky. And they got us the seven game home stand against Oakland and LA. The angels this would be an absolute. Disaster. If the Yankees made it in as the world record in the red so right when you can. Better than what we you can suggest that the Yankees blew up their team. And blew up three headed monster out of it would it would be out anything that would leave this date this should be off the charts as. Asked to go win this division I I agree they got to win the division I accustomed to when I'm not so sure play teams come out of this interest because of that scenario played out. Baltimore Toronto Boston all played each other New York's play each other vote grind it out. The better when it division developing preteen to come in the east that I do think team like Detroit. It's gonna get another wild card just because of who they've got mail. They've got Chicago and Minnesota got a bunch of games with them the right let's go to Matt that's implement IMAP. I don't. Well upon. Back until Kelly. I've never remembered usual no labor it must start. But after seeing them accountable and our potential Kelly it's stale Altman pitcher he burned out on by a Florida it's 999 and I 85. His pitch and it seems so much better it would only goal to enrich our reality to him that he he went to a little one yeah. Even warmer. It seemed like you know. He comes out and you know he isn't it all the children and our bullpen right now need someone like that. I agree I I Iowa studies better rentable that he's a two pitch guy throws pure heat out there. He is of open. That there aren't they also won New York has Joba Chamberlain unfortunately east you fiddle but. Don't you just killed in the bullpen that what I'm not a starter in terrible on that are made to those 67 inning the right to know. Two props. Yeah I got to find them it's you don't wanna give up on him as a starting your hope is Wade Davis. You know so yeah he could be I I just. I can't believe he was not appear before. A diet I have no idea he could change last two or three weeks for this team to be one more game. It is out that's out of there you don't at the island combat give him a break right now OC a coach you can look like that's gonna be a big one. Of course you can demoted to all the ball anything close to what we're accustomed to or is gonna be a guy's going to be at this hour. All great Gonzales come on people actually before it is outcome of the DL yeah as he both. For a reason charge show what makes you think he's gonna be any good is openly coach he's different. Third year and roadways and our children that I mean after awhile you figure out he's got only so many miles in him and then he just can't do it. It's a great question I don't know why they didn't take this hour put him on the sidelines with the afraid that he was not gonna handle well. I mean amicus Kelly was doing what he's doing now if I wanted to finally Eric is so much this year yeah for some weeks analyst. I don't get yours David in Florida I gave.

Tech columnist Jennifer Jolly has tips on what to do with your old device. This thing is absolutely huge. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney) 4192 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE It happens every September like clockwork. Apple unveils a new smartphone, marking the unofficial start of the fall gadget season, and the official start of people everyone wanting the newest hottest handset. Before you fork over fistfuls of hard earned cash for the next new thing — here’s how to make  bank on what you already have lying around: Sell it to Apple Apple’s new iPhone trade-up program offers store gift cards for iPhone 4’s or newer models. Apple’s flat rates are more static than other trade-in options, which means you won’t likely see them shift much from day to day or week to week. However, the current prices for the iPhone 6 and later are some of the best around, with Apple offering as much as a $250 gift card for an iPhone 6 Plus in great condition. That’s less money than some of the other services, as you’ll read here in a second, but again, many other prices will drop dramatically over the next few days. (The company only accepts iPhones from whatever the previous generations might be though, so I’m out of luck with my 6S until the 7 arrives.) Sell it to a reseller Resellers such as Glyde and Gazelle are great picks again this year too. You go online and answer a few questions about what you have, they estimate how much they’ll pay you for it and send a box for you to mail it in. The last time I checked, Glyde offered $297 for a 64GB iPhone 6 in great condition. The site also warned that it expects prices to drop at least 15% by the time the new iPhone 7 comes out. That’s an issue across the board with many of these services if you don’t have another phone to use between now and getting the new one. USA TODAY What to expect (and what we want) from iPhone 7 Gazelle - Of all the bulk resellers, Gazelle is the most popular, and we’ve talked about it many times here before. Gazelle’s known for great trade-in values and fast payment turnaround times. All you have to do is select the phone, carrier, storage size, and condition from the easy-to-use trade-in tool and then wait for your pre-paid shipping box to arrive. Then, once you have your phone packed up, send it to Gazelle and wait for the cash to roll in. If you don’t want to worry about waiting for your phone to sell elsewhere or making a listing on an auction site, Gazelle is the ultimate no-brainer. If you have an iPhone 6s in decent condition, you can score hundreds of dollars for it. The exact amount will vary depending on the carrier and storage size — for example, a 16GB iPhone 6s on Verizon is worth $242 in excellent condition, but that same phone on T-Mobile is worth $238 — but as long as you’ve kept your phone in good shape, you can expect a solid lump of cash for it. If you have time to do some comparison shopping, double check the prices with Glyde, and others such as Nextworth, which runs a similar trade-in system, and see which one offers the most cash at the moment. uSell - You might not have heard of uSell, but if you’re determined to get the most for your phone you should definitely be considering it as an option. Unlike most other trade-in sites, uSell is actually a hub for many different resellers to attempt to outbid each other for your iPhone. These companies post their best offers on the site, and uSell organizes and matches you with whichever one is promising the best payout. Because of the competitive nature of the site, uSell’s prices can often exceed those on Gazelle and elsewhere, if only by a few bucks. USA TODAY Apple unveils iPhone 7, kills headphone jack Amazon - The world’s largest retailer got into the trade-in game a handful of years ago, and today it’s one of the most popular options. To get started, simply search for the iPhone model you own and see what prices are being offered. Chances are, the value will be similar to what is being offered elsewhere, but because Amazon also takes into account the color of your device, you might discover that your Rose Gold iPhone is worth a tad bit more than the Silver model with the same specs. Once you accept the trade-in offer, you can print a pre-paid shipping label and send the device out at your earliest convenience. The really nice thing about Amazon’s program is that once you lock in your trade-in price you have a full 30 days before Amazon expects it to arrive at their doorstep, which means you can use your phone for those precious couple of weeks until your brand new iPhone shows up. Walmart - If you hadn’t heard, Walmart is all about trade-ins these days, and the iPhone is no exception. You can browse the values for used iPhones on the Walmart site and see exactly how much they’re willing to pay you for your phone. Unlike most other trade-in options, Walmart’s criteria for a trade-in seem much more laid back, with only two quality options — either working or not — and no questions about the color of the device itself. You can trade in either online or in-store, but the one major drawback here is that you are paid in a Walmart gift card, rather than cash, which means you’ll have to buy your new iPhone from Walmart as well. Sell it yourself! If you’re no stranger to the likes of eBay and Craigslist, you might be able to get an even bigger payout than you could at any resale site or store. eBay specifically can be a great place to get lucky with bidders trying to outdo each other, but there’s also a very real risk of a bidder not paying for the phone once they’ve won an auction. That’s a risk for sure, but the reward is a potentially bigger bump in your bank account if it pans out. USA TODAY Incremental Apple should 'swing for the fences' As for Craigslist, there are some who absolutely love it, and if you list an iPhone you’re going to get plenty of attention. As always, try to price your device in line with what the resellers are offering to make sure you don’t get ripped off, and always make your exchange in a public place so you don’t fall victim to some punk trying to run off with your smartphone. Don’t forget to back it up and erase your info No matter how you choose to sell your phone, you should always keep your privacy and security top of mind, and that means wiping your device so that none of your personal info can be salvaged by the buyer. Here’s how to do it: First, sign out of your iCloud account by going into the Settings menu, selecting iCloud, and then tapping Sign Out. If you’re on an older iPhone which is still running iOS 7, you’ll tap Delete Account instead. Once that’s taken care of, go back into your Settings menu and select General, then Reset, and then tap Erase All Content and Settings. Verify your decision and then wait for your phone to wipe itself and reboot. The last step before parting ways with your iPhone is to remove the SIM card, which is located in a small slide-out panel on the side of the device. Find the SIM card slot and open it by inserting the SIM card removal tool into the small hole. If you don’t have a SIM card tool, a paperclip, thread end of a small needle (the more blunt part), or even an earring post (yep, just did it) work well too. Once the slot slides open, just remove the small card inside and close the SIM door again. Now it should be all ready for the next owner to make it their own! When all else fails, recycle responsibly. If your old iPhone isn’t worth the price of someone even paying postage for it, the Apple Renew program is an easy way to dispose of it securely and responsibly. Drop it off at an Apple store or ship it in — they make sure your personal data is destroyed — and then hand it off to Liam. According to Apple, Liam’s a freaky-awesome futuristic “line of robots than can disassemble an iPhone every 11 seconds.” It can also sift, sort, and save more high-quality components than previous methods, recycling more precious materials than ever before. While squirreling away old gadgets might just be a distant cousin to real hoarding — not serious enough yet to have its own reality TV show — there’s no reason to sit on a mountain of old devices.

The Martin Agency Reduces Staff by Nearly 6% By Lindsay Stein. Published on September 07, 2016. Reprints Reprints A scene from the Martin Agency's 'about us' video. Credit: The Martin Agency Two months after losing its Walmart business, The Martin Agency has reduced its staff by 5.6%, or 29 people. The reduction, which leaves the Interpublic Group shop with 486 staffers, did not affect its London office, said Dean Jarrett, chief communications officer at the agency. He said "the vast majority" of the layoffs were in the Richmond, Va., office, where most employees are based, though a few people were cut from the New York office. Related Stories Publicis Groupe Creates New Entity for Walmart to Handle U.S. Creative, In-Store Marketing Harry Jacobs, Chairman Emeritus of The Martin Agency, Dies at 87 Geico's 'Unskippable' From the Martin Agency Is Ad Age's Campaign of the Year 2016 The workforce reduction is due to a number of factors, such as clients reducing spend, losing Walmart in July and The Martin Agency looking at how to realign resources for clients, Mr. Jarrett said. While he did not have a breakdown of the levels or roles that were let go, he said the agency had to look across all areas "to make sure we have the right mix of talent and skill sets across our organization," as well as "bandwidth left for new business." While Mr. Jarrett said it's a sad day for the agency to lose staff, it's looking to pick itself up and move forward. In July, Ad Age reported that Publicis Groupe and Walmart were creating a new entity to house the retailer's U.S. creative and in-store advertising, along with other pieces of business that do not involve advertising. The retailer had already been working with Publicis Groupe's Saatchi & Saatchi on creative, as well as The Martin Agency, which wound up losing all creative work for the business. In June, Harry Jacobs, chairman emeritus of The Martin Agency and the man who proved that great advertising did not have to come from New York, passed away at his home at age 87 in Richmond. At the beginning of the year, The Martin Agency's "Unskippable" campaign for Geico was lauded with Ad Age's first-ever Campaign of the Year award. The campaign also earned the Film Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in 2015.

A review of this pie garnered a ton of attention on YouTube — over five-million views to date — and Walmart essentially sold out immediately. Well, Walmart is back at it again with four new Patti LaBelle treats to serve its customers nationwide. Are any of them worth trying? Would they live up to the success of the sweet potato pie? I obviously had to find out. The Goods Walmart released four new Patti LaBelle desserts nationwide: three cobblers and one cake. There is also a sweet potato loaf that Walmart released, but it has a limited release, and we did not get a chance to try it. The cobblers are sold pre-baked at Walmart. You can eat them cold if you're about that life, or reheat them in the oven for 12 to 16 minutes based on your preference. Here's what you should know about all of them based on the description on the packaging and ingredients listed. Patti's Good Life Berry Cobbler, $6.98 Walmart's description of the cobbler: "Loaded with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and boysenberries." A serving size of this cobbler (there are eight servings), contains 270 calories, eight grams of total fat, and 32 grams of sugar. Patti's Good Life Apple Cobbler, $6.98 Walmart's description of the cobbler: "Sweet Fuji apples loaded in a flaky top and bottom crust." A serving size of this cobbler (there are eight servings), contains 240 calories, 8 grams of total fat, and 30 grams of sugar. Patti's Good Life Peach Cobbler, $6.98 Walmart's description of the cobbler: "Flaky top and bottom crust bursting with sweet peaches." A serving size of this cobbler (there are eight servings), contains 280 calories, 13 grams of total fat, and 28 grams of sugar. Patti's Good Life Apple Pecan Cake, $9.98 Walmart's description of the cobbler: "Delicious blend of apples and Georgia pecans baked inside of a Southern-style layer of cake finished with buttercream icing and caramel." A serving size of this cake (there are eight servings), includes 320 calories, 17 grams of total fat, and 31 grams of sugar. The Results But first, a hit from Pattie LaBelle that you should probably be familiar with. Please play this song while you read the results of our research. For this not-very-scientific taste test, I let all the hungry people in our office have at the cobblers and cakes and asked them for their opinions. I did not heat up the cobblers beforehand — I could try to convince you that I did this for a reason, but really I just forgot. Plus, the cobblers are sold in the bakery section at Walmart, and you could very well just grab one for a last-minute picnic. Let's go with that explanation. The resounding winner of the taste test was the berry cobbler. Some of our editors went back for seconds (and thirds) on this treat. I was super impressed with all the different kinds of berries in this cobbler — it almost tasted like it was fresh. If I was feeling a little lazy before a potluck where I was supposed to bring a dessert, I would consider picking this up — especially if I could heat it up and top it with vanilla ice cream. The peach cobbler was also well-received in our office, but was noticeably sweeter than the berry cobbler. I would also recommend this for a lazy potluck. The apple cobbler was the sweetest of the cobblers, and was the least favorite in our office. The cinnamon flavor was a bit overwhelming for some of my colleagues, and the gelatinous nature of the dessert made it seem less fresh than the others. I was very excited to try the apple pecan cake — it looks so pretty! — but it was simply too sweet for me. The texture of the cake was great, and I loved the apple flavor, but the frosting was just too much. If you have a big sweet tooth, however, or know someone who does, this might be a nice option for a birthday. It's also only $10, so that's pretty awesome.

She said she had not received her income tax return and after she questioned him about it, he came to her home and brought her a check for $542. He told her it was her tax refund, but the check was from a bank and not the U.S. Treasury. She had also provided the Bainbridge man, 46, with a check for $21,000 to purchase certificate of deposits, but he never provided proof that he had. After she involved her attorney, they learned the man had been permanently barred in 2014 from acting as a broker or from selling securities to the public. The suspect has not responded to the attorney's request of the woman's records and also failed to answer a call from police. The incident is under investigation. Theft of credit cards, Mayfield Road: A man reported Aug. 21 his credit card was used fraudulently to make a $500 purchase at Giant Eagle on Aug. 19. He said he was at work in Seven Hills at the time of transaction and he was still in possession of his credit card. His bank is investigating the incident. Fraud, Mayfield Road: A doctor reported Aug. 25 one of her employees called in prescriptions for controlled medications for a patient to pharmacies using her DEA number. The patient had not been prescribed one of the medications and the employee called in a higher dosage and usage frequency on another. She said she had since questioned the employee and the patient and the employee, a 43-year-old Solon woman, admitted she fraudulently called in the prescriptions and split the medications with the patient. She fired the woman from her position and told the patient to find another doctor. The local DEA office advised the doctor to file a police report. The incident is under review. Theft, Mayfield Road: A man reported Aug. 27 someone stole his wife's purse from the cart return at Walmart at he located the suspects across the street at Circle K. He and his wife had returned to Walmart after they realized the purse was left behind. It was missing, but the man recognized a vehicle at Circle K that he knew was parked next to their vehicle. He went to Circle K and confronted one of three women that were with the suspected vehicle. She denied having the purse, but the man saw it emptied out in the vehicle. He reached in and collected the purse and its belongings, but was still missing a credit card. It was believed one of the women tried to use the card at the pumps but it was denied because she didn't know the proper zip code to enter. The suspects left the area, but the man took a photo of its license plate. Responding officers spoke to a Walmart employee, who said he had stopped one of the women for shoplifting. He did not identify her though because he isn't a loss prevention employee. The main suspect is a 24-year-old Cleveland woman. The incident is under investigation. Animals, Golden Gate Plaza: A woman, 26, was warned about leaving a dog in a vehicle Aug. 28 and she said she and her boyfriend were in Chuck E. Cheese for just a few minutes. Her boyfriend, a 24-year-old Cleveland man, was found to have an active warrant in the city and subsequently arrested. Theft by deception, Marsol Road: A woman, 65, reported Aug. 28 she was defrauded out of $27,000 after she was lead to believe she won a sweepstakes on Facebook that was sponsored by Mark Zuckerberg. She was contacted in February by a woman, who claimed to work for Facebook and told her check would be withheld until she paid $27,000 worth of taxes and fees associated with the winnings. On several occasions, she wired payments between $1,000 and $3,000 to various people in Nigeria and California. She also had checks deposited into her bank and credit card accounts and was instructed to wire a portion of the money, in which she did. She later learned the checks were fictitious. On one occasion, she bought four iPhones and sent them to California. She became suspicious of the scam after she told the woman she would not send any more money and was then told she would be arrested for money laundering. The suspect has since closed the Facebook account. The incident is under investigation. Harassment, Eastwood Avenue: A man reported at 8:38 p.m. Aug. 28 a neighbor came to his home demanding he and his adult son come out and fight him. He believed the man was drunk and upset over an incident that occurred more than a year earlier. The man, 35, left prior to officer's arrival and was not at his home, but charges for menacing were signed against him. Disturbance, Mayfield Road: A man said Aug. 28 the mother of his son struck him with her car in the Walmart parking lot. He said he was behind her vehicle and trying to prevent her from leaving until she told him who was with their son. Officers spoke to the woman at her Mayfield Heights apartment, where she had left her son with her boyfriend. She said the man and his wife were punching her car windows and yelling at her. The man asked to prosecute, but was told surveillance video would need to reviewed. He showed signs of injury. Fraud, Mayfield Road: A manager of Howard's Jewelry and Loan reported Aug. 30 a former employee initiated a fraudulent loan for himself in February in the amount of $2,150. She said the Solon man, 50, quit his job the day before forfeiture notices were sent out and they realized what he had done. She said he had since made no effort to repay the loan and wanted to file theft charges. Officers called him at his new place of work and asked him to contact them when he was available to talk. The incident was forwarded to the prosecutor for review. Theft, East Miner Road: A resident reported Aug. 24 his bike, valued at $100, was stolen out of his driveway. There were no suspects or witnesses identified. Harassment, Maplewood Road: An apartment resident said Aug. 26 a neighbor told her to mind her own business and she has an ongoing problem with her. Officers spoke to the neighbor, who admitted making the comment and said it was because the woman follows her around the complex. She said she just wanted the woman to leave her alone. Officers told the woman what the neighbor said, but she continued to claim the woman stalks her by walking past her windows on the way into the building. She said she parks in certain spots for the sole purpose of walking past her windows. Officers suggested she get management involved in the situation, but the woman said "they are useless, just like the police." See more Mayfield Heights news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest.

The associate professor at Columbia claims the results show a correlation between a community's race and income and the average Yelp review of the local big-box retailer. Reich says his findings show that reviews of Walmarts in white, rich neighborhoods are more likely to feature adjectives such as "friendly" or "typical." But in low-income communities with a predominant population of black or Latino residents, stores receive lower ratings. Reich blames the subpar service on understaffing in these areas. Walmart called the report "flawed and without merit," according to Business Insider. The study published in the May issue of Context, a quarterly publication of the American Sociological Association, doesn't detail the number of positive and negative reviews. The study's reliance on only Yelp reviews limits the researchers from taking any of the reviewers' preconception on the store or specific locations.  Craig McCarthy may be reached at CMcCarthy@njadvancemedia.com.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 7, 2016 at 9:47AM Image source: Getty Images. Dividend aristocrats are a select group of high-quality dividend stocks. Among other requirements, a company must have increased its dividends for 25 consecutive years or more to be considered a dividend aristocrat. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but a solid track record of dividend payments can say a lot about the health of a business. On the other hand, many dividend aristocrats have been delivering lackluster dividend growth lately. This includes widely popular dividend stocks such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which are raising their dividends at anemic rates.  The retail giant is asleep On Feb. 18, Wal-Mart announced its most recent dividend increase, raising dividends by $0.01 per share, from $0.49 to $0.50 quarterly. This was the third consecutive year in which Wal-Mart increased payments by only $0.01, so lackluster dividend growth is becoming a trend for the discount retailer. The retail industry is aggressively competitive, and things are tougher than ever for brick-and-mortar operators because of increasing pressure from online players in the past several years. Wal-Mart is actively investing in people and technology to expand its online presence, and the company recently announced the acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion to gain ground in e-commerce. Management is doing the right thing by putting the company's long-term strategic position above current profit margins. However, investments for online growth are taking a toll on profit margins, and consolidated operating income excluding the sale of Chinese e-commerce marketplace Yihaodian declined 7.2% last quarter. The stock is paying a dividend yield of 2.7% at current prices, a premium over an average dividend yield of 2.3% for companies in the S&P 500 index. In addition, Wal-Mart has a conservatively low dividend payout ratio of around 46% versus earnings forecasts for the current year, so dividend sustainability is not in question. However, as long as earnings remain under pressure, chances are that Wal-Mart will continue raising its dividends at a modest rate over the middle term.  Connectivity problems AT&T stock is paying an attractive dividend yield of 4.7% at current prices. On the other hand, the company has raised dividends by only $0.01 annually since 2009. These minuscule dividend increases are barely enough for AT&T to retain its status as a dividend aristocrat, but the company is really not offering much in terms of dividend growth. The telecom business is going through massive challenges since internet and related technologies are reducing communications costs across the board, which is putting considerable pressure on different industry operators. AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015, and the company is now the biggest provider of pay TV services around the world. However, the pay-TV industry is also facing a major threat because of cord-cutting and the online streaming revolution, so AT&T is on the wrong side of major technological trends in its two main businesses. Wall Street analysts are on average estimating that AT&T will produce $2.86 in earnings per share during the current year. This puts the dividend yield at nearly 67% versus earnings expectations. Unless the company can materially accelerate earnings growth over the middle term, this doesn't allow much room for rapid dividend increases going forward. A business in transition Procter & Gamble made a series of mistakes over the past several years. The company entered too many markets, and product innovation didn't work out as expected. This produced a stagnation in revenue growth at the consumer-staples giant.  In order to jump-start performance, the company is transforming itself into a nimbler and more flexible organization. Procter & Gamble has sold nearly 100 underperforming brands over the past couple of years, and the company is embarked on an ambitious cost savings program. In cost of goods sold alone, Procter & Gamble has achieved over $7 billion cumulative savings since 2012. This transformation will probably be a good thing for investors in Procter & Gamble over the long term, but dividend growth has materially decelerated lately. The company raised dividends by 1% in 2016, a considerable slowdown from 3% dividend growth in 2015 and 7% in 2014. The dividend payout ratio is in the area of 70% versus earnings estimates for 2016, so the company will need to improve earnings growth if it's going to revitalize dividend payments in the future. The dividend yield is above average, though, in the area of 3.05%. The Foolish bottom line Don't get me wrong: Dividend aristocrats such as Wal-Mart, AT&T, and Procter & Gamble are solid and dependable dividend stocks, and they're good candidates for investors looking for defensive plays and current income. On the other hand, those looking for vigorous dividend growth should focus on younger companies with superior potential for expansion over the coming years.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next LEHIGH ACRES, Fla. (WFTX) - A registered sex offender is officially listed as living at a Walmart in southwest Florida. Isaiah Jones, 27, was convicted of using a computer to lure children for sex, leading to his status as a sex offender. When approached by reporters of Fort Myers' WFTX-TV with an image of Jones, one of the store's employees recognized him. This month, Jones reported the Walmart in Lehigh Acres, Florida as his main residence. "Are you kidding me? He's registered as he lives here? There's no possible way," said one parent who was shopping at the store on Tuesday. Jones has a history of trouble with the law. In 2011 he was arrested twice; once for battery and domestic violence. Seven months later he was arrested for disorderly intoxication and causing a disturbance. In 2012, Jones was busted and charged with "using a computer to lure a child to engage in sex." "The way the world is today there's always a bad person no matter where you're going to go," said one shopper. Jones listed his status as "transient", or homeless, and registered his main home address as the Walmart location in Lehigh Acres. The store's manager told WFTX that he "knew nothing about Jones living there" and promised he "will tell his store manager" and they will "take action". Meanwhile, some shoppers plan to steer clear of the location until they know the coast is clear. “I'm probably never going to come back here unless I absolutely have no other recourse," said one shopper. The Lee County (Florida) Sheriff's Office said Jones' move is completely legal. They said it's up to Walmart officials to serve Jones with a trespass notice in order to have him kicked off the property. [Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story did not indicate investigators don't have any evidence Jones lived in or around the store.  We apologize for the lack of clarity in the original story.]   Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.

PT Written by Dave Mark Earlier today, I linked to the Walmart offer for one year of Apple Music at $99. I went to the site and made the purchase. I got an email, immediately, telling me that the purchase was made. About an hour later, I got a second email with a link to redeem the offer. I clicked the link, was taken to iTunes, entered my Apple ID password, and clicked to redeem the code automatically entered from the Walmart page. I was then presented with a button that said “Extend My Apple Music Membership”. I clicked the button and got a message telling me my Apple Music subscription was extended through the end of September, 2017. More importantly, the message said my subscription would automatically be renewed at the $99 rate. It was not clear if I had to go back to Walmart to pay that $99. I suspect that Walmart is now out of the picture, that future payments will strictly be between me and Apple. I do not have a family membership, so it is not clear how that will work. If someone with a family membership does give this a try, please ping me on Twitter and let me know and I will update this post. Matt I bought the year membership at Walmart.com and clicked the link. I received the same message as you but, if I go to my account–either on an iOS device or my laptop, its shows my subscription as expiring next month and not in September 2017. What does your iTunes account say for the expiration date? Michael I’m having the exact same issue. Per Dave’s suggestion, I’m discussing with @AppleSupport and will update once I have some clarification from them on this. Mark Same issue here – subscription shows that it expires on 9/30/16. I haven’t opened a support case with @AppleSupport yet. Kris404 This ‘Apple Music Gift Card’ is a fiasco. I redeemed the $99 Walmart coupon code on a non-trial account and it crapped out with a strange message. Apple support made me sign up for a 3-month trial and there is no indication if my $99 “used” coupon will kick-in after. Matt Here is a confusing update, I just looked at my subscriptions setting on my Apple TV and that shows a one year Apple Music subscription auto renewing next year at $99. However on my computer, iPad and my iPhone I still see nothing showing a one year subscription. Michael Interesting. Apple Support asked me to try changing my subscription. When I informed them that the only option I had was “Individual (Month)” (no Family or Year options), they claimed that having no options signified that my yearly sub would kick in on Sep 30 2016. Dougie Shirlaw I’m holding off until I see how / if the family sub works. John Goodman Did you get any updates regarding how this would work with a Family Membership, Dave?

Gray   |   September 7, 2016 Jason Isbell (Wes Frazier / provided) On Monday, Jason Isbell — a former member of acclaimed Southern rock outfit Drive-By Truckers — brings his soulful brand of Americana to The Criterion along with Memphis folk-punk darling Lucero. Isbell gave a shot in the arm to those believers of country music when the Alabama-born singer-songwriter’s album Something More Than Free debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Music chart in 2015. (It also topped U.S. folk, rock and indie charts.) This might sound contradictory, but it isn’t: The same year that “bro-country” cash machines dumped radio-friendly and clichéd hits on genre fans, Isbell found success with integrity and a whole lot less radio play. “It’s kind of like the difference between Wal-Mart and a family-owned grocery store. Some people love Wal-Mart and they go to Wal-Mart when they don’t have to,” Isbell said during a recent Oklahoma Gazette interview. “You know, they actually enjoy being there. I worked at one when I was 16 or 17 years old, and I saw about as much of Wal-Mart as I think I ever want to see.” Isbell offers more than an alternative to this decade’s model of mega pop stars. His music weaves together a vibrant tapestry of autobiographical experience, alternative country, Southern rock, classic country, Americana and even gospel genres and themes. Indeed, he offers an altogether different model of white male Southern artist. Genre bender One of the things making Isbell’s genre bending significant is that he is one of few commercially successful country-styled singer-songwriters in the 21st century brave enough to sing about the realities of white masculinity in the American South. On “Different Days,” from 2013’s Southeastern, Isbell laments “another drunk daddy with a white man’s point of view.” On “Flying Over Water,” a character looks out the window of a Southern-bound plane to consider a “little empire . . . built by slaves.” By acknowledging that the world — and the South, in particular — means different things to different people, Isbell’s narrative bends the modern country and Americana playbook toward a richer account of American life. Isbell’s songs also portray women as human beings with complex motivations and desires. Tunes like Isbell’s “Children of Children,” in which the narrator reminds a character born to a young mother about “all the years you took from her just by being born,” are a far cry from Luke Bryan’s “Country Girl (Shake It for Me).” “Children of Children” is deeply personal for Isbell, he explained, because his mother was 17 years old when she gave birth to him and raised him in rural north Alabama. When asked about the song, Isbell pointed to the fundamentals of storytelling. “There are just bigger and broader stories out there” he said. “The difficulty is telling a story that’s bigger than yourself without being vague. You have to choose the right details. And if you’re writing from someone else’s perspective, you better be able to empathize.” Empathy is something Isbell has, and it’s part of what separates his signal from the noise of much of today’s modern music. Instead of flattening and over-simplifying other perspectives, Isbell renders them with sharp emotional intelligence and a remarkable sensitivity for human detail. Jason Isbell plays 7 p.m. Monday at The Criterion. (David McClister / provided) “I feel like what we’re doing is more of a boutique thing,” he said. “My goal, really, is to communicate with people more than anything else — more than selling them something.” Bettering business To that end, Isbell called the music industry what it is: a business. Making and selling music is a job, after all. He started playing music as a boy, and his grandfather taught him how to play mandolin. “They’re trying to make as much money as possible,” he said. “That’s what all of ’em are trying to do. If they tell you any different, they’re lying to you.” While Isbell maintains autonomy from that world, he acknowledged he still has a foot in it. He lives in Nashville, the epicenter of the country music establishment, and has enjoyed many of the traditional markers of industry success. Isbell recognizes that value, but he’s careful not to get too engrossed in it. He’s married to singer-songwriter Amanda Shires, and the couple had a baby girl a year ago. Shires also helped Isbell find sobriety in 2012 and recruited valuable industry friends to help. She, with Isbell’s manager Traci Thomas at Thirty Tigers (who also manages musicians like Oklahoma’s John Moreland and Alabama Southern soul act St. Paul and The Broken Bones) and musician Ryan Adams — who himself battled life- and career-threatening addiction around a decade ago — held an intervention and found Isbell treatment. He has said his Southeastern album is largely informed by that experience and his newfound, whiskey-free clearheadedness. “I’m lucky to have a second chance at all this. I don’t remember a lot of the good times from my days with the Truckers,” he told The New York Times in a 2013 interview. During the Gazette interview, he added, “Being at the top of the charts was exciting. It was really fun for a week or two. … Because it’s another thing that says, ‘You get to be a successful musician. You don’t have to go back to pushing shopping carts.’ But it’s not a reflection of the quality of what we’re doing. Those things are arbitrary.” Real life is what matters to this singer-songwriter. These days, he focuses on his live shows and touring. The troubadour has more than two dozen concerts planned through October in venues spanning arenas, music halls and clubs.

Tech columnist Jennifer Jolly has tips on what to do with your old device. This thing is absolutely huge. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney) 4192 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE It happens every September like clockwork. Apple unveils a new smartphone, marking the unofficial start of the fall gadget season, and the official start of people everyone wanting the newest hottest handset. Before you fork over fistfuls of hard earned cash for the next new thing — here’s how to make  bank on what you already have lying around: Sell it to Apple Apple’s new iPhone trade-up program offers store gift cards for iPhone 4’s or newer models. Apple’s flat rates are more static than other trade-in options, which means you won’t likely see them shift much from day to day or week to week. However, the current prices for the iPhone 6 and later are some of the best around, with Apple offering as much as a $250 gift card for an iPhone 6 Plus in great condition. That’s less money than some of the other services, as you’ll read here in a second, but again, many other prices will drop dramatically over the next few days. (The company only accepts iPhones from whatever the previous generations might be though, so I’m out of luck with my 6S until the 7 arrives.) Sell it to a reseller Resellers such as Glyde and Gazelle are great picks again this year too. You go online and answer a few questions about what you have, they estimate how much they’ll pay you for it and send a box for you to mail it in. The last time I checked, Glyde offered $297 for a 64GB iPhone 6 in great condition. The site also warned that it expects prices to drop at least 15% by the time the new iPhone 7 comes out. That’s an issue across the board with many of these services if you don’t have another phone to use between now and getting the new one. USA TODAY What to expect (and what we want) from iPhone 7 Gazelle - Of all the bulk resellers, Gazelle is the most popular, and we’ve talked about it many times here before. Gazelle’s known for great trade-in values and fast payment turnaround times. All you have to do is select the phone, carrier, storage size, and condition from the easy-to-use trade-in tool and then wait for your pre-paid shipping box to arrive. Then, once you have your phone packed up, send it to Gazelle and wait for the cash to roll in. If you don’t want to worry about waiting for your phone to sell elsewhere or making a listing on an auction site, Gazelle is the ultimate no-brainer. If you have an iPhone 6s in decent condition, you can score hundreds of dollars for it. The exact amount will vary depending on the carrier and storage size — for example, a 16GB iPhone 6s on Verizon is worth $242 in excellent condition, but that same phone on T-Mobile is worth $238 — but as long as you’ve kept your phone in good shape, you can expect a solid lump of cash for it. If you have time to do some comparison shopping, double check the prices with Glyde, and others such as Nextworth, which runs a similar trade-in system, and see which one offers the most cash at the moment. uSell - You might not have heard of uSell, but if you’re determined to get the most for your phone you should definitely be considering it as an option. Unlike most other trade-in sites, uSell is actually a hub for many different resellers to attempt to outbid each other for your iPhone. These companies post their best offers on the site, and uSell organizes and matches you with whichever one is promising the best payout. Because of the competitive nature of the site, uSell’s prices can often exceed those on Gazelle and elsewhere, if only by a few bucks. USA TODAY Apple unveils iPhone 7, kills headphone jack Amazon - The world’s largest retailer got into the trade-in game a handful of years ago, and today it’s one of the most popular options. To get started, simply search for the iPhone model you own and see what prices are being offered. Chances are, the value will be similar to what is being offered elsewhere, but because Amazon also takes into account the color of your device, you might discover that your Rose Gold iPhone is worth a tad bit more than the Silver model with the same specs. Once you accept the trade-in offer, you can print a pre-paid shipping label and send the device out at your earliest convenience. The really nice thing about Amazon’s program is that once you lock in your trade-in price you have a full 30 days before Amazon expects it to arrive at their doorstep, which means you can use your phone for those precious couple of weeks until your brand new iPhone shows up. Walmart - If you hadn’t heard, Walmart is all about trade-ins these days, and the iPhone is no exception. You can browse the values for used iPhones on the Walmart site and see exactly how much they’re willing to pay you for your phone. Unlike most other trade-in options, Walmart’s criteria for a trade-in seem much more laid back, with only two quality options — either working or not — and no questions about the color of the device itself. You can trade in either online or in-store, but the one major drawback here is that you are paid in a Walmart gift card, rather than cash, which means you’ll have to buy your new iPhone from Walmart as well. Sell it yourself! If you’re no stranger to the likes of eBay and Craigslist, you might be able to get an even bigger payout than you could at any resale site or store. eBay specifically can be a great place to get lucky with bidders trying to outdo each other, but there’s also a very real risk of a bidder not paying for the phone once they’ve won an auction. That’s a risk for sure, but the reward is a potentially bigger bump in your bank account if it pans out. USA TODAY Incremental Apple should 'swing for the fences' As for Craigslist, there are some who absolutely love it, and if you list an iPhone you’re going to get plenty of attention. As always, try to price your device in line with what the resellers are offering to make sure you don’t get ripped off, and always make your exchange in a public place so you don’t fall victim to some punk trying to run off with your smartphone. Don’t forget to back it up and erase your info No matter how you choose to sell your phone, you should always keep your privacy and security top of mind, and that means wiping your device so that none of your personal info can be salvaged by the buyer. Here’s how to do it: First, sign out of your iCloud account by going into the Settings menu, selecting iCloud, and then tapping Sign Out. If you’re on an older iPhone which is still running iOS 7, you’ll tap Delete Account instead. Once that’s taken care of, go back into your Settings menu and select General, then Reset, and then tap Erase All Content and Settings. Verify your decision and then wait for your phone to wipe itself and reboot. The last step before parting ways with your iPhone is to remove the SIM card, which is located in a small slide-out panel on the side of the device. Find the SIM card slot and open it by inserting the SIM card removal tool into the small hole. If you don’t have a SIM card tool, a paperclip, thread end of a small needle (the more blunt part), or even an earring post (yep, just did it) work well too. Once the slot slides open, just remove the small card inside and close the SIM door again. Now it should be all ready for the next owner to make it their own! When all else fails, recycle responsibly. If your old iPhone isn’t worth the price of someone even paying postage for it, the Apple Renew program is an easy way to dispose of it securely and responsibly. Drop it off at an Apple store or ship it in — they make sure your personal data is destroyed — and then hand it off to Liam. According to Apple, Liam’s a freaky-awesome futuristic “line of robots than can disassemble an iPhone every 11 seconds.” It can also sift, sort, and save more high-quality components than previous methods, recycling more precious materials than ever before. While squirreling away old gadgets might just be a distant cousin to real hoarding — not serious enough yet to have its own reality TV show — there’s no reason to sit on a mountain of old devices.

The Socialist Movement of Workers, MST, protested inside the Walmart Supercenter in Santurce, Puerto Rico, Monday, denouncing under-employment and converting the U.S. Labor Day holiday into the “Day of Unemployment." RELATED: 21st Century Colony: US Picks Businessmen to Rule Puerto Rico The protest forced Walmart to temporarily closed its doors after the police intervened. “Walmart represents poverty, looting, exploitation, oppression and discrimination,” said the MST in a communique. “This megastore is the symbol of the life conditions and exploitation which want to doom us with the Fiscal Board,” it added, referring to the recently Washington-imposed board that will oversee the financial restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt. “Walmart not only displaced a number of small and medium businesses, but also gave very low-paid jobs to workers here, who are now unable to find good wages,” said MST spokesperson Hugo Delgado. “Under-employment, in our opinion, is just as problematic as unemployment. Today, on Labor Day in Puerto Rico, we are celebrating something that does not exist: employment.” According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the unemployment rate in Puerto Rico reached over 11 percent in July—totaling about 130,000 people, with a 0.2 percent increase compared with the previous month. “The issue with unemployment and underemployment in Puerto Rico is that it is not correctly monitored: each employee counts twice if they are working in two different companies,” explained Delgado. According to the MST spokesperson, the sectors the most affected by under-employment are service, retail and the food industry.

The supervisor’s actions included placing a rope on a counter of the Richmond store and telling an African American employee, “If it were up to me, I would put that rope around your neck,” the board said. It ordered Walmart to rescind its disciplinary actions, prohibit supervisors from threatening workers and repeal a policy that now disallows employees in its California stores from wearing union insignia on their clothing. “The employees were engaged in a (legally) protected work stoppage” that “sought to resolve pressing problems,” the board said in a 2-1 ruling, issued last week. The dissenting member disputed the legality of the protest and said it should have been conducted outside the store. The ruling “sets an important precedent: Retail workers have rights, too,” said a support group, Making Change at Walmart. Walmart said it was considering an appeal to a federal court. “No customers or associates should be prevented from shopping or working because of a group demonstration,” said the company, which refers to its employees as “associates.” The Arkansas-based retail giant has resisted all efforts at union organization. A month before the protest that was the subject of the ruling, a larger group of employees at the Richmond store held a one-day strike in October 2012. When they returned to work, the board said, supervisor Art Van Riper told other employees not to talk to them, predicted they would lose their jobs and said, “If it were up to me, I’d shoot the union.” Employees sent a letter to the store’s managers, complaining about Van Riper and seeking permanent jobs for temporary workers on a store remodeling project but got no reply. On the morning that the remodeled store was due to open in November 2012, six employees, including three who had taken part in the strike, walked away from their workplaces about 35 minutes before the reopening. They headed to a customer service area where two managers offered to meet with them individually but refused a group meeting, the board said. After the store opened at 6 a.m., the strikers were joined by as many as a dozen non-employee protesters, wearing shirts and carrying signs supporting the employee organization OUR Walmart. At one point the protesters moved briefly to an aisle near the main entrance, but they never got in the way of customers or other employees, the labor relations board said. A manager told them to leave and was joined by two uniformed police officers. The employees then punched their time cards and left the store around 6:55 a.m. Walmart issued all of them disciplinary citations, known as “coachings,” saying they had abandoned their work and denied access to a main customer aisle. The company fires employees for any misconduct after a third “coaching,” the board said. In ruling the protest legal, the board majority said the strikers had acted peacefully without disrupting business or interfering with Walmart’s property rights, had no other outlet for airing their grievances as a group and had not been warned they would be disciplined. The ruling was issued by two Democratic appointees, Kent Hirozawa and the board chairman, Mark Gaston Pearce. The dissenter, Republican appointee Philip Miscimarra, agreed that the protest had been peaceful but said it was unduly long and misdirected. The employees had “ample opportunity to present grievances to (Walmart) individually,” Miscimarra said. He said federal labor law does not protect employees who “enter a retail establishment and engage in disruptive conduct in the presence of customers.” Bob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

PEDA was formed in 1998 and 18 years later the park has two tenants and no manufacturing companies negotiating for space. The Labor Council states the jobs promised by Walmart "would not offer wages nor benefits sufficient to support working families." Here are the facts to contradict the Council's conclusion. Walmart pays $14.69/hour for full-time workers with benefits. The minimum wage for the following states is significantly below Walmart's hourly rate. Massachusetts — $10, moving to $11 in 2017. Connecticut — $9.60, moving to $10.10 in 2017. Vermont — $9.60, moving to $10.00 in 2017. New Hampshire — $7.25, no planned increase. Greater New York state — $9.70, moving to $10.40 in 2017. Wait until these four states realize what Walmart pays compared to their minimum wage. They will welcome them and tell their voters how they have been able to increase their standard of living.

(KWQC) – Rock Island spent millions to clear the way for a hoped-for Wal-Mart. Businesses had to move, buildings had to be torn down, and the land needed to be prepped for development. The city spent $15 million to obtain Watchtower Plaza and get it ready for a potential Wal-Mart. It borrowed the money on a line of credit. The city’s spending relocated businesses into new locations and new buildings. The Illinois Iowa center for Independent Living moved further north on 11th Street into a new location. Hill and Valley Bakery moved to the Quad City Industrial Center. A Black Hawk College unit moved south into a new building. The blighted shopping center was torn down, and the pavement ripped up and the ground smoothed over. There’s nothing left anymore except big piles of fill and the chief statue, watching over an empty lot. The city controls all the land. It hired a retail consultant two years ago to help market the city. Rock Island’s economic growth strategy is to increase its sales tax base. It hoped Wal-Mart would do that. The city estimated the big box store would generate $1.4 million in sales tax dollars every year and create 400 jobs. It’ll now have to find another retail outlet to fill the space as it hopes to strengthen the 11th street corridor and earn money on the city’s investment. The city created a new tax increment financing district in the Watchtower Plaza area to put new tax dollars into future redevelopment projects.n A 2014 study estimated the 70-acre area needed $126 million in new investment.

Study Says Walmarts Are Nicer In The Burbs 06.09.2016 | 23:00 (6 Leser) Schrift ändern: (0 Bewertungen) AFX News·Mehr Nachrichten von AFX News White Privilege? Study Says Walmarts Are Nicer In The Burbs BENTONVILLE (dpa-AFX) - Walmart operates better stores with good services in white neighborhoods than in minority neighborhoods, according to a new study. The study found that stores in lower-income neighborhoods have considerably lower customer service ratings than those in wealthier ones. The study also claims that the higher the number of black or Latino residents in a place, the worse a Walmart there would rate. The study published by Andy Reich, a Columbia University Assistant Professor of Sociologyyear was based on Walmart customer satisfaction from data of the 35,000 total Yelp reviews across 2,800 Walmart outlets nationwide. According the researcher, the one of the reason for the disparity might be because the retail giant generally do not staff stores in low-income neighborhoods adequately as competition are not a big priority in those areas.

Jerry Gonzaba, 63, was found deceased in the trunk of his vehicle around 1 a.m. Friday in a Walmart parking lot in the 8500 block of Interstate 35 South. A previous report said officers were able to track him via an ankle monitor he was wearing for probation. RELATED: Man, 63, found dead inside the trunk of his car in Walmart parking lot on Southwest Side SAPD Sgt. Jesse Salame said the man’s probation officer reported him missing after he did not check in for curfew, which was “out of character” for the man. During the investigation, officers had to force open the man’s vehicle in order to find him in the trunk.

Then came the added insult when she sought a refund and was sold yet another baby formula that had been outdated since May. Related News/Archive Expired food and baby formula remained on Walmart shelves in low-income areas even after publicity 1 Month Ago Sports Authority to close all its stores including 12 in the Tampa Bay area 6 Months Ago Millennials drive grocers like Publix and Winn-Dixie to feature food produced around Tampa Bay 3 Months Ago It wasn't an isolated incident. Wyman, a handful of other local shoppers and Tampa Bay Times reporters have found dozens of expired merchandise on the shelves at Walmart stores in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. In addition to the Walmart store where Wyman shopped, The Times found three more Walmart locations in Pinellas and Hillsborough counties had expired goods on the shelves on Tuesday, from three-week-old expired sour cream to Gerber brand butternut squash and potato baby food that expired in February. Reporters also found expired prenatal and children's vitamins, children's allergy and fever medication and baby formula. Walmart took notice of the issue Tuesday, both at the corporate level and at the St. Petersburg location cited by Wyman, where workers were busy rechecking expiration dates Tuesday morning. "We want all of our customers to have the best experience possible while shopping with us, and we take out-of-date merchandise seriously. We are currently working to address the situation," said Charles Crowson, senior manager with Walmart's corporate communications. Officials with Walmart's local management had reached out to at least one local customer, Terri Lipsey Scott, who had complained about the products on Facebook on Tuesday. "I returned to the store to see if anything had changed and was approached by the store manager," Scott said. "He promised me that they were making an effort to clear the inventory of old merchandise and were bringing in staff from other stores to do so." Wyman bought Enfamil Reguline formula from the Walmart Neighborhood Market at 1794 22nd St. S. for her son during what she hoped would be a quick trip over the long weekend. Wyman had moved to a midtown neighborhood in St. Petersburg a month ago, but didn't shop regularly at that Walmart. She didn't notice until she got home that the formula she bought for her infant son was expired. It had expired on Sept. 1, just a few days prior. "So I went back to the store and spoke to customer service. They gave me a refund and apologized, so I changed out the milk," she said. When she got home a second time, she noticed that the second one she had purchased was also expired. This time the expiration date was May 1. "I usually shop at Publix downtown but they don't sell this brand," Wyman said. "But I know I would have never had this problem at any Publix location. What really bothers me is that it's happening in a community that's already poverty stricken and this community depends on this store." Scott posted about her experience on Facebook Monday with photos showing expired nicotine lozenges, expired fiber supplement and expired baby food. The post went viral with more than 80 comments as of midday Tuesday and had been shared more than 200 times. A half dozen employees were seen replacing goods, from packaged cheese to vitamins, in the Walmart Neighborhood Market in midtown on Tuesday morning. Workers were checking dates on items offered for sale and were removing some and replacing them with fresher products. A similar scene was happening at the Walmart Supercenter on 34th Street S in St. Petersburg Tuesday morning. Workers were checking items in the dairy and baby food sections and replacing them with new items. A Times reporter found expired sour cream from Aug. 15 on the shelf along with Enfamil baby formula that expired on July 1. In Tampa, a Times reporter found expired prenatal vitamins, children's allergy medication and expired baby food from February at the Walmart Supercenter on 4302 W Gandy Blvd. and at a Walmart Neighborhood Market on 1601 W Kennedy Blvd. Most of the expired goods came from the Walmart Neighborhood Market, which, like the one in midtown St. Petersburg, serves poorer communities. Employees were stocking shelves, but it didn't appear that anyone was checking specifically for expired items as they were in Pinellas County. The average grocery store has more than 40,000 products on the shelves, said David Vikes, spokesman for the Food Marketing Institute, a food safety organization. Vikes declined to comment specifically about Walmart, but said: "It's hard to keep up with the rotation for each individual item." Wyman said she worried that shoppers could be caught unaware. "Some families don't know how to read these expiration dates or know where to look for them," she said. "It really bothered me to see that there were still expired products there for sale." "This is another example of buyer beware," said Nan Jensen, a registered dietitian with Pinellas County Cooperative Extension. "I expect Walmart will take a long hard look at their stocking practices." It is unlikely that the baby food that expired in February would make a child sick, she said, though it could lead to a vitamin deficiency. She noted that the real risk lies in the lost nutritional value that is guaranteed by the manufacturer up until the expiration date. "I would be most concerned with the formula," Jensen said. "You could end up feeding your baby little more than liquid without the extra vitamins and minerals. We should expect a whole lot more." This isn't the first time Walmart or another grocer has sold expired food and perishable goods on its shelves. In 2008, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against Walmart, Target and a local grocery store chain over selling expired infant formula. Target settled the case for $375,000. Walmart settled two years later for $775,000. In the late 1990s, shoppers in Florida and Alabama sued Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. for relabeling expired food. Contact Justine Griffin at jgriffin@tampabay.com or @SunBizGriffin and Alli Knothe at aknothe@tampabay.com or @Knothea. Expiration date explanations Best if used by: This is the suggested date from the manufacturer that guarantees the best flavor and quality of a food product. The product is safe for consumption after this point, but the taste may be compromised. Use by: This is the date the manufacturer has recommended for use of the product. The food product is safe for consumption after this date, but the flavor or quality may not be as good as when it was initially produced. Sell by: This is the date that tells retailers when the manufacturer thinks the food product should be removed from the shelves. Infant formula: Federal regulations require a "use by" label on infant formula under FDA inspection. If stored too long, the formula can separate and clog. The "use by" date is selected by the manufacturer or distributor of the product. Do not buy or use baby formula after its "use-by" date.

As such, competition is ramping up, with local players like Soriana eager to make up ground on market leader Wal-Mart. Having absorbed domestic rival Comercial Mexicana, Soriana has set an ambitious growth plan from 2018 onwards. Wal-Mart, however, is unlikely to be seriously challenged any time soon, as its multi-format strategy — hypermarkets/discount-bodega stores/warehouse clubs — ensures it covers a broad swath of the population. This does not mean that Walmart of Mexico and Central America, or Walmex, is resting on its laurels. Previous commitments to enhance areas like logistics and the integration of its digital platforms are beginning to bear fruit. Walmex has been busily sustaining funding across its diverse portfolio to ensure its various offerings are properly differentiated. This is becoming increasingly important as the Mexican market matures and changing demographics shift consumer habits and needs. With the consumer price index forecast to remain stable for the near term and both overall and per capital gross domestic product predicted to climb significantly through 2020, this is a market where shopper expectations will see significant change. More sophisticated assortments will become far more prized by Mexican consumers as tastes mature. Health and wellness, too, will likely become a particular concern to shoppers, especially in the fast-growing middle class segment.

Sarah Priestley (TMFSarahp) Sep 6, 2016 at 7:00AM McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the undisputed leaders in their industries, have undergone notable turnaround efforts in the past few years after both companies came under the new leadership of Steve Easterbrook and Doug McMillon, respectively. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley look at their paths to the CEO office and their respective visions for each company, including new initiatives, early results, and the challenges that remain. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 30, 2016. Vincent Shen: This episode of Industry Focus is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans. Rocket Mortgage brings the mortgage process into the 21st century with a fast, easy, and completely online process. Check out Rocket Mortgage today at quickenloans.com/fool. Welcome, Fools, to the latest episode of Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. I'm your host, Vincent Shen. It is Tuesday, Aug. 30, and today, I have the great pleasure of introducing Sarah Priestley, who's making her Industry Focus debut -- kind of -- at least, for the Consumer Goods sector. I know you've been on the show with Dylan for Tech a few times. How are you doing, Sarah? Sarah Priestley: I'm good! Thank you very much for having me. Shen: Are you excited? Priestley: Yeah, very excited. This is interesting for me, very interesting -- not, obviously, that tech isn't. Hopefully Dylan won't listen to this podcast. (laughs) Shen: So, we have a great discussion for you today. But I wanted to mention that Sarah and I are pretty excited that, at this moment, there's about 36 hours remaining to the month of August, because we've been suffering through the past 30 days, after we decided to try to kick sugar along with a few other Fools here at HQ. Basically, the rule was no added sugar. Things like fruit are fine, but the good stuff, things like ice cream, chocolate, are no-go. And you can't forget that a lot of savory foods, too, like pasta and bread, I've been missing pizza a lot, even ketchup has added sugar too. So, Sarah, I have to ask you, what has been the toughest thing for you to avoid in August, in terms of sweets? Priestley: Chocolate. Chocolate has been missing from my life. Shen: That's a very common answer among the people who are participating, as something that's hard. I have to say, when the clock strikes midnight tomorrow, what's the first thing you think you're going to be eating, if you're up at that time? Priestley: My parents came a few weeks ago, and they brought some British confectionery, which I'm very partial to. So, I have some stored British confectionery that I may crack out at midnight tomorrow. Shen: That's a very good choice. I think I might be waiting with a spoon and a pint of ice cream, frankly, but we'll see. I'm not really sure yet.  Getting down to business, Sarah had suggested a really interesting topic for the show today, basically around executive leadership and the impact that new CEOs have had in two major companies in the consumer retail world that have been struggling in one way or another over the past few years. Our first company is McDonald's, now led by Steve Easterbrook, who's been at the helm for about 20 months at this point. Sarah, what is Easterbrook's story? Let's start with that. How did he get to that position? We'll go from there. Priestley: Steve Easterbrook started January of last year. He's pretty young. He's only 49. He's been working at McDonald's almost since he left college. He started in 1993. He attended Hamburger U, which is the internal training program. He headed McDonald's U.K. and then went on to head international, and left for a brief period of time to CEO for PizzaExpress and Wagamama, in the U.K., which I know that you're not familiar with. But if you envision, if you will, a mix between Chipotle and Olive Garden that's kind of what you've got. It's a step above fast casual, because it still has table service, but it's in that realm. Shen: So, he's obviously spent many years with McDonald's -- pretty much his entire career except for that short hiatus of just two or three years. Prior to Easterbrook taking the role, I think a lot of people who follow McDonald's, in general, who see headlines ... Comparable restaurant growth at the company was trending downward into negative territory across a lot of its major markets since 2012. The brand was losing, I think, a lot of its luster among consumers and investors. Competition in the restaurant industry was definitely very intense. You had fast-casual entrance, in general, among the big incumbents.  So, Easterbrook takes the job. What do you think, at the time, were the biggest issues on the docket that he needed to address? Priestley: Well, I think for anybody coming into this position, it's the scale of the company. The company is so huge that any change they make has to be pretty impressive to move the needle. To just give you a very brief idea of how big the company is -- they once considered including blueberries in one of the menu items. In one day, overnight, they looked at buying one third of the U.S.'s capacity for blueberries. It's a massive company. Anything they do really has to be quite huge. Then, I think you touched on a couple of the issues. There was definitely a lack of consumer favorability toward the brand. And you even saw this in the restaurants, they started to get a little bit degraded. And then, I think, competition from fast-casual companies. We've mentioned already Chipotle. And also, generally, the environment is moving much more toward healthy eating options, which they didn't cater to very well. Shen: Sure. With that context, there's definitely been a lot of initiatives that he has kicked off, or things he has put into place to start what you call the turnaround. The stock's definitely bounced back quite a bit, I'd say, from the approximately $90 per share that it was trading at in January 2015 when he started. We can get to that a little later, I really want to focus more on the qualitative side. What do you think were the things that worked and didn't work? In general, what did he kick off since taking the reins, essentially? Priestley: He started these initiatives. At the end of this year, they're going to transition from these turnaround plans to a more long-term progression. It's interesting, when he announced the turnaround, Forbes called the video in which he released it spectacularly awful. It was called a yawnfest. And the stock actually fell 2%. So you can see, initially, there wasn't very much support behind what he was saying. My personal feeling on this is that Steve Easterbrook happens to be British. I feel like we are not particularly good at show business and showmanship, and I think that's probably why his presentation was lacking a little bit feeling behind it. Shen: Sure, like that pizzazz. Priestley: Absolutely, which you are all very good at. So, some of the things that he started, I would split it up into four different sections. There was a general shake-up. He looked at efficiencies, better care of employees, all driving toward a better customer experience. Just to touch on the shake-up, I think this is very, very important for a company like McDonald's that's been around for a very long time. It's been beloved, and it's kind of rested on its laurels. It's officially kind of plateaued. So, he's moving the office location from Oak Brook, which is a western suburb of Chicago, they've been there since 1971, to Chicago's Fulton Market District downtown. I think this really symbolizes a lot more than it actually delivers. It symbolizes the fact that they've been in the suburbs, they've been surrounded by fences and been separated from a lot of their competitors, and they've lost that competitive edge, they've lost that drive. He wants to bring them back in to get them to where their consumers are, attract top talent to the downtown area, cost savings from moving, too. But generally, just giving off this impression that things are going to change. So, that's a big step for the company. The other thing is, he's restructured the company into four different sections. You've got the international lead market, high growth markets, and then two subsequent sections. And for all of these sections, he's changed the management. And that's a big structural change for the company, and it really shows you where they're focusing their attention. And I think it's a very sensible thing to do, with trying to devolve the turnaround plan they have. With regards to efficiencies, he's cutting $500 million in SG&A [selling, general, and administrative expenses] by the end of next year. Job cuts are rumored to be part of that. I think there will be some attrition just from moving the location of the company, and then, the franchise models. The franchise model that they currently have is around 81%. They're 81% franchised currently. They want to move that to about 93%. The result of that will be better insight into the locality, so what people like in the area, especially in the Asia region, but also the margins are lot better. They're 82% for a franchise store compared to 15.2% for company-owned. That's huge.  Things like simplifying the menu -- the menu had grown 43% in the last seven years. That's huge. It had become incredibly cumbersome for the staff when they're trying to take customer orders, and also for the customers who, essentially, you want a burger and fries when you go to McDonald's. And that became hard to get. Shen: Absolutely. There are a lot of surveys that research analysts and banks will go out and do, where they talk to franchisees about their experience, what they like and don't like from companywide initiatives. A lot of them had mentioned the fact that -- funny enough, one of the initiatives that a lot of people have attributed successfully to Easterbrook is all-day breakfast, with the fact that menu complication was a big issue for customer service in general. And I think that definitely flowed down to the customer experience. They just mentioned that trying to keep the restaurants running smoothly and efficiently, with all these different menu items, and the fact that it just took longer, for example, people in line trying to figure out what to order, that slows down the works all the way down the line. Priestley: Absolutely. And you touched on all-day breakfast. All-day breakfast has been a huge driver for them, as you can see in the quarterly results. And they actually rolled that out in four months, which I think demonstrates that they've gone from such a cumbersome, slow-moving organization to actually being very fast to enact this. They launched it in October of last year, which is going to make the comps for this coming quarter very difficult for them, I imagine.  But they're also doing other things. They moved from margarine to butter for the flavor. They're using MSC-certified fish; preservative-free in their chicken nuggets. They're moving away from antibiotics. They're doing a lot of things to improve the quality of the food that they're delivering. And some of these things that they're doing, obviously, they're using as promotional to prop the products. But some things they're not. They're actually using sustainable beef sources, and they're mixing that in currently at a low percentage into what they already use. And they're going to gradually increase that until they're using 100% sustainable beef. This isn't something that they've talked about very much, and it shows you, I think, that their quality is being taken very seriously at the company, not necessarily just in advertising. Shen: Yeah, it's not just marketing to compete with Chipotle, for example, to say, "Hey, we're also sustainable, we're also giving you the healthier foods that a lot of consumers seem to be wanting these days." Priestley: Exactly, yeah. I think they were heavily criticized before Easterbrook took over for treating millennials like a homogeneous group, and trying to push forward healthy eating -- kale was always the joke. I think this is similar. They could be criticized for going toward sustainability as a ploy, but I really do think they're trying to embody that. And I think, generally, that it's just becoming a better organization. They're taking better care of employees. They've raised wages. There's tuition assistance, which is fantastic. I think 5,000 people qualify for Archways to Opportunity, which is helping them. And this has had a direct impact. It's reduced turnover, and it's also giving customers friendlier, happier people to interact with when they go to McDonald's. Shen: Sure. And obviously that's very important. We've covered a ton of initiatives that you've mentioned under Easterbrook. I definitely think he's pushing the company in the right direction, especially with this bigger picture, long-term focus. Even going back to the beginning, which you mentioned, about the office move, that can really impact morale. That can really impact the culture, especially at headquarters, their corporate headquarters. And other companies have done that, too. I believe it was Gap, also, new leadership took over and just changed the layout, the interior design in the office. That can really flow through to the rest of the business. Without getting too focused on short-term trading moves, I mentioned that the stock was up quite a bit over Easterbrook's tenure. Forty percent at one point this year, I think it was in May. The gains now are closer to 25%. But still, in a period of 20 months, really solid, especially for a bigger, well-known, mature brand like McDonald's. But if we look a little deeper at the financials, when Easterbrook took over, in terms of trailing earnings, it was trading at about 19 [times] by my calculation. Now, it's about 24 [times]. But earnings per share hasn't changed all that much. But looking at the financials, what do you think? Do you think the business is trending in the right direction, in terms of some of the big metrics we might look at, like comps and things along those lines? Priestley: Absolutely. They had their fourth consecutive quarter of comparable-store sales growth, which is fantastic. I think last quarter, the comps got more difficult, so they are starting to slow, which affected the stock price. But if you look at the first half of 2016, their net income was $2.27 billion, versus $2.13 billion for the year previously. Earnings per share of $2.51 versus $2.09. So, they are definitely making empirical improvement. Franchise margins were also up 6%. You are starting to see some of the cost of the improvement measures, such as the increased wages, taking effect. But if you look at some of the qualitative measures like customer satisfaction, their scores improved in seven out of nine markets. YouGov also does a consumer perceptions report. They take 1,400 companies, they rank what was most improved in terms of customer perception, and McDonald's was fourth. That shows you that they're making leaps and bounds from where they were.  As I mentioned, last quarter the pace of growth slowed due to harder comparisons, but also the industry experienced a 350-basis-point decline due to deflation at grocery stores. So, it became tangibly cheaper for people to eat at home than it is to eat out, whereas before, if you go to the lower fast food restaurants, that's always been touch and go for families. But now it's categorically cheaper to eat at home, which has impacted the whole industry. Shen: Sure. I want to wrap it up here before we move on to our next company, which is another big name that a lot of people will recognize. Do you have any view for Easterbrook in terms of, he's kind of stabilized the business, and put it on the right track. What do you think is maybe, next year or five years, his view? Do you think it's going to be growing stores? You mentioned the refranchising and how important that is, especially with the improved margins they see. Maybe certain markets become a focus? Maybe in Asia-Pacific, for example? Priestley: Yes, he absolutely has a plan to open more stores. I think they want to open 4,000 new stores. I will say, that needs to be 4,000 of the right stores. They're closing underperforming restaurants right now. The focus, absolutely, is in the Asia region. They're refranchising a lot of those because they've underperformed historically. The viewpoint on that has been that they didn't have the insider knowledge, if you like, into the locality. And that's what they're hoping to give them now. They've also opened their first restaurant in Kazakhstan. In different places like that, they're starting to have a presence. So definitely, growth is on the agenda. I would also say, he probably wants to apply some of these learnings and findings from what they've done in the U.S. to other countries, too. Shen: OK. Before we move on to our next CEO case study, I wanted to thank Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans for supporting Industry Focus. I was actually catching it with my brother yesterday, who also happens to live in D.C., and he's looking to buy a home in the area. He spent the last four weeks telling me about how he's combing through listings, looking at dozens of properties in Maryland. And even with all the effort he's putting in, he said that his biggest source of frustration has been the whole mortgage process.

Equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states, nmlsconsumeraccess.org number 3030. Our next company is the king of retail, Wal-Mart. Current CEO Doug McMillon has been in the position since February 2014 -- and even more so than Easterbrook, who has impressively had such a long tenure with McDonald's -- he's a company man through and through. He has been with Wal-Mart since his job as a summer associate there in 1984, when he was just 17 years old. The true case of somebody who started at the company and just rose through the ranks, now leading it. What do you think? Priestley: I think he has rightly been praised from multiple sources, even COO of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, has given her praise to him after meeting him in an exchange program. Fortune has done an article called "The Man Who's Reinventing Wal-Mart." He's been called the most qualified person since Sam Walton. There's a huge amount of expectation on him. As you said, he's a company man through and through. He's from Arkansas. He worked there in high school, he's stocked shelves, he's done a $2.4 billion merger in South Africa. So he has a huge amount of experience. And then, the other thing is, he's incredibly likable. In New York and Washington, D.C., where Wal-Mart has tended to have a worse reputation with how they treat employees, there's ad campaigns going on at the moment. You may have already seen them. They feature him on his Instagram feed, basically visiting the store and talking about how much better they're treating their employees. It's a very compelling ad, he's very likable. I read somewhere that he strikes the perfect balance between being very affable and aggressive, and that's exactly how I would put it. Shen: Let's paint a little bit of a picture here. I think some people are familiar with the fact, once you reach the scale, similar to McDonald's, that Wal-Mart has reached, doing anything that really moves the needle for the company becomes really challenging. But, before McMillon took the helm and became, potentially, the most qualified CEO since Sam Walton, what was Wal-Mart facing? And then, we can get into the steps that he took. Priestley: I would say Wal-Mart essentially came to prominence by saturating markets. They were the most convenient option at the lowest price. But the problem is, now, they have competition from all sides. From the lower end, Dollar General and the dollar stores' increasing popularity. Costco and Target as the big-box retailers. Kroger, they've really upped their game in terms of organic and fresh. I think Wal-Mart missed the mark on that, initially. If you look, a decade ago, Wal-Mart was 15% to 18% cheaper on groceries than Kroger. The gap is now 4% to 7%. So that's getting a lot shorter. And, the other thing is, in terms of convenience, Walgreens and CVS are leveraging their geographic dominance and offering groceries there, so people have another alternative.  More than all of that, though, is online. If you look, Amazon 2012 to 2015 doubled their sales. Wal-Mart grew their sales by 8.6% in the same period. It's the Amazon effect. There's definitely online sales, which is taking away from Wal-Mart revenue. Shen: Yeah, with that kind of growth...unfortunately, consumer spending has not been growing at that rate. That is Amazon taking shares, especially, from a lot of the traditional retailers, Wal-Mart being, in my opinion, the epitome of that. But they're moving, it seems, forward, under McMillon's guidance. Obviously, big challenges, but still a very large, stable company. A very strong, incredible financial position. But, what is he doing to shore things up for another, essentially, generation of dominance in this space? Priestley: I think you'll see a lot of similarities between this and Easterbrook, purely by the fact that I think they're both huge companies, huge examples of American commerce, and by consequence, they have similarities in their turnaround plans. So he's also doing a shake-up. He's moving execs. Currently, the head of China will now go and take over Asda in the U.K., which is struggling quite significantly. Greg Foran, who's a New Zealander, has been moved to the head of the U.S. And interestingly, when he first took the position, he listed no bad feedback from store managers. He then took this feedback and gave improvement plans, which he's going to review on the 30th of September. And he's put clocks that count down to the 30th of September in a lot of the stores and back offices in Wal-Mart. So, that's very interesting, that technique that he's adopted. Again, Wal-Mart is focusing on making happier workers. CFO Brett Biggs said in the last earnings call that happier workers have been responsible for sales increases. That's interesting. Again, they've raised minimum wage, increased training. And then, I think they're focused most predominantly on e-commerce. If you look, the ShippingPass, that's to counter Amazon Prime. ShippingPass is essentially their equivalent for $50. McMillon has talked about going Wal-Mart-sized in e-commerce. I like the term. And he's doing that. He's bought JD.com in an acquisition in China, and Jet.com recently in the U.S., to really bolster their online offering. [Editor's note: Wal-Mart acquired a 5% stake in JD.com, not the entire company as implied in the comments above. We apologize for any confusion.] Shen: Yeah, we talked a few episodes ago about that. I was able to focus a little bit more on the Wal-Mart and Jet.com deal, if you're curious about that, because it is a very interesting tie up between them. How much of an impact it will necessarily have size-wise, Jet.com, though it's grown incredibly in its first year, is still very small relative to Wal-Mart, obviously. But it's the technology, I think, that Jet.com provides, and some of the logistical intricacy there, in terms of how they build a cart for a shopper, that Wal-Mart is really interested in. It'll definitely be, in the next year or two, an opportunity for McMillon to really leverage that and see where it goes. Priestley: Yeah. He's made it known that that's his focus, and I think he's investing very heavily in that area. Interestingly, we were talking about McDonald's moving their headquarters to the downtown Chicago area. Their e-commerce headquarters is near San Francisco. They're doing that to "invade Silicon Valley for talent." They're very much aware that if they want to get the best people, they need to be in an attractive location. And they're doing that. And I think that shows the importance they're placing on it. But all of these moves are, essentially, again, to improve customer experience. They want to meet the customer where they are -- very much representative of the push-pull model. They're going to offer pick-ups. They're pulling trucks into people's workplace parking lots, and they can do pick-ups from there. They've rolled that out to 30 more markets. They've added more products, improved their fresh produce. And then, on the reverse side, they're also looking into cost efficiencies. They've divested their Suburbia brand in Mexico, which was their clothing brand. And then, looking even in the minutiae of detail -- the bakers, they found, were using spoons to frost, and they were wasting 36 truck loads of icing a year. So, they now have new scrapers not to waste those 36 truck loads. We laugh, and it is funny, but that's the kind of level of detail that these CEOs need to go into, if they're really going to get acute cost savings. Shen: Yeah. For a company this size, that little bit on the spoon amounts to 36 truckloads a year. That's pretty incredible. So, we have a few more minutes. I figure we can look at their recent results as a single time period indicator of some of the progress they might be making. They reported on, I think, August 18, so very recently. The big thing that stood out to me personally was, previously, this was again tied to Jet.com, their e-commerce growth was pretty strong. It was over 20% not that long ago. It was trending downwards, then, bumped up again to 12% for this quarter. What else stood out to you? Priestley: They had organic sales growth of 2.8%, which is great. Comp-store sales at 1.6%. This amounts to their eighth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. They're definitely getting into that safety zone, I would say, where they're securing their seventh consecutive quarter of positive traffic. Interestingly, they also noted that sales have increased from their own staff members, which may be showing a greater positive feeling toward the company. International business was the underlying negative. 2.2% underlying sales growth, which is great. But if you break that down, the U.K. seriously continues to struggle. Comp sales decreased 7.5%, and operating expenses were up 8.3% across the board due to wage hikes and things like that. So, the general trend is definitely positive. There are some areas they still need to improve, and there was a lot of focus given to those on the earnings call. So, I would say that's in good shape going forward. Shen: OK. Now, at this point, as we're wrapping up, we have the story for McDonald's, we have it for Wal-Mart. Two very different businesses with their own challenges. But Easterbook and McMillon's turnaround initiatives seem to share quite a few themes. What are your final thoughts, takeaways, in terms of some of the similarities there, but also in terms of the importance of leadership? I think both of these examples that we looked at definitely took on a hands-on approach. I think, you mentioned earlier, with McMillon, for example, his ability to think "big picture," to drive and innovate, but at the same time, to have a really good grasp, the fact that he rose up the ranks, of the day-to-day operations being so important. Priestley: Absolutely. I think this is an incredible example that we have right in front of us of two CEOs and a turnaround plan. You don't get that very often. They're both young, they're both company men, essentially. They both face similar challenges. Scale is huge for both companies. They have exposure to different regions. I think it's about 60% for McDonald's, international exposure, and about 30% for Wal-Mart. So they both have those effect challenges. They're both trying to return value for shareholders. These are value stocks, and there's that underlying pressure on them to do that. And I think they've both taken a very, as you said, hands-on approach to shaking up the way the company operates at a fundamental level. Not only is that difficult to do, it's also incredibly brave, especially if they have been brought up, essentially, in their careers under this management, and they've been learning that way to manage, their whole careers. It's difficult. And, as far as, how much does a CEO actually impact on the ground -- there's 3,000 books a year written on the topic of leadership. It's a very highly debated area. I would say these are two examples where they're having a direct impact. I would tend toward the Upper Echelon Theory of Lichtenstein and Collins, who did a good-to-great analysis, and say that executive values do have a direct impact on the way that companies operate. This is a tangible example of that. Shen: Perfect. Sarah, it was awesome having you on. I really look forward to having you on the show again. It's nice to have someone in studio with me to talk to, instead of talking to my computer.

Sarah Priestley (TMFSarahp) Sep 6, 2016 at 7:00AM McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the undisputed leaders in their industries, have undergone notable turnaround efforts in the past few years after both companies came under the new leadership of Steve Easterbrook and Doug McMillon, respectively. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley look at their paths to the CEO office and their respective visions for each company, including new initiatives, early results, and the challenges that remain. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 30, 2016. Vincent Shen: This episode of Industry Focus is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans. Rocket Mortgage brings the mortgage process into the 21st century with a fast, easy, and completely online process. Check out Rocket Mortgage today at quickenloans.com/fool. Welcome, Fools, to the latest episode of Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. I'm your host, Vincent Shen. It is Tuesday, Aug. 30, and today, I have the great pleasure of introducing Sarah Priestley, who's making her Industry Focus debut -- kind of -- at least, for the Consumer Goods sector. I know you've been on the show with Dylan for Tech a few times. How are you doing, Sarah? Sarah Priestley: I'm good! Thank you very much for having me. Shen: Are you excited? Priestley: Yeah, very excited. This is interesting for me, very interesting -- not, obviously, that tech isn't. Hopefully Dylan won't listen to this podcast. (laughs) Shen: So, we have a great discussion for you today. But I wanted to mention that Sarah and I are pretty excited that, at this moment, there's about 36 hours remaining to the month of August, because we've been suffering through the past 30 days, after we decided to try to kick sugar along with a few other Fools here at HQ. Basically, the rule was no added sugar. Things like fruit are fine, but the good stuff, things like ice cream, chocolate, are no-go. And you can't forget that a lot of savory foods, too, like pasta and bread, I've been missing pizza a lot, even ketchup has added sugar too. So, Sarah, I have to ask you, what has been the toughest thing for you to avoid in August, in terms of sweets? Priestley: Chocolate. Chocolate has been missing from my life. Shen: That's a very common answer among the people who are participating, as something that's hard. I have to say, when the clock strikes midnight tomorrow, what's the first thing you think you're going to be eating, if you're up at that time? Priestley: My parents came a few weeks ago, and they brought some British confectionery, which I'm very partial to. So, I have some stored British confectionery that I may crack out at midnight tomorrow. Shen: That's a very good choice. I think I might be waiting with a spoon and a pint of ice cream, frankly, but we'll see. I'm not really sure yet.  Getting down to business, Sarah had suggested a really interesting topic for the show today, basically around executive leadership and the impact that new CEOs have had in two major companies in the consumer retail world that have been struggling in one way or another over the past few years. Our first company is McDonald's, now led by Steve Easterbrook, who's been at the helm for about 20 months at this point. Sarah, what is Easterbrook's story? Let's start with that. How did he get to that position? We'll go from there. Priestley: Steve Easterbrook started January of last year. He's pretty young. He's only 49. He's been working at McDonald's almost since he left college. He started in 1993. He attended Hamburger U, which is the internal training program. He headed McDonald's U.K. and then went on to head international, and left for a brief period of time to CEO for PizzaExpress and Wagamama, in the U.K., which I know that you're not familiar with. But if you envision, if you will, a mix between Chipotle and Olive Garden that's kind of what you've got. It's a step above fast casual, because it still has table service, but it's in that realm. Shen: So, he's obviously spent many years with McDonald's -- pretty much his entire career except for that short hiatus of just two or three years. Prior to Easterbrook taking the role, I think a lot of people who follow McDonald's, in general, who see headlines ... Comparable restaurant growth at the company was trending downward into negative territory across a lot of its major markets since 2012. The brand was losing, I think, a lot of its luster among consumers and investors. Competition in the restaurant industry was definitely very intense. You had fast-casual entrance, in general, among the big incumbents.  So, Easterbrook takes the job. What do you think, at the time, were the biggest issues on the docket that he needed to address? Priestley: Well, I think for anybody coming into this position, it's the scale of the company. The company is so huge that any change they make has to be pretty impressive to move the needle. To just give you a very brief idea of how big the company is -- they once considered including blueberries in one of the menu items. In one day, overnight, they looked at buying one third of the U.S.'s capacity for blueberries. It's a massive company. Anything they do really has to be quite huge. Then, I think you touched on a couple of the issues. There was definitely a lack of consumer favorability toward the brand. And you even saw this in the restaurants, they started to get a little bit degraded. And then, I think, competition from fast-casual companies. We've mentioned already Chipotle. And also, generally, the environment is moving much more toward healthy eating options, which they didn't cater to very well. Shen: Sure. With that context, there's definitely been a lot of initiatives that he has kicked off, or things he has put into place to start what you call the turnaround. The stock's definitely bounced back quite a bit, I'd say, from the approximately $90 per share that it was trading at in January 2015 when he started. We can get to that a little later, I really want to focus more on the qualitative side. What do you think were the things that worked and didn't work? In general, what did he kick off since taking the reins, essentially? Priestley: He started these initiatives. At the end of this year, they're going to transition from these turnaround plans to a more long-term progression. It's interesting, when he announced the turnaround, Forbes called the video in which he released it spectacularly awful. It was called a yawnfest. And the stock actually fell 2%. So you can see, initially, there wasn't very much support behind what he was saying. My personal feeling on this is that Steve Easterbrook happens to be British. I feel like we are not particularly good at show business and showmanship, and I think that's probably why his presentation was lacking a little bit feeling behind it. Shen: Sure, like that pizzazz. Priestley: Absolutely, which you are all very good at. So, some of the things that he started, I would split it up into four different sections. There was a general shake-up. He looked at efficiencies, better care of employees, all driving toward a better customer experience. Just to touch on the shake-up, I think this is very, very important for a company like McDonald's that's been around for a very long time. It's been beloved, and it's kind of rested on its laurels. It's officially kind of plateaued. So, he's moving the office location from Oak Brook, which is a western suburb of Chicago, they've been there since 1971, to Chicago's Fulton Market District downtown. I think this really symbolizes a lot more than it actually delivers. It symbolizes the fact that they've been in the suburbs, they've been surrounded by fences and been separated from a lot of their competitors, and they've lost that competitive edge, they've lost that drive. He wants to bring them back in to get them to where their consumers are, attract top talent to the downtown area, cost savings from moving, too. But generally, just giving off this impression that things are going to change. So, that's a big step for the company. The other thing is, he's restructured the company into four different sections. You've got the international lead market, high growth markets, and then two subsequent sections. And for all of these sections, he's changed the management. And that's a big structural change for the company, and it really shows you where they're focusing their attention. And I think it's a very sensible thing to do, with trying to devolve the turnaround plan they have. With regards to efficiencies, he's cutting $500 million in SG&A [selling, general, and administrative expenses] by the end of next year. Job cuts are rumored to be part of that. I think there will be some attrition just from moving the location of the company, and then, the franchise models. The franchise model that they currently have is around 81%. They're 81% franchised currently. They want to move that to about 93%. The result of that will be better insight into the locality, so what people like in the area, especially in the Asia region, but also the margins are lot better. They're 82% for a franchise store compared to 15.2% for company-owned. That's huge.  Things like simplifying the menu -- the menu had grown 43% in the last seven years. That's huge. It had become incredibly cumbersome for the staff when they're trying to take customer orders, and also for the customers who, essentially, you want a burger and fries when you go to McDonald's. And that became hard to get. Shen: Absolutely. There are a lot of surveys that research analysts and banks will go out and do, where they talk to franchisees about their experience, what they like and don't like from companywide initiatives. A lot of them had mentioned the fact that -- funny enough, one of the initiatives that a lot of people have attributed successfully to Easterbrook is all-day breakfast, with the fact that menu complication was a big issue for customer service in general. And I think that definitely flowed down to the customer experience. They just mentioned that trying to keep the restaurants running smoothly and efficiently, with all these different menu items, and the fact that it just took longer, for example, people in line trying to figure out what to order, that slows down the works all the way down the line. Priestley: Absolutely. And you touched on all-day breakfast. All-day breakfast has been a huge driver for them, as you can see in the quarterly results. And they actually rolled that out in four months, which I think demonstrates that they've gone from such a cumbersome, slow-moving organization to actually being very fast to enact this. They launched it in October of last year, which is going to make the comps for this coming quarter very difficult for them, I imagine.  But they're also doing other things. They moved from margarine to butter for the flavor. They're using MSC-certified fish; preservative-free in their chicken nuggets. They're moving away from antibiotics. They're doing a lot of things to improve the quality of the food that they're delivering. And some of these things that they're doing, obviously, they're using as promotional to prop the products. But some things they're not. They're actually using sustainable beef sources, and they're mixing that in currently at a low percentage into what they already use. And they're going to gradually increase that until they're using 100% sustainable beef. This isn't something that they've talked about very much, and it shows you, I think, that their quality is being taken very seriously at the company, not necessarily just in advertising. Shen: Yeah, it's not just marketing to compete with Chipotle, for example, to say, "Hey, we're also sustainable, we're also giving you the healthier foods that a lot of consumers seem to be wanting these days." Priestley: Exactly, yeah. I think they were heavily criticized before Easterbrook took over for treating millennials like a homogeneous group, and trying to push forward healthy eating -- kale was always the joke. I think this is similar. They could be criticized for going toward sustainability as a ploy, but I really do think they're trying to embody that. And I think, generally, that it's just becoming a better organization. They're taking better care of employees. They've raised wages. There's tuition assistance, which is fantastic. I think 5,000 people qualify for Archways to Opportunity, which is helping them. And this has had a direct impact. It's reduced turnover, and it's also giving customers friendlier, happier people to interact with when they go to McDonald's. Shen: Sure. And obviously that's very important. We've covered a ton of initiatives that you've mentioned under Easterbrook. I definitely think he's pushing the company in the right direction, especially with this bigger picture, long-term focus. Even going back to the beginning, which you mentioned, about the office move, that can really impact morale. That can really impact the culture, especially at headquarters, their corporate headquarters. And other companies have done that, too. I believe it was Gap, also, new leadership took over and just changed the layout, the interior design in the office. That can really flow through to the rest of the business. Without getting too focused on short-term trading moves, I mentioned that the stock was up quite a bit over Easterbrook's tenure. Forty percent at one point this year, I think it was in May. The gains now are closer to 25%. But still, in a period of 20 months, really solid, especially for a bigger, well-known, mature brand like McDonald's. But if we look a little deeper at the financials, when Easterbrook took over, in terms of trailing earnings, it was trading at about 19 [times] by my calculation. Now, it's about 24 [times]. But earnings per share hasn't changed all that much. But looking at the financials, what do you think? Do you think the business is trending in the right direction, in terms of some of the big metrics we might look at, like comps and things along those lines? Priestley: Absolutely. They had their fourth consecutive quarter of comparable-store sales growth, which is fantastic. I think last quarter, the comps got more difficult, so they are starting to slow, which affected the stock price. But if you look at the first half of 2016, their net income was $2.27 billion, versus $2.13 billion for the year previously. Earnings per share of $2.51 versus $2.09. So, they are definitely making empirical improvement. Franchise margins were also up 6%. You are starting to see some of the cost of the improvement measures, such as the increased wages, taking effect. But if you look at some of the qualitative measures like customer satisfaction, their scores improved in seven out of nine markets. YouGov also does a consumer perceptions report. They take 1,400 companies, they rank what was most improved in terms of customer perception, and McDonald's was fourth. That shows you that they're making leaps and bounds from where they were.  As I mentioned, last quarter the pace of growth slowed due to harder comparisons, but also the industry experienced a 350-basis-point decline due to deflation at grocery stores. So, it became tangibly cheaper for people to eat at home than it is to eat out, whereas before, if you go to the lower fast food restaurants, that's always been touch and go for families. But now it's categorically cheaper to eat at home, which has impacted the whole industry. Shen: Sure. I want to wrap it up here before we move on to our next company, which is another big name that a lot of people will recognize. Do you have any view for Easterbrook in terms of, he's kind of stabilized the business, and put it on the right track. What do you think is maybe, next year or five years, his view? Do you think it's going to be growing stores? You mentioned the refranchising and how important that is, especially with the improved margins they see. Maybe certain markets become a focus? Maybe in Asia-Pacific, for example? Priestley: Yes, he absolutely has a plan to open more stores. I think they want to open 4,000 new stores. I will say, that needs to be 4,000 of the right stores. They're closing underperforming restaurants right now. The focus, absolutely, is in the Asia region. They're refranchising a lot of those because they've underperformed historically. The viewpoint on that has been that they didn't have the insider knowledge, if you like, into the locality. And that's what they're hoping to give them now. They've also opened their first restaurant in Kazakhstan. In different places like that, they're starting to have a presence. So definitely, growth is on the agenda. I would also say, he probably wants to apply some of these learnings and findings from what they've done in the U.S. to other countries, too. Shen: OK. Before we move on to our next CEO case study, I wanted to thank Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans for supporting Industry Focus. I was actually catching it with my brother yesterday, who also happens to live in D.C., and he's looking to buy a home in the area. He spent the last four weeks telling me about how he's combing through listings, looking at dozens of properties in Maryland.

Equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states, nmlsconsumeraccess.org number 3030. Our next company is the king of retail, Wal-Mart. Current CEO Doug McMillon has been in the position since February 2014 -- and even more so than Easterbrook, who has impressively had such a long tenure with McDonald's -- he's a company man through and through. He has been with Wal-Mart since his job as a summer associate there in 1984, when he was just 17 years old. The true case of somebody who started at the company and just rose through the ranks, now leading it. What do you think? Priestley: I think he has rightly been praised from multiple sources, even COO of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, has given her praise to him after meeting him in an exchange program. Fortune has done an article called "The Man Who's Reinventing Wal-Mart." He's been called the most qualified person since Sam Walton. There's a huge amount of expectation on him. As you said, he's a company man through and through. He's from Arkansas. He worked there in high school, he's stocked shelves, he's done a $2.4 billion merger in South Africa. So he has a huge amount of experience. And then, the other thing is, he's incredibly likable. In New York and Washington, D.C., where Wal-Mart has tended to have a worse reputation with how they treat employees, there's ad campaigns going on at the moment. You may have already seen them. They feature him on his Instagram feed, basically visiting the store and talking about how much better they're treating their employees. It's a very compelling ad, he's very likable. I read somewhere that he strikes the perfect balance between being very affable and aggressive, and that's exactly how I would put it. Shen: Let's paint a little bit of a picture here. I think some people are familiar with the fact, once you reach the scale, similar to McDonald's, that Wal-Mart has reached, doing anything that really moves the needle for the company becomes really challenging. But, before McMillon took the helm and became, potentially, the most qualified CEO since Sam Walton, what was Wal-Mart facing? And then, we can get into the steps that he took. Priestley: I would say Wal-Mart essentially came to prominence by saturating markets. They were the most convenient option at the lowest price. But the problem is, now, they have competition from all sides. From the lower end, Dollar General and the dollar stores' increasing popularity. Costco and Target as the big-box retailers. Kroger, they've really upped their game in terms of organic and fresh. I think Wal-Mart missed the mark on that, initially. If you look, a decade ago, Wal-Mart was 15% to 18% cheaper on groceries than Kroger. The gap is now 4% to 7%. So that's getting a lot shorter. And, the other thing is, in terms of convenience, Walgreens and CVS are leveraging their geographic dominance and offering groceries there, so people have another alternative.  More than all of that, though, is online. If you look, Amazon 2012 to 2015 doubled their sales. Wal-Mart grew their sales by 8.6% in the same period. It's the Amazon effect. There's definitely online sales, which is taking away from Wal-Mart revenue. Shen: Yeah, with that kind of growth...unfortunately, consumer spending has not been growing at that rate. That is Amazon taking shares, especially, from a lot of the traditional retailers, Wal-Mart being, in my opinion, the epitome of that. But they're moving, it seems, forward, under McMillon's guidance. Obviously, big challenges, but still a very large, stable company. A very strong, incredible financial position. But, what is he doing to shore things up for another, essentially, generation of dominance in this space? Priestley: I think you'll see a lot of similarities between this and Easterbrook, purely by the fact that I think they're both huge companies, huge examples of American commerce, and by consequence, they have similarities in their turnaround plans. So he's also doing a shake-up. He's moving execs. Currently, the head of China will now go and take over Asda in the U.K., which is struggling quite significantly. Greg Foran, who's a New Zealander, has been moved to the head of the U.S. And interestingly, when he first took the position, he listed no bad feedback from store managers. He then took this feedback and gave improvement plans, which he's going to review on the 30th of September. And he's put clocks that count down to the 30th of September in a lot of the stores and back offices in Wal-Mart. So, that's very interesting, that technique that he's adopted. Again, Wal-Mart is focusing on making happier workers. CFO Brett Biggs said in the last earnings call that happier workers have been responsible for sales increases. That's interesting. Again, they've raised minimum wage, increased training. And then, I think they're focused most predominantly on e-commerce. If you look, the ShippingPass, that's to counter Amazon Prime. ShippingPass is essentially their equivalent for $50. McMillon has talked about going Wal-Mart-sized in e-commerce. I like the term. And he's doing that. He's bought JD.com in an acquisition in China, and Jet.com recently in the U.S., to really bolster their online offering. [Editor's note: Wal-Mart acquired a 5% stake in JD.com, not the entire company as implied in the comments above. We apologize for any confusion.] Shen: Yeah, we talked a few episodes ago about that. I was able to focus a little bit more on the Wal-Mart and Jet.com deal, if you're curious about that, because it is a very interesting tie up between them. How much of an impact it will necessarily have size-wise, Jet.com, though it's grown incredibly in its first year, is still very small relative to Wal-Mart, obviously. But it's the technology, I think, that Jet.com provides, and some of the logistical intricacy there, in terms of how they build a cart for a shopper, that Wal-Mart is really interested in. It'll definitely be, in the next year or two, an opportunity for McMillon to really leverage that and see where it goes. Priestley: Yeah. He's made it known that that's his focus, and I think he's investing very heavily in that area. Interestingly, we were talking about McDonald's moving their headquarters to the downtown Chicago area. Their e-commerce headquarters is near San Francisco. They're doing that to "invade Silicon Valley for talent." They're very much aware that if they want to get the best people, they need to be in an attractive location. And they're doing that. And I think that shows the importance they're placing on it. But all of these moves are, essentially, again, to improve customer experience. They want to meet the customer where they are -- very much representative of the push-pull model. They're going to offer pick-ups. They're pulling trucks into people's workplace parking lots, and they can do pick-ups from there. They've rolled that out to 30 more markets. They've added more products, improved their fresh produce. And then, on the reverse side, they're also looking into cost efficiencies. They've divested their Suburbia brand in Mexico, which was their clothing brand. And then, looking even in the minutiae of detail -- the bakers, they found, were using spoons to frost, and they were wasting 36 truck loads of icing a year. So, they now have new scrapers not to waste those 36 truck loads. We laugh, and it is funny, but that's the kind of level of detail that these CEOs need to go into, if they're really going to get acute cost savings. Shen: Yeah. For a company this size, that little bit on the spoon amounts to 36 truckloads a year. That's pretty incredible. So, we have a few more minutes. I figure we can look at their recent results as a single time period indicator of some of the progress they might be making. They reported on, I think, August 18, so very recently. The big thing that stood out to me personally was, previously, this was again tied to Jet.com, their e-commerce growth was pretty strong. It was over 20% not that long ago. It was trending downwards, then, bumped up again to 12% for this quarter. What else stood out to you? Priestley: They had organic sales growth of 2.8%, which is great. Comp-store sales at 1.6%. This amounts to their eighth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. They're definitely getting into that safety zone, I would say, where they're securing their seventh consecutive quarter of positive traffic. Interestingly, they also noted that sales have increased from their own staff members, which may be showing a greater positive feeling toward the company. International business was the underlying negative. 2.2% underlying sales growth, which is great. But if you break that down, the U.K. seriously continues to struggle. Comp sales decreased 7.5%, and operating expenses were up 8.3% across the board due to wage hikes and things like that. So, the general trend is definitely positive. There are some areas they still need to improve, and there was a lot of focus given to those on the earnings call. So, I would say that's in good shape going forward. Shen: OK. Now, at this point, as we're wrapping up, we have the story for McDonald's, we have it for Wal-Mart. Two very different businesses with their own challenges. But Easterbook and McMillon's turnaround initiatives seem to share quite a few themes. What are your final thoughts, takeaways, in terms of some of the similarities there, but also in terms of the importance of leadership? I think both of these examples that we looked at definitely took on a hands-on approach. I think, you mentioned earlier, with McMillon, for example, his ability to think "big picture," to drive and innovate, but at the same time, to have a really good grasp, the fact that he rose up the ranks, of the day-to-day operations being so important. Priestley: Absolutely. I think this is an incredible example that we have right in front of us of two CEOs and a turnaround plan. You don't get that very often. They're both young, they're both company men, essentially. They both face similar challenges. Scale is huge for both companies. They have exposure to different regions. I think it's about 60% for McDonald's, international exposure, and about 30% for Wal-Mart. So they both have those effect challenges. They're both trying to return value for shareholders. These are value stocks, and there's that underlying pressure on them to do that. And I think they've both taken a very, as you said, hands-on approach to shaking up the way the company operates at a fundamental level. Not only is that difficult to do, it's also incredibly brave, especially if they have been brought up, essentially, in their careers under this management, and they've been learning that way to manage, their whole careers. It's difficult. And, as far as, how much does a CEO actually impact on the ground -- there's 3,000 books a year written on the topic of leadership. It's a very highly debated area. I would say these are two examples where they're having a direct impact. I would tend toward the Upper Echelon Theory of Lichtenstein and Collins, who did a good-to-great analysis, and say that executive values do have a direct impact on the way that companies operate. This is a tangible example of that. Shen: Perfect. Sarah, it was awesome having you on. I really look forward to having you on the show again.

Today, Walmart Stores Inc. is one of Obama’s most reliable corporate allies, a go-to partner that’s backed the White House on more than a dozen business initiatives, particularly Obamacare and climate change. The pairing benefits both. Obama can point to Walmart’s support to beat back Republican charges that he’s hostile to business. Walmart can point to the president’s embrace to lure squeamish shoppers who, like Obama of old, have stayed away out of a belief that the company hurts workers and undercuts competition. This is a key part of the company’s effort to spur continued growth. “It only makes sense for the president to be willing to strike a partnership with the nation’s largest retailer,” said Dwight Hill, a Plano, Texas-based partner in retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. “And Walmart has made more strides of late to try to be more transparent about worker pay and benefits. They have certainly seen the light.” The president completed the turn from Walmart antagonist to fan when he visited one of the retailer’s stores in Mountain View, Calif., in 2014 to praise its use of renewable energy. Obama’s visit represented a “major milestone” for the company and its public image, said Jib Ellison, whose consulting firm worked on Walmart’s sustainability program. “When he got elected, his rhetoric was very anti-Walmart,” said Ellison, who continues to advise Walmart on environmental policies. “So it’s reaffirming.” The partnership between the president and the retailer is especially strong in two areas: health care and climate change. Obama’s view of Walmart shifted early in his presidency when he realized that he needed business support to advance his health care overhaul, which Republicans claimed would kill jobs and drive companies out of business. Walmart was one of the first major employers to sign on to the plan. In June 2009, as debate raged in Congress, Walmart publicly released a letter to Obama saying it supported requiring employers to offer health insurance to their workers, a keystone of the law. For Walmart, the Affordable Care Act resolved a major gripe about the company: that it provided weak health benefits for its more than 1 million workers in the U.S. Obamacare created a system of subsidized insurance for middle-income Americans and expanded the Medicaid program for the poor to cover people earning poverty-level wages. Pressure subsided on Walmart to provide coverage. When government-run insurance exchanges opened in 2014, Walmart stopped offering health insurance to 30,000 part-time workers. “Obamacare is great for Walmart workers; it was a huge transfer of wealth,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor, and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote a book on Walmart. “The pressure is off Walmart to provide better health insurance to its own employees. If you’re a single mom and work at Walmart you now qualify for Medicaid.” Walmart and the White House have cooperated on Obama’s climate agenda, which current and former company executives described as a natural gelling of interests rather than a political calculation. Walmart began pushing to cut its carbon footprint in 2005 as a way to not only help the environment, but also improve its public image, and is now the largest corporate user of solar energy. Last year, the company endorsed the global accord Obama negotiated in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the White House has found in Walmart a willing partner as it reached out to various businesses to embrace administration’s initiatives. “We recognize that the private sector is the economic engine of our country,” Jarrett said in an interview. “It’s not enough just to have these policies on the books.” Working with the administration helps the retailer address the social and environmental issues that the company’s customers care about, said Kathleen McLaughlin, Walmart’s chief sustainability officer and CEO of the Walmart Foundation. “It’s so essential that we have these collaborations,” she said. When Walmart announced that it would raise its minimum wage for employees in 2015, after some encouragement from the administration, Obama called Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon from Air Force One to congratulate him and told a crowd in North Carolina that “once Walmart is paying people more, then you know that something is happening, right?” The pair have also worked on veteran employment, financial security, workforce training, gun control, criminal justice issues and first lady Michelle Obama’s healthy lifestyle campaign. For Walmart, all of this is aimed at bolstering its standing with a key demographic of shoppers it must reach for continued growth — upper-income families in traditionally liberal areas like Chicago, Los Angeles and the East Coast. “Given the fact the company isn’t growing that much, they really need to expand in these coastal cities,” Lichtenstein said. “There has been a certain percentage of Americans that just won’t shop there for political reasons.” Money has followed Walmart’s embrace of Obama. The company increased its political spending during his presidency, with donations to Democrats no longer trailing Republicans by huge margins. Walmart’s political action committee gave $1.2 million to federal candidates during the 2012 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington nonprofit that tracks campaign spending. Democrats claimed about half that money, up from 21 percent in 2004 and only 14 percent in 2000. So far this cycle, Democrats have received about 41 percent of Walmart’s $1.1 million in contributions, with Republicans getting the rest.

(KWQC) — City leaders in Rock Island are encouraging the community to remain positive despite the news of Walmart backing out of a plan to open a new store in the city. The lot in the second ward of Rock Island would have been a grocery store for those living on that side of town. Right now the closest store for the second ward is actually in Milan. Brandon Crawford, farmer outside of Rock Island, comes to the city to shop. “I might have popped in now and then if there was something I needed. My wife on the other hand yeah she probably would have been down here quite a bit,” said Crawford. The lack of shopping options for the second ward is something Alderman Virgil Mayberry said the city is hoping to solve. “I think the majority of people in my ward that I’ve talked to said they wanted Walmart here,” said Mayberry. It is not only an inconvenience if you live in the 2nd ward, but Rock Island is losing money when residents shop in other cities. The vacant spot was a sign of hope for those living in Rock Island and now they are unsure of what the city will do with the open land. After spending $15 million on clearing the land for Walmart, Mayberry said the city truly thought Walmart was a done deal. Now city leaders said they are exploring options with the goal of filling the lot as soon as possible. “We will now get someone in here who will develop the site, it won’t sit here empty for five, ten or fifteen years,” said Mayberry.

Source: Flickr> Research conducted by Contexts — a quarterly publication ran by the American Sociological Association — determined that the location of one of the retailer’s stores could be linked to the effectiveness of its customer service. The study found a correlation between low-income communities — many of which have large numbers of minorities — and underwhelming customers service. More than 35,000 Yelp reviews were examined in more than 2,800 Walmarts around the nation. Assistant professor of sociology at Columbia University Adam Reich believes that Latino and black communities have poorer customer service than white communities because Walmart is understaffed in the former, which puts more of a burden on each worker, thus reducing the quality of their work. “Walmart is the largest retailer and largest employer in the world; moreover, it has consciously branded itself as a champion of and boon for disadvantaged communities,” writes Reich. “Its underinvestment in these communities is thus particularly notable.” It is believed that a move by the company in the early 2000s is associated with this result due to policies that eliminated employees and lowered the quality of stores. This study was not true in every location, and some customers were more affected than others.Walmart has made recent efforts to boost store presence with more employees working on the floor. However, the move will require the megastore to cut costs, including a decision to cut about 7,000 office jobs with the company. WMT stock is up 0.7% Tuesday.

A spokesperson told us that 29 people were let go across the IPG shop’s New York and Richmond, Virginia offices and that the move affected approximately 5.6 percent of the agency’s total workforce; The Martin Agency London saw no change. This morning CEO Matt Williams held an all-staff meeting at the agency’s headquarters announcing the change, which the spokesperson attributes to both the Walmart move and decreases in projected spending by other, unnamed clients. The news precedes an internal realignment based on the aforementioned factors. An agency spokesperson told us, “This is never an easy thing to do,” adding that the organization plans to revise its internal processes moving forward “with the goal of making the company more agile.” The Martin Agency did not elaborate on the specifics of these changes or the positions involved in today’s reduction. Walmart’s July announcement that it would send the vast majority of its U.S. marketing work to Publicis preceded the creation of a dedicated unit to be led by Publicis Communications CEO Arthur Sadoun. According to the press release from earlier in the summer, these plans are in keeping with Maurice Levy‘s “Power of One” approach — one that is “designed to deliver end-to end solutions for our clients” and sounds a lot like Omnicom’s plans for handling the McDonald’s business. As in so many cases of client consolidations, Walmart’s most obvious goal is to reduce its overall marketing expenses. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

If your question is why we don’t allow multi-brand retail in India, my answer is not yet,” she said. The rationale behind this was the lack of adequate infrastructure and last-mile connectivity in the country to ensure the financial inclusion of traders and farmers, she said. Terming it a symbolic step of the Centre’s attempt to remove obstacles at every step, the Minister said that 1,200 archaic laws had been unceremoniously taken out of circulation since the NDA government came to power. When asked if the sedition law was also being reviewed, the Minister said that the discussion was now going on in the courts. But she stressed that it was not being used to stifle freedom of speech. “Freedom of speech and critical appraisal of government has never been contained in India nor has it been stifled,” Ms. Sitharaman said. “To criticise the government is one thing but that which undermines the state and the Constitution, I doubt if any political party or media would support. Every country has to ensure that the state and the constitution are upheld,” she said. Keywords: foreign direct investment More In: Industry | Business Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Next Act Brooke Buchanan, Former Theranos Defender, Takes Her Talent to Whole Foods Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Next Act Brooke Buchanan, Former Theranos Defender, Takes Her Talent to Whole Foods The former John McCain, Walmart, and Theranos flack goes organic. by Emily Jane FoxSeptember 7, 2016 12:39 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Mario Tama/Getty Images. Whole Foods is in trouble. The health-conscious chain, which sells yoga pants alongside probiotics, pressed juice, and locally sourced gluten-free granola varieties, is somehow having a hard time shaking its image as an almost comically expensive alternative to grocery stores like Kroger or Trader Joe’s. It’s struggling to move on after accusations that its stores were overcharging customers for pre-packaged goods (a problem that led the chain to pay a $500,000 settlement to New York City’s Department of Consumer Affairs). And then there was the incident earlier this summer, when the Food and Drug Administration warned Whole Foods that it found “serious violations” at one of its food-preparation facilities, including failure to sanitize food-prep areas, leaky ceilings, dirty dishes near food, and sinks without hot water for hand-washing. The company is trying to turn things around and shed its “Whole Paycheck” reputation by opening a new, lower-priced 365 by Whole Foods Market chain in order to draw in new customers. But so far, same-store sales have remained sluggish, profit margins are getting tighter, and Whole Foods stock has lost about half its value since 2013, when it hit a record high. If Whole Foods is nearing a crisis, it needs a top-flight crisis manager. Enter Brooke Buchanan, a corporate Ghostbuster of sorts, who handled communications for John McCain before rising through the ranks of the Walmart P.R. machine and, most recently, serving as the vice president of communications at the embattled blood-testing start-up Theranos. In a press release issued Tuesday, Whole Foods announced that Buchanan will serve as its new global vice president of communications, leading its public relations, internal communications, and government-affairs efforts. Buchanan left Theranos in June after less than a year, as it was facing investigations from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice over whether the company, founded by Elizabeth Holmes, misled investors and patients about the scope of its diagnostic technology and capabilities. In her time with the company, which went from Silicon Valley fairy tale to P.R. nightmare, Buchanan was a frequent force at the front lines, hitting back at Theranos’s critics in a letter to the editor of Fortune and a letter to The Wall Street Journal deriding their coverage as “misleading” and defending the company’s mission. Even before Theranos, Buchanan was a formidable presence in the P.R. world. She sparred with reporters while working with McCain, and at Walmart, during a time when the retailer was under fire for the wages it paid workers, Buchanan developed a reputation among reporters for hard-charging responses. (As a reporter covering Walmart during this period, I came to fear her number on my caller I.D.) Along with Buchanan, Whole Foods brought on a new vice president of marketing and team member services. “They are accomplished leaders who bring deep retail and consumer experience, valuable perspective on both internal and external communications strategy and will play an integral role in supporting the company’s culture of innovation and team member empowerment as we continue to grow and evolve,” Whole Foods co-C.E.O. Walter Robb said in the statement. Share Email Facebook Twitter Emily Jane FoxEmily Jane Fox is a reporter for the Hive covering Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the .001 percent everywhere.

The Walmart-owned UK supermarket chain suffered a 3.7pc slump in sales to £22.4bn in the year to December 2015, in what former boss Andy Clarke dubbed the grocer’s “toughest” year ever. Like-for-like sales, which exclude store openings and closures, slumped 4.7pc as the retailer’s market share was eroded by competition from discount grocers Aldi and Lidl. Yet Asda still managed to squeeze out a 5.9pc rise in pre-tax profit to £974.9m, thanks largely to trimming its bloated cost base, according to its annual accounts published in Companies House. Employment costs, including wages and pensions, fell 2.2pc to £2.3bn after Asda reduced its workforce by nearly 5pc, reflecting 8,668 jobs across its home offices, shops and distribution facilities. Meanwhile, fewer senior directors on the payroll meant that the total salaries of top executives fell from £6.2m to £4.6m. Savings were also made in procurement, as Asda dealt more directly with producers and expanded its food sourcing business to leverage its vast buying power. It also increased warehouse and transport efficiency, saving 2.5 million miles in 2015. The retailer opened 37 stores in the year, of which eight were superstores and 29 were smaller shops. Asda is midway through a five-year plan, called "Project Renewal" to lower prices, strip hundreds of products from its shelves and reduce costs.  The grocer sells up to 30,000 items in its stores, compared to Lidl and Aldi, which have up to 2,500. By shrinking its range Asda can lower costs and compete with the discounters, who keep overheads low by offering a more limited selection of goods. Last year it cut prices on hundreds of items, including fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat and fish. “Maintaining a lower operating cost structure is a fundamental part of our drive to reduce costs in our business and invest this in prices for customers,” the company said. While last year was a tough one for Asda, 2016 is shaping up to be even worse. Like-for-like sales in the second quarter fell by 7.5pc, marking the eight consecutive quarterly decline and the worst in the company's history. The supermarket installed a new chief executive in Sean Clarke in July, who has admitted that Asda is in the middle of a “challenging” period and needs to return to “retail basics”. Money Saving Minute: online shopping vs driving to the supermarket Play! 01:16 Asda, alongside its “big four” rivals – Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrions - has been hit by falling food prices, driven in part by competition from Aldi and Lidl. Analysts are now expecting the supermarket to pursue a policy of protecting market share, rather than focusing purely on profits. Asda's market share has slipped to 15.5pc, down from 16.6pc a year ago, according to Kantar Worldpanel. A new management will be assembled around Mr Clarke, with Roger Burnley joining from Sainsbury’s in October as deputy chief executive. Asda's parent company, US-based Walmart, reported a slight increase in sales in the year to January 2016 to $482bn, but pre-tax profit fell 12pc to $21.6bn.

By Harmeet Singh September 7, 2016 Hair accessories brand Goody is stepping up its marketing efforts in-store and with digital in an effort to retain its number one position in Canada. The increased efforts have been under way for the past couple of years, as part of a global initiative from Newell Brands to grow its brands and invest strategically, says Mike Muyal, director of marketing for home solutions at the parent company. “You really can’t just rest your laurels on changing a colour,” he says, referring to products such as elastic hair bands. Rather, Goody has been innovating with its products to keep ahead of smaller, offshore manufacturers who can replicate trendy hair accessories quickly. So, over the past two years, it’s been investing more in consumer research, testing and developing new products (such as its Clean Radiance hair brush, which launched earlier this year) and working with retailers on programs to retain its top position. Part of its plan is to step up with digital. Currently, the brand has a program underway with couponing app Checkout 51 and Walmart, its largest retail partner in Canada. Digital coupons are seeing uptake in the mainstream and Muyal says their flexible nature allows for Goody to learn more about what customers are looking for in terms of offers (just this past week, for example, the brand realized it needed to make its Checkout 51 offer richer to boost redemption). With London Drugs, meanwhile, Goody is currently using digital flyer advertising (using the Flipp app), video online and in-store, as well as local market TV spots to promote its Clean Radiance brush. Generally, Goody’s target is women between 25 and 45, skewing toward moms who buy for the family but who can change between retailers, prompting the brand to shift how it merchandises in its major partners. At Walmart, for example, marketing at shelf is more value-oriented (the brand has even manufactured products specifically for the Walmart customer). London Drugs, on the other hand, now involves more department store-style merchandising, since that chain has beauty experts on hand (trained in various brands) and customers expect a higher level of interaction in those locations, Muyal says. That more fashion-focused “shop within a shop” merchandising has emerged over the past year or so and includes reformulating how the product is displayed (grouping by colour, style and application) and free consumer education panels that are refreshed based on key buying times for hair brushes and accessories. While about five years ago, Goody would invest in broadcast and print, that was limiting and it’s now finding greater measurement capabilities with social, media relations and digital, Muyal says. The idea is to complement those online strategies, such as Twitter parties, with in-store executions timed accordingly to keep the messaging going at the retailer level, he says. In other words, it’s after a more holistic approach without the spend that broadcast might require. Over the past few years, the brand has established a partnership with Toronto-based Yummy Mummy Club to get products in the hands of key influencers. In Quebec, where its major retail partner is Jean Coutu, the brand has also partnered this year with media personality Saskia Thout for content development to showcase product. Influencer relationships are particularly key for Goody, which is trying to maintain its positioning around quality and product innovation in a category where small manufacturers can quickly replicate products, he says. Influencers and product reviews lend credibility to the brand, he adds.

A sharp-eyed employee noticed the couple when the man, later identified as Chad Rob Edward Keays, also known as Chad Rob Edward Plumback, 35, put on a baseball cap. He was also carrying a pair of boxers while the woman, Kelli Marie Tschopp, 28, put several items in a shopping cart’s child seat. The employee later told Sgt. Brian Hall of the Scottsburg Police Department that the couple separated, with the woman concealing a pair of shoes in her purse. When Keys returned to his companion, the ball cap no longer had its sale tags visible. The pair then went to an aisle empty of customers, and Tschopp purportedly put items from the cart into her purse. They paid for a few items at the self-checkout area, the Wal-Mart employee told the officer, but did not pay for either the hat or boxers. The employee followed the couple outside and attempted to detain them, but Tschopp ran, he said. She was located by police. Keays went to the Wal-Mart office with the employee but then got up and walked out. He got into a white car which was stopped by city police. As Major Richey Barton returned to talk to the store employee, he learned that a purse had been found inside the white car with several hundred dollars in it. Tschopp claimed the purse, saying she wanted the money. It was placed at her feet inside the police car that transported her to the Scott County Security Center. Sgt. Hall noted Tschopp “...moving around and twitching...” during the ride to the jail. When he checked the car after taking Tschopp inside the jail for processing, he said he found the woman’s prescription bottle labeled for Oxycodone. Five orange pills and a cut straw were discovered in the pill bottle along with five Oxycodone pills. Tschopp could not explain the straw, and she told a jailer that the orange pills were her boyfriend’s and he had a prescription for them. The pills were Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine. She also stated that she’d been arrested in New Albany for having her boyfriend’s medication with her. A search of Indiana criminal records revealed Tschopp was charged there on August 15 with Level 6 felony unlawful possession of a syringe and possession of a controlled substance. In that case, she was assigned a public defender and two pretrial dates of September 27 and October 25. Tschopp was released when a $1,000 cash bond was paid. In Scott County, Tschopp is charged with Class A misdemeanors theft and possession of a controlled substance. An initial trial date of October 18 has been set. She will be assisted by a public defender. Her bail on the local case is set at $15,000 by corporate surety bond or $1,500 cash. Her boyfriend, Keays, was also assigned a public defender and an initial trial date of October 18. His bail on one count of Class A misdemeanor theft is $5,000 by corporate bond or $500 cash. Keays will be back in court on September 13 to see if he can get his bail lowered or be released on his own recognizance.

The Institute of Supply Management Non-Manufacturing Index measures firms in service sector industries such as retail, finance and healthcare  Markets | Retail Author: Tom Bailey September 7, 2016 The service sector in the US saw its slowest pace of growth in six years, according to the latest data from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Non-Manufacturing Index. The index, measuring firms in the service sector (including retail, finance and healthcare), fell from 55.5 percentage points in July, to 51.4 in August – representing a 4.1 percent dip. While any reading above 50 signals growth, the composite figure of 51.4 is much lower than had been expected. Such slow growth in the service sector has not been seen since February 2010. Based on previous expansion, economists had predicted a higher score, closer to July’s figures. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index fell from 55.5 percentage points in July, to 51.4 in August The index is based on a survey of over 375 service sector firms and has four major components: business activity, new orders, employment, and supplier deliveries. The index’s business activity figure saw a substantial decline in growth from the month prior, down to 51.8 percent from July’s 59.3. The index measuring new orders fell by 8.9 percent, to 51.4, while the employment index eased down to from 51.4 in July to 50.7 in August. Supplier delivery growth rose by 0.5 percent. This slowed growth raises some cause for concern for the US economy; the weak growth measured in the index comes on the tail of August’s disappointing jobs report, which showed only a modest expansion of jobs. Whether or not the US economy is facing weakened overall growth in the third quarter of 2016 remains unclear, but the latest figures will perhaps dampen the prospects of a federal rate rise in September.

News Newport News Police: 'Dangerous, desperate' robber, car thief needs to be stopped VIDEO: Police searching for robber, car thief Newport News police have shared footage of a man robbing two stores at gunpoint. Police called the man desperate and dangerous and are seeking the public's help in identifying and locating the man. Newport News police have shared footage of a man robbing two stores at gunpoint. Police called the man desperate and dangerous and are seeking the public's help in identifying and locating the man. Michele CantyContact Reportermcanty@dailypress.com Police: 'Dangerous, desperate' robber, car thief needs to be stopped Privacy Policy A man who witnessed a convenience store robbery helped Newport News police piece together a crime spree by a man they say is desperate, dangerous and needs to be stopped. "This guy is bold — we're talking about broad-daylight robberies in highly traveled areas," said Master Police Detective L.D. LeGrande, a robbery unit investigator, during a news conference Tuesday at police headquarters. In August, the man stole a car, used it to rob at least two Newport News businesses — including one robbery where he punched two clerks — and then dumped the stolen Oldsmobile at an apartment complex, according to police reports. Map: Crime spree locations "We'd like the citizens to be aware of this particular car, we'd like to put the car out there, in case someone actually saw this man driving around in this car between (Aug. 29 and Aug. 31)," LeGrande said. "Maybe the citizens of Newport News can help us identify who this guy is." Surveillance video from Aug. 29 at the Wal-Mart at 12401 Jefferson Ave. shows the man in the parking lot with a backpack, wearing a baseball cap and shorts riding his bike. He tried to steal a car, checking out models made in the 90s or earlier, but was unsuccessful, LeGrande said. He leftWal-Mart and is captured on film minutes later in the Kohl's parking lot at 551 Bland Blvd. Again, police say he rides around the lot before stopping at a blue 1991 Oldsmobile Calais. The man breaks into the car and drives away, police said. At 1:15 p.m., the stolen blue car pulled up to the curb of a Radio Shack store in a shopping center at the corner of Denbigh and Warwick boulevards, LeGrande said.

Newport News police received a call around 6:30 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 13, reporting gunshots heard at Tarrytown Apartments, police spokesman Brandon Maynard said. The man outfitted himself in a mask and dark clothing. Armed with a black handgun, he demanded money and a pair of high-end headphones from store employees. He left the store at 14331 Warwick Blvd. and drove off in the Oldsmobile, police said. LeGrande said the man kept the car for two days before using it in another robbery on Aug. 31 — this time at a Miller Mart at 12445 Jefferson Ave. The robber slid through a back door and was armed with a gun, police said. During this robbery, he punched the two clerks, leaving them injured and stole cash from the register, police said.

He described the car and got the license plate number that helped connect it to the other robbery, LeGrande added. Police searched the area and found the robber had dumped the blue car not far from the convenience store at an apartment complex on Warwick Boulevard. LeGrande said the theft and the robberies happened within a five- to eight-mile distance from each other in the Denbigh area. "We think this guy is very violent. We need him identified and taken off the streets," the detective said. Police encourage anyone with information that could help the investigation to call the Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP.

Walmart supporters will get what they want, but we will all pay for it with a loss of quality of life and an increase in the cost of police protection.  Nancy W.

By Debra Borchardt on September 6, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk A SoftWear automated sewing machine. courtesy photo Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Department of Defense could be the reasons why the apparel industry finally becomes fully automated. SoftWear Automation Inc. just delivered on its final phase of a 24-month project to automate jean production for Wal-Mart. The Wal-Mart Foundation and Wal-Mart Stores gave Georgia Institute of technology grant money to figure out how to get robots to take over the sewing process. By collaborating with SoftWear, the two has now begun to solve the myriad of challenges that sewing presents to robotic processing. The “sewbots” were able to accurately place two pattern pieces, transport them and sew the outside seam on a pair of jeans with the push of a button. The robot uses a variety of air devices to pick up the fabric pieces and then place them correctly at the sewing machine. The machines have cameras that function as eyes to make sure the sewing happens in the correct sport. SoftWear got its start after the company received a round of funding from the DOD to look at solving the problem of automating sewing. Military uniforms must be made in the U.S., but manufacturing thousands of uniforms domestically presents some challenges. SoftWear spokesperson Anastasia Simon said that one problem in particular is that soldiers come into the military wearing one size and then change as they become more fit. The military has a hard time providing multiple sizes to soldiers and felt that if the process were automated, more uniforms could be turned out more quickly. This money helped get the company off the ground. To address Wal-Mart’s issue, they started with unlocking the process of sewing a pair of denim jeans, which takes 38 different steps. The main challenge for robotics and sewing is that fabric is flimsy. This lack of rigidity makes it hard for robots to pick up pieces and move them. Denim is a great trial fabric because it is stiffer than many other textiles. This was solved by using a combination of vacuum and compression air. The tricky part is when a human seamstress would normally pick up the item and them adjust the product for the next step. Simon said their main challenge in this stage is to keep the right tension on the fabric as it is manipulated for the next level of sewing. The company’s goal is to accomplish automating all 38 steps in jean production over the next two years. There are already automated fabric-cutting processes and pocket-making that the company can integrate into their procedures. Wal-Mart decided in 2013 that it wanted to spend $250 billion on U.S.-made goods. But the company found that it was easier said than done and ran into major supply chain problems. In order to solve for this problem, they launched the $10 million U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund in 2014. The retail giant awarded grants to 7 universities with the first group focusing on textiles. The idea is to innovate the processes of fabric printing, dyeing and cutting in order to make U.S. goods more competitive with foreign products. According to Simon, the apparel industry has been slow to invest in automating the sewing process because labor is so cheap. But as labor costs rise in China, apparel manufacturers are now turning to Bangladesh and India for the latest cheap labor. There is also a cultural shift in China that Millennials don’t want to sit in a factory and sew. Either their parents want them to pursue education or work in a call center, but not a factory like themselves. Simon said the company isn’t looking to eliminate all apparel manufacturing jobs. Instead, automation would create a new category of highly skilled sewing technicians and software designers for the industry. Not to mention, new automated sewing machinery that is computer-driven.

She died at her home surrounded by her family. Walker married Willard Walker in 1942 after the two met at S.H. Kress department store in Kansas. Seventeen years later, Walmart founder Sam Walton hired Willard Walker to manage his Five and Dime store in Fayetteville and Walker eventually worked his way up to an executive position at Walmart. During the first ten years of their marriage, the Walkers lived in several Oklahoma and Arkansas cities before settling down in Springdale to raise their family. The couple established the Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation, which has contributed to medical centers, colleges and universities, public schools, libraries, park and recreation facilities, performing arts centers and museums, churches and religious institutions and social service organizations. In 2016, Pat Walker was inducted into the Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame. Willard Walker died in 2003. Pat Walker is survived by her two children, seven grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held for Walker Thursday (Sept. 8) at 5 p.m. at the Springdale High School performing arts center, which is named after her. A church service will be held Friday at 2 p.m. at Spring Creek Fellowship in Springdale, followed by a private burial ceremony. The Walker family will receive friends for a visitation Wednesday at Sisco Funeral Chapel in Springdale. The Walkers' names appear on several facilities around Northwest Arkansas including Walker Elementary School in Springdale, the Willard Walker Field House at Springdale High, the Pat Walker Health Center at the University of Arkansas and the Pat Walker Center for Seniors at Washington Regional Medical Center. “She was wonderful. She was kind. She had a beautiful presence around everyone," said Mary Alice Serafini, Executive Director of the Pat Walker Health Center. "We want that to carry on, and we have a lot to learn from her legacy." To read Pat Walker's full obituary, click here.

But before you get ready to munch on those prepackaged, fresh-cut veggies, you'll want to read this first. Country Fresh, Inc., just recalled 30,000 of its precut packaged vegetables due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination.  A variety of these products can be purchased at several stores such as Walmart, Publix, Winn Dixie, Harris Teeter Supermarkets, and BI-LO. Shoppers in the Southeast should be on the lookout because the products were distributed across several southern states including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.  According to the US Food and Drug Administration, customers should be wary of Country Fresh items that have the "best if used by" dates that range between August 7, 2016 to August 19, 2016, as they may be affected. These items in question are also packaged in either clear containers or Styrofoam trays wrapped in plastic. A list of the recalled items and the store in which they are sold can be found here.  More from CafeMom: 6 Foods This Expert on Food Poisoning Will Never Ever Eat (PHOTOS) Fortunately, there have been no reported illnesses in relation to the recalled vegetables.  The director of food safety for the Conroe, Texas–based company, Max Payen, explained in a news release: "We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome, and high-quality products available."  The Georgia Department of Agriculture originally identified the contamination in a routine sample that tested positive for the bacteria. More from CafeMom: Major Hot Dog Recall Underway: Here's What You Need to Know Right Now Listeria causes short-term symptons for healthy people, but can cause serious infections in children, elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems. Infection can even cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women. If you have purchased any of the possibly contaminated items, please return the items to the store for a full refund. Customers can also reach out to Country Fresh about any questions via phone at 281-453-3305, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. CT.    Image via StudioSmile/Shutterstock Read More recalls, food safety, kitchen safety Share this Story Share Tweet Pin comments Related Articles Bizarre News Grandma Goes Viral After Inviting the Wrong 'Grandkid' to...

View Latest Posts >>> Trump Selling “White America” Trash By Sami Jamil Jadallah on September 5, 2016 Gary Indiana 1965 White middle-aged Americans have every reason to be angry, but there is no reason to believe that Donald Trump will deliver prosperity and get back the good old days, when a high school education and working in the steel mills would allow you to own a home, two cars, and some leftover money to send your kids to junior college. Those days are gone, done with, and neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump will ever bring them back. Statements coming from presidential candidates about getting back American Middle-Class status are at best, trash. I should know. Though categorized by the US Census Bureau under “Others”, I am an immigrant; yes, a legal immigrant — fingerprinted, issued a permanent visa and arrived in Chicago on a TWA flight. I am an Arab-American who lived in and grew up in the industrial town of Gary, Indiana. Back in the 1960’s, my father, who had no high school education, worked in the steel mills, and so did I after completing my military service, working the midnight shift at Inland Steel in East Chicago. We both earned around $2.75/hour, but that salary allowed my father and me to own a decent house and each to own our own car and support our siblings. We could never do that again, even if we got a minimum wage of $12/hr. _________ That Was Then White Americans of the early fifties and sixties enjoyed the industrial boom that came after the end of the war. With Europe’s and Japan’s industrial bases totally destroyed, Americans – mainly White Americans – enjoyed and benefited from the fact that America’s industrial base was intact and was easily converted from military manufacturing to civilian manufacturing. Steel mills flourished from Milwaukee all the way to Chicago to East Chicago to Gary to Pittsburgh and Ohio, with great companies of the times such as Inland, US, Bethlehem, and Republic steel employing hundreds of thousands. These factories supplied the steel to booming car industries all over the State of Michigan, Ohio, even Indiana, and Wisconsin. The South also had its share of the industrial boom, with textile, and furniture manufacturing, in addition to factories producing refrigerators, televisions, washers and dryers to meet the needs of every house in America. White Americans with high school educations were the engine behind such an industrial boom — and a good job they did. Many small towns became big towns. With the spread of suburbia came the demand for cars, and all the amenities the suburbs can provide. _________ What Happened? All of that changed during the Reagan years, where the very idea of a “trickle down” economy was promoted as the new hope for White America. Well, partially true, it made the rich richer, but it left White Americans having a mere high school education behind. A changing economy was taken shape while White America slept through it. WalMart set up shops that competed with downtown Sears and JC Penny’s and Goldblatt’s, and with a business model that attracted buyers looking for cheap items, over 500,000 small businesses in small town America had to close down because they could not compete with WalMart and many loyal and lifetime customers abandoned these community shops. The wealth of these 500,000 owners overnight was transferred to a family of 100. Those White American lost their jobs in these shops, and lost their jobs in over 500,000 industrial manufacturing plants that also closed — no different than the hundreds of thousands of steel mill workers who lost their jobs in the industrial Midwest, the one that won the war neglected and became the Rust Belt. As the wealth shifted from the owners of these small shops through the WalMart-effect, so did many of the factories in the South close down, then moving to China and Mexico — with no thanks to Congressional tax policies that gave the financial incentives to America’s big corporations to move their manufacturing operation overseas, thus depriving tens of millions of Americans out of a job and the dreams of retiring as Middle Class. _________ Election reflects Disappointment Abandoned by both Republicans and Democratic administrations, certainly, by a corrupt Congress, White America is showing its anger by rallying to the side of a man who represent everything but the very ideals that White Middle-Class America hold, hard work, family values, and love for the country. Donald Trump, notwithstanding his rhetoric, is no lover of America, seeking much deferment to avoid military service, born into privilege and wealth, most gained from morally questionable sources; a person who is the darling of Wall Street, having filed for bankruptcy and bailed out by Wall Street six times — Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Castle 1992, Trump Plaza and Casino 1992, Trump Hotels and Casino Resort 2004 and Trump Entertainment Resorts 2004. Wall Street always came to the rescue of a man who is presenting himself as a successful businessman, a Wall Street that failed to bail out tens of millions of American, but looted them, looted their assets and their pensions. Most of Mr. Trump’s business is casino business, fleecing the very poor by selling them dreams. Busloads of poor Whites and Blacks board the buses every day and every weekend, only to drop the little of what they have in Mr. Trump’s treasury. Anyone who believes this man will bail out America is a stupid fool. Of course, I can understand why White America is angry, and yes for good reasons, left behind in a changing economy, when America’s political and business leadership failed to anticipate the changing economies and never invested in “retraining” White America for the new jobs and new economies that while accepting high school education required a highly skilled labor force. It is too late, the game is over. One can also understand the anger at the “illegal immigrant” who is taking the White Man’s job, but if you look around, these immigrants, legal and illegal, work hard in homes and housing construction, cutting grass on highways, maintaining parks, picking up garbage, cleaning offices, doing all the hard work and accepting minimum wage, which requires them to work two jobs and to have 2 or 3 members of their families working to make ends meet. You hardly see a Latino loitering and without a job. Angry, yes and for good reasons, but do not be fooled that Donald Trump will make America great by his policies of building walls and have Mexico pay for it, or deporting over 5 million illegal immigrants causing America to come to a halt. Will White America that lost its status as Middle-Class role its sleeves and does the dirty work these “immigrants” do, from picking lettuce in farms to cleaning the streets, I doubt it. We are all mistaken that Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton has the magic wand to make America Great now or again. It is the Congress and only Congress that enabled the policies that deprived White America of its cherished Middle Class status, by allowing American corporation to set shops overseas giving them tax benefits, by never accepting the very idea of “investing” in people and the White labor force to train them and provide them with the skills for the new economies. I never understood why White America is against the government. I understand it is against this kind of government that we have, beholding to big money, big business and to the privileged few. But never understood why White America think that “libertarianism” is the right thing for America with the views that the less government, the people are better off? Well think about, without government investing in its people, in their education, in their health in their well-being, they will never be able to regain their Middle-Class status. If they think that Donald Trump will use his money to bail them they are more than stupid fools. What we need in America is not big or small government, we need responsible efficient government, corruption free, that gives us as much it takes from us, that while we contribute to the treasury it must also contribute to and save our social security and retirement and give us the security we need in our old age and as we become sick and fragile. Why Congress writes their own health policies and we had to fight for ours. Even the people in the need of real health care are opposed to public health, never understood such logic. After working so many years contributing to the treasury with most of our money ($ trillions) going to wars, I think that our government owes us something like a safety net. We worked for it, and we earned it. Think about it before you cast your vote for a lousy businessman who is selling White America “trash”, and he knows it. _____________ Related Posts: Should the military overthrow Trump?

Getting in the line is a red herring. I believe that immigrants, citizens, and people toiling away all over the globe are all being kept in slavery by the corporations. The government has just become an enforcing arm of the corporations which is allowed to take money from these same people to protect the looters. However, people will not look at this issues without going nuts at the use of the word “slave”, however the present state of a large majority of people are far worse off than slaves. People have come to believe that this euphemistic freedom, is actual freedom. The other day I was watching “Captain Philip” on TV with my family, I don’t know if it was true or not, however the message that took away was that our soldiers engaged at a very large scale to protect the insurance company! Of course we cheer for our armed forces doing such a good job, but no one calculates the amount of money which such an expedition will cost, to protect corporate trade, which has nothing to do with US. The ships was not transporting anything to the US, let alone something useful. In the end taxpayers foot the bill, the military endangers the lives of our young men and women–just to protect an insurance payout. I don’t think such actions should be acceptable to the public.

No politicians especially those operating casinos talk about because of big income from such operation. They only look at the guy who is working 18 hours a day on a farm or washing dishes.

You probably have notices that Asians have taken over most of the Tech Industry, the education, and the South and central Americans are no less human or no less hard working.

Black Americans, living in the hood are the unluckiest people. in the hood you can still hire people for 10 bucks a day for hard labor and a day is when the job is finished not 8 hours. 9. The truth is the people are worse off than slaves these days. The immigration laws have been designed to produce slaves. A slave owner has property, so they had to protect them by feeding them, clothing them, teaching them skills and providing them healthcare. Now a minimum wage (or below minimum wage) worker has to provide all of that for himself, while his slave owners–credit ridden under educated, suburbanites–who are most likely less educated or skillful work them to death without providing the benefits that they will to their dogs. 10. Let’s face it, America started as a slaver owning nation, it has innovated to stay a slave owning nation but with reduced responsibility, before people were owned and taken care off, now they are made to work for free in a less personal way, however the free labor is the constant factor. And no, one human who is less skilled or less educated is not entitled to services of the more skilled and more educated. It is a travesty when a Computer science graduate is driving a cab, or a lawyer is mowing your yard, or a doctor is cleaning your house. It is shameful and it will not stay that way, it cannot stay that way, it is unnatural. Human laws, especially deceitful ones, cannot trump the laws of nature. contd… Log in to Reply Nasir  September 11, 2016 at 10:44 am Sami, labor arbitrage can only exist for a limited time. The truth is that people who do not work hard/do not want to work hard are no longer competitive. You made factual errors: 1. Illegal immigrants, are not paid minimum wage. 2. Illegal immigrants are usually more educated than US populace. In 1980s my cleaning lady was an attorney from Mexico. If you bother to look, you will find a large number of legal and illegal immigrants employed below their qualification and expertise. 3. While NASA employs professional clappers for JPL, the people who actually work are not White American or what passes for American these days. 4. Look at your faculties (real faculties, hard sciences) you will be hard pressed to see a white member, if you see one, if will be a spousal hire or quota mandated. 5. It is absurd to want to be able to live the American Dream without being as intelligent and as hardworking as other humans in this world. 6. The immigration VISAs take something like 15 years to process–if one gets in Trumpian lines–therefore a sizeable majority of immigrant, bit the bullet and marry a local idiot for a while to obtain residence status. 7. In case of Trump, he is importing women of east European areas, through marriage. No that they were qualified, or deserving of O visas, H1B Visas. The reason for East European women getting work and immigration VISAs quickly can be witnessed in your local strip clubs. Log in to Reply Sami Jamil Jadallah  September 11, 2016 at 10:56 am Nasir, while no one question the fact that some of the illegal immigrants are well educated, mostly from South Asia ( India, and China) the majority of “illegal immigrants” are from Mexico and Central America. Who have been in this country for a long time, before the tech boom that allowed hundreds of thousands of well-educated “South Asians” into the country most of who are on a work visa. I think the case of your cleaning lady is an exception and not the rule. The fact remains the majority of illegal immigrants are from Mexico, Central and Latin America.

Log in to Reply wjabbe  September 7, 2016 at 2:07 am Here is a quote this morning from an article by Neil Munro in Breitbart on exactly what Sami is talking about here and this disgusting H1b visa program authorized by Congress: “Caterpillar is firing 300 American employees in Mossville, Illinois, even though it is continuing to recruit and pay foreign “H-1B” guest-workers to do the white-collar jobs sought by American professionals in the United States. Caterpillar’s combination of white-collars layoffs and H-1B outsourcing matches the much-criticized decision by Carrier, a company in next-door Indiana, to outsource 1,400 blue-collar factory jobs to Mexico.” About a year ago Disney did exactly the same thing. It is bad enough that these reprehensible companies are doing this but being encouraged by our reprehensible Congress and president only adds salt to the wound. These workers are the backbone of our country as the former ones were years ago. How else can this be interpreted other than a deliberate destruction of American in front of our very eyes by the worthless pieces of garbage elected to our worthless Congress.?

Get a few books out by Upton Sinclair and discover how nothing ever really changes in America except more unemployed stupid workers who were sold out by greedy employers with money on their minds. This is a shameful disgrace. We learned nothing from history and the great depression did we? The more higher education Americans get, the dumber they become. Frankly they deserve their plight because the continue to elect liars and cheaters and thieves.

He was only able to muster about 20% of the vote and even he and his own family were also threated then by the corrupt powers for destroying the jobs of the American Workers. The barn in DC stinks to high heaven today like a rotting meat locker with a power failure. Doesn’t it sound so simple? The Founders gave all of us simple tools to put these worthless pieces of human garbage in Congress, all on the public dole, out of their jobs.

No one  September 6, 2016 at 8:04 pm Ya know, Sami – when I was a young girl, I asked my WWII father what he felt about draft dodgers and protesters. His reply: I DON’T BLAME THEM. THEY AREN’T FIGHTING THIS WAR TO WIN, SO I DON’T BLAME THEM. See, Sami – I DO love America, and I DID volunteer to serve during that war, but after witnessing those young men, many of them drafted, leaving for war, and their faces after their return, I have NEVER DISPARAGED ANY ONE who refused to be rounded up like a sheep to slaughter. My sons love this country, but they will not serve in a military that is not fighting to win. I’ve made a flying trip down to a Marine Corp recruiting station, shrieking like a banshee, to stop my oldest son from signing. I won’t stand for my sons becoming another alcoholic riddled with nightmares LIKE THEIR FATHER. That does not mean they are not willing or ready to fight for this country in the streets of their home town. I’ve worked with Iranian Engineers who came to this country to escape things like seeing their mother KICKED INTO A ROADSIDE DITCH after her face was exposed during a sand storm by a man passing by on a bicycle. I KNOW the stories of such immigrants who did, indeed, sincerely love this country and were GRATEFUL to no longer live in fear… I also know poorly disguised Taqiyya when I hear it as well. Trump 2016 Log in to Reply Victor King  September 7, 2016 at 2:54 pm How do you propose “fighting to win” and against which enemy? If you are referring to ISIS or Al-Qaeda. perhaps the best way to “fight to win” would be not to have our government covertly sponsor these groups in the first place. And your comment about “taqiyyah” reveals your ignorance. Taqiyyah is an obscure idea in some medieval Islamic texts that most Muslims have never heard of. It simply states that if your life is in danger, you don’t have to admit to being a Muslim. Most of us would have no problem with a Christian lying about being Christian when captured by a ISIS murderer, or a Jew lying about being Jewish when confronted with the Gestapo. In practice, taqiyyah has been historically only been used by minority Shia when oppressed by fanatical Sunnis and it was safer for them to say “I am Sunni, leave me alone.” A rare case of taqiyyah being practiced by Sunnis was in Spain during the Inquisition, where Moors would say they were Catholics to stay alive (hardly surprising). It appears that taqiyya in the minds of people like yourselves is a projection of your own tactic — lying about your own beliefs and motivations, presenting yourselves as patriots when in reality you are just angry bigots who wish to do to others what you do not wish others to do to you.. Sami Jamil Jadallah  September 7, 2016 at 3:29 pm Victor King, not so sure of my “ignorance” since I did not refer to “taqiyya” which I agree was used in ancient times to hide one’s faith or identity to escape prosecution. Both Muslims and Jews in Catholic Spain during and after the Inquisition to use such practice and for good reasons. As for the Al-Qaeda and ISIS, the US directly and indirectly played a key and significant role in setting up and funding and sponsoring such terrorists group and it goes all the back to the Reagan years when not only funded by supplied and trained the Mujahideen with the latest weapons including the Stinger missiles which we refused to give to the Saudis. To end terrorism, we must disengage from out constant wars against the region pro or con and stop funding and ask our allies in the region to do the same. These mercenaries did not come from Mars.

However too bad the Congress does not take this issue seriously enough that it mandate a commission to come up with the solutions and implementation. Congress is too far polarized to even think straight. We need level headed people that over a period of 3 years take care of this issue. Of course, as you know, many of these “illegal immigrants” are “plantation” workers working for people that make money out of them and most likely do not pay taxes. I think you and I agree on the need to solve this issue. As a country with failing infrastructure, we need to “retool” all those guys who worked in the steel mills and manufacturing job to take care of and fix our falling apart infrastructure.

The way all this evolved is very unfortunate. No employer or businessman want idiots on the job because they can cause mayhem and money and liability for horrible claims which the owners must pay. Especially today think of the difficult job it is to trouble shoot almost anything because of the complex computers on board. Almost everything has computers today. One false move and some part or the whole system is destroyed. It is very unfortunate we did not develop a parallel system leading to respect of any and all workers high or low skilled, college or no college but with intelligence and hard work the leveling field instead of the military type pecking order system where an engineer can be overruled by a political hack in the front office and cause lives to be placed at risk or lost. This is what happened in the Challenger disaster where Roger Boisjoly pleaded with them not to launch but was overruled anyway due to politics. Frankly Reagan should have been jailed for negligence but he was so sorry it all happened. Many years later this top mechanical engineer with a conscience cried when he related this horror story because he knew the crew was being sent to their deaths but he was powerless to stop it. Log in to Reply Sami Jamil Jadallah  September 6, 2016 at 12:42 pm Wjabbe… you are so correct. Reagan Administration put the last nail in the coffin of “White Middle-Class America” when he sold them ‘snake charm, making them feel good while they were losing their jobs left and right without any efforts to retrain or put in place transition teams to new economies. As such many of those White Americans with high school education were out of jobs in the steel mills and manufacturing job with nowhere to go and no jobs to get to keep them in the honorable lifestyle of dignity they are used to. America never invested in its labor force, never bothered to work corporation to put in place mandatory retooling plans for its laid-off workers. Yes, we did commit major sin toward all these people who worked so hard in difficult jobs and left them on their own. It is ironic that the same people left behind by the government are now who are seeking and supporting less government. Ironic and it makes no sense at all. zman  September 6, 2016 at 10:46 am Thank you for a very adept article. Yes, we are continually baited with the old ‘make America great again’ line, whether enunciated specifically or not. Ever since Reagans PR presidency template which in reality was the death knell for our country, we’ve gone continually in the wrong direction…Caring for citizens is bad, bigger corporate profits are good. Unions, environmentalists, safe food and medicine, decent incomes and employment security became the enemies of our society, while corporate profits, off shoring, economic pacts, over grown military and perpetual war became the mantras. Hasn’t quite worked out for the average joe, but Wall & K street have done very well. A great start would be cutting the military in half and investing in us, but that would take a miracle these days of perpetual war and foreign control. Bernie had the right ideas, but apparently no guts to stick to his guns even after finding how badly he (and we) were screwed. Then again, he probably was made an offer he couldn’t refuse…which I imagine any real person would be. What it would take to change directions today is scary.

You did not read any of my articles, about the blight of Black America. Yes, before I put the blame on others I put the blame on Black American themselves, on their leadership on their churches on thier own schools. They never rose up to the responsibilty for their own community, blaming others will not do. Why the Koreans and Asians, and Vietnamese even Latino were able to rise up politically and economically because of a community dedicated to education, to family values, to social cohesions to hard work. The Black leadership failed the Blacks in America, you only see them at funerals and at demonstration but you do not see them cleaning the neightorhoods from drugs and guns that send most of Blacks to jail. Of course the deck is stacked against them, but the Black community has to take charge and they never did. I should know, I grew up in Gary, Indiana. Black politicians are bought and sold on the Republican and Democratic stock market. Chicago and Detroit are but too examples. We can fault the Nation of Islam but they sure proved White America wrong with their hard work and social values. If you think Donald Trump or Hilary will deliver Blacks you are a fool.

Demand for those hot-ticket items is helping to push back-to-school spending to its fastest growth in four years, a boon for retailers in their second most important season. Outdone only by the post-Thanksgiving holiday bonanza, back-to-school shopping for clothing, shoes, electronics and backpacks spans most of the third quarter, from July to September, and is a key driver in the sector's sales and profits. But while demand is on the rise, retailers still need to work hard to get shoppers in the door with coupons and promotions like special shopping days.  An increasing share of parents are Millennials, adept at using technology to find the best deals. Good weather is playing its part too by coaxing shoppers to malls and department stores such as J.C. Penney and Macy's, which have endured tough competition from online giant Amazon Inc. Total back-to-school sales rose 2 per cent in July, compared with 1 per cent growth in 2015 and 2014 and a 0.2 per cent rise in 2013, according to payments technology company First Data. Spending for back-to-school and college is expected to reach US$75.8 billion (RM309.33 billion) this year, up from last year's US$68 billion, according to retail association National Retail Federation's annual survey. “They (younger shoppers) are getting mom to buy more for them, because they are agreeing to shop at these less expensive lower priced retailers,” NPD Group analyst Marshal Cohen said. In July, electronics and appliance sales rose 5.5 per cent, the biggest increase in four years, according to First Data.  Items ranging from tablet computers to USB drives are all doing well, especially when carrying special offers. Always appreciating a bargain  Sales of laptops that can double up as tablets like Dell's Inspiron 2-in-1, have been helped by this trend, said Petter Knutrud, spokesman for Office Depot.  He added that schools were asking students to save their work on USB drives, which had boosted demand for the small devices. Electronics retailer Best Buy has tempted students with special coupons for everything from laptops and headphones to college dorm-friendly items like compact refrigerators and microwaves. J.C. Penney is also using promotions to boost back-to-school sales of apparel, which in turn helped July comparable sales.  Its 'Penney Day' promotions, which offer back-to-school staple items such as fashion leggings or tee shirts at a discount every Saturday during the season, are helping drive sales, company spokeswoman Sarah Holland said. Sales of apparel and accessories have been helped by new trends such as retro sneakers like Stan Smith models from Adidas and shirts for women with cut-out shoulders known as "cold-shoulder" tops. Good weather so far in the season has also benefited clothing sales at retailers such as Gap Inc's Old Navy chain or Urban Outfitters. While more jobs and rising stock markets are boosting consumer wealth, customers are still putting value over brand name. Wage gains for middle-income consumers remain insufficient to encourage discretionary spending, some analysts caution. Lower-priced stores like Old Navy, off-price retailer TJ Maxx and Kohl's are 2016's top back-to-school shopping destinations, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick wrote in a note. “Income rises faster than frugality changes,” NPD's Cohen said, suggesting that bargain-hunting is hard to give up even in the best of times. — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Fintech association anticipates regional investments With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Movie accent expert breaks down 32 actors’ accents Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles US native groups promised input as pipeline dispute looms Takei responds to Trump surrogate’s internment camp comments Japan PM confident in Trump’s diplomacy debut ‘I Wrote That Sh-t’ series puts songwriters for Katy Perry and more US intelligence chief James Clapper resigns Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Warren, File X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Wal-Mart is seeing the future, and the future isn't more shoppers driving through stop-and-go traffic to big boxes at the edge of town. It's online shopping. The giant retailer plans to plunk down a princely $3.3 billion for Jet.com, an e-commerce company. Using the same crystal ball, Macy's says it will close at least 100 stores, many in malls that have seen better days. Where does retailing in our city centers and on our Main Streets fit into this story? The answers are not simple. In the beginning, Americans went downtown to buy everything from hammers to sweaters to footballs. When much of the middle class departed for the suburbs, the retailers followed them. The new shopping venues were big-chain discounters and giant malls. This mass transfer drained the life out of downtown retailing, leaving sad, empty storefronts on architecturally splendid streets. Nowadays, "the Darwinian thing is going on in suburban retailing that was happening downtown," Mark Cohen, retailing expert at Columbia Business School, tells me. Amazon.com is the undisputed king of that jungle. Its online mega-store sells 550 million products. Every year, it takes a bigger bite out of bricks-and-mortar store sales. Another weight on suburban retailing is a ludicrous overbuilding of retail space. "The developers never saw a highway and exit ramp that they didn't want to build a mall on," Cohen quipped. So what happens next? Many of the fringe developments further down the highway without full tenancy are going to be history, according to retail analysts. Some big boxes, such as Home Depot and Lowe's, may do OK. Others will not. On to our downtowns. Whether hopping with activity, on the mend or still ailing, they remain the center for much of our civic life. Downtown is where one finds city or town hall, a main post office, a good library and transportation hubs. The stores are key players in the experience. Will online shopping hurt Main Street retailing the way it has plagued suburban stores? That all depends on the downtown. Where there is gentrification -- wealthier people moving to urban neighborhoods -- there is, of course, retail opportunity. Another advantage for city and town shopping districts is foot traffic, people walking by storefronts. Take me. I'm one of Amazon Prime's valued customers. I click away for moth traps and patio lights and color printers that get delivered to my doorstep. I know exactly what a Lego Elves toy is and would not sacrifice a half-hour driving for something I can order online in five minutes. But shopping does remain a part of the entertainment mix. On Saturday afternoons, folks hang out in nearby shopping districts. The stores there display clothes and housewares more interesting than the commodities at the discounters'. And being seduced by an artful display window could be a byproduct of meeting someone two doors down for coffee. Many of the most successful retail districts are those that attract tourists, particularly foreign ones. Visiting Asians, Russians and South Americans are known to stuff empty suitcases with stuff bought here. The concern right now is the higher American dollar -- plus the threat of another travel-related terrorist attack. The good news for physical retailers everywhere, Cohen says, is that the internet isn't likely to take it all. About 15 percent of current retail sales, online shopping could possibly go as high as 40 percent, but that would still leave at least 60 percent. And so the dreamscape of a bustling Main Street persists. Every now and then, one comes across a surviving family-run sporting goods or shoe store -- and salutes. It would be awfully nice to see more of them. COPYRIGHT 2016 CREATORS.COM fharrop@gmail.com Related Topics: U.s.

Prime Retail Advisors sent letters to the Fairfield County Board of Commissioners and the city of Lancaster inquiring about two properties the government entities own in the area: the Baldwin building, 240 Baldwin Drive, and the Lancaster Parks and Recreation office, 1507 E. Main St. "At this point, we don't know who it is," said Mike Pettit, Lancaster's economic development director. "We don't know if it's a go yet or anything." The scope of the project is about 15 acres, according to county officials. The consultant firm contacted multiple property owners, spanning from Baldwin Drive to the backyards of Kanawha Road and from Main Street to the county's property. Buy Photo A retail consultant group has been making inquiries on the availability of property on East Main Street between Baldwin Drive and Kanawha Road in Lancaster. The group has so far not said who they are representing. The total amount of land in question is about 15 acres.  (Photo: Matthew Berry/Eagle-Gazette) Prime Retail Advisors, a consultant company hired by the retailer, is still determining who is willing to sell in the area, Pettit said. Both businesses and homeowners have been approached in the area, but the name of the retailer remains unknown. Prime Retail Advisors did not return requests for comment. According to the consultant company's website, some of their "past and present clients include CVS, Rite Aid, Kroger, Gabe’s, Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Big Lots." Fairfield County Economic Development Director Rick Szabrak said officials were told the retailer could bring 150 jobs, but it was unclear whether those jobs were transfers from an existing location or new jobs were being created. The identity of the retailer and the offer to county officials will likely determine whether the county decides to sell. In May, the commissioners were sent a letter of intent to purchase the Baldwin building. The building was purchased this year by the county to house records and other county assets. The building sits on nearly 3 acres and is about 33,000 square feet. "(The Baldwin building) wasn't bought for an investment property, but we don't want to get in the way of economic development," Commissioner Dave Levacy said. The letter of intent stated the purchase price for the Baldwin building would be $500,000. County commissioners Dave Levacy, Mike Kiger and Steve Davis asked for more details and a fair purchase price to entertain the idea because they had just purchased the building this year, spending about $650,000 on the building and environmental assessment. Since the consultant company's inquiry, the county's plans were stalled. However, Davis said Tuesday that he would like to move forward with the original plans because the consultant firm had not returned with more information by the end of August, which was the time frame given to commissioners. "The way I'm looking at it, the secret guy in the closet is holding us up and I don't want to play anymore," Davis said. The commissioners' intention, Levacy said, was not to hold up the developer or the county's plans with their building, but they need more information before deciding whether to sell. "We just can't make a decision in a vacuum," Levacy said. sremoquill@lancastereaglegazette.com 740-681-4342 Twitter: @SpencerRemo 197 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2c8cMra TOP VIDEOS LHS planetarium celebrates golden anniversary 2:50 Why body cameras fail 0:55 Chipotle opens country's first Tasty Made restaurant in Lancaster 0:22 Man finds, rebuilds car he built in 1963, sold in 1974 2:08 Police video shows response to 'armed' man 1:37 Gears and stones being installed at Rock Mill 0:51 Body found in cornfield near Pleasantville 0:46 Making apple cider the old fashioned way, sorta 1:18 Mount Pleasant rescue training 0:44 Old grandstand demolished after fire 0:42 Fire destroys historic grandstand 0:48 Local farm harvests freshwater prawns 1:00 Inspectors check for card skimmers at gas stations 1:39 Local prawn farm prepares for harvest 1:24 Couple talks about how grief counseling helped their families 3:01 Girl donates birthday presents to dog shelter 1:37 Horse paints way into woman's heart 3:15 Where are the sidewalks on Sheridan Drive?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Shakey's Pizza returning to Victorville after 25-year absence Wednesday Sep 7, 2016 at 3:13 PM Sep 8, 2016 at 9:10 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz VICTORVILLE — Lovers of mojo potatoes, chicken and specialty pizza will be excited to hear that Shakey’s Pizza Parlor is returning to the High Desert. Cindy Staats, vice president of marketing for Shakey’s, told the Daily Press the popular pizzeria will be a reality in Victorville this fall. “We’ve had several requests to come back to the High Desert,” said Staats, from her office in the Los Angeles area. “We were in Victorville way back." High Desert residents recall visiting Shakey’s in Victorville when it was located near the corner of Bear Valley Road and Balsam Avenue, in the former Wal-Mart shopping center in the 1990s, and earlier when the pizzeria was located on Seventh Street on Lorene Drive near Costco. Several excited Victor Valley residents told the Daily Press that seeing the Shakey’s "Coming Soon!!!" banner on a building located at 14120 Bear Valley Road, Suite 103, in Victorville had them dreaming of the popular pizzeria, with its mojo potatoes. About five years ago, many residents were abuzz after seeing a similar Shakey’s banner go up on a building on Bear Valley Road in Victorville. “We planned a Shakey’s for Victorville, but the owner couldn’t complete the project,” Staats said. “But we finally had someone who came forward and said they wanted to open a Shakey’s in the High Desert.” Founded in 1954, Sherwood “Shakey” Johnson opened his first pizza parlor in a remodeled grocery store in Sacramento. Originally established as “Ye Public House” for pizza and beer, Johnson added live ragtime music, featuring banjos and player pianos in all his stores. Shakey’s serves up pizza, mojo potatoes, chicken, salad, dessert, beer and soft drinks. The pizzeria currently has approximately 60 stores in the U.S. and about 500 pizzerias globally.

Top quarterbacks show up in the fall of their freshman season, or even the spring before, already equipped with enough know-how to saunter into the starting huddle. The position that supposedly takes longest to master has been overrun by collegiate neophytes. In 2012 and 2013, Johnny Manziel and Jameis Winston won Heisman Trophies as redshirt freshmen. Last year, Josh Rosen at UCLA and Lamar Jackson at Louisville manned the position in their first year on campus. In the first weekend of this season, freshmen held the reins of heavyweight programs no less distinguished than Alabama, Texas, Florida State and Georgia, with all but the Seminoles opting for a true freshman. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Last weekend, FSU redshirt freshman Deondre Francois surpassed 400 yards in a comeback over Ole Miss. Jalen Hurts shredded Southern California with his arm and legs as Alabama romped. Jacob Eason replaced a senior and stewarded Georgia to a second-half comeback over North Carolina. Shane Buechele split time but still managed to pass for 280 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Longhorns over Notre Dame, perhaps the program's biggest win under Charlie Strong. This week's freshman quarterback stars may simply be a particularly advanced crop, likely to leave an imprint on this college football season and a couple more to come, with nothing broader to discern. "I think it's really individual," Wisconsin coach Paul Chyrst said. "I think each one is a specific case." They may also serve as an indication of how quarterback play and the Football Industrial Complex have converged. At the high school level and below, for those kids who want to make it one, quarterback has become a year-round pursuit. They can play in 7-on-7 leagues, hire personalized coaches and attend a series of camps and clinics. "It's its own business," Chryst said. Technology has led to more efficient and more advanced study. IMG Academy has a sponsorship deal with Striver, a virtual reality system. High schools can buy a similar system, with fewer bells and whistles, at Wal-Mart. Before they leave high school, quarterbacks often take their advanced training and apply it against better competition than what's available in their immediate area. Intersectional games between top teams from Florida, Texas, Ohio, California and other hotbeds have grown common, sometimes played on national television. "Things are changing," said Rich Bartel, the quarterbacks coach at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, and a former NFL quarterback. "Teams are playing national schedules. People are starting to branch out. Kids are getting what I would consider a fast rush or seeing skilled coverages more and more before they get to college." Jim Mora Jr., who coaches Rosen at UCLA, said top freshmen now come with "recognition of defense and understanding of offensive pass concepts" and an "understanding this concept should have an advantage over this defensive call in this area of the field." The rhythm of their footwork and timing of their throws, once a product of collegiate drill work, is present from the start. Broadcasters and analysts have rightfully been quick to praise the poise of young passers. But when the quarterbacks have specially trained to play the position for years, it's only natural for them to build immunity to panic, 18 years old or not. "When you add those things together, you get a more poised player at a younger age," Mora said. "They're able to handle the environment so much better." Earlier this week, Southern California coach Clay Helton reminisced with Trojans quarterbacks coach Tee Martin about their own college recruitment a generation ago. They received their first scholarship offers in the fall of their high school senior years and still wound up, respectively, at powerhouses Auburn and Tennessee. They laughed at the memory, because now top programs offer top quarterbacks as sophomores, if not earlier, because they start training at a young enough age to display evident collegiate ability by then. Helton received a firsthand example when he watched redshirt freshman Sam Darnold compete this summer. "The kid was so far beyond his age maturity-wise," Helton said. "I think there is a faster development than there was in the past." The hastened maturity has teamed with a paradoxical partner, and it helps explain both the proliferation of star freshmen and why their from-childhood training doesn't translate in the NFL: As the quarterbacks grow more advanced, college offenses have grown simpler. "There's probably more a disparity from scheme from college to the NFL," Bartel said. "The college system resembles more the high school system. When you see guys like Shane Buechele go in and have success early, it's probably not too far off of his high school system." In some spread systems, such as the Air Raid, play calls can be distilled into one word. NFL offenses, almost all of them some version of the West Coast or Erhardt-Perkins, use complex verbiage and elaborate, long-winded play calls. For a college quarterback in the spread, passing progressions typically involve nothing more than, "Is he open?" In the NFL, the kinds of reads a quarterback must make are varied, based off of layers of the field and the geometry of the defense. Almost every college offense now operates predominantly from the shotgun, giving quarterbacks a less convoluted vantage. "The game has become a shotgun game," said Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez, whose teams at West Virginia helped popularize playing from the shotgun. "The young guys are learning in the shotgun, and in the shotgun they can see the field better and get rid of the ball quicker." » Next page...

Muslim Purdue professor attacked, told to 'go home' Ron Wilkins , rwilkins@jconline.com 9:34 a.m. EDT September 8, 2016 Austin Bradley Gregory (Photo: Provided/Tippecanoe County Jail) WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A Muslim Purdue University professor attacked Saturday evening wants justice. The 37-year-old Canadian citizen of Egyptian heritage says the attack started as a flash-in-the-pan road rage incident about 5:45 p.m. Saturday in the West Lafayette Wal-Mart parking lot and ended in the his driveway, where a man punched and kicked the professor while the woman yelled from the driver's seat, “Kill him! Kill him!" “They chased me until my driveway,” said the victim, who asked that his identity be kept private, “and they attempted to kill me on my driveway.” On Saturday, police arrested 21-year-old Austin Bradley Gregory on preliminary charges of misdemeanor battery. He was released Sunday morning after posting a $250 bond. The woman, who the Journal & Courier will not identify unless she is charged with a crime, went free, according to court documents. The professor, however, compares her culpability to that of a person who drives the getaway car for a bank robbery. In a brief interview with the Journal & Courier on Wednesday, Gregory said the professor walked up to the car he was in and reached inside. Gregory said he was protecting his family and that's when the fight started. But two witnesses cited in the probable cause affidavit said the professor never made it to the car before Gregory punched him. A third witness said the professor reached inside the car but did not know if that was before or after Gregory punched him, according to court documents. The attacks have caused the victim to reconsider his employment in the United States. He fears for the safety of his wife, his children and himself. Whether he remains here after the school year will depend on whether Gregory and the woman are formally charged. “I will not stay here if I don’t see justice,” he said. “This country is not safe. There is no justice now.” The victim shared his experience with a Muslim friend, who reported it to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights organization for Muslims. That organization on Wednesday called for the woman’s arrest. The council also called for Indiana to adopt hate laws that enhance sentences for crimes that target victims based on their religion, race or sexual orientation. The victim, who did not want the council contacted, does not want hate laws pushed here. “I don’t want to take it to the political side,” the professor said. JCONLINE Download the Journal & Courier app How the incident unfolded Saturday’s attack started as an ordinary road rage incident. The victim told the J&C he had just backed out of a parking space in the West Lafayette Wal-Mart parking lot about 5:45 p.m. when a woman driving a gold Cadillac honked, passed him and cursed at him. "They yelled at me like, 'Go home, f---ing foreigner,'" said the victim. “I don’t know why she yelled at me.” Gregory said the man wasn't paying attention as he backed out, so they honked. They did not yell at him, he said. "(The woman driving the Cadillac) gave him the bird, gave him the finger," Gregory said, noting that was the extent of the initial incident. Gregory and the woman told police that the professor flipped them off, but the victim said he would never do that. Such gestures run contrary to his cultural upbringing. The professor continued to drive home, but he and the Cadillac were taking the same roads to their respective homes, according to court documents. When the Cadillac attempted to turn left into an apartment complex off Morehouse Road, the professor said he passed it on the right. But Gregory said the professor tried to run them off the road three times — the last time nearly running them into a tree. That aligns with what driver of the Cadillac and Gregory told deputies. They also said they followed the professor to get his license plate number and call police. The victim denied this, and there's nothing in police reports that indicated Gregory or the driver attempted to call police to report a reckless driver. Gregory told the Journal & Courier they were just calling police when they rolled up outside of the professor's home. The victim got out of his car in his drive, turned toward his pursuers and asked, “What’s wrong?” That’s when Gregory punched him, knocking him to the ground and kicked him in the head and back while the professor's children watched from the garage in terror, the victim said. Fortunately, the professor said, three of his neighbors witnessed the attack.

Ahmed Alshami, the husband and father of the two women hurling expletives and making obscene gestures, is not a U.S. citizen. A Facebook page appearing to belong to Alshami indicates he is from Sanaa, Yemen. Alshami owns a Buffalo deli called IGA Community Express Mart and has been convicted of third-degree burglary and second-degree possession of public benefit cards. After the court hearing, Alshami’s wife, Nadia Alhaj, and daughter exited the building. His daughter flipped off reporters while Alhaj shouted, “Are you happy now? F— you! F— America! F— it!” Buffalo’s WKBW-TV 7 reported Alshami now faces possible deportation and up to 14 years in prison. His next court date is set for Oct. 20. Ahmed Alshami Investigators say Alshami paid off customers in exchange for their Electronic Benefit Transfer, or EBT, cards. Then Alshami would take the cards to large retail outlets such as Walmart to buy items for his deli. His purchases totaled nearly $4,000. Alshami is reportedly being held on $2 million bail. Acting District Attorney Michael Flaherty told TWC News, “He would effectively use taxpayer money to buy provisions for his own store and sell them at retail, so he had an incredible competitive advantage over other stores in the area because the taxpayer was in essence underwriting the cost of him doing business.” Alshami was also convicted of third-degree burglary. “Police said he went inside a vacant house and stole kitchen cabinets, a hot-water tank and a baseboard heating unit,” Buffalo’s WKBW-TV 7 reported. Officials believe the man took the items to his deli for reuse or to sell them. Buffalo Council Member Richard Fontana, who lives near Alshami’s deli, told WKBW-TV 7 there has been a great deal of illegal activity at the store. “He was essentially the worst store owner I’ve seen in my 20 years at City Hall,” Fontana told the station. In 2015, concerns were raised about alleged drug activity surrounding Alshami’s store. The deli owner made local headlines after he posted the following message on Facebook: “From the Davey & Ludington store owners … The people who sit here and say they want the store shut down are the same people buying wraps to smoke weed … We will stay open regardless of what you want … Long stay the Arab stores … We are gonna stay here and make this money! So try to shut us down.” WIVB-TV 4 reported that Alshami had been arrested in 2015 and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance. Police reportedly discovered crack cocaine beside him in the back seat of a car. As for the food-stamp scam, Fontana said Alhaj may be charged as well. “We think we might be able to make a case now where she was illegally benefiting from his illegal actions within her business,” Fontana told TWC News. A YouTube video of the Alshami family antics generated a fiery response from the online community. Many of the nearly 300 comments are too obscene to post, but some included: “They said ‘F— America’ when they got off the boat. And they did.” “Why is he here? How did he get here? Why isn’t this family being deported right now?” “I am extremely happy! Glad he got caught. I hope he and his family get deported to whatever s—hole they came from. They were only here to abuse whatever they could. ‘F— you all, f— America”? OK, leave.” “A one-way ticket back to Yemen is perfect.” Click here for reuse options!

(Photo by Harrison /Topical Press Agency/Getty Images). No Time For Comedy Is there room for farce—and critical thought—after September 11? By Robert Brustein October 8, 2001 I was hoping to do a review this week of the late-summer London theater season, but like everyone else in America I had to change my plans. Writing drama criticism seems very trivial labor after watching the herculean efforts of police officers, fire fighters, and city workers to retrieve the remains of victims buried under the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. How does one continue to evaluate plays in the face of all that grief and all that rubble? It is being said that among the many things destroyed forever by the terrorists was our innocence. They may also have killed—I hope temporarily—our craving for serious art and hard-edged entertainment. When, for example, will any of us be able to watch a disaster movie again? As has been noted, the spectacle of thousands of terrified people running down city streets pursued by clouds of smoke and debris was already so familiar to us from films such as Independence Day and Godzilla that it was almost impossible to separate fiction from reality on that fateful Tuesday. Were authentic human beings or crowds of Hollywood extras fleeing toward the camera as two giant buildings imploded behind them? No wonder the studios have announced that they are canceling all their forthcoming disaster films—including an Arnold Schwarzenegger epic about a man whose family is killed in a terrorist attack—and replacing them with patriotic stories, family dramas, and other escapist fare. The impact on the theater has been just as daunting. The show is famously supposed to go on, regardless of internal problems or external catastrophes. (London’s Windmill Theater boasted that “We Never Closed” even during the darkest days of the Blitz.) But this plucky thumbs-up attitude in the face of adversity did not characterize the mood of theater people after September 11. For several days, all Broadway shows were canceled. Five of them have since closed for lack of attendance. New openings were delayed for a week or more. The Roundabout revival of Stephen Sondheim’s Assassins was postponed until further notice because, as its director Joe Mantello observed, the musical “asks audiences to think critically about various aspects of the American experience,” and in light of the murderous assault on our nation, “this is not an appropriate time to present a show which makes such a demand.” Especially when the show is about the assassination of American presidents. In the early 1940s, following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, S.N. Behrman wrote a play called No Time for Comedy. Sixty years later, we again find ourselves in a situation where there may be no appetite for comedy, not to mention critical thought. The late-night comedians went off the air for a week, and when they returned all Bush jokes were proscribed. It would seem that the only fully acceptable public activities have been churchgoing, praying, and flag-waving. (In the days immediately following September 11, we are told, Wal-Mart and Kmart sold a total of 514,000 American flags.) As we again consider risking American lives abroad in order to annihilate an enemy, critical voices may be considered as objectionable as they were during World War II. So the terrorists accomplished in one brief morning of depravity what had seemed almost inconceivable after three decades of identity politics: they managed to unify the country into a nation of patriots, turning numerous multiculturally diverse factions into a people with a common cause. But at what cost? I fear the effect on civil liberties of a concerted war effort. During the divided days of Vietnam, artists had more freedom to criticize their government than at any time since the fourth century B.C.E., when Aristophanes satirized Pericles’s conduct of the Peloponnesian wars. But this nation is now more united behind its government than it has been at any time since 1941. As we again consider risking American lives abroad in order to annihilate an enemy, critical voices may be considered as objectionable as they were during World War II. The fall season at my theater in Cambridge was intended to be a festival celebrating the Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo. It started with Johan Padan and the Discovery of America, Fo’s satiric comedy about the adventures of an anti-hero fleeing another kind of religious fanaticism, the Spanish Inquisition, to join Columbus in America. This was to be followed by one-person shows starring Fo (Mistero Buffo) and his wife Franca Rame (Sex? Don’t Mind If I Do). We elected to cancel the Tuesday performance of Johan Padan. Fo and Rame canceled the remainder of the tour. “We do not feel capable,” they wrote to me, “of performing ironic and grotesque shows, which deal among other things with sex and eroticism, in such a grave state of national mourning. ‘The show must go on’ and the clown crying behind his mask are stereotypes that we do not wish to perpetuate.” In other words, no time for comedy. In a speech to the audience on the night that we re-opened Johan Padan (the same night that our sister theater, the Huntington, was opening the unfortunately titled The Dead), I did my best to argue that comedy—like all forms of art—has the capacity to humanize us in the midst of inhuman events. But to tell the truth, my heart was not in it. I did not feel much like being humanized one day after those planes rammed into those buildings, engulfed them in fireballs, and toppled them to the ground, killing thousands of innocents. I wanted revenge. Some of my theater students were eager to know what America had done to make “those people” so angry at us, indeed why we were so roundly hated throughout much of the world. “You just don’t want to believe in evil,” I bellowed, comparing this question to trying to “understand” why Hitler hated the Jews. I was out of patience at that moment with the way the liberal mind always picks at its own scabs. Against the background of bodies catapulting out of the top-floor windows of the World Trade Center, the self-hatred of American political correctness never seemed more incongruous. (Actually, PC is probably dead as a doornail now, another casualty of the terrorists’ flight plan, and sharing a grave with the Peace Now movement, which has been blown to smithereens by Palestinian suicide bombers.) A few days later, my thirst for vengeance began to diminish, mitigated by a growing fear that our president, inspired by his own frontier America “dead or alive” imagery, might pack on his six-shooters and pick off a lot of poor shlubs in the rubble of Afghanistan. As one commentator wondered, how do you bomb these people into the Stone Age when they already are in the Stone Age? I began to feel ashamed of my previous feelings of indiscriminate belligerence. What we need is a focused police action, not a protracted general war. One of my anxious students wrote to me that she had been a prison guard in Israel and had watched herself grow so “callous and punitive” over the way her ratty charges berated her, smelling of urine and perspiration, that she was forced to request a transfer. She understood full well, she said, the origins of hatred and revenge. What we need is a focused police action, not a protracted general war I was even more ashamed when Jerry Falwell, with Pat Robertson concurring, blamed the whole catastrophe on secular America. “I really believe,” he fulminated, “that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way—all of them who have tried to secularize America—I point the finger in their face and say, ‘You helped this happen.’” He has since apologized. But this was almost enough to make one embrace political correctness. (Far from being the result of secularism, of course, the terrorist attack was the work of fanatical religious fundamentalists who shared the revulsion of our own fundamentalists at America’s “moral corruption” and “secularism.”) My student ended her letter by saying that she was “blessed to be able to work in the theater” because of the opportunity that it gave her to “criticize and rebuild my conscience” rather than to “simplify issues into good and evil.” That was my blessing, too, and I was grateful for being reminded, in my current state of anger and confusion, of the obligations of art in a bad time, of why literature and drama continue to remain relevant despite our horrifying glimpses into the darkness of the human heart. Or maybe the arts remain relevant because of those glimpses. They help us to understand, not to excuse, the motives behind evil actions--as Shakespeare was able to suggest, not to condone, the reasons for Macbeth’s murder of Duncan; and as Dostoevsky was able to examine, not to exonerate, the political ideas that led Raskolnikov to plunge an ax into the brain of his landlady. It is one of the functions of great art to help us see how the hatred and viciousness of our enemies can begin to infect the brains of relatively normal people like ourselves. It can also help us to understand the origins of that infection. I want to go back to Conrad’s The Secret Agent, perhaps the best account of state terrorism in literature. And I want to re-read The Possessed, in which Dostoevsky examines the anarchism and nihilism and despair that make a sane man into a criminal killer of innocent bystanders. I also need to refresh my memory of such bracing criticisms of our military establishment as Catch-22 and Dr. Strangelove, because the greatest danger of the moment--with ninety percent of the country in favor of strong military action (an opinion I share), but apparently willing, according to a recent New York Times poll, to sacrifice many innocent civilians in the process--is a blank check for the military. As Genet once wrote in The Balcony, if we behave like the other side, then we are the other side. If only for that reason, it is necessary to look past the waved flags, and the silent moments of prayer, and the choruses of “God Bless America,” and try to keep the arts in focus. By lighting up the dark corridors of human nature, literature, drama, music, and painting can help temper our righteous demand for vengeance with a humanizing restraint. The American theater presently stands, like Estragon and Vladimir, under that leafless tree in Beckett’s blasted plain. The show can’t go on. It must go on. There can be no time when it’s no time for comedy. Note: Some people should stick to comedy. Since I wrote this (last week), Dario Fo and Franca Rame have been circulating an appalling newsletter called “Give Peace a Chance.” There they attribute the attack on the World Trade Center to “the bloody beasts of capitalism,” claiming that brokers were yelling orders into their cellular phones while screaming people were hanging from the flaming towers. “Great speculators revel in an economy that every year kills tens of millions of people by reducing them to poverty,” they wrote in a widely quoted passage. “Faced with that, what are 20,000 deaths in New York.” Claiming that the Oklahoma City bombing was a white Fascist effort to provoke an anti-Islamic reaction, they also pretend to be in doubt about who armed the terrorists (“Islamic extremists? Rightwing extremists? Mad Zionists?”). Fo and Rame are friends, but this sort of vicious—and fatigued, outdated, and melodramatic—Stalinist ranting is inexcusable. There have been a lot of dumb, insensitive responses to the evil explosions that shook this country. But it is hard to argue for the complexity of art when the stupidest of all may have been written by this Nobel Prize winner in Literature.

Jacqueline Brooke Evans, 25, of Albrightsville, pleaded before Judge Steven R. Serfass to one count each of criminal attempt, criminal trespass and theft. In exchange for the pleas, charges of burglary, receiving stolen property, endangering the welfare of a child and access device fraud were dropped by the district attorney’s office. Evans was arrested for incidents that occurred on June 22, 2015, ata West Broadway residence in Jim Thorpe. Evans entered the residence of a coupleand took a purse which contained the victim’s credit cards. She and a co-defendant then went to the Walmart store in Mahoning Township and made purchases with the card. She later returned to the same residence in an attempt to enter a second time but was caught by the victims and held until police arrived. When police arrived, they found Evans’ young child in her locked car with all the windows up. Police got the child out of the vehicle. Police later located the stolen purse and wallet and other items that were taken. The victims spoke to the court concerning what happened and addressed most of their remarks to Evans. They told the court that they had to purchase new security doors and windows for their home. One of the victims told Evans, “You have a choice to make.” He said she could go back to drugs and end up in prison again of even die, or quit drugs and turn her life around. Evans admitted to a drug addiction problem she has had for the past two years. She said she got involved in illegal drugs when she became ill and was prescribed medication for that illness, which she claimed led to the use of illegal substances. Serfass told her, “You heard from(the victims) on how your actions impacted their life that night and continues to make them feel unsafe.” He added, “I’m glad they were here and you heard them.” Serfass sentenced her to serve a total of 3 to 1 day less 24 months in prison followed by 24 months of probation. She was also ordered to pay total restitution of $1,173.94, supply a DNA sample, render a total of 250 hours of community service when released on parole, get a drug and alcohol evaluation and follow any recommendations for treatment, pay court costs of about $1,000 and pay a $50 per month supervision fee while on parole or probation. She was given credit for 71 days already spent in jail on the charges. Her legal problems are not over. When arrested on the instant case, she was in the county’s Accelerated Rehabilitation Disposition probation program. Defense attorney Adam Weaver said he expects the adult probation office to move to revoke her from it.

Print   Email   Font Resize Carmike Cinemas to build far East Side theater By Vic Kolenc / El Paso Times Updated:   09/12/2012 12:02:03 AM MDT REPORTER Vic Kolenc Carmike Cinemas on Tuesday announced plans to put a 13-screen movie theater in a booming area near Montana Avenue and Joe Battle Boulevard on the far East Side -- about a mile from where Cine mark last week announced it would put a 14-screen movie theater. "El Paso is a great community for us. We've been there many, many years (with a Northeast El Paso theater)," and this site is in a fast-growing area, said Terrell Mayton, director of marketing for Carmike, based in Columbus, Ga. "I am not familiar with Cine mark's plans," Mayton said. "We compete across the country (with Cinemark), and we think our product is exceptional," and Carmike and its development partner will go forward with its plans, he said. Anthony Properties, a Dallas retail-site development company, has a contract to buy a 15-acre site at Montana and Justice, across Montana from Walmart and Lowe's home improvement stores, said Jay Anthony, principal for Anthony Properties. The company has built more than 40 Carmike theaters across the country, he said. "Carmike had interest in this quadrant, and we were able to tie up the location," Anthony said. The Dallas company is also in negotiations with El Paso businessman Cesar Viramontes to either buy up to 215 additional acres on the northeast corner of Joe Battle and Montana or become partners with him in a proposed mixed-use development of homes, retail and other commercial uses on that land, Anthony said. Advertisement Viramontes announced plans last year to put a Smart Growth development, El Cruzero, on his land, where he once operated a jeans-washing plant. The former plant building now houses the El Paso County Sheriff's headquarters, and is near the El Paso County Jail Annex. Viramontes was not available Tuesday for comment about the Carmike-Anthony Properties plan. "We do a lot of demographic studies and we try to identify nodes of opportunity across the country, and that led us to this quad in El Paso," said Anthony, whose grandfather founded the now-defunct C.R. Anthony department store chain. The company does retail developments across the country, and "we're finding the El Paso economy is stronger than the nation as a whole," in part because of Fort Bliss expansion, Anthony said. "There is strong interest in the market" from retailers, he added. The company wants to put four sit-down restaurants at the Carmike site, but it has not yet spent much time marketing the property, Anthony said. The site with the theater and restaurants will cost about $15 million to $16 million to complete, he said. As for Cinemark's recently announced plans, Anthony said, "I think we have the best location, and we are moving forward." Doug Schwartz, chief executive officer of Southwest Land Development Services, which is developing a 20-acre shopping center at Montana and Rich Beem Boulevard, where Cinemark will be the anchor tenant, deferred comments about Car mike's plans to Cine mark officials. Cinemark's chief marketing executive was not available for comment Tuesday. Cinemark operates three theaters in El Paso. Carmike's Mayton said the proposed new El Paso theater will have the latest technology and latest concession features. It will have self-serve popcorn and soda stations with 120 soda flavors, Mayton said. It will have a 600-seat, BigD auditorium, which features a three-story-high, 81-foot-wide wall-to-wall screen, Surround-Sound, and digital projection that provides a "complete immersion in sight and sound" for moviegoers, he said. It beats Imax, Mayton said. Carmike began rolling out BigD auditoriums in July 2010, and now has 14 in the nation. Cinemark's new theater also will have a big-screen auditorium, named Extreme Digital, or Cinemark XD. Two of its El Paso theaters already have XD auditoriums. Anthony said construction of the Carmike theater should begin by the end of the year and it is expected to be open by next summer. Cinemark plans to have its new theater open by fall 2013. Carmike has 233 theaters in 35 states, and plans to open five theaters in the Southeast United States this year and early next year. Cinemark has 300 theaters in 39 states, and 161 theaters in 13 Latin American countries. Vic Kolenc may be reached at vkolenc@elpasotimes.com, 546-6421. Follow him on Twitter @vickolenc.

(eric lynch/Flickr/Creative Commons) A reader alerted me to this incredible story of patriotism at a high school in Heber City, Utah: Student Ben Schofield is known around Wasatch High School for his American spirit. He flies an American flag from the back of his red pickup truck.  "I think it's really important," Ben told Fox 13 in Salt Lake City. "It's not just the material part of the flag, it's the meaning behind it." The other day someone set fire to Ben's flag in the school parking lot. Part of his truck was scorched by the blaze. Some of his classmates saw what happened and rushed over to extinguish the fire. "They pulled into the parking lot and they saw it on fire so they stopped and got it out and then they went and told the office," Ben told Fox 13 in Salt Lake City. Police and the school district are investigating—they believe another student may be responsible. The motive is unclear. The following day—students at Wasatch High School—decided to take a stand. Several dozen young people rallied at a nearby Wal-Mart. They wore red, white and blue and most proudly flew Old Glory.  Samantha Emmanuel, one of the participating students, said she and the others were appalled at the vandalism. "There are thousands and thousands of soldiers (in) a couple different countries right now fighting for you to come to school and then you just burned (the flag) up like that?" student Samantha Emmanuel told television station KSL. The young patriots boldly sent a message to those who might deface or desecrate the U.S. flag—we will not be silenced nor will we be bullied. And sure enough—the day after his flag was desecrated, Ben showed up to school with the Star-Spangled Banner proudly waving on a post in the truck bed.  "We're just showing that we can fly our flags and we always will," Ben declared. President Ronald Reagan once said that "freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction." We owe a debt of gratitude to the moms and dads and educators in Heber City, Utah, for raising up a new generation of patriots willing to defend freedom.

FOXSPORTS 8 takeaways from the season finale of 'Hard Knocks' with the Los Angeles Rams A vanilla season comes to a close but not before finally providing some drama. By Pete Blackburn Sep 7, 2016 at 11:31a ET 0 Shares The fifth and final episode of this season's Hard Knocks aired on HBO Tuesday night, bringing an end to the latest installment of the annual series that takes football fans behind the scenes of an NFL training camp. This year's series has followed the Rams as they return to Los Angeles and try to establish a new identity both on and off the field. But just as the Rams have had some pretty unspectacular seasons of football in the past few years, this has been a pretty unspectacular season of television. The first four episodes were mostly vanilla, and the finale was never going to undo that regardless of what went down. That being said, some drama finally arrived and brought some brief reminders of why we watch the show in the first place. Let's jump into the final takeaways. Time to grow up, Lamarcus Joyner HBO Last we checked in with cornerback Lamarcus Joyner, he was being a big baby and refusing to practice because he wasn't getting enough reps in camp. Tuesday's finale kicked off with the 25-year-old threatening to quit the team during a meeting with head coach Jeff Fisher. "I want to be a starter," Joyner told Fisher in his office. "Ya’ll can have your money back. I don’t play football for money. Coach, I love this game." He told his coach that he would be happier if he quit and went to work at Wal-Mart. (I wish Fisher called his bluff there.) Fisher told Joyner he wanted him to be the nickel cornerback because he thought it was the hardest position to play. Then, he shared a story with Joyner about how, back in 2000 as head coach of the Titans, he thought Steve McNair lost some passion for the game after taking a big hit. Eventually, Fisher saw it come back, and he said he wanted to bring it back out of Joyner as well. Ultimately, Joyner and Fisher were able to clarify their stances and work it out, and the cornerback returned to the field soon after. These probably the most interesting and revealing moments of the entire series this year, as fans don't often get an inside look at how conflicts like this one find a resolution. This is exactly the kind of behind-the-scenes stuff that makes Hard Knocks valuable and interesting. Unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot of it this year. Musical. Montages. I can't pinpoint when exactly Hard Knocks decided they'd have a musical montage featuring pointless super slo-mo closeups every 10 minutes, but that was a thing this season and it got old pretty quickly. We can probably chalk that up to the Rams being super boring and HBO needing to fill time. William Hayes inception true William Hayes watching William Hayes on @JimmyKimmelLive #Mermaids #HardKnocks pic.twitter.com/wHgVW4fgY7— NFL Films (@NFLFilms) September 7, 2016 Speaking of needing to fill time, we got to watch Will Hayes watch an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in which Kimmel talked about the defensive end's love for mermaids and showed scenes from previous episodes of Hard Knocks. Seriously, we got to watch Hayes watching Hard Knocks on Hard Knocks. It was weird. Todd Gurley hits the Pro Shop HBO The Rams second-year running back actually visited the Vikings' Pro Shop to buy an Adrian Peterson jersey that the Vikes' running back could sign after the Rams' final preseason game in Minnesota. A couple of teammates ribbed Gurley for the move, but he defended himself. "What's wrong with buying another man's jersey, bro?" asked Gurley. "That's what's wrong with y'all. People got too much pride these days." It's not uncommon to see players exchange game jerseys on the field, but I'm not sure if I've ever seen a player hitting up the team store before a game to purchase another dude's jersey. A heartbreaking muffed punt  HBO Heading into the finale, one of the biggest complaints I had regarding this season of Hard Knocks was the lack of emotional depth or high stakes. The finale brought those stakes, as a lot of the players profiled through the previous four episodes had to fight for a spot on the final 53-man roster. The last preseason game is where a lot of those jobs are won and lost, and wide receiver Paul McRoberts knew that. After not getting much of a chance to impress while lined up on offense, he decided he needed to make his impact felt on special teams. Unfortunately, his desperation backfired when he attempted to return a punt that clearly should have been fair caught and ended up fumbling away a turnover. Knowing he's on the bubble, McRoberts' reaction to the mistake was pretty devastating. After competing intensely for a spot all training camp, he recognized that he could (and likely would) be undone by that one mistake. It was brutal to watch, but that's the kind of stuff that makes Hard Knocks great. Or at least used to. Fortunately for McRoberts, he went on to make a nice touchdown grab later in the game and would eventually be signed to the Rams' practice squad. Other guys weren't so lucky, which brings us to ... Final roster cuts Hard Knocks always highlights several fringe roster players, making the round of final cuts pretty dramatic and interesting for viewers. This season's finale provided a number of harsh realities for familiar Rams players, as several who were focal points of the series ultimately didn't make the team. Ian Seau, the nephew of late Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau, was cut. Austin Hill, the undrafted free agent wideout competing against McRoberts, was cut. Eric Kush, the goofy center who loves tank tops more than anybody in the world, was cut. true After being cut by the @RamsNFL lineman @EricKush64 has signed with @ChicagoBears #HardKnocks pic.twitter.com/Pufv8zjNJ0— NFL Films (@NFLFilms) September 7, 2016 For what it's worth, the conclusion to this year's Hard Knocks provided a pretty interesting juxtaposition of fates. While not making a roster means coming up short on a lifelong dream for some, it's not always the end of the road for others. Kush took his release pretty hard but was signed almost immediately by the Chicago Bears, his sixth team in the past two years. Linebacker Brandon Chubb didn't make the 53, but joined McRoberts on the practice squad, which was a win for him. Hill, however, didn't get any such breaks. He was left in "limbo," stuck at home with his family while he waits for a call from another NFL team. It's a call that may never even come. “I’ve been cut multiple times and you always think it’s going to be easier each time, but it’s not,” Hill said. The face tattoo pays off  (Photo by Frederick Breedon/Getty Images) Rams defensive end Ethan Westbrooks is a guy we saw getting chewed out on several occasions during this season. It wasn't a sure thing that he'd make the final roster, but he did. That's extremely good news for him, considering he got a face tattoo with the hopes that it would motivate him to make it in the NFL and not have to pursue another, "normal" job with a tattoo on his face. It looks like he'll get to put off that worry for another year. Hello, Hollywood true Welcome to Hollywood @_MikeTeee and @nspruce22 #HardKnocks pic.twitter.com/A5ESSa464A— NFL Films (@NFLFilms) September 7, 2016 After preseason officially wrapped up, we got to see some of the guys loosen up a bit. Cameras followed rookie wide receivers Austin Spruce and Mike Thomas as they hit the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where they danced with (and failed to tip) a Michael Jackson impersonator, took pictures with fans and made fun of a way-too-skinny SpiderMan impersonator. Call it too little too late if you want, but it was one of the few standout examples of personality from a very vanilla Rams team this season. 0 Shares Los Angeles Rams Play Pro Pick'em For Prizes View Comments Hide Comments Get The Fastest NFL Scores, News and Alerts Text yourself the FOX Sports App - - Thanks!

Webster, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 07, 2016 at 10:36 AM, updated September 14, 2016 at 8:28 AM comments Devin Diamond, 20 Killed June 5 'They had so little disregard for his body' Antionette Diamond can remember one of the last texts her son, Devin Diamond, sent her. It was a picture of the keys to his new apartment in New Orleans East. He was so proud, she said, and she was proud of him. They had moved back to the city the previous year, having spent the past decade in Georgia after Hurricane Katrina. Her sister, Nicole Hunter, who lives in Atlanta, said she warned them not to move back, that New Orleans was too violent and dangerous for young black men, especially for someone like 20-year-old Devin. But New Orleans was home, Antionette Diamond said, and for that first year, it seemed like everything was moving in the right direction. Devin had just gotten a job at the Walmart on Bullard Avenue and moved into his own place in the Chenault Creek Apartments in the Little Woods area. He sent his mother the picture of his house keys June 2. It was a good day for the family, Antionette said; the same day her 6-year-old son Dylan graduated from kindergarten. "We were all so happy," she said, recalling that Friday. Three days later, around 4:20 a.m., firefighters found a body in the passenger seat of a burning vehicle in the Pines Village area. It was Devin's car, Antionette said. The coroner later identified the body inside as Devin. He died from blunt force trauma. "They had so little disregard for his body, I couldn't even say goodbye to my child," she said. "It's the hardest thing in the world for me to deal with, even to talk about, because I never thought I would be without him. And I am." Devin had dreams of becoming a veterinarian or a make-up and hair stylist, Antionette said. He had never been in trouble, though his mother said she did worry about how difficult his life could be because he was gay. "It's one thing to be a black male, but to be a gay black male is even harder," she said. There is so far no evidence that Devin was targeted because of his sexual orientation, but it's something that Antionette said she thinks about. In her mind, there doesn't seem to be any other explanation. "They took my son's life. They took a part of me that is irreplaceable," she said. "I miss him making me laugh. I miss the smile on his handsome face. I miss him calling when he was worried about something and us praying together when he felt he needed to be prayed with." Hunter, her sister in Atlanta, is angry at New Orleans. "I talked to Devin that Friday," Hunter said, remembering the last phone call she shared with her nephew, two days before his death. "He told me how he had moved into his first apartment. He was excited. He had just come from making groceries. It was a regular, normal conversation. I wasn't thinking that was going to be the last time I talked to him." Hunter left New Orleans in 2001 and has never looked back. "You could not pay me to move back to New Orleans. The crime is ridiculous. I am beyond angry and I have been angry for a long time. He was a good kid. I tried to get him to not go back. It's just too many killings," she said. Antionette said she has tried to explain to her youngest son, Dylan, why his older brother is gone. But to a child that young, the concept of death, let alone murder, is too difficult to grasp. "I explained that sometimes if a person hurts our bodies, and our bodies can't take it, Jesus calls us home. So he understands Devin is just not with us physically. But I don't think his mind can wrap around everything. "I'm learning to cope with it myself. As a parent, you never think you'd be in a situation like this. I've seen stories like this on the news a tremendous number of times. I now have a greater understanding of it, now that I have to deal with the loss of a child myself."

The companies, which act as landlords for dozens of Aeropostale stores, joined with liquidators and a licensing firm in a surprising late bid to save 229 of the chain’s roughly 700 remaining stores -- beating out a rival bid from a private-equity firm that planned to shutter all Aeropostale locations. Bidding to acquire a retail tenant is a highly unusual step for a REIT, which typically would get involved in a retail bankruptcy only if the chain’s assets included owned real estate. Aeropostale leases all of its stores. In this case, however, the landlords could win twice -- by retaining tenants that otherwise would have closed and stopped paying rent, and via the profits of the reorganized retailer. Play Video CBS This Morning What's behind Macy's closing 100 stores? Macy's is closing another 100 stores next year as it faces slowing sales and fierce online competition. The locations have not been disclosed, bu... But don’t expect a repeat of such an “unlikely” landlord intervention, wrote Rich Moore, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets, in a research note. This deal is probably one-of-a-kind and not a sign of bailouts ahead for retailers struggling with declining mall traffic and fickle consumer tastes. Macy’s (M), which owns much of its real estate, in August said it plans to shutter 100 stores, or about 15 percent of its fleet. The announcement followed similar ones from fellow retailers including Walmart (WMT), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP) and Kohl’s (KSS). Aeropostale is joined on the 2016 bankruptcy bandwagon by fellow retailers The Sports Authority (which is liquidating 450 stores) and Pacific Sunwear (which is restructuring). Simon and General Growth have so far declined to discuss the Aeropostale deal with analysts and reporters, but they’re expected to house their investment within a subsidiary to stay in compliance with REIT rules. They’re also unlikely to be long-term owners of the chain. “We believe that the liquidation of Aeropostale would have unilaterally benefited the company’s creditors … and would have negated the potential value of Aeropostale as a going concern to other stakeholders, including the landlords,” Moore noted. “Due to the unique circumstances, we expect that GGP and SPG’s foray into retailer bankruptcy auctions is a one-off situation in which a sizeable number of viable stores could be salvaged from an undue conclusion.” Play Video CBS This Morning How rise in online shopping and returns is hurting retailers The New Year could bring uncertainty to the nation’s retailers. Holiday sales at brick-and-mortar stores grew, but less than expected last year, ... The REITs would be in a good position to know which stores in the Aeropostale chain are worth saving because most mall lease deals include a rent component based on sales. Both Simon and General Growth can easily afford this effort, given that the $234.3 million bid represents a rounding error for the companies, which have market capitalizations of $68 billion and $28 billion, respectively.  Joining them in the bid are Authentic Brands Group, which owns names including Juicy Couture, Jones New York and Airwalk, and liquidators Gordon Brothers Retail Partners and Hilco Merchant Resources, which would be tasked with selling merchandise from the stores that would close. Aeropostale, which initially filed to reorganize in May, accused lender Sycamore Partners of pushing it into bankruptcy court by tying financing to a vendor relationship. A bankruptcy judge allowed Sycamore to use the $151 million it is owed toward its own bid for the chain, which slightly exceeded the bid Aeropostale ultimately chose to accept as the best deal for stakeholders. The bankruptcy judge still needs to sign off on the agreement and has scheduled a hearing for Sept. 12. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

As some of the accused head to a Bangladesh court, Al Jazeera looks at the aftermath of the epic factory collapse. 07 Sep 2016 12:03 GMT | Human Rights, Bangladesh, Rana Plaza , Labour By Jason Motlagh @JasonMotlagh Jason Motlagh is an International Reporting Fellow with the Pulitzer Center. Saddam Hossain lost half of his right arm when the Rana Plaza complex collapsed on the next-door building where he was working. More than three years after the deadliest incident in garment industry history drew international attention to dismal working conditions in Bangladesh, Hossain is relieved that shadowy factory bosses are going on trial. He is also cynical that justice will be served, and for good reason: In a country where factories and fatalities are synonymous, no owner has ever been punished. In Pictures: Recounting the horror of Rana Plaza This is likely to change starting this month , when 41 defendants go on trial for murder, none more loathed than Sohel Rana, the owner of the eight-story structure on the outskirts of the capital whose reckless decision-making was emblematic of a corrupt, politically connected business elite that has long operated above the law. Rana, the building's former chief engineer, several factory owners and more than a dozen government officials initially faced charges of culpable homicide for ignoring warnings not to allow workers into the complex, but authorities upgraded the charges to murder due to the gravity of the incident, likening the deaths to a "mass killing". Some of the accused will also face charges of violating building safety rules for illegally adding extra floors.  "Every single member of the government wants justice for them," public prosecutor, Khandaker Abdul Mannan told Al Jazeera. If convicted, he said they could face the death penalty or life imprisonment. 'Too extreme' to ignore While stern convictions may finally send the message that extreme recklessness can have legal consequences in Bangladesh, labour and human rights groups counter that scapegoating owners could shift responsibility away from the authorities and Western brands that abetted dangerous working conditions in the first place. "[The convicted] will be taking the fall for all of the parties that also bear responsibility: ruthless brands and retailers, heedless auditors, and the feckless government," says Scott Nova, executive director of the Workers Rights Consortium, a labour watchdog. WATCH: Help eludes Dhaka garment disaster victims "To the extent there is justice in this case it will only be because the event was too extreme for the government to ignore," he said. No one disputes that the April 2013 tragedy that killed more than 1,100 people and left 2,500 others seriously injured was a turning point for the world's second largest garment industry. An unprecedented outcry compelled hundreds of western retailers to create a pair of international coalitions committed to carrying out inspections and improving fire and building safety at thousands of factories. After years of resistance, a group comprising more than 150 mainly European companies such as H&M and Zara adopted the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, a five-year, legally binding agreement. Another block of North American companies, including Walmart and Gap, formed the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which is non-binding but can impose financial penalties against suppliers that do not comply, or sever ties altogether. On the labour side, factory workers successfully mobilised after the tragedy to raise the minimum wage from about $38 a month to $68. Labour laws were also reformed, nominally allowing workers to organise and push for better conditions, and social media has gained currency as tool to share information about dubious working environments. A prominent Bangladeshi supplier, who counts H&M among his clients, asserted that buyers who may have once turned a blind eye to violations have "genuinely changed their mindset" following Rana Plaza, investing more in safety upgrades and carrying out better audits of facilities to avoid another catastrophe that could jeopardise their bottom line. At the same time, he noted: "Our workers are much more informed." Quick pledges, slow action As global attention has moved on, labour and human rights groups insist that most western brands are woefully behind on delivering their promises. Nova pointed out that most of the buildings are still not safe enough because owners are dragging their feet and many brands are not fulfilling their obligations to help pay for renovations, notably on fire exits and vital structural repairs. Among the factories covered only by the government inspection programme or by the Walmart-led Alliance, which requires factories to pay for their own safety improvements, "the picture is worse," he added.  Both safety coalitions assert that they have helped factory owners secure loans and reduce the cost of fire safety equipment while acknowledging there's still a lot of work to be done. On their website, the Accord says that although more than half of the problems at active factories have been confirmed as corrected, another 1,400 more are behind schedule owing to political unrest and a dearth of engineers. In its first 2016 quarterly progress report, the Alliance touted a 90 percent reduction in garment factory fires and a threefold increase in its suspension of factories that have failed safety inspections. But the group conceded difficulty in adding fire doors, which are hard to come by in Bangladesh and must be imported. What both groups still grapple with is the murky matter of sub-contracting.  WATCH: Clothing factory workers' plight highlighted during  UK fashion week Despite pledges made by top American and European brands to clean up their supply chains, the directly contracted factories they scrutinise amount to just a third of those operating in the country. Another 5,000 sub-contracting factories, with an estimated three million garment workers are still without any oversight or safety improvements, according to an April report from researchers at New York University. In a statement to Al Jazeera, the Alliance said that while authorised subcontracting is allowed, these factories must adhere to the same registration, inspection and training standards as member factories. Whenever a member adds a new factory, it must first be inspected by the Alliance or Accord, have an acceptable plan to make necessary upgrades, and have "made progress" in doing so before it can begin production. This ensures that orders stay in inspected factories and warns members against adding unapproved factories. "Unauthorised subcontracting by any Alliance member is prohibited, and our members recognise the need to minimise the threat of unauthorised subcontracting," the Alliance said.   Off-book, outside the law? In the vast recesses of the garment industry, however, some owners concede that orders are still farmed out to off-book, sub-contracted facilities to meet tight deadlines for fear of losing fast-fashion contracts . In a poor country where garment exports account for nearly 20 percent of the GDP, the resources and political will needed for enforcement are hard to muster. "Though global brands assert that they have strict policies against unauthorised sub-contracting, in reality, millions of workers at thousands of smaller factories are producing their goods," Sarah Leibowitz, the lead researcher on the NYU report, said in a public statement. "Working in these factories is highly risky, yet virtually no international resources are being applied to them." The enduring risks to garment workers are exacerbated by the fact that although labour laws have been amended to make it easier to form unions, abuse and intimidation makes it difficult in practice. A 2015 Human Rights Watch report detailed workplace abuses including physical assault, forced overtime, denial of paid maternity leave, and failure to pay wages and bonuses on time or in full. Those who dare try to push back are routinely fired or face threats and beatings at the hands of factory management or hired third parties, often with active government collusion. WATCH: Fault Lines - Made in Bangladesh Here again, foreign brands whose purchasing power gives them leverage in the industry "for the most part, sit by and watch," says Nova. "Bringing buildings up to code, and ensuring that workers can act collectively to protect themselves, are the twin guarantors of safety in a place like Bangladesh." The Alliance maintains that it has formed a labour advisory group on all matters related directly to workers, and, along with the Accord, recently began training safety committees - elected groups in every member factory mandated by the government after Rana Plaza - to "ensure workers' voices get heard". Additionally, a 24-hour hotline has allowed them to better address allegations of abuse, notably against those who have attempted to form unions. None of this will make a difference to Rana Plaza survivors such as Hossain. Handicapped and racked by nightmares, the 31-year-old former salesman gave up on working in the city, unable to set foot in multi-story buildings. Running low on the $15,000 the government paid him after the collapse, he is now looking for a clerical job in his village, with hopes that his disability will secure him preferential treatment under the state's quota system. His faith, however, does not extend to the country's justice system. "Of course Rana should be convicted," he says, "but we all know he's a very powerful man, with links to the higher-ups in government."   - Golam Mortuja contributed reporting from Dhaka.

The sheriff's office confirms that Ryan Keith Tilley, 33, of Princeton, was captured after he was spotted inside the store.  He tried to run from deputies, but was arrested in the parking lot.  Deputies say he initially resisted arrest and then tried to make them think he had a gun in the bag he was carrying. It turned out to contain only some cash.  Tilley was indicted by a Mercer County Grand Jury in February of this year on a multitude of charges, including attempted first degree murder.  He's being held in Southern Regional Jail without bond. ----- More stories from WVVA.com Homicide investigation underway in Buchanan County Third times the charm for Alderson salon destroyed by flood 2 captures, 3 wanted in latest All Points Bulletin Report Pipestem Par 3 short course to stay open into the fall Wayne Stafford NEWSMore>> West Virginia settles claims against 3 drug companies West Virginia settles claims against 3 drug companies The West Virginia Attorney General's Office says it has reached settlements with three more prescription drug wholesalers for $800,000 resolving allegations they failed to detect, report and stop suspiciously large drug orders into the state.

Whole Foods and its $29.99-a-pound steaks hit age-old problem (Bloomberg)—The problem with Whole Foods Market's expansion plan—and, perhaps, its entire business model—is epitomized by its store in west suburban Elmhurst. The outlet looks like any other Whole Foods on the inside, with its artisan breads, exotic facial oil and quinoa. But it's the surroundings that are the problem. It shares a parking lot with a Dress Barn, a Kmart and a Shoe Carnival (“Buy One Get One Half Off”)—“not what we would consider high-end,” as Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin put it. At a time when Whole Foods is losing shoppers to the likes of Kroger, Trader Joe's and Wal-Mart—as those chains crowd into the organic-food business Whole Foods helped create—the concern that Mushkin and others on Wall Street have is that by trying to expand into hundreds of new neighborhoods, the company is targeting the wrong audience. Focus instead, they say, on the wealthy urbanites who can afford to pay $29.99 for a pound of filet mignon. “They should embrace that premium experience,” said Matt Argersinger, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool. “If they race in the opposite direction, I think it will trip them up.” MORE ON THE STORY: • Whole Foods flagship in Lakeview could sell for $70 million • Whole Foods facility planned for Pullman • Whole Foods coming to proposed Vernon Hills mall STOCK'S DOWN It's already happened. Shares are down more than 50 percent since hitting a record high in 2013, around the time co-founder John Mackey declared his goal to more than triple the number of stores to 1,200. Sure, there are other problems depressing the stock—same-store sales are sliding and profit margins are shrinking as the company offers discounts and digital coupons in a bid to shed its “Whole Paycheck” nickname—but these are issues that outsiders worry will only get worse as the company finds itself in more and more middle-class locations. It's an age-old problem for retailers: How do they keep growing when they run low on suitable new locations? So far, Whole Foods insists it's sticking to the 1,200-store target. There are signs, though, that it may be having second thoughts. Mackey recently said the company would cut back on square-footage growth in 2017 and that it's giving more scrutiny to potential new locations. The company operates 435 stores in the U.S., with another 20 in the U.K. and Canada. TWEAK PLAN Photo by Bloomberg Shoppers browse the produce during the grand opening of a 365 by Whole Foods in Los Angeles in May. Some analysts say it's just a matter of time before the 1,200-store plan is abandoned, or at least tweaked. They say it's possible, for instance, that the expansion target will be reached by including the construction of stores in the new 365 by Whole Foods Market chain. Named for the company's private-label brand, these stores are cheaper to build and operate and are designed to attract customers priced out of the flagships. The first two in the chain opened recently on the West Coast, with another scheduled for this month. And in May, Whole Foods said it had renegotiated three leases in Ohio and Indiana, switching those sites to 365 stores. In all, 20 leases for 365 locations have been announced. On a recent earnings call, company executives gushed about the economics of the model. “All of our regional presidents have gone and seen the 365 stores and are kind of electrified by some of the labor savings and some of the structural changes that we've done there,” David Lannon, executive vice president of operations, told analysts. So far, Whole Foods hasn't abandoned Mackey's target of 1,200 stores and has said that the number of locations for its 365 stores will push the total beyond that optimistic number. And it was only four years ago that the company said its push to add more stores would include locations in food deserts in inner-city Detroit and Chicago. DIFFERENT OPTIONS The sentiment on Wall Street is that if Whole Foods is intent on expansion by competing for budget-conscious consumers, the 365 stores, with their lower cost structure, are the right way to go. Credit Suisse Group analysts recently added Whole Foods to its list of top investment ideas, with a price target of $40. The analysts argue that while a basket of grocery items at Whole Foods stores they visited in three Midwestern cities cost as much as 20 percent more than a similar basket at Kroger, some of that price premium was warranted because the shopping experience at Whole Foods was better. Whole Foods' stock has been hovering in the $30 to $31 range since the end of July. RELATED: Whole Foods plans lower-cost store in Evergreen Park And there are, of course, some cities and neighborhoods targeted in the expansion plan where the arrival of a Whole Foods flagship store is still a hit. In July, the company opened a glistening 51,000-square-foot store in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, the center of New York City's hipster community and a million miles culturally from Elmhurst. The store features a tap room and wine bar, a food hall and a full butcher shop where whole pigs hang from the ceiling. Stylish young shoppers streamed by, picking through local cheeses and stopping at the eye-catching display of LaCroix seltzer, which has become a popular selfie backdrop. Analysts expect the location to do well, but it's also emblematic of the company's need to focus on areas with the kind of upwardly mobile shoppers who don't mind paying a little more. Swinging too far the other way, and stretching to hit an aggressive store target by trying to fight a price war with Kroger and Wal-Mart, could end up being a trap that Whole Foods can't afford to fall into. “There are a lot more wrong ways to do it than right ways,” said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Inmar's Willard Bishop.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel The government today said it will not be possible to allow FDI in multi-brand retail trading in India unless small traders and farmers are "empowered" and can face market competition. "At the moment, India can create several Walmarts of its own. We welcome anybody...but if some way this dialogue is moving towards, why not (FDI in) multi-brand retail in India? My answer is, 'not yet'," Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at The Economist India Summit 2016 here. She was replying to the question as why to India is not permitting FDI in retail trade. Explaining the "thinking behind" this, the minister said there is an issue of last mile connectivity, adequate infrastructure and financial inclusion of those segments such farmers and small traders. These things were absent all the while but now this government is making every effort to bridge these gaps, she said. "If only that happens, and if they (farmers and small traders) are adequately empowered to tackle the market themselves... But today we are trying to bridge those gaps. We are still not ready to have them and face a competition where there would not be a level playing field," Sitharaman added. Although the current foreign direct investment (FDI) policy permits foreign players to hold 51 percent stake in an Indian company, BJP had opposed foreign investment in this segment in its election manifesto. The last government had cleared UK-based Tesco's proposal in multi-brand retail. On a question that there are no big supermarkets in India, Sitharaman said: "Our supermarkets are friendlier than the faceless supermarkets I have been in the West." She also said that the government is taking steps to improve ease of doing business in the country. "There was a long list of archaic laws...over 1,200 laws have been removed just unceremoniously and taken out of the system because you do not need them," she added. On a question about a law on sedition, the minister said there is a discussion going on in court and "we will certainly be eager to hear about it". "The freedom of speech even to the extent that critical appraisal of government has never been contained in India, never stifled in India," she said. If there is problem with an act or a certain code in IPC, the government is willing to look at it, she said adding "but that can not be an expression to undermine the State itself". Criticising the government is one thing, but nobody should undermines the State and the Constitution, she said. Tags  government FDI farmers small traders Nirmala Sitharaman Tesco Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Expert: Watershed in sexual harassment awareness By Kelly Wallace CNN Published 09/07 2016 01:27AM Updated 09/07 2016 01:27AM Copyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (CNN) Gretchen Carlson's $20 million sexual harassment settlement against 21st Century Fox and the company's unusual public apology to the former Fox News Channel anchor bring an end to her very public battle with Roger Ailes, once one of the most powerful men in media and now the ousted head of Fox News who resigned only weeks after Carlson's team filed suit. But a lingering question remains: Will Carlson's hefty settlement encourage more women to come forward and report sexual harassment in the workplace? There are reasons to say maybe it will. Women who are facing sexual harassment at work may feel empowered by Carlson, who stood up to her harassment and won a real and prompt resolution, said Emily Martin, vice president of workplace justice for the National Women's Law Center. "It's certainly the case that just because (Gretchen Carlson) did it doesn't mean that everybody will be able to get the $20 million settlement and their apology next week, but the value, I think, of what happened in the past few months is, I think, that it is always helpful when you are struggling in your own life to have some role models, to have some examples of someone who was able to mitigate this successfully, who was able to find a solution, and who blazed a path in some way," Martin said. Martin said she believes Carlson's case is a "comparably big moment" in terms of raising sexual harassment awareness as the Anita Hill hearings were in 1991. Hill accused then-Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassing her. There have certainly been sexual harassment allegations that have captured the public's attention since Hill came forward, but for the most part, until Carlson, the accuser has always been someone people don't know, said Martin. "I can't think of a clear analogue where it's not just that the person being accused is a public figure but the person who is saying 'I was harassed' is a public figure, who people feel they have a relationship with, who people feel like they trust," she said. Immediately after the Hill hearings and changes in the law to allow jury trials and monetary damages for employment discrimination cases, there was an increase in the number of women who filed sexual harassment complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. "One of the things that's different about this story from Anita Hill's ... is this is a story with a positive legal result," said Martin. "Part of what this story is is that the law worked, that she made a legal complaint, she brought a lawsuit and look at all the things that happened as a result," said Martin. "I think that's a powerful story." The impact of a 'courageous first' Being the first to come forward is never easy, said Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations and advocacy for the American Association of University Women. It wasn't easy for Betty Dukes, a store greeter who filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart in 2001 claiming sex discrimination. It wasn't easy for Carlson, who could not have known how many other women would have come forward and how quickly Ailes would be out of his job. "Do I think that there will be more folks coming forward" after Carlson? Maatz said. "I don't know that for sure but I do know this: I think that when women do come forward, they will have more support from other women who have been in the same spot. "What this has shown is that if there's a courageous first who is willing to come forward, that those folks who came up behind her and said, 'Yes, me too, 'Yes, me too, 'Yes, me too,' that there was a benefit," she said. "It helped everybody." The very public nature of the settlement, the settlement amount and 21st Century Fox's apology to Carlson for the "fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all colleagues deserve" also could encourage more women to speak up. In many high-profile sexual harassment cases, when women win a settlement, a gag order is often imposed, preventing them from disclosing that a settlement has been reached, the amount of the settlement and any other details of what they experienced. "So many women who have won suits against their companies signed nondisclosure agreements and that's thwarted many other women who might complain," said Emmy Award-winning television journalist and New York Times best-selling author Diane Smith, president of Diane Smith Media. "They are not aware that others have had success in taking action." The fact that the sexual harassment took place at such a prominent and well-known company as Fox News and that the accused perpetrator was the most powerful person at the company can also play a role in encouraging women to come forward. some women said. "I think it's a game-changer because it shows that this kind of bias and discrimination is alive and well and in fact is being cared and fed at the highest echelons of business in this country," said Maatz. Janeane Davis, a business consultant for the blog Janeane's World, said the settlement will make more women come forward because it shows sexual harassment is a real problem and occurs in big businesses even run by "important people." "It will make people realize that if it is happening in respected companies, people should believe it when women at smaller companies say sexual harassment is happening to them," said Davis, a mom of four. Why it's still hard to come forward Carlson's case still shows how hard it is to come forward when you are the victim of sexual harassment, said Katharine Zaleski, co-founder and president of PowertoFly.com, an online platform linking up women in tech with job opportunities. "The size of the settlement makes clear that she had a slam dunk case and yet her veracity was questioned publicly numerous times -- and even when other women came forward," she said. Sexual harassment is "embarrassing" and often people question what the woman did in order to be treated in such a manner, said Laura Beyer, a mom of two who said she was sexually harassed in the military and in corporate America. "Many believe she must have dressed in a certain way or must have behaved in a promiscuous manner. Rarely is the man blamed due to the fact that no one, not his wife, family, children, want to believe that he would behave in such a disgusting and vile manner," said Beyer. Women fear retaliation. They fear being labeled a "troublemaker." They fear losing their jobs. And that won't change, even after Carlson's massive victory, some women said. "The average woman does not have the power and visibility of Gretchen Carlson. Most women do not come forward because they fear retribution and that will not change," said Lori Day, an educational psychologist and the author of "Her Next Chapter." "Even though Carlson did face scrutiny and criticism, she had the backing of other women at Fox who'd experienced the same thing, and as a media personality, she brought negative press down upon Ailes, which ultimately worked in her favor." She added, "It is all so beyond the daily experiences of average women that I don't think it will move the needle at all." Carlson's settlement doesn't look as "monumental" when you consider that her "abuser," Roger Ailes, received $40 million "just to leave," said children's television host Miss Lori, who said she was sexually harassed by a professor while in college. She reported the harassment and her division head removed her from his classes. However, she had to be enrolled in comparable classes at a different university. "The echoes of the harassment reverberated on as I was ostracized by my classmates," said the social media strategist and Babble.com contributor. "I was seen as a troublemaker who refused to go along to get along with a beloved teacher. ... I was victimized by my teacher's actions and then victimized again by my own reporting of the abuse." Yes, the Gretchen Carlson suit will have "reverberating ramifications" in the business world, she said. Yes, it might get a few more women to step up to the mic and expose their harassing employers, she said. Yes, we are making progress and that's a good thing. "But the bottom line, it won't ever really get better until the war on women is defeated," she said, saying what's needed is a complete end to any objectification of women by men and boys. "And that's going to take more than dollars. It's going to require a lot of sense." Copyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.

If you don't, look for a card to help build your credit. by Michael Gardon Updated on 10.24.16 The best credit cards generally offer low interest rates, great perks, and no hidden fees. However, that doesn’t mean the “right” card is the same for each person. Because each credit card offer is as different as we are, the best card for your needs depends on your spending habits, credit score, and personal credit goals. Use this post as your guide to match up your needs with the benefits you desire most. Apply Now on Chase.com’s secure website But, if you want to avoid analysis paralysis, here’s the CliffsNotes version: According to our readers, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is the single best credit card with the best rewards and perks for nearly every type of spender. How do we know? Because, over time, more of our readers have signed up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card than any other rewards card we have seen. Add onto that the myriad feedback we receive on this card’s benefits, such as no foreign transaction fee and the flexibility of Chase’s Ultimate Rewards points, and it’s easy to see why the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is one of the top cards on the market. I can attest to its greatness as well. I have been writing about the credit card landscape for the last three years now, and this is the card I use for the bulk of my family’s everyday spending because I find the Chase Ultimate Rewards platform to be the most flexible for earning and redeeming travel. I even use the Ink Cash® Business Credit Card from Chase for my business as well to combine my business and personal Ultimate Rewards points to take my family of four on a free vacation. The Simple Dollar’s Top Picks for 2016 The best credit cards on the market come with plenty of perks that include things like cash back rewards, travel insurance, and price protection. They can also help you travel for free, or score heavily discounted travel perks. Other types of cards offer a lower interest rate, which can lead to huge savings over the long term. To help you get started, we created a list of our top cards in each of the main categories: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card Best Travel Credit Card Chase Freedom® Best Cash Back Credit Card Discover it® Cashback Match™ Earn Double Points Your First Year Chase Slate® Best Balance Transfer Credit Card Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card Best Airline Credit Card Starwood Preferred Guest® Credit Card from American Express Best Hotel Credit Card Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard® Best Sign-up Bonus for Travel How Should I Choose the Right Credit Card? While the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is the clear winner for my family, that doesn’t mean it’s the best card for yours. In reality, the best card for your needs depends on your spending style and personal credit goals. Below are a few scenarios to help you narrow down the right card for you. “I want free travel and perks.” Travel credit cards are notorious for their amazing perks and travel-related benefits. Not only can you earn points or miles good for free travel, but also many travel credit cards let you earn special status with a hotel or airline, and also let you transfer your points to numerous hotel and airline loyalty programs. What to look for: If travel is your number one goal, you’ll want a credit card that earns at least 2x points on travel, and has tons of flexibility, including allowing you to transfer points to hotel and airline loyalty programs. Also, many of the best travel credit cards offer additional travel benefits like trip cancellation coverage, primary and secondary auto rental coverage, and emergency travel assistance. Beware: Most travel cards have annual fees, which are well worth the price if you earn enough points each year to justify the fee. You will also need excellent credit for most top travel cards. Check out our picks for the top travel cards below. “I’m looking for the best sign-up bonus right now.” While it’s smart to think about the ongoing rewards you can earn, scoring a huge sign-up bonus doesn’t hurt, either. Fortunately, a ton of credit cards offer huge bonuses to people who are able to meet a minimum spending requirement within the first few months. While these sign-up bonuses can come in the form of cash back, you can also earn gift cards, airline miles, free hotel stays, and hotel points as well. What to look for: Credit card sign-up bonuses are often cyclical with a peak season generally in the summer months, although some top travel cards offer healthy bonuses all year round. Sign-up bonuses are highest on rewards cards and travel cards, but make sure the one-time bonus is worth it. Often the largest point bonuses are on hotel cards, which offer little long-term value unless you travel frequently or only stay at one hotel chain. If you only travel one to two times per year, you will probably not earn enough points to justify the annual fee. Beware: Since most cards with big bonuses come with a minimum spending requirement, you’ll need to make sure you can hit that requirement without hurting your finances. Also make sure the “bonus” you earn is something you can actually use. For example, a sign-up bonus made up of airline miles will only be useful if you plan to travel and can actually fly that airline. Check out our picks for the top cards with sign-up bonuses below. “I want to earn cash back on my spending.” Cash back credit cards let you earn cash back, statement credits, or gift cards for every purchase you make. The best credit cards allow you to accumulate two or more points per dollar or more. Cash back cards are great second credit cards to own and work best when paired with a more general 2x points per purchase rewards card. And since many cash back credit cards are also considered “beginner credit cards,” they offer a great opportunity to build credit while you earn rewards. What to look for: A cash back card is ideal when used as either your first credit card, or a complement to a higher-earning rewards card. Use cash back cards to maximize rewards on groceries, gas, and other categories where your rewards card might not earn bonus points. I use the Blue Cash Preferred Card® by American Express to earn 6% back on groceries for my family — up to $6,000 per year, for example. You also, generally do not need excellent credit like with a rewards card, but this can vary by issuer. Beware: Cash back cards often rotate their bonus categories on a quarterly schedule. This means that you might earn 5% back on gas for the first three months of the year, and then groceries in the second quarter. Also, despite the allure of high earnings, cash back cards often cap the points you can earn in a given quarter. Check out our picks for the top cash back cards below. “I need to reduce my interest rate.” One way to avoid high-interest credit card payments is to transfer your balance to a new credit card. When you do this, make sure it’s a credit card that will either accept your balance without charging a fee or offers a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers for over a year. This gives you time to pay off your large balance. What to look for: If you’re carrying credit card debt at a high interest rate, look for a card with a low interest rate or 0% introductory APR for anywhere between 12 to 21 months. Depending on how much you owe and your current rate, the interest you save could add up quick. And when you’re not paying huge interest payments every month, you may be able to get out of debt faster. Beware: Most 0% introductory APR cards carry a fee for transferring your balance to the new card. This fee is usually between 3% and 5% of your total balance. The Chase Slate® card waives this fee if the balance is transferred within 60 days from a non-Chase credit card. Check out our picks for the top balance transfer cards below. “I need to build credit.” Building credit is an important step in your financial journey, and using a credit card responsibly is the quickest way to build credit. However, when you do not have credit history, it can be difficult to obtain a card. There are two types of credit cards for building credit: unsecured and secured. Most credit cards are unsecured and do not require a cash deposit to use. A secured credit card is needed in more extreme circumstances where you need to “secure” your line of credit by depositing a cash amount equal to what you want to borrow. What to look for: If your goal is building credit, rewards should take a back seat for the time being. Instead of looking for the top rewards credit cards, you should home in on cards geared to people with poor or evolving credit. If you can, you’ll want to get an unsecured credit card that doesn’t require a deposit. Beware: You might have to apply for a secured credit card if your credit score is extremely low or if your credit history is limited. With a secured credit card, you would need to deposit $200-$500 with the credit card company in order to receive a $200-$500 line of credit. This sounds like a big barrier, but with a few months of on-time payments, you can reasonably expect to have the deposit requirement lifted. Read our reviews for Best Credit Cards for Average Credit, Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit, and Best Student Credit Cards to find one that’s right for you. “I don’t know what I need.” If you’re still unsure which type of card would benefit you the most, browsing them all can help you compare and contrast. Take a look at our credit card database below.

Best Airline Credit Card Apply Now on Southwest Airlines' secure website Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card Highlights The best airline credit card depends on a variety of factors including which airports you fly out of, but if Southwest Airlines is an option for you, the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card is the best airline credit card for domestic travel and travel to the Caribbean. With this card, you’ll earn 2x points on all Southwest® purchases plus 1x points for every other purchase you make.

Best Sign-up Bonus Right Now Best Flexible Sign-up Bonus Apply Now on Chase's secure website Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card Highlights We hate to be repetitive, but the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card really does offer the best flexible sign-up bonus on the market. With this card’s 50,000-point bonus, you can redeem those points for $625 in travel, or transfer them to airline or hotel loyalty programs. For comparison, a hotel card like IHG Rewards might offer an 80,000-point sign-up bonus, but that can only be used at IHG hotels and select partners, which severely limits your options.

Best Cash Back Credit Cards Best Cash Back Card with Rotating Bonus Categories Apply Now on Chase's secure website Chase Freedom® Highlights If you’re looking for a card that lets you earn up to 5x points for every dollar you spend, look no further than the Chase Freedom®.

In addition, you’ll earn 1x points for every dollar you spend elsewhere — all of this with no annual fee. With any card that offers cash back on purchases with rotating categories, it’s important to get the one that matches your spending habits at the places you shop frequently in order to reap all of the rewards. Keep in mind that Chase doesn’t count purchases at Target and Walmart, so if you’re a frequent shopper there, you may be better off with the Discover it® Cashback Match™.

Earn Double Points Your First Year Apply Now on Discover's secure website Discover it® Cashback Match™ Highlights The Discover it® Cashback Match™ is similar to the Chase Freedom®, but its first-year benefits set it apart. Discover not only offers 5x points on your first $1,500 spent in rotating categories and 1x points on all other purchases, also for no annual fee, but also matches your first-year earnings at the end of 12 months. So, in the categories where you already earn a cool 5% back, you’ll actually end up earning 10%! While all that’s great, you’ll ultimately want to make sure that the spending categories line up with your shopping habits. Keep in mind Discover isn’t accepted at as many places as Visa, so the Chase Freedom® may be the better choice for you. Read our full review of this card here.

Better yet, if you transfer your balance within the first 60 days, you won’t be charged a balance transfer fee. Since this card doesn’t charge an annual fee either, you can save a chunk of money on interest by transferring your balance without getting loaded down with charges. Keep in mind though, you can only transfer balances from a non-Chase card. Read our full review of this card here. Who Should Get the Chase Slate®: Anyone with high interest credit card debt People who don’t want to pay an annual fee Anyone who wants to avoid balance transfer fees How to Use It: Transfer your high interest balances within the first 60 days to avoid balance transfer fees. Pay down your debt as quickly as you can, preferably within the 15-month 0% introductory offer. Keep your card open to build credit. Best Balance Transfer Credit Card with Rewards Apply Now on Discover's secure website Discover it® Cashback Match™ Highlights While the Discover it® Cashback Match™ is known for its amazing cash back benefits, this card is equally good as a balance transfer card. Once you sign up, you’ll get a 0% introductory APR for a full 18 months. If you have high-interest credit card debt, getting a 0% introductory APR for 18 months can save you a bundle and help you get out of debt faster. On the downside, you will pay a 3% balance transfer fee on the amount you transfer over. As an added bonus, this card also offers 1% to 5% cash back on purchases and a 0% introductory APR on purchases for the first six months. Plus, you’ll never pay an annual fee.

Suggest a Card Here Did You Know? How to Make The Right Credit Card Work For You When used correctly, credit cards are powerful tools to help manage cash flow, and “earn” on your everyday spending. However, used improperly, credit cards can wreak havoc on your finances. Below are a few tips to make sure you get the most out of your credit card. Research your rewards program I can’t tell you how many times I have heard people complain about having trouble redeeming airline miles. The thing is, with a bit of research ahead of time, they would already know that airline miles are incredibly difficult to redeem, especially during peak travel times and within a few months of departure. This is where it pays to educate yourself. If you plan to sign up for a card that is tied to a specific program, such as an airline or hotel chain, you should first have an idea of what you would want to redeem your points for — and if it’s even possible. If you don’t want to be tied down to a specific rewards currency, you can also opt for a cash back card or one that offers flexible rewards. One good option is the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. Don’t Be Afraid to Get Multiple Cards A huge misconception in the world of credit cards is that it is bad for your credit to have more than one or two cards. Because a large percentage of your credit score is based on your balance-to-limit ratio, having a large credit limit spread over several cards and a zero balance can actually be better for your credit score than just having a few cards. Meanwhile, carrying more than one card can also help you leverage the different benefits and perks that different types of rewards cards have to offer. For example, you could get a hotel card for free hotel stays and a cash-back card to help you pay for the gas to get to your destination. Always treat your credit card like cash In order to maximize rewards without getting in trouble, you need to treat your credit card like cash. This means only spending amounts you have incoming each month, and not a penny more. The quickest way to enter the credit card downward spiral is to use a credit card to make a large purchase you cannot afford. If you don’t have the cash to pay for something, don’t use credit as an excuse to justify the purchase. Only charge what you can afford to pay off each month — period. Cash In on Hidden Benefits Although the best credit cards offer a slew of obvious benefits including cash back and travel rewards, many offer a handful of hidden perks that aren’t always advertised. You might have to dig deeper to find them, but these “extras” can truly come in handy. If used correctly, they can even help you save money, travel safer, and protect yourself from undue risk. Here are a few credit card benefits not everyone knows about, and some information on how each one works: Benefit #1: Zero Liability Although consumer liability for fraudulent purchases made on credit is limited to $50, the best cards take that protection a step further and offer zero liability for transactions you didn’t make. If your card is lost or stolen, or if a random charge appears on your bill, you won’t be liable if you report it immediately. Benefit #2: No Foreign Transaction Fees Many of the best credit cards on the market charge a foreign transaction fee equal to 3% of your purchase for charges made overseas. However, some waive this fee altogether — a feature that can help you save when you travel out of the country. Benefit #3: Rental Car Coverage If you rent cars frequently, you have probably already checked to make sure your personal auto policy provides this type of coverage. However, it’s also important to check with your credit card as well. While some cards only offer a secondary Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), others offer expensive primary auto rental coverage as a free perk to cardholders. Benefit #4: A Free FICO Score Although you can pay to get your FICO score at any time, several of the top rewards cards offer a free FICO score on your monthly statement or bill. This can save you the expense of paying to see your credit score, while also helping you monitor fluctuations in your score over time. Benefit #5: Emergency Travel Assistance If you find yourself in a bind, it is possible your card issuer could help. That’s because many of the best rewards cards offer emergency travel assistance for individuals traveling at least 100 miles from home. Perks include helping find lost luggage to booking alternative travel plans. Benefit #6: Free Travel Insurance Although benefits vary, several of the top rewards cards offer trip delay or trip cancellation insurance that will reimburse you if your itinerary is changed due to issues beyond your control. This type of insurance is most often used when a trip is canceled due to the unexpected death of a family member, an accident occurs, or a natural disaster puts travel plans on the back burner. Benefit #7: Extended Warranties Many of the top cards offer extended warranties that kick in if something goes wrong outside of a qualified item’s traditional one-year manufacturer’s warranty. Depending on the circumstances, this type of coverage usually reimburses you or sends you a replacement. Benefit #8: Price Protection Some cards offer price protection, which will pay you the difference on a large-ticket item if it goes on sale shortly after you purchase it. The most popular program is Citi’s Price Rewind. With Citi’s service, you will be automatically reimbursed for the price difference if any large item you buy and register is found at a lower price within 60 days. Benefit #9: Roadside Assistance If you have a credit card that offers roadside assistance and you experience a breakdown, all you need to do is call the number on the back of your card. You’ll be charged a flat fee depending on what type of service you require, but at least you won’t be left at the mercy of your local tow truck company. Benefit #10 Access to Cash While not common, some credit cards give you access to cash at the register similar to your debit card. For example, with Discover’s Cash Over program, you can request cash back at the register and avoid a trip to the ATM — and without paying any fees. This benefit is only available at participating stores. The Bottom Line The very best credit card for you depends on your circumstances, spending habits, and personal financial goals. While credit cards have gotten a bad rap over the years, their myriad benefits make them worth considering if you’re able to avoid the allure of overspending. If you’ve gotten this far, you’ve learned how to select a great card from thousands of possibilities. You have also learned some basics for using credit cards, seen some pitfalls to avoid, and have been exposed to many hidden benefits credit card pros have been exploiting for years. Now it’s up to you to use your card responsibly, and make sure your card is another tool in your financial tool belt. Loading Disqus Comments ...

Published Sep 6th, 2016 2:24 pm aric.mitchell@gmail.com / @tbarkansas Fort Smith Regional Airport enplanements were down for the first seven months of 2016 by close to 5% compared to the same period in 2015. But for Airport Director John Parker, the number is not yet cause for concern. Parker said the airport experiences “fluctuations on an annual basis and within the year, every year is different.” “You’ll have a strong spring the year before, then weaker numbers the following year during that same season and that will reflect as an early decline in numbers overall, whereas you might have a strong winter to bring you back to what you anticipated the year previous,” Parker told Talk Business & Politics. The airport’s enplanements were 49,801 for the first seven months of 2016, down 4.97% compared to the same period last year. July enplanements totaled 8,208, up 8.65% compared to July 2015. Enplanements totaled 86,704 in 2015, down 7.1% compared to 2014. The 2014 traffic was 92,869, the first time the airport had topped the 90,000 mark since 2007. Still, there is no sign at present, Parker said, of a downward trend starting to develop. “It’s hard to say what’s driving those numbers unless you have significant events. For example, you may have a very, very large Wal-Mart stockholders meeting, and that might drive XNA, but also our location. That was the case either last year or the year previous. We saw higher numbers. With the volume of people coming in, they used a number of airports around the region, and an event like that one could have seen traffic going into Tulsa or Springfield as well.” Parker added: “Our numbers are a little less than 5% (down) at this point, and that could be recovered very easily in the coming months. Being down now — we don’t know if that will be a continuing trend or a recovering trend since last month’s (July) enplanements were up. It may be up-trending by the end of the year.” Fort Smith Regional is the state’s third largest commercial airport behind Bill & Hillary Clinton National Airport and Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA). For the first seven months of 2016, Clinton National saw a 1.42% increase in traffic with 579,137 enplanements versus 571,002 during the same period in 2015. However, July numbers were down 4.03% with 92,447 enplanements versus 96,327 in July 2015. July enplanements at XNA totaled 63,463, up 1.36% compared to July 2015. Year-to-date, XNA reported 380,143, up just 0.75% compared to the same period in 2015. However, the 2015 enplanements set a new record at 647,530. XNA’s first full year of traffic was 1999, and the airport posted eight consecutive years of enplanement gains before seeing a decline in 2008. During the same period, Fort Smith went from 108,072 enplanements in 1999 to below 100,000 in 2001. In the 15 years since, 2005 was the only other year Fort Smith broke the six-figure barrier with 102,607 enplanements. Talk Business & Politics reached out to several travel agencies to get their take on the down numbers for Fort Smith, but in most cases, received no response. Carlson Wagonlit/DeramusTravel returned calls but declined comment.

He says they had no indication of a problem two days before the deadline on the project extension. “My reaction is we know we threw over $600,000 in the site we’ve been told all along they were going to build a store. We didn’t have any indication other than we are going to build a store. As for the next step, Pauley says, “We will now start what we are going to start figuring out what to do with the site and hopefully recruit someone else to be on the site.” ROCK ISLAND, Ill. (KWQC) – After years of work, it appears the development project to bring a new Walmart store has fallen apart. A news release was issued by the company Tues. Sept. 6, 2016 says “After much deliberation and consideration of various business factors, we have decided not to pursue development of a new store in Rock Island, IL at this time. The statement goes on to say, “We commend the visionary leadership of Mayor Pauley and the City Council and the work they have done to create a business friendly climate in Rock Island that encourages continued growth and investment in the city. We appreciate their support as we have worked through the conceptualization and complexities of a potential commercial development. We remain committed to serving our customers throughout the Quad Cities and look forward to continuing to innovate our services and invest in improving our existing stores throughout the region.” Stay tuned to KWQC-TV-6 and KWQC.com for reaction and further updates.

Donald L. Chrisman, 46, formerly of Niagara Falls and now living on Almay Road in Rochester, was charged with third-degree grand larceny, a felony, and official misconduct, a misdemeanor, according to the office of state Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott. Scott's office found that Chrisman made at least 249 unapproved personal transactions during the summer of 2015. The limo charges alone added up to more than $4,000, according to her office. Chrisman had worked for the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities as a peer advocate. He worked there from Aug. 7, 2003, to February 2016. As a peer advocate, his responsibilities included providing guidance to and advocating for people with developmental disabilities. He was assigned a state credit card for travel expenses as part of his work-related duties, according to Scott's office. Chrisman was arraigned in the town of Brighton Court and released. His next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 19.

David was born on Feb. 22, 1946, in Mount Moriah, Michigan to Hubert and Zelma Brown. He was the fifth child of nine. David graduated from Wahtonka High in The Dalles, Oregon in 1964 where he met the love of his life, Donna. He was a dedicated craftsman who worked with concrete in the construction industry from which he retired. He couldn’t stay busy being retired once he completed all of the upgrades to the inside and outside of his home (which included lots of concrete), so he went back to work part-time at Walmart in Tooele, Utah. David loved to go camping, fishing and bowling; he almost bowled that elusive 300 game on several occasions. He also enjoyed playing cards with his family and friends whenever possible. There weren’t too many people who could cook quite like him, and he liked to cook for family and friends. During the holiday season, he spent months every year preparing numerous types of candy, mostly chocolate for his loved ones (The Candyman can). He was preceded in death by his father Hubert, his mother Zelma and his brother Randall. He is survived by his loving wife of 52 years, Donna; his daughters Debbie (Louie) Morrow and Darsie (Tom) Pulliam; as well as nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He is also survived by four brothers, Ronnie Brown, Conrad Brown, Russell Brown and Stephen Brown; three sisters, Tessie Koester, Linda Brown and Betty Brown and numerous nieces and nephews. Because of his quick and contagious smile, the sparkle in his eyes, his quick wit and work ethic, most of the people he worked with over the years also became his extended family. There will be a gathering held on Sunday, Sept. 11, 2016 at the Vista House in Corbett, Oregon for all who want to attend.

It announced the closure late Friday afternoon and its last day in business was Monday. The greater Appleton area now has no dedicated self-serve frozen yogurt shops. This CherryBerry at 3525 E. Calumet St., in the strip mall west of Walmart, was the first fro-yo shop to open three years ago. At the peak of their popularity, there were two CherryBerry locations, Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt in Grand Chute and Forever Yogurt in the Fox River Mall. All are now gone.

The Oshkosh CherryBerry also closed Monday at 1810 Jackson St. Both locations had been owned by franchisee Jason Madsen, who did not return a call asking for comment. If you’re stuck with a plastic credit card-type CherryBerry gift card, it’s usable at other locations. See the list at cherryberryyogurtbar.com. The nearest one in Wisconsin is now in Beaver Dam.

Login Register Public Release: 6-Sep-2016 Consumers may search online for 30 days, but buy close to what they found on the first day Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences Share  Print  E-Mail CATONSVILLE, MD, September 6, 2016 - Given the ease of online search, consumers can explore and discover hundreds of available items in any category. Retailers and advertisers are keen to influence the search and final purchase through better product recommendations and targeted advertising. A forthcoming article in the INFORMS journal Marketing Science studies online search and purchase behavior of consumers in the digital camera category and finds that even though consumers may search for extended periods of time, what they purchase tends to be remarkably close to items they searched and found in their very first search. The study conducted by Bart Bronnenberg of Tilburg University, Jun Kim of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Carl Mela of Duke University combine detailed consumer online browsing and purchase data for digital cameras from the online measurement firm comScore, with scraped camera product pages from the three largest online retailers (Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart) to uncover a variety of insights about online consumer search behavior. From the browsing and purchase history of over two million consumers, they used a sample of more than 1,000 digital camera purchases with full browsing histories over a three-month period. "People differ in their search behavior a lot; some make up their mind right away but others search for long periods - often up to a month and review many products." said Mela. The study finds that about 25 percent of consumers search and purchase in just one online session, the average purchase takes much longer - around 15 days and over six sessions. The vast majority of purchases happen in under a month. Further, about 40 percent of consumers search only one brand and 20 percent only one model, while the average consumer will search about three brands and six models. For marketers, a long period of search can be a great opportunity to influence the exploration and discovery of new products during search and purchase. But as Bronnenberg notes, "What surprised us was that consumers don't explore anywhere close to full range of products and attributes in the category. The final product they purchase is very close in terms of the attributes to the products they discovered on the first day." This suggests that consumers have a rough idea of the quality and type of features they want as they begin search. The search helps them merely to refine the right combination of features within the narrow range of features of the products they found on the first day. On first glance, this finding might mean that retailers and advertisers can do little to influence the final purchase. But Kim cautions that would be the wrong conclusion. He notes, "In fact, the exact model with the right combination of features that the consumer will ultimately purchase can still be influenced up until the moment of purchase. The fact that what people buy is close to what they initially found means that ad targeting and product recommendations can use this information effectively and recommend close variants of what the consumer initially searched and found." Concludes Mela: "Overall, we think the whole exploration and discovery angle when searching for online purchases may be overstated," but then cautions that "it is also possible, that the limited exploration we find may be due to widespread availability of online reviews for digital cameras." Reviews may have informed the consumers exploration and discovery and the initial search outside of the search and purchase behavior that the study observes. Discovery may then be still important in categories where such reviews are less available. ### To cite this study: Bart J. Bronnenberg, Jun B. Kim, and Carl F. Mela (2016).

The roundabout was one of the options Arizona Department of Transportation had proposed for traffic control at the corner of Haul Road and Highway 89 when the Walmart Super Center was constructed just west of that intersection. Page Mayor Bill Diak recalled that the roundabout decision was made just prior to his election to City Council. While he wasn’t in favor of that option, he supported the decision of the Council and was involved in negotiations for right of ways at the intersection. Diak’s concerns prior to construction was the surprise factor of that particular intersection’s traffic control strategy. After travelling 140 miles from Flagstaff through remote areas, drivers might not be prepared for the lighting, signage, and lane configurations unlike anything else in this area. Diak was vocal about his concerns for driver safety at the intersection but ADOT had convincing statistics to back up the safety claims for a roundabout. The only surprise at the intersection has turned out to be how few accidents there has been. There have been a few low speed fender benders but no major medical issues for drivers or passengers in those few crashes. Because of the success of the roundabout at the intersection of Highway 89 and Haul Road, many residents are choosing that route because the traffic moves smoothly and there is little if any wait time to get on your way. The main concern continues to be the speed of approach for first time visitors and drivers of large trucks. Roundabouts may not be such an unusual traffic control device in the future as ADOT is considering adding more roundabouts in the next ten years at both the South and North intersections of Highway 89 and Lake Powell Boulevard. Drivers who have sat at those two intersections waiting to turn left would most likely want to see roundabouts there as soon as possible Tags Highway 89pageroundabouttraffic Current Articles Scroll Back To Top 2016 Cold Hard Holiday Cash Give Away NAU Basketball Plays Tonight in Tuba City Grand Canyon National Park Fire Managers Plan Fall Prescribed Burns on North Rim Kanab Jail Locked Down NGS Employees Donate to Thanksgiving Baskets Dedication of Little Colorado River Navajo Tribal Park Interpretive Site NEWS ARCHIVE Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 Recent News More Articles     2016 Cold Hard Holiday Cash Give Away Read Full Article NAU Basketball Plays Tonight in Tuba City 0 Grand Canyon National Park Fire Managers Plan Fall Prescribed Burns on North Rim 0 Kanab Jail Locked Down 0 NGS Employees Donate to Thanksgiving Baskets 0 Weather Forecast Freeze Warning Issued: 2:51 AM MST on November 18, 2016 Expires: 8:00 AM MST on November 18, 2016 Friday Clear High 49°/Low 32° 0% Saturday Clear High 53°/Low 39° 0% Sunday Partly Cloudy High 60°/Low 43° 0% Monday Chance of Rain High 53°/Low 40° 70% Home Lake Powell Communications Contact Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ © 2015 Copyright LAKE POWELL COMMUNICATIONS.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Eugene Volokh September 6 Follow @volokhc (Here is the latest edition of the Institute for Justice’s weekly Short Circuit newsletter, written by John Ross.) Thousands of Americans die needlessly each year because they cannot find a bone marrow donor, writes IJ’s Nick Sibilla. Click here to watch IJ’s award-winning short film on the need for compensation for donors. Oil companies that drill on Alaska’s North Slope transport their crude to market by means of a single pipeline. During the 800-mile journey, high-quality crude gets commingled with low-, so FERC calculates compensation for companies that receive lower-quality stuff than they put in. D.C. Circuit: Could be some companies are still getting shortchanged. FERC needs to change, or at least explain, its methodology. The United States was not at war with al-Qaeda in 2000, argues the alleged mastermind of the attack on the USS Cole. So does a military commission set up after 9/11 have the authority to put him on trial? We’ll not intervene, says the D.C. Circuit. Puerto Rican officials drastically raise corporate alternative-minimum tax. Walmart: In such a way as to apply only to us. Our tax liability would increase to 132 percent of our total annual income if this is enforced. First Circuit: The tax violates the dormant Commerce Clause. Resident complains to Quincy, Mass., police about an officer who angrily and mistakenly confronted her (while armed) about stolen property. The officer is suspended and ordered to stay away from the police station, but he shows up there just as she arrives to make a statement. He’s fired. First Circuit: Which was not unlawful retaliation for protected speech. New York City officials require cabs to be equipped with GPS so that regulators might detect overcharging. An unreasonable search? Second Circuit: The plaintiff doesn’t seem to own his cab, so he can’t bring suit. Dissent: The city never argued that. Moreover, the implied license taxi drivers extend to customers (and therefore also to regulators) to briefly occupy their cabs is plainly not an invitation to install surveillance equipment. EMT receives unsolicited phallus photo from a co-worker, reports him. He just happens to have printouts on hand of a fabricated text-message conversation indicating she welcomed such behavior. She’s fired for sexually harassing him. District court: The employer can’t be held liable for the actions of a low-level employee. Second Circuit: It can when the employer’s negligence gave effect to his nefarious intent. Electrical fire breaks out at Lower Merion Township, Pa., home as electricians repair faulty wiring. Yikes! Police file bogus arson charges against a former resident. District court: She was acquitted, so she can’t sue police for fabricating evidence. Third Circuit: Yes she can. Moreover, though she was never jailed, she was indeed “seized” (when fingerprinted, forced to post bond, and required to attend numerous pretrial proceedings on pain of arrest), so her malicious-prosecution claim was improperly dismissed. DHS officials decide that 28 women and their children (who entered the country illegally and were caught immediately) should be deported forthwith, as they aren’t likely to be tortured or face spousal abuse at home. Can the women seek review of those findings in an Article III court? The Third Circuit says no and, moreover, that the statute that mandates this result does not violate the Constitution. Advancing theories of fire that have been “unequivocally repudiated by rigorous scientific testing,” prosecutors obtain arson and murder convictions in 1986 against Ionia, Mich., man who lost his wife and daughters in a house fire. Released in 2012, can he sue officials involved in his prosecution? Sixth Circuit: But for the estate of one forensics worker, no. Allegation: Man makes to flee traffic stop (over a speeding violation); a Flint, Mich., officer runs in front of the car just as the man hits the gas. The officer shoots him dead through the driver’s-side window. Sixth Circuit: The officer is not entitled to qualified immunity (just yet). Indiana officials revoke child-care provider’s registration. Provider: We committed none of the violations alleged. We’d like to appeal. Officials: Because you are merely registered with the state (as opposed to licensed), there is no administrative-appeals process. District court: Which deprived the provider of due process. Seventh Circuit: Which was a clearly established right, so the officials can be sued in their individual capacities. There may have been something untoward about Minnesota law-enforcement officials repeatedly accessing the state’s driver’s license database for a glimpse of two local media personalities’, a former Minneapolis officer’s, and a reality-TV contestant’s personal information, says the Eighth Circuit. Numerous other plaintiffs, including media members, political activists, former police officers (and their spouses) and a beauty pageant contestant, all failed to make such a showing, however. Defense attorney convicted of money laundering for knowingly accepting stolen money from a client and disbursing some of it back to said client. Yikes! A prosecution witness who is both a paid informant and receiving leniency on his own charges in exchange for his testimony lied to the grand jury about these facts, and prosecutors did not correct the record. (The jury at trial did know said facts). Ninth Circuit: No reversible error. Conviction affirmed. Nevada medical-marijuana permit holder tries to buy gun, is rebuffed. Federal law prohibits the sale of guns to “unlawful drug users,” and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says even state-approved marijuana use counts. Ninth Circuit: The government didn’t put forth any evidence that medical-marijuana patients are especially prone to gun violence, but there was no need to under intermediate scrutiny. No Second Amendment violation here. Federal parolee kidnaps 11-year-old, keeps her captive for 18 years. Can she sue the feds for negligently supervising the parolee, who committed numerous parole violations before the kidnapping? Sadly not, says the majority of a Ninth Circuit panel. Officials could not have known the parolee would target her specifically and so owed her no special duty of care. After customers who have purchased an unlimited-data plan have used a certain amount of data each month, AT&T drastically slows down the speed of their service. FTC: And didn’t adequately inform customers of the fact. Ninth Circuit: The agency lacks the statutory authority to get involved. Federal officials seize $800,000 from U.S. bank accounts controlled by Mexican businessmen suspected of (but not charged with) laundering drug money. Ninth Circuit: The men have standing, at least for the time being, to challenge the forfeiture. New Mexico legislators abolished civil forfeiture last year, requiring law-enforcement officials to secure a criminal conviction before taking people’s property (and prohibiting them from padding their budgets with the proceeds). How did Albuquerque officials (who seized 1 vehicle for every 66 residents over a recent five-year period) respond? By announcing plans to buy an even larger parking lot for seized vehicles — paid for with revenues from property forfeited from people such as IJ client Arlene Harjo, whom the city has not accused of committing any crime. Can Albuquerque officials continue to both ignore state law and flout the U.S. Constitution? Not by the hair of our majestically bearded litigators’ chins.

Columbia County sheriff’s deputies were called to the Evans Wal-Mart about 5 p.m. Tuesday after a shopper noticed a small child sleeping in a vehicle. The car was not running and the windows were cracked, according to an incident report. A deputy noted that the child appeared to be in good health and the temperature was in the low 80s. The officer stated in the report he could not tell if the child was sweating. When the child woke, he told police he was unsure how long he had been alone. The child’s grandfather, Mohamed Maged Mohamed, 67, told police he allowed the child to stay in the car because he was sleeping. He stated he had been in the store about 10 minutes. Mohamed was not arrested at the time. An arrest warrant was issued after the deputy consulted with a judge. The Department of Family and Children Services was also notified of the incident. Mohamed was booked Wednesday into the Columbia County Detention Center on a charge of willfully commits or fails to act causing minor to be deprived.

By Elizabeth Foster September 6, 2016 Num Noms—MGA Entertainment’s take on the collectibles craze—is expanding its scent beyond the toy aisle and into ancillary products. The food-based miniature characters are shaped and scented like sweet or salty treats, with soft and hollow Nums stacking on top of hard-shelled Noms, which are either motorized to scoot around or filled with flavored lip gloss. Nums and Noms can be mixed and matched to create thousands of fragrance fusions like Raspberry Cream-Banana Go-Go or Peachy Choco Gloss. Targeting girls five to nine, Num Noms launched at Toys “R” Us last December with mystery packs, starter packs and playsets (SRP US$3.99 to $32.99), and moved to full global distribution earlier this year. Its retailers now include Target, Walmart, Kmart and Amazon—as well as mid-tier and specialty chains. Juli Boylan, MGA global head of licensing, is now building out the property and says the “delicious” nature of the brand will continue to provide a unique point of difference as MGA continues to expand Num Nom’s reach, appeal and licensing opportunities with each new series of characters. Boylan and her team have already gotten things underway, recently appointing key category licensees for the US including Canal Toys (craft/activity), Sky High (back-to-school), E.S. Originals (footwear), MZ Berger (home decor), Party Holdings/City (party goods), Ceaco Inc. (puzzles) and Palamon International (seasonal). These new licensees join existing partners like Komar Kids (sleepwear), HER Accessories (accessories), Thermos LLC (lunch kits), My Favorite Company (confections) and Franco Manufacturing (bedding). Accordingly, Num Noms-branded apparel, sleepwear and accessories will be available Stateside in Q4, with a second wave planned for spring 2017 and a full launch for all categories in fall 2017. Worldwide, Num Noms has more than 40 licensing partners, but Boylan is still on the hunt for licensees in ancillary categories like sporting and home goods. And as she searches for new partners, Boylan says the L.A.-based toyco will seek to maintain the property’s strong aesthetic in all licensed products. “One of the things that MGA is known for is our packaging. Not only do Num Noms come in yogurt cups, but they’re displayed in stores in a tray that looks like a yogurt truck,” notes Boylan. “We’ve got stories of people buying the entire truck displays—and we’ve even heard stories of people literally stealing them.” TAGS:MGA Entertainment, Num Noms, Toys 'R' Us About The Author Elizabeth Foster is Kidscreen's Senior Writer.

Boutique options often feel out of our price range and, in my experience, sometimes feel like one trick ponies. I am partnering up with a local business, Ali on the Boulevard, to showcase items that you can get LOTS of wear out of and the highest priced item is just $38, keeping you right within your budget. Once you see all the ways that you can style these, I know that you will see how versatile they are for your wardrobe and the diversity in these pieces. All items are available for shipping to you and online so you can take advantage of these pieces no matter where you live. Let’s get started! wrap dress, (ali on the boulevard), nude heels (similar, target), burgundy bubble necklace (similar, kohls), faux tan legs (amazon), bralette (ali on the boulevard) Wrap Dress Style #1 If you are looking for an alternative to your little black dress, I found this gray heathered wrap dress (did you see she named it after me- awww!!)  in an a-line cut that makes a great substitute. Wrap dresses, as long as I have been around, never go out of style and are a fun piece to accessorize with. The material is very soft and feels like a nightgown. I am wearing a Small and I find this to just fit. I would size up one in this one! Ali advised wearing this with a bralette. You know that I have preached and preached that Coobi bras are the next best thing to sliced bread, but I did hear from you that some of you can’t pull it off without support (LUCKY DUCKS!). Her shop offers bralettes that are not padded and can be worn with your regular bra, offering the support you need, without the bulk, seam, or annoying roll-up of a cami. Cami rolls are the worst. This first look is a great look for a nice dinner out or for church! wrap dress, (ali on the boulevard), flannel shirt (similar, j. crew), tassel booties- your feet will say thank you over and over again (tom’s), zodiac necklace (ali on the boulevard) Wrap Dress Style #2 Here is the same dress, but now I am wearing it like a skirt, a trick anyone with a capsule wardrobe is doing on repeat in their wardrobe! I tucked the tie inside the shirt and tied the hem of my flannel shirt. I am wearing a J. Crew factory flannel in an XS and I can’t rave enough on how well this washes and the fit on this shirt. You will get lots of wear out of that piece too!  This didn’t need a lot of accessorizing so I went with a small zodiac necklace from the shop. You can see a close-up on my IG feed. wrap dress, (ali on the boulevard), mustard cardigan- (h&m), burgundy tights (target), tan boots (thredup) Wrap Dress Style #3 Dresses can still look cozy especially when paired with a longer cardigan, boots, and tights. I tied the tie towards the back so you wouldn’t have it hanging out in the front. This is a great look to look dressier, but still super comfy for your day. If you haven’t discovered fleece tights, get some for winter. You can find them even at Walmart now! wrap dress, (ali on the boulevard), burgundy cardigan- (h&m), burgundy tights (target), tan boots (thredup), gray & white rose patterned scarf- check out her scarf collection (ali on the boulevard),  belt (similar, target) Wrap Dress Styling #4 Indiana can get chilly so I do a lot of scarves and sweater layerings to fight off the cold. This time I am just doing tone on tone. Gray dress, gray scarf, burgundy cardigan, burgundy tights. Adding a belt makes this feel more like a skirt again! wrap dress, (ali on the boulevard), jean vest (thredup- here is a similar one on budget) , burgundy tights (target), tan boots (thredup), pearls (similar, target) Wrap Dress Styling #5 Jean vests are such a versatile piece so I am excited to add that to the capsule this year. A bib necklace of pearls adds a feminine touch to the denim and, once again, it’s all layered over that basic wrap dress! Here is a side-by-side shot if you prefer pinning that way! Can you believe that is the same wrap dress? rust sweater- olive in stock and rust returning!! (ali on the boulevard), black pants with zipper detail (ali on the boulevard), long & short necklaces (ali on the boulevard),  world’s comfiest leopard flats (Amazon), bralette (ali on the boulevard) Oversized Sweater Styling #1 Ponchos and capes are so fun, but can be a PAIN to stay on and the fabric can be a lot to maneuver on a petite frame. I find the ones without arm holes to be distracting and the ones with arm holes to limit my range of motion. I also hate doing chores around the house with a lot of fabric on me. I am PARTICULAR.  This sweater has the shape of a cape, but is a sweater with sleeves. Ali has these in a few color options for you. I am wearing the Rust colored one and a size Small. This fits true to size! In this styling I am pairing these very simply with a basic black pant, leopard slip-ons, and a long & short simple necklace. rust sweater (ali on the boulevard), black pants with zipper detail (ali on the boulevard), long & short necklaces and bracelet- shop the collection (ali on the boulevard),  world’s comfiest leopard flats (Amazon), belt (similar, target), bralette (ali on the boulevard) Oversized Sweater Styling #2 I prefer a cinched waist so this is the same styling, just with a belt. I think it gives it a totally different look without a lot of style switches. rust sweater (ali on the boulevard), black pants with zipper detail (ali on the boulevard), world’s comfiest black flats (Amazon), mustard scarf (anthro from thredup, linking to similar) mustard belt (j. crew from thredup, linking to similar) Oversized Sweater Styling #2 I like color so I have lots of colored belts and scarves to dress up my wardrobe basics. Adding a colored belt and scarf makes this sweater feel like a different piece. You could also chose just one or the other instead of layering on both! rust sweater (ali on the boulevard), black pants with zipper detail (ali on the boulevard), black bralette (ali on the boulevard), tan boots (thredup), mint statement necklace (similar), bralette (ali on the boulevard) Oversized Sweater Styling #3 You know when you see pictures of women wearing capes and gazing at their cell phones while holding tiny dogs in their purses? I feel like this is tiny dog in a purse style and I don’t even like dogs. #teamcats!! You can pick a statement necklace in any color and make this look a little different. The best part is how comfy this is while still looking polished. Here is a side-by-side shot if you prefer pinning that way! I LOVE this piece! textured printed t-shirt (ali on the boulevard),  Just Black black jeans (Stitch Fix), Moccasins (Kenneth Cole, Stitch Fix).  chevron necklace (francesca’s) Plain tees can get a little boring so I was excited to find this t-shirt because the cut is really flattering (and comes in a curvy size too for my curvier friends-holla!). The best part about  this piece is that the front is as cute as the back. This shirt runs true to size and I am wearing a small! Hard to show you the back so this is the best I could pull off, but you can see it MUCH better on her site. Isn’t that cute? T-Shirt Styling #1 This is a great mom uniform- a cute t-shirt, black jeans, and suede moccasins. I am still madly in love with my chevron necklace and this looks great with this shirt. This is a great outfit for running my kids back and forth to activities. textured printed t-shirt (ali on the boulevard), suede booties(similar,old navy), rose jeans (similar, 6PM), jeweled statement necklace (similar, romwe) T-Shirt Styling #2 Colored jeans can be fun and I love pairing this with my rose jeans. Suede booties and a statement necklace in similar tones completes this look and makes it a fun one to go out on the town with! textured printed t-shirt (ali on the boulevard), black pants with zipper detail (ali on the boulevard),  Madden Girl Open Toe Booties (similar, Macy’s), mustard tassel clutch (similar, cotton on), fringe necklace (WALMART!!, but linking to similar) T-Shirt Styling #3 Tees don’t always feel like great going out choices, but I have found with the right accessories, they can feel quite dressy. This bib necklace made of fringe was a $4 find from Walmart that I still love. Paired with black pants, booties, and a bright clutch, this would make the perfect sushi date outfit with my hubby! textured printed t-shirt (ali on the boulevard), black pants with zipper detail (ali on the boulevard), black cardigan (h&m), tan boots (thredup), red skinny belt (target), pearl necklace (ali on the boulevard) T-Shirt Styling #4 I feel like I could style this shirt and pants the very next day and no one would even know this was the same shirt and pants! Layering a neutral cardigan over it and cinching the tee waist with a skinny belt adds a totally different look. It hides the pattern, making this feel like a different piece. Here is another side by side for you! I love the versatility of this piece! You may not have noticed that these pants are on repeat too. Did you catch that? If you are looking for something that fits like a legging, but offers support and doesn’t pill, these are an EXCELLENT option.  On me, they sit above the belly button and are full length. For taller girls, this might have a cropped affect (LUCKY LADIES!!).  The shot all the way to the right is how I folded them inside themselves so they would look more cropped. My favorite part is the zippered detail on the side. How cute is that? These fit true to size and have faux pockets on the back that make them look like a pant (without the bulk of a pocket), but offer an elastic waistband. I know I will be wearing these all the time and I am told that they wash like a dream. I still would wear something with full butt coverage over them, personally (elderly hipster!), but I like that they look like a structured traditional pant instead of tights. You might be surprised to know that I wear my sneakers A LOT. These pants pair perfectly with sneakers. My favorite classic New Balance  sneakers are always in rotation, but I know those can be a little pricey. Ali actually sells these adorable sneakers for $26 (!!!), that look so stylish and are surprisingly comfortable. I have a wide foot and this is wide enough for my block feet. These only come in whole sizes. I teeter between a 7 and a 7.5, but the 7’s still had plenty of toe room for me! There was no need to break these in- I never had a blister. You can’t beat that price for an attractive street sneaker. I can’t wait to hear what you think of these looks AND I hope you can help me support a small business owner. This is a great opportunity to help a woman owned business succeed & stock smart basics in your capsule! This post contains affiliate links. I only recommend what I love- promise!! Your purchases help sustain this site so THANK YOU!! Ali & I are working on a partnership to offer our readers affordable clothing options for your capsule wardrobe needs.

However, if you want to excel in customer experience you must help people do what they want as quickly as possible. For every second faster Walmart.com has been able to make its pages load, it has had a 2 percent lift in conversions. Firefox reduced its page load time by 2.2 seconds and had 10 million extra downloads as a result. The Financial Times found that a one second delay in page downloads caused a 4.9 percent drop in the number of articles read. A three second delay caused a 7.2 percent drop. An Alexa study found that the top 10 sites on the web are significantly lighter than other sites. The study showed that while page size for the top sites rose until 2014, after that the size began to drop substantially, as the page size for other sites continued to quickly grow. When GQ magazine reduced its page load time from seven to one and a half seconds, unique visitors rose from 6 million to 11 million in one month. A 2015 study by Radware stated that “a site that loads in 3 seconds experiences 22 percent fewer page views, a 50 percent higher bounce rate, and a 22 percent fewer conversions than a site that loads in 1 second, while a site that loads in 5 seconds experiences 35 percent fewer page views, a 105 percent higher bounce rate, and 38 percent fewer conversions.”  Google discovered that even a 400 millisecond delay could result in 8 million less searches per day. Amazon found that a page load slowdown of just one second could cost it $1.6 billion in lost sales each year. Etsy found that an additional 160 kilobytes added to a page resulted in a 12 percent increase in bounce rate on mobile. Almost half of respondents to a 2015 Google survey said their top frustration was waiting for slow pages to load. Slow pages was way ahead of any other issue.  Online shoppers expected pages to load in two seconds — and at three seconds, a large number abandon the site, the New York Times reported in 2012. The same report noted people will visit a web site less often if it’s slower than a close competitor by more than a quarter of a second. Helping people complete tasks gets you onto the pitch. It allows you to play the game. But if you want a chance of winning you must focus relentlessly on speed.  Of course, it’s not simply about how fast your pages download. Your content must be optimized for speed by making it as simple and as fast to read as possible. You must remove all distractions whether they be unnecessary links or graphics or fields in a form. You must constantly simplify your processes. How can you bring it down from a five step application process to a four step one? Making it faster and simpler for the customer should be the number one conversation on Monday morning. Speed should drive the agenda. In digital, speed is the customer experience.

Unified teachers, speaks during a rally in February. Kyle Stokes/KPCC Audio from this story 0:55 Listen Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Leaders of California's largest teachers union have launched a new ad campaign, but this time they're not battling for hearts and minds on school policy. They're competing against charter school advocates to get politicians elected to office — with some schoolyard name calling. In the months leading up to the June primary, the two largest charter school groups spent more than $10.4 million in "independent expenditures" on fourteen races — the most they have spent in this type of political influence in any election cycle since at least 2002. The spending was an overt strategy to influence primary races.  And it was aided by several major donors, including philanthropist Eli Broad who gave more than $1 million dollars. Among the other wealthy donors are Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Wal-Mart heirs Alice, Jim and Carrie Walton. The ad campaign the union launched in response last week, dubbed "Kids Not Profits," denounces these contributions; one radio spot claims rich donors are "paying to push their agenda on the rest of us." "These are very deep pockets," California Teachers Association president Eric Heins said. The union has only spent $236,000 so far this election season, on two state legislative races, according to data from the Secretary of State's office. But charter advocates said unions are being hypocritical. "They have historically, significantly outspent what you have seen us spending thus far in this cycle, for example," said Gary Borden, executive director of the California Charter Schools Association's political arm, CCSA Advocates. "The notion that [the unions] don’t have the capacity to spend significantly in these races is, I think, certainly a fallacy." The teacher's union is certainly a juggernaut in Sacramento politics, commonly ranking among the biggest campaign donors. But there's conflicting evidence about whether charter school backers have mustered the money to unseat CTA from this perch. The union is right that charter groups have spent more in 2016 on independent expenditures — that is, spending on a race by an outside group that isn't coordinated with the affected candidates. It is also true that the union has donated much more in direct contributions to candidates and causes than charter school advocates have. The two most active pro-charter groups, EdVoice and CCSA Advocates, have together given around $475,000 in direct contributions to candidates, campaigns or other political action committees this year. The CTA has contributed around $1.6 million in direct contributions in 2016. Its smaller counterpart, the California Federation of Teachers, has made around $880,000 in contributions. In 2013 and 2014, the two teachers unions contributed more than $21.7 million to campaigns. They also spent $7.5 million in 2014 through an independent expenditure committee the CTA set up specifically to support their favored candidate for state schools superintendent, Tom Torlakson. Borden said CCSA Advocates made a strategic decision to spend heavily during the primary races — especially in state legislative campaigns — because they feared a high-profile presidential contest and other statewide races will drown out local races in the general. Charter groups spent big during primary races in hopes they'd be more effective in raising their favored candidates' name recognition, Borden said. The impact of this strategy on the independent expenditure numbers, though, has been stark. As KPCC reported in June, spending by one pro-charter school group accounted for more than 70 percent of the outside money spent in the contest between Glendale Democrats Ardy Kassakhian and Laura Friedman, both hoping to win the 43rd District seat in the California State Assembly. Both charter and union backers want allies in elected office, particularly in Sacramento, where they're battling over a number of different policies: how many years teachers must spend in the classroom before receiving "tenure" protections, for instance; or whether to more tightly regulate charter schools' admission practices. The battles closer to home continue as well. Two members of the L.A. school board are up for re-election in March 2017. Board president Steve Zimmer, historically a favorite of teachers union leaders, faces a steep challenge from Nick Melvoin, who has already raised more than $124,000 — including $1,100 from charter supporter Eli Broad. Zimmer has raised around $7,300. Mónica García, who has received $2,200 from Broad and his wife Edythe, also enjoys a wide fundraising lead over her charter-opposed challenger, Carl Petersen. But it's still early and the teachers union's ability to mobilize the vote is priceless. Like the state union, United Teachers Los Angeles, which represents L.A. Unified teachers, recently launched a "public awareness campaign," featuring images of smiling teachers on more than 100 billboards and bus bench ads. Politically, UTLA sees the campaign as part of the "long game," said the union's secretary, Daniel Barnhart. He said the ads are a response to the same concern the CTA mentions: the growth of charter schools backed by for-profit operators or wealthy political donors. "We want to raise awareness about the need to support public schools and also to kind of reclaim the narrative. The notion of what it means to be ‘public' has been diluted a little bit," Barnhart said, referring to the union argument that charters siphon public funding away from school districts while being held to different regulatory standards. "We run the risk of diluting what it means to be a public school or to be in support of public education." The best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.

WASHINGTON (TNS) — For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the 2007-09 recession has arrived every week or two for years — in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has limited economic recovery, with many workers getting few if any raises. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurring solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures, amplified by laws providing minimum-wage increases in California, New York and elsewhere, also are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonald’s and JPMorgan Chase increased what they pay their lowest-level employees. “A pay increase is the right thing to do,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently in announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers, customer service representatives and other employees to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the current $10.15. “Wages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,” he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated from the presidential campaigns of Republicans and Democrats. When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available, from $57,724 in 2000. “Household incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,” Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. “Think of it … you’re making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.” Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is the loss of bargaining power caused by a drop in the share of private-sector unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. As a result, the share of money flowing into households from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest and dividends, according to a study last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes, further stifling overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth, job openings are near record levels. That’s forced employers to raise pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall — they reached a seven-year high of 2.7 percent year-over-year in July — an improvement from the tepid 2 percent during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1 percent, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workers’ purchasing power. In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce. From 2010 to 2013, new jobs that paid between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions, according to research released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs in fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. Some states and localities have tried to accelerate wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasn’t budged since 2009. In April, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hour by 2022. Also in April, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region — faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas — and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. As the states with the nation’s largest and third-largest populations moved to increase their minimum wages, large companies realized that they’d soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. “We certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country,” McDonald’s chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan said during an earnings call in July “It has, from a purely business standpoint, created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. “A lot of companies … were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,” she said. Early last year, Wal-Mart became the first major employer to announce raises for its lowest-paid workers. It now pays them at least $10 an hour once they finish the company’s training program. Wal-Mart is spending $2.7 billion over two years to increase pay, bringing the average full-time hourly rate for its workers to $13.38. Brett Biggs, the company’s chief financial officer, predicted the investment “will pay off long-term.” “Whether it’s lower attrition rates in the stores, better motivated associates, we think we’ll see the benefits from that,” he told an investor conference in June. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz cited similar reasons after announcing this summer that the company would raise base pay for its workers by at least 5 percent in October. The company’s baristas earn an average of about $9.40 an hour, according to Glassdoor. “What we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice,” Schultz told analysts on an earnings call in July. After saying last year that he opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage, Trump this summer said he thought it should be raised to at least $10. The Democratic Party’s official platform calls for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. “Raising the federal minimum wage won’t just put more money in the pockets of low-income families, it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods,” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told a Michigan crowd last month. “We need to get incomes and wages rising, and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer.” Tags Wage Worker Employee Company Gain Minimum Wage Job MARC WEHRS Follow MARC WEHRS Close Get email notifications on MARC WEHRS daily!

Liquid Blue will purchase and move its operation into the empty Sanmina Building at 6 Linlew Drive, bringing a business that could employ up to 125 workers and creating licensed apparel for both Major League Baseball, National Football League and entertainment icons like Jerry Garcia, AC/DC, and also provide products for major retailers like Walmart, Kohls and Target. The company hopes to close on the Sanmina building next month and will move its operation from Rhode Island to Derry soon after. Company officials attended the Economic Development Advisory Committee meeting Aug. 15 to give a presentation on the Liquid Blue move to Derry. At that meeting, company consultant Gary Piontkowski said Liquid Blue had found a perfect new home. The company has been in business about 30 years, he said, and 62 properties in New Hampshire were considered for a new facility. After narrowing the list down to two communities — Dover and Derry — Derry took the prize and the project. "It's a successful fit for what we want to do," Piontkowski said.. Piontkowski noted that company founder Paul Roidoulis began the company simply by making tie-dye shirts and selling them at concerts. Grateful Dead star Jerry Garcia forged an eventual relationship with the businessman to start making shirts for concerts. The tie-dye products led into other types of apparel and screen-printed designs, Piontkowski said. In an email sent to Derry Planning Director George Sioras, Piontkowski said Liquid Blue was happy to be coming to Derry. "I hope we can be a good neighbor/partner and will look to you to give us the guidance to become a valuable asset to the city and the business community," he wrote. Sioras said he is very excited about Liquid Blue's move to Derry, saying it's good news for the town. "We will be meeting with them over the next couple of months to begin our Technical Review Committee meetings with staff," he wrote in an email. "We are very excited they are coming to Derry." Liquid Blue gross sales per year are approximately $14 million. The company hopes to begin hiring workers by the end of the year. We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

Letters to the editor: Preserve local small businesses Letters to the editor 7:02 a.m. EDT September 6, 2016 Editorial cartoon (Photo: Lisa Benson) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE EDITOR'S NOTE: The News Journal will not publish election-related op-ed submissions or letters to the editor from Sept. 6-13. Preserve local small businesses It was with great empathy that we read the article about Jim and Janet Smyth, who had to close their hardware store in Middletown for economic reasons. We too own a small business (Ninth Street Book Shop). We’ve operated in downtown Wilmington for over 40 years and we’ve been struggling to stay open. Although fortunate to have a core of exceptionally loyal customers, we ruefully say that we’re also “the bookstore of last resort” when people can’t find a book at the big chain stores or the online shipping charge outweighs the cost of the item. We can’t match the deeply discounted prices on bestsellers from Walmart, Costco, Amazon or other corporate stores, but we do provide the intangible and very valued benefits of a knowledgeable staff, personalized service and community involvement. Please consider making the conscious choice of dealing with small, locally owned businesses as often as possible because some things are worth the effort to support and preserve. And they aren’t fully appreciated until they’re gone. Jack and Gemma Buckley Wilmington Animal cruelty a symptom The headline about a cat killer in Delaware brings back memories from my lesson plan on child abuse and the link to serial killers. Adult serial killers often have early developmental clues …. "animal cruelty, fire setting, bed wetting and being badly abused when they were children." Get alert, Delaware and take this animal cruelty/abuse characteristic as a red flag when you see it in others! Irene Talley Wilmington DELAWAREONLINE Keep death penalty for mass murderers, cop killers DELAWAREONLINE Our thumbs up, thumbs down for the week Bat deaths excuse to slam wind energy I was struck by the juxtaposition in the Aug. 29 letters to the editor of the cartoon depicting the cognitive dissonance of a climate change denier faced with the string of record-breaking climate events this summer and the letter decrying the death of bats by wind turbine. The letter writer exhorts readers to “ask the environmentalists” where they stand on wind power given this deadly toll. I can’t speak for all environmentalists, but my answer is that the toll on bat populations (and birds and many other species, not to mention human beings) from unchecked climate change will far exceed any number of bat casualties from wind turbines. We can make turbine technology safer for bats and birds, but there is only one way to prevent catastrophic climate change at this point and that is to make the transition to renewable energy as quickly as possible. And if it takes government subsidies to wind and solar power to make that happen, I’m all for it. The fossil fuel industries have already benefited from such subsidies for far too long. Beth Chajes Newark Reform Delaware bus driver rules If Delaware would go back to the traditional school bus licenses, many dependable trustworthy individuals and retirees would step up to the plate and drive. I personally think it's crazy to have to be tested as if you're driving a tractor-trailer. The contractors have maintenance people to take care of the buses as well as direct contact with their drivers during their routes. It's the driver's job to make sure of the safety and getting the children to school on time. It's time to look at the big picture and get some truly dependable drivers back on the road, make it a little less complicated to get your "school bus driver license in Delaware" again and see what happens. If one can drive an RV, one can drive a bus. Marjorie Hitchens Middletown Opposed to Woodlawn sale Harry Themal endorsed the sale of 41 acres on the corner of route 202 and Naamans Road by Woodlawn Trustees, "It’s the best use of land waiting to be developed." The best use of that land is what it is now – a cornfield. Is it waiting to be developed because it is undeveloped? Woodlawn Trustees mission statement calls for protecting the Brandywine Valley, not selling it off piece by piece. They should be ashamed. County Council is also complicit in this travesty for granting a "waiver." Staggered starting times, more turn lanes, car pooling, please. I'm sorry, Harry, but you're wrong on this one. William Vaughan Greenville Safely keeping nuclear codes? According to a political TV commercial, Hillary is worried about Trump getting the nuclear codes.

According to court documents, BFS employees called police after they received a counterfeit $50 bill from Hyde.  They didn't realize the bill was counterfeit until Hyde had already left the store, police said. Police later found Hyde at Walmart and found two $5 bills and four $50 bills inside of his wallet.  After searching the vehicle Hyde was in, police found a bundle of white, blank paper, a white trash bag containing counterfeit bills that had not been cut, an empty ink cartridge box, a counterfeit detector pen, and another counterfeit $50 bill. Police also found a real $50 bill that had the same serial number as the counterfeit bills. Hyde is also accused of passing a counterfeit $100 bill at Circle K on July 31, passing a counterfeit $100 bill at Hardees on August 1, and attempting to pass a counterfeit $100 bill at the Kompak Store on August 15.  He is charged with three counts of counterfeiting. Hyde is also charged with possession of counterfeit money with intent to deliver.  Hyde is currently in the North Central Regional Jail.

Like, say, the 21-year Rubik's Cube we fiddled with trying to bring the NFL back to the second-biggest market after sitting vacant since 1994. A riddle finally solved by a billionaire from Missouri, and 300 acres of open land in Inglewood he swooped in and purchased two years ago. But more on Stan Kroenke in a bit. In a city where thousands of movie scripts sit stacked on top of one another either unworthy or unable to reach theaters, who knows better than L.A. how difficult it is to harness all the critical dynamics at the exact right time to turn written word into big-screen consumption? To get a major motion picture made, you need a good script, financing and a big-name star all joining hands at the same time. Nothing less gets it done. And if you have one or two without the others, it's just a pipe dream. But when all three come together at the same time, you have a chance to make some history. Which brings us back to L.A.'s two-decade long quest to get the NFL back. Time after time in the years after the Rams and Raiders left L.A., stadium deals would spring to life or grand schemes would be hatched or a team here or there would kick the tires on relocating to Los Angeles. Nothing ever came to fruition because, like getting a movie made, bringing the NFL back required three essential components all coming together at the exact same time: Land. Financing. A commitment from a team. Just ask Farmers Field, or the stadium project in the City of Industry, how elusive that undertaking can be. Both projects had financing and land. Neither had the team. So, no dice. Enter St. Louis Rams owner and multi-billionaire Enos Stanley “Stan” Kroenke, who had the financial might, a ticket out of St. Louis, the gumption to see around corners and the necessary land to finally solve L.A.’s NFL riddle. Oh, and a bold plan to build an 8.5 million-square-foot state-of-the-art stadium to anchor a 300-acre entertainment, retail and office development on the former site of the Hollywood Park race track. Kroenke, who is married to Walmart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke, dazzled fellow owners with his Disneyland-meets-the-NFL entertainment hub in Inglewood and his financial wherewithal to convince them to grant him his wish to move the Rams back to Los Angeles from St. Louis. It was that vision – along with his deep pockets – that convinced them the time wasn't just right to get back to L.A., but that he was the man to make it happen. “A great idea without the right owner was never going to get it,” said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. “And of course, here comes Stan Kroenke walking though that door with a great relationship with Inglewood and a great plan. And when he presented that to the NFL, I’ll tell you, it immediately felt like something had been sent to us from above, as far as the NFL was concerned.” And why not? Kroenke is worth an estimated $8 billion – combined with his wife they are worth more than $15 billion – and oversees a sports empire that includes English soccer club Arsenal, the NBA’s Denver Nuggets, the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and MLS’ Colorado Rapids. His real estate empire stretches across 30 million square feet and includes shopping malls throughout the United States and ranches in Montana, Wyoming, Texas and Canada. His most recent major purchase came in Texas when he bought the 800-square mile Waggoner Ranch for $725 million. That's the kind of clout the NFL wanted back in Los Angeles. Jones was a long-time proponent of the NFL returning to L.A., but understood if the league was going to go back it had to do it right. “My concern has always been, relative to the NFL and Los Angeles, is that we had the right man, the right owner,” Jones said. “One of the biggest concerns that, on a personal level, as much as I’ve been involved in the NFL, my background in the NFL and as much as we all knew that Los Angeles needed to have an NFL team, the biggest concern was we had to have the right man leading the way. The right owner.” An athletic Missouri native described by friends and associates as deeply competitive, Kroenke made a convincing case during a process that began in 2013, when he purchased a 60-acre parcel of land across the street from the Forum on the land of the old Hollywood Park site. A year later, Kroenke took control of all 298 acres, with the intent to build a stadium. Kroenke fell in love with the possibilities upon stepping foot on the available land two years before. “This was pretty amazing to a guy like me, to see something sitting here like this – 300 acres. That’s bigger than Century City,” Kroenke said. “You can do things here, as a developer like me – you can do scale, you can do things that are exciting, and you can combine it with sports. “To me, there was no doubt this was the perfect site.” Kroenke relentlessly pursued his quest over the next 12 months, building a case for relocation even while St. Louis scrambled to provide $400 million in public assistance for a new riverfront stadium. In the process, he beat out a competing bid by the the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers, who had teamed on a proposal to build a stadium in Carson. All of which culminated in a 30-2 vote last January in Houston by fellow owners to green-light the Rams back to Los Angeles. “It’s a difficult market, a difficult place to permit a stadium that we as a league can all be proud of,” Kroenke said of Los Angeles. “I think we got a little bit lucky.” Jones played a vital role, having worked the room long and hard enough over the previous 12 months to garner the necessary support for Kroenke and the Rams. In particular, it was his belief in Kroenke that compelled him to throw his support behind the Inglewood project. “I’ll never forget,” Jones said, remembering that night in Houston four months ago. “Stan was thanking everyone for their vote of confidence when we voted for him to move the Rams to Los Angeles – go home to Los Angeles if you will. And I reached over to tap my son, who was sitting next to me, and I said, ‘This is a big day, now. This is a watershed event. And this really means a lot.’” As Kroenke made his way around the room Jerry Jones and his son Stephen observed him. The father turned to his son and asked: “I hoped you learned something today.” Stephen Jones, according to his father, glanced at Kroenke and replied: “I sure did. If you’re going to win a race, make sure you ride Secretariat. That’s what I learned.” It's almost ironic that man turned out to be Kroenke, considering the original role he played in pulling the Rams out of Southern California to his home state Missouri. It was Kroenke who acquired 40 percent of the Rams from Georgia Frontiere for $80 million in the 1990s on the condition the team move to St. Louis. The agreement also gave Kroenke the right of first refusal to buy the remaining 60 percent of the team, which he exercised in 2010 by paying Frontiere’s heirs $450 million. At the time St. Louis celebrated, assuming the Missouri native would keep the Rams put. But when St. Louis opted against an arbitrator’s ruling to pay $700 million to update the Edward Jones Dome – the home of the Rams – it triggered a clause in the original lease the Rams signed upon moving there in 1994 in which they converted the final 10 years of the lease to year-to-year agreements with the ability to look elsewhere for a new home. In Missouri, many residents assumed that meant looking for a better deal in the St. Louis area. But Kroenke had bigger ideas, and soon turned his attention to Los Angeles. After a year-long roller-coaster ride to get here, he knows he made the right decision. “It’s been an enjoyable experience ever since,” Kroenke said.

In 2005, when "The Office" premiered, the iPhone didn't even exist, Beyonce was still touring with Destiny's Child, and facebook membership wasn't open to the public. The pilot episode, a direct remake of the first episode of the original UK series, was criticized as a poor imitation of its source material, and the first season received mixed reviews. Very few could've guessed that the reputation of "The Office", even with its highs and lows, would go on to arguably dwarf that of the series that spawned it, that the show would help birth a movie star (Steve Carell) and a second successful TV show ("Parks and Recreation", initially referred to as a spin-off), and most importantly, alongside "30 Rock" and "Parks", launch an entirely new era and style of network sitcom that was mostly exclusive to NBC for most of those ten years. Unfortunately for NBC, as that decade came to a close, that legacy started drifting out the door. Their decision not to hang onto Fey's "30 Rock" follow-up "The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt" has paid off for Netflix. NBC Universal produces "Brooklyn Nine-Nine", created by "Parks" co-creator Michael Schur and producer Dan Goor, but it airs on Fox. "Community" was cult-popular but never a ratings smash, eventually migrating to Yahoo! for its final season. It could even be argued that they let "The Mindy Project" get away from them, which was with the network in script stage before going elsewhere. Greg Daniels, who developed "The Office" for American TV and co-created "Parks", is working on something new for the network, but it remains in development. In what invariably seems like a desperate bid to recapture lightning in a bottle, NBC has reverse-engineered "Superstore", another workplace comedy, this one set inside a Walmart-like department store, and the results are dire, an unfunny and mildly embarrassing hybrid of not just "Office" and "Parks", but also the hacky, terminally regressive sitcoms competing network CBS is running (albeit, to great success). "Superstore" focuses on Amy (America Ferrara), floor manager for a "Cloud 9" department store (the program's fictional chain), and a new employee at that branch, Jonah (Ben Feldman), as he tries to figure out how to get on her good side, and both of them navigate unruly customers, corporate chaos, and a complicated set of colleagues. Among the co-workers are perpetually happy, extremely Christian, deeply neurotic store manager Glenn (Mark McKinney); hard-as-nails assistant manager Dina (Lauren Ash); cool-as-ice, wheelchair-bound PA guy Garrett (Colton Dunn); pregnant makeup counter ditz Cheyenne (Nichole Bloom); and another new employee, cut-throat suck-up Mateo (Nico Santos). To understand why "Superstore" sucks, one only has to look at why other NBC comedies succeeded. Daniels, whose background includes "The Simpsons", added a subtle cartoon bent to "The Office", which was then pushed forward further with subsequent shows. "Community" often took place in realms of pure fantasy. Each show was anchored by its own level of internal consistency that allowed them to function, not to mention most of their settings (a paper company, television production, local government, a community college) were closed-end places where eccentricity can sensibly spread, and the protagonists were generally placed as sane people in contrast to the madness. "Superstore" takes place in a cartoon world, but there aren't any rules that govern what has consequences and what doesn't. Jonah brings an anatomically correct sex doll to work after Amy continuously pranks him with a mannequin that the staff believes resembles him. Dina physically assaults an elderly customer she suspects is a "secret shopper." Every item in electronics is marked down to 25 cents and nobody gets fired, even though the mistake is temporary. In the world of "Community", this wouldn't be a problem, and "Parks" would find smart solutions to account for big mistakes, but "Superstore" wants to take place in an "Office"-like world where the audience is emotionally invested in Amy and Jonah's hopes and dreams. Without a consistent frame of reference for what stakes are real and what stakes the show will wave away with a line of dialogue in the last few minutes, there's no reason to care about any of it. Pretty much every other NBC success was also an ensemble, filled with distinctly-drawn characters whose colliding personalities created the comedy. "Superstore" tries to be that, but the failure to settle on a tone and an unwillingness to commit to what the stakes are undermines the ability to craft engaging characters. Amy and Josh, as the most realistic of the bunch, are almost blank slates, with germs of dreams, failed and otherwise, that are no doubt seeds planted that the writers hope to grow in future seasons. All three of the network's big gems had a massive personality at the center of them (Carell, Fey, Poehler), and although "Superstore" lead America Ferrara is certainly talented, she doesn't have the magnetism the role requires. She and Younger are consistently pleasant, while everyone else beams in from different universes. Dunn's Garrett feels more in keeping with Ferrara and Younger's universe, whereas McKinney, Ash, and Santos are broad comic caricatures. In the background, bit players who recur as other members of the store's staff feel like a ploy to generate some Creed Brattons or Stanley Hudsons, and a constant stream of insults directed at one of them (Kaliko Kauahi's Sandra) is an echo of both Toby Flenderson and Jerry "Gerry" Gergich. There's also a bizarre surplus of characters who fall below even that designation -- Cloud 9 seems to have 50 working employees at any given moment, 40 of which are nameless and only seen when convenient. Still, even those flaws could be overlooked if the writing was inspired, but it's here where "Superstore" is the most disappointing. The melting pot of influences only adds up to a bunch of disparate dots that each script needs to connect, and unfortunately, the electricity animating this Frankenstein's monster is mostly depressingly hacky sitcom premises. Would you guess that the show's first eleven episodes offer up a cheesy sensitivity training video? Sex caught on surveillance cameras? Not one but two major instances of a boss trying to fit in with the "cool" crowd to disastrous results? An episode where they get locked in the store? A competition between the staff members? All of the above are trotted out here, complete with predictable background runners that play out like clockwork, in sets of three. Obviously, there's no mandate that a sitcom should have messages, but "Superstore" mimics a familiar "character growth" structure, yet constantly contradicts itself, particularly in an episode where Cheyenne's white wanna-be MC boyfriend Bo (Johnny Pemberton) tries to expand his horizons by writing a jingle for the store without swearing in it, never figuring out how to reconcile "be true to yourself" with "grow up." Plot-wise, the show also continues to borrow from its influences, introducing a will-they-or-won't-they dynamic between Amy and Jonah in the first episode, and frequently playing humor off of awkward manager/employee relationships. The one episode of the first season's that kind of works is the finale, "Labor". It should be no surprise that "Labor" is also the one episode with a fairly consistent comic tone throughout, the one where the characters have a strong story to bounce off of, and the one with the most genuine stakes. Admittedly, "The Office" and "Parks" both course-corrected after underwhelming first seasons to become the shows they're remembered as, but there's so much less about "Superstore" that shows promise. Perhaps that's because NBC's other sitcoms, driven by distinct voices and starring distinct personalities, were trying to do something new. Even at its mediocre best, "Superstore" never does more than rely on what came before it as a guideline for where to go next. The DVD "Superstore" arrives with a glossy, embossed slipcover featuring the characters striding down one of the aisles of Cloud 9 (arguably a reference to the season finale) toward the camera, or toward the potential DVD purchaser. Underneath the slip, one finds a nearly identical design on the sleeve (only difference being the tech specs on the back cover). Open the transparent 2-disc eco-friendly Amaray case (less plastic, no holes), and you'll find a small leaflet advertising some Universal comedy Blu-rays and the second season of the show, and an episode guide printed on the reverse of the sleeve so as to show through on the empty space on the left side. The Video and Audio Presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, there's nothing about this slickly-produced network television show that isn't easy for DVD compression to handle. Clarity and fine detail are generally fine because the show is so brightly lit and features such clean and straightforward sound design that there's not much to even present as a challenge, and through the series' 11 episodes, I only noticed one shot in one of the episodes where there may have been a bit of compression wonkiness in a single shot in low-lighting. Dialogue and music are cleanly separated. All-around adequate. English captions for the deaf and hard of hearing are also included. The Extras Those who recall the glory days of "The Office" season sets that contained hours of golden content will maybe be disappointed to find that the deleted scenes (4:57 on disc 1, 7:24 on disc 2, arranged by episode and in both individual episode or "play all" reels) are not only completely inconsequential (at least a couple contain no jokes), but are actually cumulatively less substantial than the only other extra, an uncensored gag reel (14:27) which is far funnier than anything from the show itself. Conclusion "Superstore" is a pretty bad show, one weighed down by the reputation and influence of the shows it's attempting to follow up. It feels like an uncanny valley of quirks and personality that other programs arrived at organically, something rife with network notes, focus group testing, and general insecurity. The first season DVD is pretty bare bones as well, continuing the tradition of bare-minimum adequacy set by the program itself. Skip it.

Buy Now Mike Christy / Arizona Daily Star A group of hikers, led by Sergio Jones, Jennifer Bass and Leon Segura, ascend the final few miles of the Bright Angel Trail back out of the Grand Canyon in April, 2016. The teenaged Healthy Living Ambassadors of the 4-H Youth Leadership program at the Pima County Cooperative Extension took part in a 3-day teen summit trip to the Grand Canyon, with most of the 60-plus students choosing a 14-mile round-trip hike to the bottom of the canyon and back to the rim in one day. A healthy-living program for youths in Southern Arizona has secured enough grant funding to expand its reach and encourage thousands of kids to make healthy food choices, boost physical activity and gain leadership skills, leaders say. The Pima County Cooperative Extension’s 4-H “Youth Voice: Youth Choice” program has received $78,000 in grant funding from the Walmart Foundation for the 2016-2017 school year. Funding for the program — which is in its third year — is never guaranteed, so organizers were excited this year’s grant allows them to significantly expand the program, said Dan McDonald, interim director of the Pima County Cooperative Extension. “The idea is to have youth be more informed about their health choices, both in terms of their nutrition and physical activity, but also to be leaders in their communities,” he said. Through partnerships with schools in Pima, Santa Cruz and Pinal counties, organizers aim to reach 5,000 elementary-age children, as well as 250 Native American youths and 125 high schoolers who can become “Healthy Living Ambassadors.” Last year the program was funded to reach 1,750 children, McDonald said. The Healthy Living Ambassadors component is more intensive than the program for younger kids, who get six hours of nutrition education and physical activity, McDonald said. Ambassadors are trained in how to share what they’ve learned with others, becoming leaders in their schools, their neighborhoods and within their own families, he said. For 17-year-old Destiny Camou, a senior at Sabino High School, volunteer work came naturally — she’s done it for most of her life. But she said her time as a Healthy Living Ambassador also helped her become more outgoing and confident as a leader, while giving her opportunities to interact with younger kids from a low-income school district. Today’s youths face an uphill battle to stay active, she said. “When I was little, I was always outside and running around. But now kids are so consumed in technology, it’s hard to get kids out in the community and out exercising,” said Camou, who plans to study chemical engineering after graduation. “The main goal is to get kids my age and younger involved in the community and to kind of unite youth, so we can all work toward a healthier tomorrow.” Last year, dozens of young Healthy Living Ambassadors hiked into the Grand Canyon, an annual event covered by the Star last spring. The students had to first complete and log 50 hours of hiking and complete a qualifying hike on Mount Wrightson south of Tucson to ensure they could manage the challenging trek into the canyon, McDonald said. The program is also focused on reaching out to the diverse indigenous populations of Pima County through partnerships with the San Xavier Mission School and the Tucson Indian Center, who will help train a number of Healthy Living Ambassadors, McDonald said. Schools that sign up will get resources and support from program organizers, McDonald said, including kits to help students launch walking and running clubs at their schools and track their own healthy eating habits. Participating students and their families will have two big events to look forward to: The Tucson Marathon Family Fitness Fest on Dec. 3 will include a one-mile fun run and an obstacle course. Students will also get hands-on experience with food cultivation during a Family Farm Day event, to be held in the spring at the Tucson Village Farm. The farm is also offering a certification course for high schoolers who want to establish community gardens at their schools and in their neighborhoods. The Youth Voice: Youth Choice grant will not only give youths important tools to improve their own health, “but also builds their self-confidence and leadership skills by setting them up with the tools they need to act as peer liaisons,” Thom Plasse, instructional specialist at Tucson Village Farm, said in a news release. “We find that teens especially respond well to information that comes from their peers, rather than adults.” Contact reporter Emily Bregel at ebregel@tucson.com or 573-4233.
