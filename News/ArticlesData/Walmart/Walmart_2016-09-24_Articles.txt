The store in McDonough, Georgia, about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta, allegedly refused to make the Blue Lives Matter cake on Friday for a retirement party. 'My buddy's sister went to Walmart in McDonough, GA to have a cake made for their father's retirement party,' Taylor Wilkies, a police officer from Georgia, wrote on Facebook. 'She asked Walmart to make a "thin blue line" cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer.  A Walmart store has been accused of refusing to bake a cake decorated with the 'police officer's flag' because workers said it was 'racist', and then offered this cake (pictured) as a replacement 'Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being "racist". To me, this is appalling. 'People CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I'm so tired of it. It's literally exhausting for me to think about now.  The claim was then picked up by conservative Fox News host Todd Starnes who wrote about the alleged incident. Starnes says he spoke to the daughter of the police officer on Saturday night, however he does not include any details of the family or the woman.

Share this article Share 4k shares He wrote that the daughter said: 'I was so shocked... One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake.'  Starnes claims the woman told him she was 'disappointed'. 'I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him,' the unidentified woman said, according to Starnes. The Fox News host then goes on to say the workers were told to make the cake after complaints were made to the store's manager, but they still allegedly refused. A Georgia police officer shared the story of her 'buddy's sister' being denied the cake and it quickly went viral on Facebook The Walmart store in McDonough, Georgia, about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta, allegedly refused to make the cake on Friday for a retirement party on Sunday 'The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply,' he claims. 'I’ve attached photographs of Walmart’s handiwork — it’s absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. 'Walmart needs to make this right and they can start by delivering a professionally decorated cake to the police officer’s family. 'The three cake decorators need to be told: either decorate the cake or be fired.' Since Starnes tweeted the story, the Walmart alleged of refusing to make the cake has been flooded with criticism.  'Why do you not hold your employees to the job requirements they agreed to, decorate cakes? Fire them or as a Patron I'd worry you would poison the cake or other food I might purchase there because your employees hate cops,' Lisa Victoria angrily wrote. Other people refuted the story, claiming the store told them the accusations were made up 'Shame on you walmart!!!!! Hopefully you will take action upon your bakery department,' Erik Fowler said. However another person claims the store's manager told them the allegations were false.  'She was very polite, was familiar with the story, and denied that any of this was true,' David Sauls said. 'I asked her if I wanted to have the bakery decorate a cake depicting the thin blue line would they do it, and she said that they would be more than glad to, that it's ridiculous for anyone to make this claim, and that she doesn't understand why someone would make it.  'I'll give them the benefit of the doubt at this point.'

Elizabeth V. Camp, 49, confessed to stealing Walmart gift cards while employed at the Manson Post Office and discarding the opened envelopes in her trash at home, according to an affidavit filed by the USPS Office of the Inspector General. She was arrested Thursday in her current city of Aberdeen. She is charged with three counts of second-degree identity theft and three counts of possessing stolen property, and made her first appearance Friday in Chelan County Superior Court. Postal inspectors said a Manson resident who kept a post office box was expecting two $50 Walmart gift cards at Christmas, but reported their disappearance Jan. 5. The cards had been used at the Chelan Walmart store Dec. 17. Inspectors probed the purchase and said they found store security footage that appeared to identify Camp as the person using the cards.  The Postal Service then set up an “integrity test” that provided Camp another opportunity to steal a Walmart gift card. Camp allegedly stole and used that card Feb. 18, and confessed to the thefts during an interview with inspectors Feb. 25. Camp was charged by summons in April, but court records show the summons and a subsequent warrant were sent to an address in Oklahoma, where Camp said she had never lived. No trial date has been set. Camp remained jailed Saturday on $1,500 bail. Reach Jefferson Robbins at 509-664-7123 or (javascript required to see email). Follow him on Twitter at @JRobbinsWW.

Jackson Police officers were called to Walmart at 12:42 a.m. Thursday, September 22, where the male suspect, Lacy Wolford, 32, of Keystone Road, Vinton, was being detained by store personnel and witnesses after they had restrained him and taken a pocketknife away from him. Police said Walmart representatives attempted to stop Wolford as he was in process of leaving the store, pushing a cart with bags of dog food for which he had not paid. Wolford allegedly shoved a Walmart representative, then ran out of the store. Witnesses in the parking lot saw what was happening and took Wolford to the ground, who then allegedly took a pocketknife from his pocket and threatened to stab one of the witnesses who had stopped him. However, a Walmart representative was able to grab the knife out of Wolford's hand with nobody getting hurt. Police were able to locate other items Wolford had allegedly stolen from the store which had a total value of $194. Wolford was charged with Theft and Aggravated Menacing and held in custody for six hours at the Jackson Police Station. According to the police report, he was released because no jail space was available to incarcerate him. Oak Hill area home struck by gunshots An Oak Hill area woman reported her house was recently damaged by gunshots while she was at the residence. According to Jackson County Sheriff Tedd Frazier, Lori Jenkins of 13940 State Route 279, Oak Hill, reported the incident at 3:01 p.m. Saturday, September 3. Jenkins said she was inside the house and heard a gunshot. When she went outside to investigate, she heard another shot. Upon closer inspection, she found two gunshots had left holes in the house's siding next to the front door. It was not immediately determined who fired the shots or where they came from. Man cutting corn finds Marijuana in Milton Township A man who was recently cutting corn in Milton Township found another crop instead - and it was an illegal one. According to Jackson County Sheriff Tedd Frazier, Ray Bierhup contacted the sheriff's office at 11:21 a.m. Monday, September 5, and reported he had come across some Marijuana plants while cutting corn off A.W. Long Road. Deputies went to the scene and confiscated seven Marijuana plants and later destroyed them at the sheriff's office. Semi rig damages road sign, utility pole A semi-truck driver was cited in Jackson after his trailer struck a road sign and utility pole Monday evening, September 19. According to Jackson Police, the incident occurred at 11:29 p.m. at the intersection of Morton and Chillicothe Streets. The semi rig, driven by Brian K. Johnson, 49, of Mebane, North Carolina, was attempting to make a right turn from Morton Street onto Chillicothe Street when his trailer struck a State Route 93 road sign and a utility pole owned by Frontier. Johnson was not injured, but police cited him with Failure To Control. Pedestrian charged with Intoxication in Jackson When Jackson Police officers were on patrol at 4:19 a.m. Monday, September 19, they noticed a man who appeared unsteady and uncertain on his feet walk across the intersection of Main and Bridge Streets. He continued to walk and passed through a couple of different yards before officers stopped to check on him at the corner of West and Crossland Streets. The man was identified as Randy L. Wiseman, Jr., 26, of Youngstown, Ohio, and officers detected the odor of alcohol from his person and noted he was exhibiting poor balance and was having trouble standing up. He was charged with Disorderly Conduct By Intoxication and held in custody for six hours at the Jackson Police Station. Jackson area woman charged with Resisting Arrest Jackson Police officers were dispatched at 1:14 a.m. Thursday, September 22, to an alley behind Marie Laveau's Bar at 203 East Main Street where two women reportedly had been in a fight. A Jackson County Sheriff's Office deputy was talking to the women when police officers arrived. When one of the suspects, Amelia Hobbs, 54, of 247 Smith Bridge Road, Jackson, was questioned about the incident, she allegedly became disrespectful to officers and later resisted their attempts to arrest her. Police took her to the ground during the episode and she was treated for a cut on her elbow.

 Discount supermarkets are taking over the US Hayley Peterson Sep. 24, 2016, 1:30 PM 11,556 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Photo /Martin Meissner, file America's largest supermarkets are slashing prices amid ongoing food-price deflation and growing pressure from the rapid expansion of discount-grocery chains like Aldi. The price cuts are squeezing profits and dragging down company shares. Kroger, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Dollar General have seen their stock prices drop a collective 13% in the last three months. "The current landscape is now beginning to look a lot like 2009, when meaningful deflation resulted in an industry price war and multiple quarters of declining earnings," Credit Suisse analyst Edward Kelly said in a recent research.Yahoo Finance Dollar General said in August that it's cutting prices on hundreds of items across 2,000 stores as it battles slowing sales growth. "These price reductions are meaningful and recognizable," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in an earnings call. "These are the items that will actually drive additional foot traffic into our stores." The strategy follows in the footsteps of Kroger, Trader Joe's, and Walmart, which have also been slashing prices this year. Kroger lowered the cost of 1,000 popular grocery items in 120 of its stores, retail consultant David Merrefield writes on industry website The Robin Report. It's also in the process of hiring 14,000 people at its 2,800 stores to boost customer service. Prior to Kroger's cuts, Trader Joe's quietly dropped its prices and Walmart revealed it was reducing prices on hundreds of items in its grocery department with a particular focus on fresh produce, consumables, and over-the-counter drugs. Walmart's price cuts are part of a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment that Walmart it in the first quarter of the year. The grocery price wars are cropping up at the same time that German discount grocer Aldi expands its footprint in the US. Walmart's grocery department. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson In a price check last year, Business Insider found Aldi's prices were roughly 30% lower than Walmart's. Aldi has about 1,500 stores in the US with plans to open 500 more stores over the next two years as part of a $3 billion expansion. Aldi and rival discounter Lidl have upended the grocery market in the UK in recent years, forcing the nation's largest supermarkets to dramatically cut prices and lay off workers to stay competitive. As Aldi expands, Lidl is gearing up to open stores in dozens of cities in the US, spanning from New Jersey to Georgia, the company told Business Insider this week. Lidl wouldn't reveal how many stores it's planning to open, but sources told the commercial real-estate firm CoStar that the company will open as many as 150 US stores by 2018. The company currently has 10,000 stores in 26 European countries. Lidl has already snatched up leases in dozens of US cities. It's seeking store managers in areas including Burlington County, New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; and Augusta, Georgia. Aldi and Lidl are known for their rock-bottom prices and small, convenient store locations. Aldi's stores are about 15 times smaller than Walmart's supercenters. Lidl's stores, by comparison, are about twice the size of an Aldi. Deutsche Bank analysts have referred to the two German chains as "predators crossing the pond." In a research note published in April, the analysts predicted that the two companies will shake up the US grocery market by killing off weaker chains and stealing customers from larger players — most notably Walmart, Dollar General, and Whole Foods. "All retailers need to treat Aldi (and at a later date Lidl) as a meaningful threat — and to be dismissive will likely prove to be a tactical/strategic error," the analysts wrote. So far, the biggest supermarket chains in the US are being proactive in fending off the competition by lowering their prices. As Aldi and Lidl continue to expand, however, they will likely be forced to make even deeper price cuts.

But consumer drones are just a small part of the story for this emerging technology. Sarah Priestley (TMFSarahp) Sep 24, 2016 at 11:39AM GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) unveiled several new products this week, including their new Karma drone. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley talk about GoPro's release -- what improvements they've made to their products, how the price points might affect consumer response, and where the stock is today from an investor's point of view. Then, the hosts dive into the potential future of drone adoption in the commercial sector. Find out how huge this market could be, and some giant obstacles that e-commerce companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are going to have to solve before drone delivery can really take off. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sep. 20, 2016. Vincent Shen: Hey, Fools! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. It is Tuesday, Sept. 20, and I'm your host Vincent Shen, joined here in studio by Sarah Priestley to bring you the latest news and insights from the consumer retail sector. Jumping right into it: Yesterday, GoPro unveiled several new products, including what are considered to be some of its most important releases since the original GoPro 35mm Hero and GoPro Digital Hero a decade ago. Those new products included the Hero5 Black, the Hero5 Session, and of course, what everyone has been waiting for since the delay in the first half of 2016, the Karma drone, which will introduce quite nicely our main discussion for this episode, which is drones. What kind of experience do you have with drones, Sarah? Sarah Priestley: We have ... Shen: Who is "we?" Priestley: My husband and I. (laughs) My husband was given by my father a drone for Christmas. And we have, I'm ashamed to say, only used it to make insulting home videos with Star Wars background music. Shen: Very nice. Do you know specifically which drone it is? Priestley: That we have? I think it's a DJI. Shen: In terms of usability, are you impressed with how far the technology has come along? In the consumer space, at least. Priestley: Yeah, I'm incredibly impressed. I think they've come on in leaps and bounds in a very short period of time. It's incredibly stable and easy to fly. I would say my issue with it is probably battery life, which is the same as what a lot of people seem to have. And I know people are talking about the GoPro, it has an 18 minute battery life? Shen: Yeah, about 18 to 20 minutes. The Hero5 cameras, there's some really interesting upgrades and improvements from the prior generation cameras. They have voice control now, GPS tagging and more. The Karma is what really caught our attention, especially since we're focusing on drones for this episode. It's been priced at about $799 as the stand-alone device, $999 or $1099 paired with one of the new Hero5 cameras as a package. Based on research and speaking with some of my friends who are into drones as a hobby, some of the key factors that people generally consider when they buy a drone for consumer use are battery life (like you mentioned), form factor, range, how far it can fly out, the camera system it uses, if you want to have a camera on it, and, of course, the budget. How the Karma fares with these criteria, in terms of battery life, we mentioned 18 to 20 minutes, it's actually pretty standard and competitive with rival offerings. Other makers like Parrot, DJI, the current battery technology, even just a half hour flight time is actually considered to be industry-leading for consumer drones. And then the form factor -- where I thought the Karma really stood out, it was actually on stage with the CEO for his entire presentation in a backpack. When he pulled it out, it was kind of a surprise, because of the fact that it's so compact. Basically, arms fold in for storage; otherwise, when they fold out, it looks like the standard quadcopter. But it's very easy to snap open and deploy. The whole package with the camera, the mount, the remote controller, and the stabilizing gimbal -- if I'm pronouncing that correctly -- it weighs not much more than five pounds, and the remote has a five-inch screen with controls that really resemble, in my opinion, your basic handheld gaming device, kind of like with joysticks, which I think a lot of everyday users would be able to pick up and learn relatively quickly compared to some of the other drone remotes that I've seen that are how much more complicated, and resemble things like a more complex RC device. In terms of range, it can fly up to 1 kilometer -- over 3000 feet from the user, which is pretty impressive. 35 miles per hour flight speed, and a maximum altitude of 14,500 feet for flight. The camera system is obviously compatible with the Hero5 series, also the Hero4. When it's paired with the stabilization accessories, it makes for a really smooth, professional-looking video, as can be seen in some of the marketing footage, which I highly recommend you check out. I'm sure once it is released in October, there will be tons of user footage out there to show how good it is compared to the competition. But overall, I think the Karma is pretty well-suited to the action-sport lifestyle and activities where GoPro has established its roots. If you take a minute and look at some of the media headlines about the Karma release, first impressions seem really good. Even in drone hobbyist communities and forums, people seem to be really impressed. These new products are due officially in October. It's perfect timing for the holiday season. That's usually the company's biggest selling period. In 2014, for example, the company was still delivering really strong double-digit growth, and that fourth-quarter holiday season made up nearly half of total sales in 2014. Right now, it's a much different world for GoPro and shareholders. A lot of new, low-price competing action cameras have eroded the company's market share, taking a toll on the company's results for the past three quarters. So, including the holiday quarter of 2015 and the first half of 2016, the company reported year-over-year revenue declines of anywhere from 30% to 50%. The stock itself peaked back in October 2014, when it hit nearly $90 per share, bounced around until August 2015 at about $60 per share. Now it's endured a pretty steady decline; it's trading at $15. Honestly, with that decline, its valuation multiples have come down from the clouds into much more reasonable territory. It's trading at about 20 times trailing earnings. Previously, it was 70 times or more. But, when it comes down to it, it's a $799 device, or $1,000 or more if you need a camera to go with it. I'm not sure this is something that can necessarily sell in enough volume to really help GoPro return to its previous growth levels. What do you think? Is that something that people are willing to spend? If you think about another really popular electronics item that's higher end, more expensive during the holidays, for example, gaming consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation, even when they first come out, they're $400 to $500 for a package. This is even beyond that. Maybe certain computers, the newest MacBook, might rival this in terms of price range. But, what do you think? Priestley: I think if you are serious hobbyist, and you're really into drones -- in fact, if you're really into action photography -- this would probably be something you would do. There's a lot of people who have side gigs, like they're doing wedding photography -- our man behind the glass today is actually supporting his cousin, doing some videoing for her wedding this weekend. I was at a wedding a couple weeks ago, and they had a drone just hovering above the ceremony the whole time. That's a very easy, if you think about it, low-priced option that a lot of people can add to their packages. It's not necessarily just amateurs, I think. Shen: Yeah, sure. With all that in mind, I think I will leave listeners to stew on this question, and ultimately, wait to see how successful the Karma sells -- how many it's able to sell, and if it has that significant an impact on GoPro's results. But, a little bit of additional color for you to consider is that ABI Research estimates that the consumer drone market will grow from the 5 million units shipped in 2014 to about 90 million by 2025, or about $4.6 billion in sales. So, there is a lot of opportunity, I think -- a runway for growth for GoPro to establish itself in what is ultimately still a very much developing niche market. If anything, the company definitely has a ton of history taking a pretty specialized product and turning it into a mainstream success. They've sold millions upon millions of action cameras, and at some points, they boasted 80% to 90% market share in that segment -- so, dominant. GoPro is not quite an early mover in the drone industry, as it was with action cameras. For a long time, when consumers thought of action cameras, they thought of GoPro. And though the price tag makes me a little skeptical, the company does have the option of expanding its price points, just as it did with cameras. The Sessions come in at cheaper levels, at lower price levels. GoPro can do the exact same thing with different models of drones in the future. And I think, when it comes to drones, bigger picture, away from GoPro, our discussions have really been focused on the amateur hobbyist market. Even the professional consumer market. But, in actuality, that's really just a small piece of the opportunities in the drone market overall. Over the summer, back in June, the Federal Aviation Administration issued its official rules for commercial drones, which really opened the door to their use in a lot of industries. Those rules went into effect late last month. And honestly, the commercial drone market is going to dwarf the consumer drone market. Laying a little bit of foundation in terms of how these commercial drones are coming into play initially, can you tell us a little bit about the framework for the rules, and how that's impacting their use? Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's important for people to know that prior to this period, it was illegal to use commercial drones unless you had a section 333 exemption from the FAA. This is actually the second time that they have been asked to come up with these rules and regulations. They were asked in 2012 and they missed the deadline. So it's been something that's on Congress' mind for a while, foreseeing this activity. But, as you said, the new rules came out in August 2016. I'll just read you a brief excerpt from the press release: "The FAA has finalized new operational rules for routine commercial use of small, unmanned aircraft systems, opening pathways toward fully integrating UAS into the nation's airspace." It's quite a bold claim, and I think these are almost baby steps. Right now, pilots have to keep drones within line-of-sight, which reduces a lot of opportunities in terms of delivery, especially, for retail like we're looking at with Amazon Air and things like that. But, at the same time, it's a big step forward. The same press release suggested that it could add $82 billion to the U.S. economy and create 100,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. It seems like a baby step, but it's a step in the right direction. Shen: I think it's really important to note that number you just mentioned, $82 billion. That's huge. The commercial drone usage, the number I had for 2025, almost 10 years from now, on the consumer side, is only $5 billion. Again, a really big difference in terms of the size of the market. I think, not just for GoPro, but also some of the other players right now that are trying to establish themselves in the drone market, mostly private companies like Parrot, DJI Innovations, they're going to be fighting pretty hard for a piece of that very sizable market. A few other rules, specifically, that I thought were kind of interesting in terms of commercial drone usage: They obviously regulate proximity to airports, their flight speed, their flight altitude. But the one you touched on in terms of it having to be within line-of-sight, really affects something that has been a huge trend for e-commerce, which is the impact of delivery, and you mentioned Amazon Air, and the fact that a lot of e-commerce retailers are challenging the traditional retailers, and challenging consumers to think that maybe "It's easier for me to order something, essentially, from the comfort of my couch than it is to make the drive 10 minutes, 15 minutes, or even farther for some people, as we'll get to, to go to the store to buy something. Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's, for a long time, been the preserve of sci-fi movies, but now it's starting to become a reality. I don't know how quickly it will actually happen for consumers. But if you look, in 2015, just business-to-consumer -- so, excluding business-to-business -- the online retail market was $808 billion. There is a huge amount of consumer expectation over how quickly they're going to receive those packages. I think that's, essentially, created a huge pressure point, and a competitive pressure point, for retailers and how they're competing over free delivery -- which obviously is not free for them -- and immediate delivery, which is what we're talking about now. Shen: Sure. When you look at, what I consider to be one of the biggest examples, it's the biggest example of a traditional retailer, like Wal-Mart, it's obviously been focused a lot in terms of its e-commerce efforts. We've talked previously on this show about it's Jet.com acquisition and other efforts. I think for the most recent quarter, it's been able to return to more robust levels of growth for its e-commerce efforts. And they are really pushing their shipping option. They have their Shipping Pass package, now, I think it's $50 per year, comparable to Amazon Prime. Something I thought was really interesting is, Piper Jaffray research analysts estimates that Amazon has successfully built out its network of fulfillment centers at this point to be within 20 miles of 44% of the U.S. population. Back in 2010, that penetration level was just 5%. On the other hand, we know that Wal-Mart has a ton of stores. What's their penetration level? Priestley: They have a store within 5 miles of 70% of the population. Shen: So, what do you see in terms of shipping, the drone opportunities, how do you see that playing out? Because Amazon, obviously, with about 44% penetration within 20 miles, that seems, potentially, in the future, as the technology develops, as the flight times improve, for them to be able to really deliver and expand what is right now a limited 40 markets for Prime now, essentially, your delivery within 1 or 2 hours. What do you think? Priestley: I think there's a lot of hurdles for them to overcome, not just regulatory. I think it's going to be a societal change, too. How much do you really need to get it within 30 minutes? And, obviously, price will affect that. But, as you said, Wal-Mart's distribution of the retail locations is a huge advantage. I don't think people realize, when you talk about drones, the idea is that it will essentially be a single-package short delivery. Then, this opens up a whole secondary question over how cost-effective is this actually going to be? A lot of people have made the argument that this could be, in fact, cents per mile. The last mile of the delivery is where the opportunity is for retailers. I think the last mile adds 28% of the cost of delivery. So, if you just take this last mile and think about how much cost benefit there is going to be for a drone. And there are some analysts that are pegging this out to be ridiculously cheap, $0.88 for the final delivery. Some of them are pegging it to be $10 to $17 per delivery, depending on what you factor in. So, there's a whole host of issues. There's a whole timeline when we need to find out what the price point is for people; if they actually want this, how much they're willing to pay for it. Deloitte surveyed last year 4,000 shoppers around the holiday season, and a quarter of them were unwilling to pay for next-day delivery. You can see that expectations are rocket-high from consumers already from what they're expecting. Shen: If you're online and you're not competing on price, you're competing on getting that package to the person as quickly as possible. That's, ultimately, one of the big challenges with shopping online. You have to wait for it, and you can't handle it in person. That has driven consumers to have this expectation where, "Hey, I want that, and I want it shipped to me quickly for free." Amazon has certainly contributed, partially, to that. But that has also been a huge competitive advantage for them. Focusing in on what you mentioned, that last mile of delivery. There was an article in The Wall Street Journal that was really interesting, basically about how it's affecting the United States, a very big country, a lot of people live in more rural areas. With last-mile delivery, for the logistics companies like UPS or FedEx, they benefit most when their truck can drive along a street, maybe a five-mile stretch, for example, and deliver a ton of packages, hundreds of packages in their route. It's the most cost-effective for them. Whereas, in some cases, in more rural area, population densities are much, much lower, it's the complete opposite. Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. This is called route density and drop size -- the two criteria here. So, either you do your normal route, and you deliver a lot of packages, or you do a smaller route to, say, one place, and you deliver a lot of packages. That's the way they work out the economics of this. The issue, as you alluded to, is the fact that the rural economy in the U.S. is really picking up online. I think 68% of people were online shopping in rural areas last year. That's grown to 75% this year. This poses a challenge to retailers in the fact that they offer a standard delivery price whether you live in Manhattan or you live Arkansas. The reason that they do this is because they have to be completely transparent, and they have to be open. They can't seem to be penalizing people for where they live. But there is an additional cost for doing this, and it's around $4. If you look at USPS or even the more premium FedEx and UPS, they're charging upwards of about $4 for very rural deliveries. And the retailer is absorbing these costs. That's going to have a direct impact on margins eventually, if this continues to increase. At the moment, it's probably just a small fraction of the overall revenue source for them. Shen: Yeah. To put some of that into context, too: Right now, online purchases for all consumer spending is still in the single digits, like 9%, almost 10%. So, there's really a ton of opportunity for online shopping, especially among rural consumers, to grow. That Wall Street Journal article had some really interesting examples where, basically, they mentioned, it's not just people shopping for a big ticket-item like a PC, or something you would buy online. It's really some of their daily staples, including paper towels and other things you need every day in your home. Another example of how long some of these mail routes get: There was one carrier, his daily mail loop is almost 190 miles in Oklahoma. That's the kind of challenge we have. Potentially, if the cost structure and the other logistics to regulations work out, drones can help alleviate that. Right now, a lot of the technology is limited. You can only carry one package, for example. But I would assume they're working on that. What other limitations do you think -- it seems like a really great idea in a city, getting things out really quickly, less than 30 minutes. What aren't we thinking of? Priestley: There are a whole host of issues, especially in cities. The people that are working on this, they call this the last 50 feet issue. So, not only do you have problems with human interference -- we're naturally inquisitive people, and there' the suggestion that maybe they could be taken, stolen ... Shen: They could just swat a drone like a fly. Priestley: Exactly. You get children, animals, all those kinds of interferences that can occur. And also, you have logistical issues. Last year, in November, Amazon released a YouTube video basically showing a woman who needed football cleats, and she ordered them, and it showed you the dispatch, and it going all the way there. She put a little pad outside on her yard, and that's where the drone landed. We don't know if that's actually what's going to happen, but there needs to be some kind of identifying factor of where this is going to land. And if you live, like we do, in an apartment complex, where does the drone deliver? Is it going to be on the roof? How safe is that? There's a whole host of issues. Shen: It's funny, we talked about last mile delivery, when we're talking about a truck. Now it's the last 50 feet when we're talking about drones. Anything else, in terms of what you see as possibly being a holdup in terms of adoption in the specific consumer retail application? Priestley: Yeah, I think there's also going to be big argument that, how necessary is this? You have, now, Walgreens and CVS, who have a huge store footprint. They're stocking a lot of the things that formerly, you would have to make an emergency run to the supermarket for. It seems this is going to be much more niche than people are expecting, to me. I think it has much more application with things like oil rigs, parts for when big oil rigs stop pumping, and medical applications. And I think this is where a lot of other people project this to go, too. Shen: Let's focus in on that. What examples have we seen, or, are there good examples out there that you've seen of drones working really well? People have talked about, beyond the consumer retail space, also agriculture, defense, energy, medicine. Do you have examples? Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. There's a start-up -- I guess they're not start-up anymore, they were established in 2011 called Matternet, and they deliver medical supplies. They operate in Switzerland, Haiti, the Dominican Republic right now. And I'll take one example from them. In Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, which is in Southern Africa, one in four adults has HIV. Matternet's drones deliver blood samples to clinics, they deliver medicine, and they already operate in a network 1.5 times the size of Manhattan. So, it really does show you the opportunity there. But I think the biggest reason this is used is that the paved roads are scarce, and the drone network is cheaper than establishing a road network. I think the delivery cost is about $0.24 per delivery on what they operate now. Shen: Oh, wow. So, I think, overall, bringing this back into the Foolish world, in terms of investing, with the drone players themselves, GoPro is really making a splash with its Karma, that we spoke about earlier. But a lot of the other companies right now are definitely small, private, a little harder to make that direct investment, if you're interested in getting an investing foothold here. But we talked about some of the retailers, as well. Amazon -- for years now, Jeff Bezos has talked about, for years, his interest in turning this into a viable way of expanding its delivery options and its efficiency, for example. But otherwise, I'd love, in future shows, to tackle some of the different companies that might be supplying some components and things along those lines -- as much as we can in the consumer retail space -- for these drones. Any other takeaways for you, that you were surprised by, or anything in terms of the future for this industry right now? Priestley: Yeah, I will say, if you're an investor right now in Amazon or Wal-Mart, the things you're probably going to be seeing are the building out of more click-and-collect kind of offerings, more distribution centers, shipping from store. And I wouldn't be surprised to see that in the earnings calls. This is going to potentially offer a huge benefit. If you look right now in the U.K., the retailers are losing about 300 million pounds a year because they can't find the right price point for delivery, and consumers are so sensitive to it. I think this is really a good debate to have. Shen: OK. Thanks a lot.

(REUTERS/John Gress/Files) Reuters Sep 21, 2016 at 9:03 am | Print View CHICAGO — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. The world’s largest retailer said 932,000 store employees received a quarterly bonus this year. This was a jump from 880,000 employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 687,000 workers in fiscal 2015. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States, with about 1.5 million workers including hourly store staff, store management and truck drivers. Hourly workers at the company’s nearly 4,600 U.S. locations are eligible for quarterly bonuses based on the performance of their store. This increase in bonuses comes after the retailer bucked a string of weak earnings by its rivals and reported a better-than-expected quarterly performance last month, saying it benefited from more efficient U.S. stores and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service. It also comes at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart said it will cut about 7,000 jobs, mostly in accounting and invoicing positions at its U.S. stores, and will offer affected employees consumer-facing positions. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said until two years ago Wal-Mart’s internal targets focused more on metrics like higher store sales. However, in the past two years the retailer has pivoted toward a greater emphasis on customer service by bringing more employees to the front of the store from its backrooms. Wal-Mart has also increased entry-level wages to $10 an hour and said it will invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years, a move it has said contributed to improved service levels. “As a result employee turnover has reduced and you have more people on the sales floor,” Lundberg said. The retailer also recently launched a new system for scheduling workers at 650 U.S. stores to improve staffing levels during peak shopping times and offer more certainty over hours for employees.

Digital distribution and highly-accessible game engines have led to a crowded marketplace where making a good game doesn't necessarily equate to success. While many developers still bring their games to market on their own, in the past couple years there has been a rise of smaller publishers like Versus Evil, which works with small indies to bring their games to an increasingly complicated market.  Gamasutra spoke to Steve Escalante, general manager at Versus Evil about what pitfalls indie developers should avoid if they want to find an audience in the midst of the explosion of new titles. Can you give me a little bit more of your background on Versus Evil? I think I'm on my sixteenth year or so in the games business. From basically developing MMOs for about five or six years and then kind of getting into the book publishing side with Brady Games for a few years. Then back into games publishing again. My last five years before I started Versus Evil was with Bethesda Softworks. I was there as marketing director on Elder Scrolls Online for quite a bit. Then I moved over to Bethesda Softworks team for the last year and a half. Then I started Versus Evil almost three years ago back in, I guess, August of '13. The end of August? Something like that. So we're coming up on our three-year anniversary. Banner Saga How many people are at Versus Evil? There's a total of four including myself. Low headcount means you don't have to worry too much about each title selling millions of copies to keep everyone employed. Yes. The flip side of that is we've also got indie teams that we need to support. So if I'm pretty fat as a company, then I have all these expenses that I need to cover and I can't do the deals that I'm doing. When we started this, there were only a few indie publishers out there. There were certainly developers who were doing it on their own, but very few indie publishers. That's why we're named "Versus Evil." It's like, "How do we break the dynamic of overruling publishers swooping in and taking all the revenues. Recouping all these different things, all these hidden expenses and all this stuff?" Banner Saga Since you've been on the larger publisher side and now the smaller publisher side, could you describe this evolution that's happened? It looks like it was all big companies and then there was kind of this "mid-tier" implosion. And now you have all these new tools, and you've got these indie developers, and more open platforms. Where does a publisher fit in these days? Why does Versus Evil and Devolver and publishers like that exist? To your point about the mid-level guys exploding--THQ and Midway and everybody kind of went away. Which is kind of like the Kmart vs. Walmart and Target. They just got squeezed out. What's interesting to me is I kind of wonder if we're actually in that part of our business. What I mean by that is, you've got the smaller-value guys that are coming in. I don't even mean to say that we are value like Walmart. It's more of, just those mass market price points, if you will, versus the triple-A $60 stuff more premium. It's really changed some of the dynamic. As we grow, we look at a Paradox Interactive. I think they said they did, what, $70 million last year and $30 million of profit. They're talking about going public. So they're kind of a "mid-tier" outfit. Are we in the stage where we're going to build some mid-tiers again? It's a question that I ask myself all the time. Are there mid-tier publishers basically just growing up? As we add more titles and have more hits and things like that, I think it's realistic to assume that you're going to have some publishers, the Paradoxes and bigger, that are suddenly doing a couple hundred million dollars a year because they have some really solid indie hits. (You could also say that about mobile as well, but mobile certainly had the explosion of the "triple-A mobile," if you will, that are making such big money.) Armikrog But to answer your question specifically about "Why do we exist?" I think the biggest problem that we have right now -- anybody, whether you're an indie publisher or what -- is discovery. Steam is releasing hundreds of games a month. Hundreds. ... So how do you differentiate yourself from the next guy? The same was said about the App Store. I think where publishers such as ourselves and others who have expertise in marketing and PR and reach and things like that, we're pretty well suited to do that for a team. When you look at the smaller teams, like the Banner Sagas and Stoic, they are like three or four guys.  I think more than anything, what we give back to our teams is time. We are able to focus on that while they focus on the game, because that's hard enough as it is. That's not to say that you can't do it alone, but when you have someone that's supporting you and helping you with the financials of all of that as well; working with you as a partner, then you can kind of go, "Okay, good. I can now focus on the game and not have to worry about all this other stuff." Armikrog I feel like we have a place in the market because we now have experience, we now have reach, we now have good relationships with the platform holders and things like that. All of those things which are typically a reason why you want to work with a publisher is now kind of coming true with indies. We can really talk with the platform holders about how we can promote and get featured and do those different things. It's just not possible for them to speak with hundreds of developers every single month. There was maybe a year or so where indie developers started coming up through some of the emerging platforms and it was like, "Screw you, publishers. we don't need to share revenue. We can do this ourselves!" Now, thanks to all the changes that are happening, some are saying, "Actually, now we do." Now that it's more flooded, the need has come back and we're heading back to where we were publisher-wise, in a way. What it used to be was, you've got to go to manufacturing. You've got to negotiate with all the top-tier retailers, which means you need a sales team, because you've got to get into the buyers. You're not getting into Walmart unless you know the buyer or unless you've got a sales team that can get you in front of the buyer. Even then, it wasn't a given that they would actually buy your product. So it was risky. At the same time, there were lot more retailers back then. You had the EBs of the world, and GameStops, everybody that was out there. You also had a cost of goods that. That being said, as a consumer, the confidence was when I walked into the store there was a pretty decent slew of PC games and console games. Toren As soon as you go digital, once they opened up those floodgates, it really helped build a lot of great content. The indie movement has brought back old genres. They've brought back old art styles, and moved them forward. Some games are beautifully stunning and yet they're still an 8-bit, 16-bit type of look. Then you get games like Hyperlight Drifter that are just beautiful to look at. Banner Saga, which almost turns a concept artist into your main artist, which is not typical in a game. It's really kind of opened up a whole marketplace. I do agree with you, there's all these indies out there and not everyone is succeeding and some of these games are really good. Is there a way that I can help them? What I found with a lot of the experienced teams that became indie and we were talking to, some of them were like, "Yeah, screw you, publishers. I don't want to work with anyone because I've been raked across the coals so many times." You get that a lot, then? That dynamic has been removed. I could tell you my first year of signing titles, it was all with hesitancy. It's really hard to make that decision to become independent and then to start talking to a publisher. Has that sentiment changed for the better, for you? From my perspective, I think it has. I think there certainly are teams that go it alone. Some of those teams that I've talked to haven't done as well and they've kind of come back saying, "Hey, we'd like to talk with you about our next one. We didn't do as well as we'd hoped." Everyone kind of checks references, which I think is very cool. The indie community is very well connected, right? Because Versus Evil has had a good reputation with the developers that we've worked with, I'll talk to a developers that we're working with, and they say, "Oh, I talked with those guys. So you signed that game?" Toren We run Versus Evil like a service company. These are my clients, and I need to do well by them. Otherwise we're not Versus Evil, we're just this overruling publisher that does messed up things just like everybody else. We become the evil. So we're very cautious of that. I think the conversation has changed. When we launched Banner Saga 1, I think there were 34 titles launched that month. I think this last April there were 320. It's different. All of a sudden, it's more like the App Store and how do you differentiate yourself? Just the last two years Twitch and YouTube from a live streaming perspective have really changed things as well. How can you tell an indie developer that you can do a better job at discovery than they could? I hate to keep saying the same thing, but it really just boils down to time and focus. I'm not a person to say, "I can do this better than you." If you look at it from a marketing and community standpoint, we're not talking rocket science here. There's knowledge and experience, don't get me wrong. There's things that I've done over the last 16 years that allow me to say, "This works. This doesn't." Everyone is a consumer, so they can really have an opinion about the marketing and the management of the community and things like that. We're not saying that we can do it better, we're just saying we have experience doing it. You have a good artist that's pretty well trained in what he does, don't ask him to program. And in some regards, don't ask him to do marketing.  Ask anyone who's run a Kickstarter campaign. You lose at least 30 days prior getting ready for the Kickstarter and then the 30 days running the Kickstarter. And then afterwards fulfilling it. It's a job in itself,  and you've not been developing the game during that time. It's things like that that you're kind of like, "How much am I going derail myself from managing community, managing different things, from developing the game?" Bedlam Some people can do it. The Stardew Valley guy did an amazing job. I'm not silly enough to sit here and say that I can do it better. I'm saying that I can do a good job and I'm saying that we are 100 percent focused on it and we feel that we will add value, we will bring more. What are you looking for in a game? The answer to this question has changed from when I first started. In the past, when Steam wasn't so wide open, it was just, "Fun? Good." There was a time that I think I was looking at four viking games at the exact same time. My team and I were laughing about it, but they're all good games. For me now, those core values still exist. It's got to be a fun game. It's got to be an art style that is different and noteworthy. We don't have multi-million dollar marketing budgets that we can brand an image into many consumers' minds. So you need to make sure that your art style is unique enough so that when you do anything, even your social media posts, your imgur stuff, that it stands on its own. That's where your branding and everything comes from when you're starting to build community and get out there on social media. Your look and feel can be "Oh, that's The Banner Saga. Oh, that's Guild of Dungeoneering, because it's so unique." Bedlam But today the big thing that we also look at is multi-platform. With the PC and mobile being so crowded, we have to have multiple SKUs so that we can help recoup risk both from the developer and publisher side, as well as differentiate ourselves, and make it look like a much bigger launch. For us now, it's like, "What's your console plans? What's your PC plans? What's your mobile plans?" All three of those don't have to be "Yes" answers, but we do try to have a "Yes" answer to at least two of those questions. Speaking of console games, what kind of numbers or performance are you seeing when you release an indie game on a console these days? I hear from a decent amount of indies that release, for example, on PlayStation 4. Seems like a lot of those games are dying on the vine. To be fair, it's not apples to apples. We launched Banner Saga there two years after the PC release. We launched Toren simultaneously, and I would say it kind of paralleled the numbers. I've been doing a lot of analysis just to see where we are for the year, I would say that my console business is growing and catching up to PC quite quickly with fewer titles. My three verticals, if you will, I see mobile, I see PC, I see console whereas before I was predominantly PC. I'm now seeing all three of those things grow and compete with each other from a revenue standpoint, and that's exciting. We're much more stable as a company because we have that whole ecosystem. I look at the console games and I don't see that, "It dies on the vine." The biggest risk for any indie game, whether it's developer or publisher, is going back to the old dynamic of retail. Your storefront is the digital storefront. If you're not getting featured, you're not getting marketing, you're not getting placed well, then how are they really hearing about it? Whereas before you would walk into a GameStop or a Walmart and you'd walk around the store. You'd pick up a physical box, you'd read the back, and you'd get informed. Maybe you wouldn't buy it, but you'd at least go somewhere and look. You'd have these big media hubs that people would go to like an IGN or GameSpot,  to check news or whatever. A lot of that has changed to, "Who's playing it on YouTube? Who's playing it on Twitch?" Guild of Dungeoneering When I look at it, I don't necessarily see it as a correlation to platform. It's all about discovery and making sure that the audience is aware that you're coming to that platform, and they actually care. We've had good success with console, we're going to continue going that way. We feel that console is very important to our market. Armikrog did okay on the PC, but we're really excited about what we're going with it on console. It certainly is getting more crowded on the consoles, but it's a long ways off from where Steam is right now. It is. It's a harder process. You have to go through certification. You have to have dev kits, you have to have all these different things and it's more complicated. It is absolutely not impossible. People are doing it and they do it successfully every single day. The barrier to entry is still higher than PC. What are some common mistakes you see indie devs make from a publishing or marketing standpoint? I think the common mistake, which really parallels triple-A titles as well, is they push it out. It's one of the things that I tell a lot of indies: "You've got to let it bake. You've got to test it more. If you think it's done, can you sit on it for a month? Make sure that this is the title." You see a lot of devs saying, "We just need to monetize. We're going to push it out on early access." My response to that is, "Consumers do not know what an alpha is. They really don't. They don't know what a beta is either." The beta testing that consumers are used to are the Call of Duties and MMORPGs that basically brought millions of people in for a really pretty and polished experience. What some of the early access titles have been doing is showing them a true alpha or beta and people going, "Whoa. What's this?" Guild of Dungeoneering The Darkest Dungeon guys did an excellent job of not doing that. It was fun, it was polished. It wasn't complete, but quite frankly you didn't notice. To me they are still, by far, the best run early access title out there. And they kind of ran it like an MMO where they released content over time and kept engaging people, releasing classes -- And they had their own blowup when they added in heart attacks and things like that, and people kind of freaked out and had to adjust. It was really fun to watch. It felt like you were getting rewarded. When they add new content that they intended on adding the whole time, you felt like it was a nice surprise and they were gifting you with something. Right. The key point there is that what they started with was good. It's kind of what World of Warcraft did way back in the day. When you played their beta, it was like, "Wow, this feels better than most MMOs." The other big mistake I see is focused around Kickstarter and trying to dredge up press. With Kickstarted projects, in order to get the funding they need, they've had to put out all the features, all the stuff that they basically had to do to get funding. Then when they go to the press, the press guys are like, "Well, I saw that on your Kickstarter, it's  old news." They spent all of their cool features to get the Kickstarter money. Which they needed! But then when it comes to dredging up press and PR and getting people excited, it's tougher because there's nothing new to say. I was talking to somebody who is about to launch a game out of alpha, and he had no idea how it will do. The game was getting good traction during early access on Steam, getting good sales. But when it "actually launches," he's wondering if he's going to see any bump at all. It is interesting because when speaking to press about a title that's been in early access, they ask what you've added, what's new. And you have to say, "Oh, no, we're just done. We're out of early access." Kyn This suggests that you've got to have a big content drop at the time of release. If you don't, you might not get any press to give you a bump. How are you bringing back the people who tried the early access seven months ago? How are you bringing them back and getting them excited again? Another strategy is, do early access on PC for six, seven, eight months. Then when you go live, roll out your console and PC version together. Because now you've got multiple platforms, now you've got different marketing, you've got different press excited about it because the console guys haven't been paying attention.  Kickstarter is interesting. We've seen some pretty good things there where your Steam community does not care that these guys paid you some money on Kickstarter. They'll say, "It's a good game, but they gave the Kickstarter people something special. I want those things too." Well, they funded the title, just to be clear. They deserve it. But some of the Steam community is like, "Yeah, but I want that too." I get that, but to be angry about it seems interesting to me. So basically keep in mind the different audiences on different platforms and how they'll react to business moves. You've absolutely got to. I think that's probably the biggest mistake -- I tell that with people that we don't work with. "Do me a favor, just take a step back." Think about when you're launching. Look at your window. Who are you launching against? When's the next sale? You've got to wind this thing up. Are you doing a pre-order discount? Are you doing a launch discount? You've got to make sure that you're not upsetting any of your early adopters. You've got to line up when you're going to drop certain things along the way. Kyn Even just from a high level. "I've got my beta. Maybe early access. Then I've got a launch. How am I doing in pre-sales? How am I doing launch discount? When's my first sale?" You can't put it on sale two weeks later, because you just pissed off all your early adopters. You've got to respect the people that are actually following you and being your fans. The message needs to be, "You guys are getting something and I'm not going to suddenly drop it a couple weeks later because I was looking for some money real quick." Do you think that the industry is setting itself up for another kind of mid-level collapse? Could that happen again? I'm sure some economist would disagree with me, but I kind of look at it like a mid-level birth. Because back in the day, what you were dealing with in the traditional retailer sense, you were dealing with physical retail distribution, placement in those stores, dealing with all the triple-A guys who had these massive kiosks and things like that, that you may or may not have been able to afford, because you just don't have enough titles to financially justify those types of displays. Whereas today, mainly because of how wonderful the console players have been and how Apple and Google really are open doors, you can get your content on there, it's just how you do it. Then with Steam and others on the PC, you've basically got a lot of avenues to create a really good brand. I would almost argue that it's all about your community and your management of the press and your management of the streamers to create a brand for yourself and hold on to that. You could exist as a medium-level company so long as you just don't screw that up. I'm sure the day will come when I'm going to get squeezed out, because the big guys always figure out a way to do that. But I think medium-level publishers can exist for a long time because they don't have a lot of the barriers that existed in the past that would require them to close doors. And we're not even a medium-sized publisher yet, so -- [laughs] Yeah, we've got plenty of time before we have to worry about that. It's an interesting thing, but I do think about it. If a Midway and THQ was around when there was the digital platforms and everything was much more open and they didn't have those expenses and things, where would they be today? I don't know. They had a lot of baggage going into it so it was tough for them to stay square. Merged with Eidos and that made them quite a bit bigger. Warner has done an excellent job of establishing themselves. Great IP, great games. So it's interesting. I think it's exciting to look ahead. I think the medium-level publishers can exist for indie teams that are also getting bigger that want the $5-$10 million development budgets to do "III" third party development. Could be cool. Big companies like THQ were publicly traded and there's so much focus on growth, growth, growth, growth for their investors, where perhaps that's not going to be such a huge focus for some of these independent publishers that are on the rise. Yeah, I don't think so. For me, a lot of the reasons why I like where we are is I want to have fun and in the process create some great relationships with partners and be successful with each other. If I can end my career in however long, I've got plenty of time left, I guess, and I was able to accomplish that with multiple teams, I'm going to be a pretty happy guy. It doesn't mean that everybody had some big payout and they made hundreds or even tens of millions of dollars, and they're able to retire. It's more like did we do it well? Did we treat each other respectfully? Were we completely transparent? Did we have a good time doing it? Did we do good products? I love what I do and I know these guys do as well.  That's where the big publishers helped birth the indie market. "Well, if this doesn't sell over a million copies, we're not interested." I wouldn't focus on trying to hit a million units or saying that selling 200,000 copies is easy. It's difficult because you've got a lot of choice out there. I mean, I'd be happy to sell a million copies. That would be great. We're set up to be able to not have to be focused on that type of success. But if that level of success happens, then you're in a really good place.

Buy Now KRISTIN STREFF, Journal Star The entrance to the Spreetail office at Nebraska Innovation Campus offers a hint at what the e-commerce company does. It features an enclosure made from a shipping container and wood from pallets. Buy Now KRISTIN STREFF, Journal Star Spreetail employees work in their new office space last week at Nebraska Innovation Campus. Brett Thome compares Spreetail, the company he runs, to a duck. It looks calm on the surface, but below, things are going 100 miles an hour. These days, a comparison to a small fish might be more apt. And that fish is swimming in a sea of sharks. Spreetail is the Lincoln e-commerce company that burst on the scene last fall, announcing its presence with a name change and a move to Nebraska Innovation Campus. Since then, it has stayed the course, continuing to grow in its new space -- now up to 100 employees there and nearly 160 companywide, according to Thome, the CEO. The company earlier this summer opened a new distribution center in a suburb of Indianapolis, improving its geographic coverage, and Thome said it is looking to open another one in Georgia in the next two years and one in Texas after that. Last fall, Spreetail said it was working toward the goal of $1 billion in revenue and 800 employees by 2022, and Thome said that is still a goal the company sees as achievable. The e-commerce market is so big and is growing so fast that, "if we get one-tenth of 1 percent in 2022, that's $1 billion," he said. "That's a slice of a slice of the pie." The key is getting there intact in an industry that is changing and consolidating rapidly. Last fall, Spreetail had a similar-sized competitor just 50 miles up the road in Omaha in Hayneedle. But Hayneedle was acquired by Jet.com in February for $90 million, and then Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com less than six months later for $3.3 billion. In addition to consolidation in the space, more and more large competitors are ramping up their use of e-commerce. In Lincoln alone in the past year, Hy-Vee started grocery delivery and Google expanded its Google Express online delivery and service to Lincoln and all of Nebraska. Google, Wal-Mart and others are all chasing online sales king Amazon, which had $79.3 billion in e-commerce sales last year, six times as much as Wal-Mart, the second-largest company. By comparison, Spreetail had about $140 million in sales last year and is hoping to hit $200 million next year, as it keeps its focus mostly on selling home and garden items. Even for pure e-commerce companies, meaning ones that sell exclusively online, that's tiny. According to the website eMarketer, Wayfair.com had $1.9 billion in sales last year and Overstock.com did $1.65 billion. Before it was acquired, Hayneedle was doing more than $400 million a year. The numbers game would seem to make Spreetail a prime target for acquisition, and Thome said the company does get what he termed as "feelers" from time to time. But he said Spreetail has no interest in being acquired. Being privately held makes it much easier to ignore buyout offers because there are not outside investors clamoring for an "exit" so they can get a big return on their money. Thome said Spreetail wants to keep it that way and tries to be as frugal as possible to ensure it has enough money to both fund operations and invest in the future without the need for outside capital. It did splurge a bit on the Innovation Campus space, though. Spreetail's previous offices were in a building near the Lincoln Airport that used to house a garden hose manufacturer. Though there were a few high-tech touches, it looked like any other office space. The Innovation Campus offices, on the other hand, look like something that might be featured in Architectural Digest. The space, on the second floor of the Innovation Commons building, is very open, with polished concrete floors and exposed ceilings. What walls there are -- to create conference rooms and meeting spaces -- are made from shipping containers, a nod to Spreetail's business. There also are design elements that incorporate wood from pallets that are used to store product in the company's distribution centers. Like many other high-tech offices at mostly millennial companies, Spreetail's office has a rec room with video games and beer taps. Thome said the company wanted to create a fun workplace but one that isn't too fun. "We don't want to be the place everyone wants to work," he said. "We want to be the place where 5 percent of the right kind of people want to work." Thome said the new office has helped with recruiting, not only with bringing in new hires and interns from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln but also with potential employees who visit from out of state. While it introduced the name Spreetail last year, the company still doesn't advertise itself that way, using that name mostly only for recruiting. Its website still operates as VM Innovations, its previous name. When Indiana officials put out a news release last month about the company opening a distribution center there, there was no mention of Spreetail. "The only place we're known as Spreetail is Lincoln," Thome said. That's by design. For one thing, the company wants to attract as little attention as possible from large competitors. "We want to stay off of lists and radars," Thome said. Another reason, though, is that the company wants to have all its ducks in a row before attempting to make a big splash. "What we do not want to do is go out and launch under the Spreetail name and not be able to deliver," Thome said. So it will continue to focus on growth, adding distribution centers, adding employees -- especially software developers -- and attempting to steer clear of any sharks -- or duck hunters. Thome said he is really optimistic for the future, despite all the competition and consolidation. "Do we think there's going to be 20 e-commerce companies, long term," he asked. No, he said, but there will be a handful, and Spreetail expects to be one of them. "At the end of the day, people are always going to want options," Thome said.

Twitter user George Garrett spotted Xiaomi’s Mi Box at a Walmart store, complete with a price tag of $69.00. According to a photo posted by Garrett, there were three Mi Boxes on this Walmart store’s shelf. @jasonhowell @androidshow @Ohthatflo @ronxo saw this Mi Box at Walmart today for $69. Was this released yet? pic.twitter.com/AsuNZeU5oJ — George Garrett (@garrettdotcom) September 23, 2016 What’s notable about the Mi Box’s appearance in Walmart is that Xiaomi hasn’t made any announcements regarding the device’s pricing or launch date. In fact, the closest that we’ve gotten to learning that info is a recent report that claimed that the Mi Box would launch in early Q4 2016 for less than $100. Considering that Xiaomi hasn’t actually announced the Mi Box’s availability yet, it’s possible that this Walmart just put the Mi Box on shelves early.  The Xiaomi Mi Box includes features like a quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, output at up to 4K 60 frames per second, and both HDMI and USB 2.0 ports. There’s a Bluetooth voice remote control in the box, and Xiaomi will offer a Mi Game Controller separately if you’re into gaming on the device. Would you buy a Xiaomi Mi Box for $69?

The affluent Bel Air neighborhood, where Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Aniston are just two of the major celebrities in its zip code, is also home to four of California's top five largest residential water customers.  The affluent Bel Air neighborhood, where Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Aniston are just two of the major celebrities in its zip code, is also home to four of California's top five largest residential water customers Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting has named seven of the affluent neighborhood's biggest water wasters, six of whose homes are pinpointed in this aerial photograph that shows just how lush and green their lawns continue to be more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Seabed 'lifts' out of the water following NZ earthquake Watch video Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Watch video New Zealand earthquake transforms road into cliff Watch video Good pup!

The investigative reporting organization used satellite images, algorithms and calculations to pinpoint the homes that had exceptionally lush and green landscapes, especially healthy plant life and relatively wet soil that indicated heavy irrigation.  These homes have fountains, swimming pools, waterfalls, thousands of flowers and, among some of them, more bathrooms then bedrooms.   1. Former CEO of Univision Jerrold Perenchio There are 12 bathrooms at the home of former Univision CEO Jerrold Perenchio. The billionaire's 21,500 sq foot chateau on Nimes Road also has a tree-lined driveway, pool and tennis court  Reveal estimates that Perenchio's estate uses between 6.1 and 12.3 million of gallons of water per year There are 12 bathrooms at billionaire Perenchio's 21,500 sq foot chateau on Nimes Road, not to mention a tree-lined driveway, pool, tennis court, 'extensive formal gardens' and one lawn that covers a quarter of an acre.  Half of an acre is planted in vineyards at the home, whose garden and facade were once used in the Beverly Hillbillies 1970s television show.  Reveal estimates that the estate uses between 6.1 and 12.3 million of gallons of water per year.  Asked to comment, Perenchio's assistant replied: 'We don't comment on anything'.  But the site found that some of the former CEO's lawns have turned brown since the spring, which could suggest a decrease in water usage.  2. Investment banker Garry Winnick At Casa Encantada on Bellagio Road one will find the home of investment banker Garry Winnick, who in 1999 was identified as the richest person in Los Angeles Casa Encantada has 64 rooms, including 20 bathrooms, and was estimated to be worth $225million in 2013. Reveal estimates that the estate uses somewhere between 4.6 to 9.3 million gallons of water per year At Casa Encantada on Bellagio Road one will find the home of Garry Winnick, who in 1999 was named the richest person in Los Angeles. Of the 64 rooms inside Casa Encantada are seven bedrooms and a whopping 20 bathrooms.  The home, which was listed for $225million in 2013 but was not sold, also has a pool house and a grand terrace with a fountain.  There were once 40,000 flowers blooming on the 8-acre grounds, according to the Los Angeles Times, and there is also a pool, tennis and basketball courts and a personal putting green.  Reveal estimates that the estate uses somewhere between 4.6 to 9.3 million gallons of water per year. Winnick did not respond to requests for a comment.  3. Movie producer, co-owner of Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Dodgers Peter Guber This Lausanne Rosd compound belongs to movie producer Peter Guber and was once owned by Mary Tyler Moore There are nine wooded acres on the grounds, including a pool and tennis court. Reveal estimate that the estate, which was sold for $20million in 2001, uses between 2.3 million and 4.6 million gallons of water per year At Guber's Lausanne Road compound, which once belonged to Mary Tyler Moor, there is a 14,000 sq ft of interior space and an additional 2.700 sq ft property that acts as his wife's studio. Guber, who is a co-owner of both the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Dodgers, has nine wooded acres on his grounds, including a pool and tennis court.  The property is estimated to use between 2.8 million and 5.5 million gallons of water per year. A spokesman for Gruber did not return a request for comment.  At the Strada Vecchia home, owned by billionaire Laurie, there are six bedrooms and four bathrooms.  The estate has fives acres of grounds, which include a pool, tennis court and a half-acre lawn full of trees. Reveal estimate that the estate, which was sold for $20million in 2001, uses between 2.3 million and 4.6 million gallons of water per year.   4. Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie At the Strada Vecchia home, owned by billionaire heiress Nancy Walton Laurie, there are six bedrooms and four bathrooms  The estate has fives acres of grounds, which include a pool, tennis court and a half-acre lawn full of trees. Reveal estimates that Laurie's  estate, which was sold for $20million in 2001, uses between 2.3 million and 4.6 million gallons of water per year On Bellagio Road one will find the mansion Daly shares with his wife, Grammy and Academy Award-winner Carole Bayer Sager.  The 11-bedroom estate has eight bathrooms and 11,600 sq ft of interior space, with a 500-foot-long driveway and a pool shaped like a half-moon.   It's central lawn is the size of half an acre and the estate is believed to consume 2.1 million to 4.2 million gallons of water per year.  Daly told Reveal has been 'responsible' about his water usage, which he estimated to be around 4 million gallons per year, telling the organization: 'I can't help the fact that I own a lot of property'.  The former Warner Bros chairman said he has since replaced lawns with artificial turf and pebbles as the state's drought intensified and said his water usage dropped by 35 percent since 2014.  5. Beverly Hilton hotel owner Beny Alagem This Bel Air Road mega mansion, which belongs to Beverly Hilton hotel owner Beny Alagem, is the 49th largest home in the entire country and has three acres of grounds  The estate includes three fountains, a swimming pool and formal gardens, as well as a lawn the size of half an acre. Reveal estimates water usage to be between 2 million and 4 million gallons per year The Bel Air Road mega mansion, which belongs to Alagem, is the 49th largest home in the entire country.  There are three acres of grounds, including three fountains and a swimming pool.  Formal gardens are also on the estate, as well as a lawn the size of half an acre.   Reveal estimates water usage to be between 2 million and 4 million gallons per year, but Alagem's spokeswoman said he is increasing his conservation efforts and takes the report 'very seriously'.   6. Soap opera producer Bradley Bell and wife Colleen, the US Ambassador to Hungary  On North Carolwood Drive is this 10-bedroom mansion that belongs to soap opera producer Bradley Bell and his wife Colleen The estate has five acres that includes a tree-lined lawn and formal gardens that include a large artificial waterfall. The organization estimates that just the home's landscaping would require 2 million to 3.9 million gallons of water per year On North Carolwood Drive is the Bell's 10-bedroom mansion, which once belonged to Rod Stewart.  The estate has five acres that includes a tree-lined lawn and plenty of palm trees.  Its formal gardens, which includes a large artificial waterfall that cascades down a hillside, were featured in Architectural Digest and called the estate's 'pièce de résistance', according to Reveal.  The organization estimates that just the home's landscaping would require 2 million to 3.9 million gallons of water per year, a figure that does not include the garden's waterfall. A spokeswoman declined to comment.  Although the biggest water waster will remain unnamed for now, they will not be so lucky the next time a drought emergency is declared.  Last month California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that requires local water agencies to set limits on how much water customers can use during an emergency, even if they can pay for it.  The law will also requires that violators' names be released to the public.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 212 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

By Jon C. Ogg September 25, 2016 10:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has enjoyed a serious gain in 2016, but that was after the wheels fell of the Wal-Mart truck in 2015. Now the Dow Jones Industrial Average component and retail giant is up 20% year to date, and the stock is up almost 17% from a year ago. That will mask at least some of the notion that the shares were down 0.7% in the past week and are up a mere 0.2% in the past month. 24/7 Wall St. has noticed that some analysts have increased their ratings and targets on Wal-Mart in recent days in weeks. It is quite possible that these analyst calls will be viewed as being late to the Wal-Mart recovery party. Still, they needed to be looked at. Wal-Mart was raised to Overweight from Equal Weight with an $87 price target at Barclays on Friday, September 23. The prior closing price was $72.19. Wal-Mart shares also closed up eight cents, or 0.11%, at $72.35 on Friday. On September 16, Credit Suisse raised its rating to Outperform from Neutral. The firm also raised its price target to $80 from $62. The report said: Walmart’s in-store investments and a better low-end consumer have yielded the return of traffic growth against a deteriorating staples retail landscape. While there is more work to do, early progress has been encouraging. We see a continuation of top-line momentum as management invests further, and although earnings growth is limited, risk to consensus looks low. This set-up should yield outperformance in an uninspiring coverage universe. Back on September 14, 24/7 Wall St. featured Wal-Mart as one of four stealth stocks for a volatile market according to Jefferies. The report said at the time: Our August pricing work showed that Walmart continued to invest in price, particularly in the dollar store and grocery baskets, which contain high visibility food and consumable SKUs. Based on our recent conversations with WMT, we believe they remain pleased with the results and expect expansion of this initiative. We expect the price investments to continue and cost out initiatives should fund this, so we reiterate our Buy rating. On September 12, Cowen raised its rating to Outperform from Market Perform. The analyst also raised the price target to $83 from $76. Cowen’s view was that a good trend is your friend and they think it is still early enough to buy shares to see positive returns. Cowen said: A combination of price investments, creative integration of physical + digital & the Jet acquisition position Walmart to regain retail dominance. WMT drivers & a healthy consumer should drive stable comps of 1-2% with upside potential. Importantly, we do not expect a negative surprise at Oct. analyst day & would be comfortable owning into event. Also on September 12, Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and its $86 upside price target. The firm said in that call: Our August pricing work showed that Walmart continued to invest in price, particularly in the dollar store and grocery baskets, which contain high visibility food and consumable SKUs. Based on our recent conversations with Walmart, we believe they remain pleased with the results and expect expansion of this initiative. We expect the price investments to continue and cost out initiatives should fund this, so we reiterate our Buy rating. JPMorgan has a mere Neutral rating, and on September 19 it lowered its price target to $74 from $75. This call was based on lowered estimates after factoring in the purchase price against earnings that it paid for Jet.com to better compete against Amazon. That price was $3 billion in cash, a portion of which is payable over time, and $300 million in Walmart stock. JPMorgan’s thesis and valuation said: Walmart is in a period of wage, IT, and price investments for improving relevance in a rapidly changing, omni-channel retail world at the expense of medium-term profits. WMT’s large market share (20%+) and mix (55%) in the lower-growth grocery category make the transition more difficult from a financial perspective given the challenges growing traffic/comps. This plus the investment cycle suggest that earnings growth will continue to be challenged for the intermediate future. Our December-2016 price target of $74 reflects our updated 2017 forecast and is based on ~16x P/E, which is one turn above its historical FY1 P/E valuation and slightly below its current valuation on FY16 estimate. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Wal-Mart shares closed at $72.35 on Friday, in a 52-week trading range of $56.30 to $75.19. The retail giant has a consensus analyst price target of $74.99. What investors might want to look at is the consensus price target history from Thomson Reuters: $72.94 a month ago, $69.07 just two months ago and $69.11 three months ago. By Jon C.

The company did say that this device will be released in the United States within the next couple of months but it’s yet to be confirmed when it will be launched and how much it’s going to cost. The Xiaomi Mi Box Android TV set-top box has now been spotted at a Walmart store with a price tag of $69. The Mi Box is going to be Xiaomi’s first big product launch in the United States as the company seeks to establish a strong footing in this lucrative market. The box features a simple design and power internals that provide it with the ability to stream video content in 4K UHD resolution. According to a report, there’s a Walmart location in the country that appears to be actually selling the as-yet unreleased Xiaomi Mi Box for $69. The suggests that since the company has started shipping inventory to retailers it may not be long before Xiaomi officially confirms the release of this set-top box. It merits mentioning here that even though Xiaomi has confirmed some details about this device it’s yet to confirm how much it’s going to cost in the United States. If it does cost $69 officially then it’s certainly going to be a very enticing proposition for folks who want to buy an Android TV set-top box. That’s actually the Xiaomi way of doing things, it’s best known for making good products and pricing them very competitively. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about android tv, walmart and Xiaomi.

Let's fix them. By  Kelly Heyboer | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author Follow on Twitter on September 25, 2016 at 10:10 AM, updated September 25, 2016 at 11:38 AM Print Email If you buy a product online from Amazon or pick up a product off a shelf at Walmart, chances are good that item was handled by a temporary worker at some point. Nationwide, the temp industry is booming, according to federal statistics. Workers hired on a temporary basis for short-term or long-term assignments have become a cornerstone of the warehouse and shipping business. Blue-collar temps — who are usually paid between the minimum wage of $8.38 and $11 an hour in New Jersey — often unload trucks, sort packages, pack boxes and work at manufacturing plants. 'I am illegal': One temp worker's story Last week, NJ Advance Media published "The invisible workforce," a series of stories chronicling the alleged racial discrimination, low wages, unsafe working conditions and mistreatment some New Jersey temp workers say they face on a daily basis. Part of the problem is many temps fear filing complaints about mistreatment because they are new immigrants or workers living in the U.S. illegally, advocates say. Carmen Martino, a professor in Rutgers University's labor relations department (Carmen Martino)  Carmen Martino has been following the temp industry in New Brunswick for three decades, first as a union official and later as one of the founders of New Labor, a worker advocacy group. He is now a professor of professional practice in the labor relations department at Rutgers University. Martino spoke to NJ Advance Media about the state of the temp industry and ways to improve conditions for workers. Here is an edited transcript: How did you first come across the growing blue-collar temp industry? In the late 1990s, I was working for the New Jersey Industrial Union Council in downtown New Brunswick. I would come to work very early in the morning. Along that route, I started to see lines of workers at 5 o'clock in the morning waiting to go into these office spaces or what looked like homes. They were basically make-shift temp agencies. We started to do some investigating. It turned out the vast majority of the temps, at least in the late 1990s, were immigrants from the same place — Oaxaca, Mexico. It was sort of like a pipeline that had been created. Why were so many temps needed? The late 90s was a time when retailers began to import more and more items from abroad. There was a huge explosion of goods being brought into the Port of Newark. The goods had to be put somewhere, so all of these warehouses were being built off of Exit 8A on the Turnpike. So, the demand was there for low-paid workers. The immigrants came because employers were waving flags that they would give them jobs. Are conditions getting better or worse for temp workers? The dynamics of the temp industry continually force labor costs and wages down. We used to say that this model of work was a race to the bottom. It probably has hit the bottom. If you're a temp worker now and you've been employed by the same temp agency and were sent to the same warehouse for five years, there's a high probability that you're still making less than $9 an hour. Pay isn't improving. And warehouse jobs are very dangerous. There's a high rate of injury — repetitive stress, back injuries. The conditions have only gotten worse over the years. Invisible workforce: How temporary labor works in N.J. Some advocates have compared temp work to a modern-day sweatshops. Is that accurate? Yes. A hundred years ago they called it the "sweating system." New Labor calls it the "cheating system." The consumer taking an item off the shelf at Walmart has no idea of the conditions temp workers face. The multi-national companies contract to the manufacturers. Then, the logistics companies that move the goods and operate the warehouses hire the temp agencies. Then, the temp agencies hire the low-wage workers. All it does, every step of the way, is worsen the working conditions and hold down or reduce worker's wages. Is the government doing enough to monitor the temporary employment industry? The state is working to the best of its ability to enforce labor laws. The federal government, through OSHA and the Department of Labor, is doing the best that it can. But none of those agencies are equipped with the resources and manpower to really be able to enforce the law and make employers do their job. The industry is under-regulated and, not surprisingly, very resistant to efforts to pass new regulations. In some states, such as Illinois and Massachusetts, stronger laws were passed to protect temp worker rights. A few attempts to pass legislation in New Jersey have been stopped by the industry's lobbying efforts.  Would raising minimum wage help? The proposed $15 minimum wage is a good thing. But, in low-wage temping, agencies live off a very slim margin to be profitable. I don't know how a $15 minimum wage would work in temp agencies in New Brunswick. It would create some very tumultuous times in the industry. I could envision situations where agencies might have to close or consolidate. That consolidation might not be a bad thing for the temp workers. There's no way of knowing. Why aren't temp workers in unions? The National Labor Relations Board's Browning vs. Ferris decision last year was a very significant step forward. It means, at least in principle, temp employees are able to get union recognition. In the past, it was nearly impossible for that to happen. The NLRB decision encourages unions to think seriously about organizing workers who are temporary. New Labor has been trying to figure out ways to work with unions. There certainly has been more coordination between worker centers, like New Labor, and unions nationally. Are you hopeful about the future for these workers? Yes. Temporary work is with us and it's not going to go away. If both temporary and permanent workers are represented by unions on a job site, then I think we have a model that might work better than the one that we have now. None of that is going to happen without a real fight and a real concerted effort by worker centers like New Labor and the unions they partner with. How do you solve the problem that many temps are immigrants living in the U.S. illegally? The only place a temp worker who is undocumented has rights is in the workplace. Wage and hour laws, workplace safety laws, discriminations laws still count even if a worker is undocumented. It's a matter of people wanting to stand up for themselves. And undocumented workers are going to have to take chances. The only way they are going to take a step forward is if they try to exercise those rights. There's a larger problem to be fixed on immigration on a national level with comprehensive immigration reform. I'm not hopeful that there will be much movement on immigration reform. But I am hopeful that workers will enforce their rights in the workplace, regardless of their immigration status. That's the place where they can focus their time and energy and experience immediate improvements. Kelly Heyboer may be reached at kheyboer@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @KellyHeyboer.

Awake and talking some, the Palatine boy remains in the intensive care unit at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. Courtesy of Rosie Rodriguez   Burt Constable Follow @BurtConstable     A popular waitress at Jelly Cafe in Mount Prospect, Rosie Rodriguez was handling the Friday lunch rush on Sept. 9 when she got a phone call that merely hinted at the life-altering disaster coming. Her 11-year-old son, Dary, had a headache and was in the nurse's office at Stuart R. Paddock School in Palatine, where he is a sixth-grader. They had no idea this could surpass other challenges they've faced. related advertisement   "When he was a baby, we'd sleep in the Wal-Mart (parking lot) because my son and me, we were homeless in Texas," says the 38-year-old. She moved there by herself 13 years ago from her hometown in Mexico, and Dary was born two years later. With no contact or support from the father, Rodriguez and Dary moved to Palatine when the boy was 2 and forged a happy life. Thumbing through photos on her phone to show her son dancing and having fun in selfies he sends daily to his aunts in Mexico, Rodriguez stumbles across pictures of a smiling Dary sitting next to backpacks and coolers on a cold park bench last winter in Chicago. "We made sandwiches and Mexican hot chocolate for homeless people. We take the train and every homeless person we see, we give it to them," Rodriguez says. The kindness they sow is coming back tenfold, mostly through a youcaring.com fundraising website set up by Kaitlin Kretsch, who owns the Jelly Cafe with her husband, Billy. "I can't believe it that people love me," Rodriguez says, wiping tears from her eyes. "I really appreciate it."    Rosie Rodriguez got a phone call from her son's school in Palatine saying Dary had a headache. But it turned out to be much more than that. The boy, 11, was flown to Lurie Children's Hospital that same day, where a neurocritical care team saved his life. Nurse Meredith Williams tends to him in the pediatric intensive care unit. - Gilbert R. Boucher II | Staff Photographer Even before anyone knew Dary's headache was the result of a near-fatal hemorrhage in his brain, Billy Kretsch was trying to help. While Rodriguez was waiting tables, he drove to the boy's school and told the nurse he was delivering chewable pain relievers. "By the time I was done with that conversation the nurse said, 'I think we should call an ambulance,'" Billy Kretsch says. The school called Rodriguez again. "They told me he's bad, bad, bad. He's crying," Rodriguez says. After Dary arrived at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights, doctors quickly decided to transfer the boy to Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. "He didn't know who I was," Rodriguez says, explaining how her son stared off into space. "I cried bad. I didn't want to think, just cry." As a fellow waitress drove a frantic Rodriguez, a helicopter rushed the now-unconscious boy to Lurie Children's Hospital, where Dr. Craig M. Smith, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit, says he "rallied the troops" in the neurocritical care team to deal with "an evolving brain catastrophe." "Time is brain," Smith says, meaning the more time that passes, the more a brain can be damaged. Pressure was building in Dary's brain because of bleeding caused by an arteriovenous malformation, a tangle of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins in the brain. The defect can go undetected for a lifetime, or it can start bleeding and cause problems at any age. If Dary had taken an ambulance fighting with traffic instead of the helicopter to Lurie, the outcome would have been different. "Ultimately, death. There's no other way around this," Smith says. "He was under such pressure and so sick when he came in." A team of Lurie specialists headed by neurosurgeons Tadanori Tomita and Robin Bowman and neuro-interventional radiologist Ali Shaibani stabilized Dary, drilled a hole in the boy's head that night and inserted a drain to relieve the pressure. Forty-eight hours later, they inserted a second drain for the other side of his brain. They kept Dary in a coma and took "meticulous control" of his temperature, electrolytes, glucose levels and anything else that could have taxed the boy's brain, Smith says. His mom slept by his side that first night and since then has been given a room in the nearby Ronald McDonald House. A week after the bleeding started, Dary was stable enough to undergo surgery to clip out the clump of problem blood-vessel tissue. Now, everyone is waiting to see how quickly and how well he recovers.    A waitress who goes out of her way to make others feel good, Rosie Rodriguez of Palatine says she is grateful for the outpouring of help after her son, Dary, 11, suffered life-threatening bleeding in his brain. - Gilbert R. Boucher II | Staff Photographer "They told me two weeks, two months, a year. They don't know," says his mom, who adds that she doesn't know what is covered under her Illinois All Kids insurance. "I pray so much and I say to my family, 'Pray for my kid.' I tell my Lord, 'Don't take my son.' He has to stay calmed down, so that's why I stopped crying." There are no guarantees, but Smith says he hopes doctors can get the boy starting rehabilitation soon and maybe even back in school before the year ends in the spring. "We find that kids can make remarkable recoveries," Smith says, telling stories of kids who go home in wheelchairs unable to speak, only to walk in for appointments six months later as if nothing had happened. "That's one of the most satisfying things I can be part of." In the meantime, Smith is impressed by the outpouring of support for Dary and his mother that has grown because of the Jelly Cafe owners, staff and customers. "It's pretty inspiring when people stand up for each other like that," Smith says. "I appreciate it so much," Rodriguez says. The waitress who drove her to the hospital stayed by her side for hours that first night. Another waitress drove to her apartment the next day and did the dishes. A neighbor took in two of Dary's three guinea pigs, and the Kretsches, parents of daughters Paige, 2½, and Hayden, 1, are looking after Tyson, the biggest guinea pig. Jelly Cafe is collecting donations for Dary and his mom at the restaurant and through the youcaring.com site, which is touted on posters and the cafe's menu. "One side has our specials, and the other side tells what's going on with Rosie," says Kaitlin Kretsch, who canceled Rodriguez's cable TV and Dary's after-school program and is looking for others ways to save money until the waitress can return to work. She says Rodriguez goes out of her way to help others. "I like to share whatever I have. My son is the same," Rodriguez says. "Sometimes, I have homeless people sleep in my house. He brings the pillows and blankets and asks, 'Are you OK? Do you need anything?'" She's a hit with diners. "I get more requests to sit in her section than I do for any other waitress. I've had people wait 45 minutes to sit in her section," Billy Kretsch says of Rodriguez. "She collects our recyclables to donate to her church. She collects clothing to donate to her church." Rodriguez is especially good with children and older people. "Rosie's always kissing kids on the head or trying to teach them Spanish," Kaitlin Kretsch says.   Shown during a winter outing to hand out sandwiches to the homeless in Chicago, Rosie Rodriguez and her son, Dary, 11, now are receiving help from others. - Courtesy of Rosie Rodriguez "I love it. It's my pleasure," Rodriguez says, explaining that she is driven to make people happy. "We don't know what happened in their homes, what happened in their lives." Now those customers know about the tough times she and Dary are facing. "Rosie, you may not have local family, but know that you have a tight-knit community who loves you and will be thinking of and praying for you and Dary," reads one youcaring post. "He's a great kid," says Rachel Bland, Dary's school principal, who is spreading the word. "As a community, we're going to do this." The donations should keep Rodriguez afloat until she can return to work, Kaitlin Kretsch says. "Her job would never be in jeopardy. She's got all the time she needs, however long it takes," Billy Kretsch says.   Shown during a winter outing to hand out sandwiches to the homeless in Chicago, Rosie Rodriguez and her son, Dary, 11, now are receiving help from others. - Courtesy of Rosie Rodriguez Rehab could be lengthy and difficult. But everyone has hope. Dary sat up Thursday, and even asked his mom to go back to work. "I want this kid to go back to being who he was," says Smith of Lurie Children's Hospital. "I want him to be a good boy," Dary's mom says, "and he is."

Speaking as someone with a diagnosis that worked in the service industry (worked at Walmart, grocery stores, and then was an over-glorified customer service rep for a cable company that advertised the position as "technical support" during hire, yeah) I was more or less totally annihilated by it to the point it made everything terrible. I actually quit the job because of how harmful and stressful it was to my mental health and my overall well-being. I tried to go back to school after that (it was a "safe zone" for me.) I did eventually buckle under it all. So, after a stay in the psych ward I've found my sense of "normal" for the most part now thankfully. I've personally had mental issues for a long time and avoiding of them in working them out I did two things, I was of mind to choke it back and keep going and simultaneously I was being a very "mind over matter" individual and tried to handle it all myself to a point, which lead to failure and me being about as nutty as Galvatron in G1 for a while. What you said though, that's not very promising. Service industry does take a special kind of person that is significantly more extroverted. "Ah, the power of public relations." Soundwave may be a Megatron fanboy, but I am as well. All Hail Megatron!

There are other jobs that hire with "no experience needed" But since you live in Georgia they assume you're already a handyman redneck who can fix a carburetor with a blindfold on. Which is unfair. I haven't applied yet, as my sleep schedule won't allow me to do much currently. What really sucks is being surrounded by people who aren't or have never dealt with any kind of mental illness aside from throwing me at a doctor. In their eyes i'm just a normal person who can handle anything "If I put my mind to it" If that were the case, I wouldn't be living here right now. Check out my Art Thread!

It's crazy how different freelance VS normal job hunting can be, in freelance half of the employers/people want you to talk yourself up like you're the next big thing while other expect you to be the most humble person ever.

Sep 24th 2016, 4:04 PM 63,197 Views 42 Comments Share74 Tweet Email File Photo Source: Tony Gutierrez CALIFORNIAN POLICE SAY a 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the arts-and-crafts section of a Walmart store in the Southern California desert, leading to losses of more than $1 million (€891,000). The store in Barstow remains closed for a fourth day as a result of the damage caused. Barstow police said in a statement that the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees tried to put it out with fire extinguishers but failed, and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters arrived and extinguished it, but serious damage was done by both fire and water. Police looked at surveillance video and saw the boy with a scooter and a backpack. He was found on a street corner later in the day. He was arrested and taken into custody.

Box store touts corporate citizenship, dodges taxes Lowes.JPG Lowe's Home Center in Daphne, Ala. Lowe's is challenging its property tax assessments throughout Alabama including the store at Ala. 181 and U.S. 90 in Daphne. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com). Print Email Kyle Whitmire | kwhitmire@al.com By Kyle Whitmire | kwhitmire@al.com AL.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 24, 2016 at 8:30 AM, updated September 26, 2016 at 8:51 AM comments Lowe's, I've got to hand it to you. If your store prices went as low as your newfangled tax strategy, you'd have to change your name to Wal-Mart. It's not like we shouldn't have seen something like this coming. Big box retailers have a long history outsmarting the taxman, starting even before you move into town. First, you tell city and county governments that you might set up show in their hometowns if the deal makes sense, which usually means millions of dollars in tax breaks and incentives. Take the store you recently built in Hartselle, for example. The city council there was so eager to have a Lowe's store that they gave up $1.2 million in sales taxes. All you had to do was pretend to be on the fence, and the locals did the rest. How's that go? "You can do it! We can help!" Sorry, that's the other guys' slogan. Regardless, they gave up $1.2 million, just for you. That's money that could have gone to schools or public safety, but instead, it helped pay for your new store. All under the assumption that at some point the city would have the opportunity to make that money back later. At least then, the city would have something. And something is better than nothing, right? It seemed that way at the time, but now it's not so clear. Once you planted your flag here, like a lot of big box retailers, you exploited loopholes in our tax laws and invented new schemes to avoid paying tax here. Already you've used tax avoidance schemes to dodge tens of millions in state income taxes. And now you want to dodge your property taxes, too. It isn't enough, I guess, that Alabama already has among the lowest property taxes in the country. You want to see how low Lowe's can go. I get it. I do. According to your filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you have more than $20 billion of property in the United States. That must be a heck of a tax bill. Unless, suddenly, it wasn't worth $20 billion anymore. As AL.com reporter John Sharp wrote this week, you have invented a new tax dodge called the "dark store" strategy. The idea here is that you want to value your stores, for property tax purposes, at what their market potential would be if you backed up a truck and moved on down the road, leaving an ugly cinderblock shell behind. I admit you have an interesting argument. When chain retailers and restaurants abandon their stores, it's often hard to find a new tenant. Just look at how many old Kentucky Fried Chickens have turned into Chinese restaurants or payday lenders, or how many old Wal-Marts and K-marts (may they rest in peace) have turned into thrift stores. Only you want to pay taxes now on brand new stores like they were already one of those ugly empty cinderblock boxes. It's a neat trick, and a lot of other big box retailers are watching to see if it works. If you are successful, you might cut commercial property taxes in half or less, for them and many others. That's clever, and if you reported to your shareholders that the $20 billion in property you have nationwide suddenly dropped the same way you want the tax man to appraise your stores, I might be inclined to accept it. But let's face it. If you told your stockholders tomorrow that you sunk $10 million into a new store somewhere and then saw those improvements lose 85 percent of their value in just two or three years, you'd have problems. If you told them that happened everywhere, you'd have a shareholder revolt.   This isn't just a tax avoidance scheme. It's a scam. One perpetrated on cities and towns, big and small, all over this country. You come in with the promise of being an economic engine and then make them pay for the gas. The courts might find your scheme to be legal, but it sure isn't neighborly. Sooner or later, it's going to backfire on you. Just listen to Baldwin County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey who told Sharp that if a Lowe's building isn't worth more than $1.5 million to you, it might be better suited for some other public purpose.   "If they feel that a Lowe's is worth $1.5 million, we can offer that to them and transform the Lowe's into a school," he told Sharp. That might sound like a lot of tough talk, but it's coming from someone who holds the power of eminent domain. It's time, Lowe's, for you to be socially responsible. What does that mean? "At Lowe's, it means we're accountable – to customers, to our people and to the communities we serve. It means we aim to do what's right – to find a solution that works for all of us. It means we strive to be trustworthy – to do what we say and keep our commitments." That's what your CEO Robert Niblock wrote in his CEO letter last year, which he titled "What does it mean to be socially responsible?" In retrospect, however, he seems to have meant that as a question rather than a statement. Columnists John Archibald Kyle Whitmire Roy S.

And near the water tower and the Walmart is a pleasant neighborhood of septuagenarians. Curl around the back road and there’s a sweet brick house with white shutters but two contradictory signs posted. One has a picture of pumpkins and says: “WELCOME.” The other? “RESERVED PARKING — CUBS FANS ONLY.” Sure enough, Jake Arrieta’s grandmother lives here. The reigning Cy Young Award winner and Cubs star starter was born 30 years ago in nearby Farmington. New parents Lou and Lynda Arrieta moved to Texas four months later, but Lynda’s mother remained in Missouri. And now, at 76, Nancy Sheets is probably the biggest Cubs fan in Cardinals country. She watches every single Cubs game — not just every fifth one — sometimes in her light-blue Cubs T-shirt or bundled in her Cubs blanket, but always wearing her baseball-glove necklace, a gift from Jake. “I put it on the first day of spring training,” Nancy said, “and I don’t take it off until the season is over.” On Friday afternoon, Arrieta pitched in Chicago against the Cardinals. “I’ve said several prayers,” Nancy said, moments before the first pitch. “I started last night.” In the carpeted living room, there are two plush chairs and a couch, but it does not matter – Nancy will be standing. Well, pacing. Her hair is as white as home plate, and as she spots her grandson, her smile is as wide as a strike zone. Jake’s grandfather died in 2003. Nancy married Jerry Sheets three years later. They knew each other from church. Today, Jerry is controlling the remote, while Nancy tries to control her emotions. “Nervous, nervous, nervous!” she said. “You’d think I wouldn’t be nervous because I watched him all these years.” When she cheers, she often repeats a word – “Yes! Yes!” – or a sound – “Woo! Woo!” She watches pitches with her left hand gently pressed upon her chin. And when she celebrates, as when Jake struck out the first two batters in the first, she sticks her right arm in the air and opens her palm, like she’s trying to get the teacher’s attention. “She was over at her sister’s one night, and tore up the light!” Jerry said. “I didn’t mean to!” Nancy replied. “I jumped up and the light was kind of low. And I broke it. It was glass.” “I was sittin’ there on the couch!” Jerry said. “Couldn’t believe it.” Two outs, two strikes on Stephen Piscotty. “Come on, one more,” Nancy said, as a fastball froze the Cardinal to end the inning. “He’s listening to his Nanny! He calls me Nanny.” Getting together Nancy and Jerry’s first date was in Festus. “Pogolino’s Pizza Place,” Nancy said. Jerry Sheets lost his wife in 2004. In due time, he felt comfortable with Nancy. “We started going to church together,” Jerry said. “And we got married down in Branson in 2006.” Jerry used to play his acoustic guitar at church, years ago. Now he plays at home for Nancy — perhaps some Merle Haggard or Don Williams — or at local nursing homes, performing bluegrass, gospel or country. “He sings well,” Nancy said. The two occasionally go out to dinner, and seemingly every time that Nancy wears a Cubs shirt, someone will say, as Nancy excitedly imitated in a high-pitched voice: “What are you doing wearing?” She’ll politely explain to the Cardinals fans that her grandson is a Cub. “They can’t believe it sometimes!” she said. “They’ll want their picture taken with me.” It happens at Colton’s Steak House & Grill. And The Pasta House Co. Even at the service station at Cherokee Pass, where Jerry parked his motorcycle, “And a lady comes out and jumped all over me: ‘Whuddya wearing a Cubs shirt in here for?’” It gives the proud grandmother and step-grandfather a chance to show off. “And for a long time,” she said, “the days that he pitched, I would get blue helium balloons and tie them outside our house, on our little bench.” They don’t like the Cubs down in Desloge, but they do like Jake Arrieta. OK, but maybe just a little less on Friday. Nancy’s grandson struck out 10 Cardinals in his seven scoreless innings pitched, as he earned his 18th win of the season. Jake’s earned run average dipped to 2.85. And he allowed just five hits, so his opponents’ batting average is .186, the lowest of any starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. Deep roots When Arrieta was a boy, his grandfather would pick him up in a plane. Nancy’s first husband, Sonny, was a pilot of a small aircraft. Sonny would scoop up his first grandson in Texas and bring him to Missouri. And then sometimes, before they’d fly back to Texas, they’d first play catch in a nearby ballyard. “My late husband would have been so proud,” Nancy said. Nancy’s father has since passed, too. Herschel. He lived on a farm in Frankclay, an unincorporated community five miles west of the Flat River. On a wall near her living room, Nancy pointed out important family photos — Sonny, with his distinguished mustache; Jake, just married with his wife and a smile; Herschel, an elderly man next to a horse. Jake’s mother and little Jake sat atop. Turns out Arrieta’s great-grandpa, who died about two decades ago, was a huge Cardinals fan. “My dad was a farmer, an old-time farmer,” Nancy said, “and wore bibbed overalls with a long-sleeved shirt. But when then the Cardinals played, he’d put a Cardinals shirt on – and tennis shoes.” Benjamin Hochman @hochman on Twitter bhochman@post-dispatch.com Sports columns 10 Questions: Hochman on St. Louis sports Sep 23, 2016 (…) Sports Box score: Cubs 5, Cardinals 0 Sep 23, 2016 (…) Sports The Hoch Corner: Benjamin Hochman's forum for STL sports fans Sep 2, 2015 (…) Sports More Hochman: Columns, blogs, videos, podcasts Sep 6, 2015 (…) More information Cardinals notes: Cards put Garcia back in rotation Lefthander will start Monday against Reds.

Filed on September 24, 2016 | Last updated on September 24, 2016 at 12.26 pm Share More > Vote The store in Barstow remains closed for a third day on Friday because of the damages. (Alamy Image) The store in Barstow remains closed for a third day on Friday because of the damages. Police say a 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the arts-and-crafts section of a Wal-Mart store in the Southern California desert, leading to losses of more than $1 million. The store in Barstow remains closed for a third day on Friday because of the damages. Barstow police said in a statement that the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees tried to put it out with fire extinguishers but failed, and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters arrived and extinguished it, but serious damage was done by both fire and water. Police looked at surveillance video and saw the boy with a scooter and a backpack. He was found on a street corner later in the day. He was arrested and taken to juvenile hall. Share More > Vote MORE FROM Offbeat Offbeat 12-year-old sets fire in Wal-Mart, causes $1m...

The box was found at Walmart on a shelf, for sale with a retail price of $70. @jasonhowell @androidshow @Ohthatflo @ronxo saw this Mi Box at Walmart today for $69. Was this released yet? pic.twitter.com/AsuNZeU5oJ George Garrett (@garrettdotcom) September 23, 2016 Since its announcement, not much was known about pricing or when we could expect to see the Android TV box in stores. Reports pointed toward an October launch in the US. It looks like perhaps a store had them early and didnt know they had to wait to put it out. Or it could also be that some Walmart stores are now putting them on shelves. Unfortunately, the Mi Box is nowhere to be found on Walmarts website. If we dont see it pop up on the website in the next few days, then it looks like this particular store stocked the item too early. With the rumors of an impending release for a new generation Chromecast with 4K-capable video and possible HDR-compatibility, and with the same rumored price of $70, it looks like the Chromecast could have some deep competition this Holiday Season.

(Reena Rose Sibayan/Journal photo) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on September 24, 2016 at 3:00 AM comments On Sept. 5, police were investigating a possible theft in the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter at 400 Park Plaza Drive in Secaucus when they came across a separate incident — a man caught red-handed trying steal from the store, police said. Juan Rodriguez, 41, of the Bronx, was leaving the store with a backpack full of $561.54 worth of electronic devices when officers placed him under arrest, police said. The following day, two more men were arrested at the store when they allegedly tried stealing PlayStation controllers. For Secaucus cops, responding to these types of calls at Walmart is to be expected. Since Aug. 3, there have been 11 arrests at the superstore — 10 for alleged shoplifting and one for an attempted shortchange scheme, cops say. The week of Aug. 18 alone saw four arrests made at Walmart. While data is not yet available for 2016, police say that over 12 percent of all Secaucus Police Department arrests in 2015 were at Walmart — 121 of 964 arrests. Incidents at Walmart (458) accounted for 4 percent of the police department's total number of town-wide service calls in 2015. And while the superstore, which opened in 2004, is a frequent stop for Secaucus police officers, all of the people arrested there are not Secaucus residents. "Walmart is a big place and people come from all over to go there — from New York to other parts of Hudson and Bergen County," Capt. Dennis Miller said. "(Secaucus) is located centrally and is easily accessible to all these places. The other thing is that this one is open 24 hours a day." The store also generates millions of dollars in tax revenue for Secaucus. The Sam's Club and Walmart — both operated under the same company — contributed $1.5 million in tax revenue in 2015 for the town, and has thus far contributed nearly $1.2 million date this year, according to electronic tax records. Nonetheless, Mayor Michael Gonnelli said the town would like to sit down with Walmart officials and negotiate the cost of having an officer permanently positioned inside the store. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," Walmart spokeswoman Betsy Harden said in a statement. This would be in addition to Walmart's loss prevention staff, as well as a third party security firm that works overnight hours, Harden said. "They have loss prevention that works there already," Miller said. "We had met with one representative of Walmart to discuss them having a cop there full time — to be stationed down there as a detail and that officer would handle the call volume from there. But there's nothing to report on that right now."

Rashaad Moore, a high school sophomore, was shopping with his neighbor, a disabled veteran named Ray, when the man began having a heart attack inside the chain’s Fort Wayne, Indiana, store, KTLA affiliate WANE-TV reported. Moore didn’t wait for paramedics — he immediately started giving Ray CPR and is now credited with saving his neighbor’s life. Walmart manager Darlene Walker went to Northrop High School Friday and met Moore after school to thank him with two gifts: a 50-inch smart TV and a $100 gift card. Walker said she was “very pleased with what he did to stand up and help because that doesn’t happen every day.” With a wide smile, Moore said he was surprised and grateful for the support, saying, “I am very blessed that everybody is showing support and love, and I’m very appreciative.” Moore said he has a television that’s about 20 years old and is happy to be able to replace it. His friend Ray is still recovering and isn’t yet able to communicate, but Moore said he hopes to talk to him in the next few weeks. In May, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote a letter to Walmart’s president urging the company to “to examine its internal security protocol to ensure effective deterrence measures are in place and reduce the burden on local police.” Rather than relying on taxpayer-funded police forces, Walmart could cut down on criminal activity at its stores with more staffing, uniformed security and better layouts, according to a report by the Tampa Bay Times. The newspaper found that authorities were dispatched to Walmart for disorderly incidents such as drunk customers and aggressive panhandlers more often than they were for shoplifting. Casey wrote that “large retailers like Walmart bear responsibility to have in place reasonable security measures to assist in the deterrence of frivolous crimes.” 41.079273 -85.139351 Filed in: Nation/World, News Topics: Indiana, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Facebook Popular Arizona Grandmother’s Accidental Invite to Wrong Teen for Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Viral Texas Teacher Impregnated by 13-Year-Old Student She Had Sex With ‘on Almost Daily Basis’ Pleads Guilty: Report JetBlue Flash Sale Offers Flights as Low as $34; Book by Wednesday Video Shows Chili’s Manager Taking Away Free Meal From Army Veteran in Texas Latest News LA Auto Show- Opening Day Holidays at Disneyland Resort McDonald’s to Offer Table Service, Touch Screen Ordering at US Locations Fire Crews Respond to Pallet Yard Fire Burning in Perris Nation/World Tornados Barrel Through Central Indiana, Flattening Starbucks at Mall Nation/World Video of Indiana State Troopers Lip-Syncing to ‘Summer Nights’ at State Fair Goes Viral Nation/World Small Metal Blade Found Inside Candy Bar After Indiana Girl Bites Into Halloween Candy Nation/World Pennsylvania Man Crawls from Car Wreck 3 Days After Crash Kills Girlfriend Nation/World Suspected Meth Lab Discovered Under Walmart Parking Lot in New York Nation/World Indiana Police Officer Lies on Floor to Comfort Tearful Young Boy Having ‘Rough’ Day Nation/World Heroin Laced With Elephant Tranquilizer on The Streets; 10,000 Times Stronger Than Morphine Nation/World Indiana Mother Told Police She Used Her Hands to ‘Smother’ Two Young Children to Death: Court Documents Local News Sex Offender Suspected of Recording Girl, 10, in Walmart Bathroom Near San Diego: Sheriff’s Dept.

The meeting comes two years after the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the shooting of John Crawford III at a Beavercreek Wal-Mart. Crawford family attorney Michael Wright told the Dayton Daily News he hopes the Sept. 30 meeting provides insight into why the investigation is taking so long. Justice Department officials didn’t immediately return calls for comment Friday. A 911 caller on Aug. 5, 2014, reported a man waving a gun at the store. It was actually an air rifle taken from a shelf. Police say Crawford refused to drop it. The officer wasn’t charged.

Source: AAP 24 Sep 2016 - 1:32 PM  UPDATED 24 Sep 2016 - 1:32 PM Tweet A 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the arts-and-crafts section of a Wal-Mart store in the Southern California desert, leading to losses of more than $US1 million ($A1.3 million), police say. The store in Barstow remained closed for a third day on Friday because of the damages. Barstow police said in a statement the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees had tried in vain to put it out with extinguishers, and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters had put the fire out, but serious damage was done by flames and water. Police saw the boy on surveillance video footage with a scooter and a backpack and found him on a street corner later in the day. He was arrested and taken to juvenile hall.

The school is resolute that my remarks focus not just on the history of those days, but rather speak to ways young people today can actively honor the legacy of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. It’s one thing to merely remember the courageous sacrifices made by those charging the cockpit with a drink cart on United Flight 93, or by those Marines pushing the flag into place atop Mount Suribachi in the South Pacific. But it’s another to actively honor those heroes. I recently challenged students at my school: “Stop the veteran walking through Walmart and say thank you. At church, greet those who serve and tell them you are praying for them. Remember they are all around you at ball games, so shut your mouths, take off your hats and stand respectfully during the national anthem. Follow their example and choose humility, putting the needs of others ahead of your own selfish desires and comforts. When we say the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, remember that flag on the wall is more than a piece of cloth. Remember it is a visual representation of that soldier and their sacrifice. You may not be able to go back in time and say a verbal thank you to those who died storming the beaches of Normandy or storming up stairwells of the World Trade Center. But by the respect you give to the flag they served under, the flag that draped their caskets, the flag that was folded and presented to their hurting families, it’s your way of giving them the gratitude they earned and the dignity they deserve.” So let me take this time to offer a hearty thank you to the Indiana Fever players and organization for undermining everything I try to do in the classroom. Spare me the mindless drivel about how the Fever were “embodying the spirit of that flag” in their protest. Don’t lecture about how the First Amendment protects their right to be disrespectful. No one is arguing that point. We are arguing that by choosing this particular form of protest it is solving no problem, but adding to one; it is resolving no conflict, but fueling one; it is relieving no divide, but deepening one. Leftist sports writers will puff up to defend them by saying silly things like how courageous these players are for using their platform to “create conversation.” Indianapolis sportswriter Bob Kravitz dramatically gushed, “United they stand. Or sit. Or kneel. You don’t have to like it. But you have to talk about it. Which is, in the end, the entire point.” Wait, what? The entire point of them kneeling during the anthem is to get us all talking about them kneeling during the anthem? What good is that? What does it accomplish? Nothing, of course, other than creating or furthering a racial divide, and sadly lending undeserved legitimacy to the lawlessness and social anarchy so closely tied to the Black Lives Matter movement. To the degree Kravitz is right, he accidentally exposes the annoying truth about these spectacles. Ultimately they are self-serving attempts by people desperate to be known for something more meaningful than putting balls into baskets or end zones. I can’t and won’t bemoan any athlete’s desire to use their platform to do good. But I can and will criticize their efforts when it does the exact opposite. If the Indiana Fever players are truly interested in racial reconciliation then they should understand their conduct is as unproductive as those on the opposite side of the divide shouting “All Lives Matter.” Offending people is not typically an effective strategy for engaging a problem, whether it is your right to do so or not. Instead of taking a knee, how about taking the time to thoughtfully lay out your solutions? I may not agree with your call for reparations, racial quotas for police forces, more gun control, or the expansion of hate crimes laws. And you may not agree with my call for school choice scholarships in the inner cities, censure for grievance mongering, the end of no fault divorce, or teaching the Biblical view of race in schools. But at least we’ll be talking about something meaningful. Kneeling for the anthem promotes rebellion, disrespect, resentment and division. If you’re doing it or applauding it, you’re part of the problem you pretend to protest. Peter Heck is a speaker, author and teacher.

Jonesboro police were called to Walmart, 1911 West Parker Road, in regards to someone shoplifting shortly after 4 p.m. Saturday.  According to the police report, William Keasler, 42, peeled tags off of less expensive items then placed them on several items he wanted to purchase. Keasler reportedly placed a $1 price tag on a $16 belt, a $.97 tag on a $19.96 shirt while doing the same with several other pieces of merchandise.  An employee confronted Keasler about the tags when he was checking out. When police arrived, Keasler told them he was short on money and admitted to switching the price tags so he could pay less for his items. The price differences ended up being $56.30, according to the report.  Police arrested Keasler and took him to the Craighead County Detention Center where he was cited for theft of property.  Copyright 2016 KAIT.

Several WV employers excel in disability equality - Business, Government Legal News from throughout WV Member Center: Create Account| Log In Manage Account| Log Out SITE SEARCHWEB SEARCH BY Home News Business Government Energy Law Opinion Lynne D. Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings Several WV employers excel in disability equality Posted: Thursday, September 22, 2016 11:56 AM EDT Updated: Saturday, October 22, 2016 11:56 AM EDT By Jim Ross Several companies, each with a large presence in West Virginia, scored 80 percent or better on this year’s Disability Equality Index. Scoring 80 percent or better allows companies to describe themselves as a member of the “2016 DEI Best Places to Work” list. DEI tracks indicators of corporate disability inclusion, such as access, employment practices, culture and leadership and community engagement and support services. The survey gives companies an opportunity to evaluate policies and practices as well as to determine where a company stands in regard to being a best in class organization for disability inclusion practices. Companies scoring 100 percent included DuPont and Walmart. Those scoring 90 percent or more included CSX, CVS Healthcare and Walgreens. On the list of those scoring at least 80 percent were American Electric Power, Dow and UPS. A score of 100 does not mean to convey perfection. Rather it means a company adheres to many of the numerous leading disability inclusion practices featured in the DEI. “We’re proud to have achieved this recognition because it reflects the open dialogue with employees,” said Diana Sorfleet, vice president, chief human resources and chief diversity officer for CSX. “CSX continues to foster an environment where people from different backgrounds and experiences can contribute a variety of perspectives and solutions.” The DEI is a joint initiative between the US Business Leadership Network (USBLN) and the American Association of People with Disabilities. The 2016 DEI was completed by 83 companies. “By receiving a top score on the DEI, companies demonstrate significant business leadership, going far beyond compliance activities, driving their business success through leading disability inclusion policies and practices,” said Jill Houghton, executive director of USBLN.

But despite the decline in consumption that began in the mid-’70s, a particular type of beef is rapidly rising in popularity. According to Nielsen, sales of grass-fed beef rose by 40 percent in 2015 over 2014 numbers, compared with a 6.5 percent increase for conventional beef. Today, you can get grass-fed beef franks at Major League Baseball parks, grass-fed beef burgers at the drive-through, and packets of grass-fed ground beef at mega-grocers such as Walmart. For an alternative meat product to achieve such mainstream status in a relatively short period of time is, on some level, a success story. After all, grass-fed production systems are celebrated for raising animals outside of confinement and can have a reduced environmental footprint compared with grain-fed beef. Defining what grass-fed beef is can be a challenge, and what lies behind the rising sales is equally murky. Despite sales being up significantly in the past year, grass-fed beef accounted for less than 2 percent of the overall beef market, according to the USDA. Furthermore, the acceptance of grass-fed beef by American diners doesn’t mean that more American ranchers are moving away from conventional beef production. Overall beef imports to the U.S. have been trending downward for about a decade, but two of the largest foreign suppliers of U.S. beef are New Zealand and Australia—and meat cattle operations in both countries are based in large part on pasture, not feedlots. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, “Most imported beef is lower-valued, grass-fed beef destined for processing, primarily as ground beef.” That’s been the case for a while, but as the market changes, all it takes is some new branding, and the same ground beef that was sold as “ground beef” a few years ago can suddenly become a hip new product with a not-insignificant green halo. The hormone- and antibiotic-free grass-fed burger that Carl’s Jr. debuted in 2014—to much fanfare—is made with 100 percent Australian beef. “When consumers see grass-fed on a label, they have this vision in mind that the meat came from not-too-far away, from animals out on a pasture and not given antibiotics and hormones and in many cases, that’s not the truth,” Marilyn Noble, a spokeswoman for the American Grassfed Association, told the Wall Street Journal. Domestic producers have seen their sales rise too, according to research from the Wallace Center, a nonprofit working to reform the food system, which found that U.S. grass-fed beef sales hit $400 million in 2013, compared with just $5 million in 1998. If you’re buying beef raised on pasture because you want to take part in the local ag economy, then shopping will require a bit more work than grabbing the first thing you see at the store with “grass-fed” printed on the label. There was a USDA process-verified label for grass-fed beef, which required that animals be raised only on grass or forage, but it was rescinded this year (much to the chagrin of organizations that support small farms). The American Grassfed Association has established its own standards, which also require a diet consisting solely of grass and forage, in addition to restricting the use of antibiotics, hormones, and confinement. All AMA-labeled beef comes from animals that were born and raised in the United States.

Students who finish the programme, dubbed the “MicroMasters”, and pass the final exams can get certificates of completion for about $1 000. If they want to go still further, they'll have a leg up in applying for regular admission to complete a full-fledged degree. In short: Learn now, apply later. The MicroMasters, which MIT offers for supply chain management, covers about a quarter of the material in a typical master's degree programme and involves subjects in critically short supply in the workplace. The certificates are likely to carry weight with employers because of the quality of the universities standing behind them. Among them, Columbia University is offering artificial intelligence; the Rochester Institute of Technology, project management; and the University of Michigan, user-experience research and design. Wal-Mart Stores gave MIT's certificate a strong endorsement in a statement on the launch, calling it “a powerful way for people to learn the important skills required to be successful.” The universities can keep costs low because the courses are online. The offerings help fulfill their educational mission while attracting students who could end up going for full degrees and paying tuition. The programme comes as schools, including top universities, are increasingly experimenting with online education, offering “micro-credentials” and expanding their outreach - and their brands. The MicroMasters is being offered through edX, the online education platform co-founded by MIT and Harvard University. Harvard “looks forward to offering a MicroMasters programme in the future,” edX statement said in a statement on Tuesday announcing the programs. MIT, the originator of the MicroMasters, launched its pilot programme in supply chain management earlier this year. It involves five courses lasting 10 weeks each, requiring eight to 10 hours of work per week per course. The school says 27 000 students enrolled, of whom 3 500 are working toward a certificate. By contrast, only 40 students are admitted each year to MIT's traditional, 10-month master's degree in supply chain management. MIT President Rafael Reif said in an interview that the MicroMasters programme is close to his heart because he was raised and educated in Venezuela and understands how hard it is for most people to get an education at a world-class school. After teaching in Caracas, he earned a doctorate in electrical engineering at Stanford, taught there for a year, and then got hired by MIT. “I hit the lottery,” he said. Reif called MicroMasters “an experiment in what I call inverted admissions. Anybody anywhere can try to take those courses online.” If the concept works well, he said, it may be expanded to other parts of MIT. “It is an important project for me,” he said. “I believe in the model of empowering people.” Other schools offering MicroMasters include Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management, Australian National University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Indian Institute of Management/Bangalore, and Catholic University of Louvain (or Leuven), in Belgium.

Bolus’ Trump trucks on a recent afternoon. Anti-social media spasmed Thursday with reports of “scary clowns” appearing across Northeast Pennsylvania, but I swear Bob Bolus and I were only on the road for a couple of hours. Times-Tribune Web Editor Ted Baird came along for the ride, an afternoon jaunt on the Donald Trump Express. A Northeast Pennsylvania trucking magnate and diehard supporter of the Republican presidential nominee, Bob challenged me — a diehard Trump detractor — to tour the valley in his “Trump Truck,” which pulls a trailer tattooed with Trump slogans. Bob has more than one of these trailers, but wouldn’t say how many. I brought along a “Share Size” bag of Skittles and offered some to Bob. He declined, and didn’t seem to get the reference. He was laser-focused on showing me the light at the end of the Trump tunnel. “You can bet your ass you’re gonna be greeted with ‘deplorables’ who have something to say,” Bob said, riffing on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s recent description of half of Trump supporters fitting into a “basket of deplorables.” The media and many Trumpeters seized upon the phrase as a rallying cry, but I’d wager that the word that most stuck in their craw was “irredeemable.” “You could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the ‘basket of deplorables’ … some of those folks, they are irredeemable,” the former first lady, senator and secretary of state said. Ugh. Apology not accepted It is always a mistake to insult voters. It is a sin to judge anyone ineligible for redemption. Hillary has since apologized for damning a sizeable portion of the electorate, but no one I spoke with Thursday was interested in listening. Vein of frustration Steve Rakauskas laughed when I asked why he didn’t like Hillary. He listed “Benghazi” and her private email server among other affronts as we baked in the late-summer heat of the Wal-Mart parking lot in Taylor. I pointed out that eight (!) Republican investigations turned up zero evidence that anyone did anything illegal. It didn’t matter. Hillary Clinton has been a fixture in American politics for the better part of 40 years. Donald Trump is a novice, which is attractive to Steve. A machine operator who earns $12 an hour at Scranton Products in Moosic, Steve is a registered Republican and a volunteer firefighter in Ransom Twp. He said Trump has tapped into a genuine vein of frustration among those who want America to “be the way it used to be.” “I went up to that (Outlaw Music Festival) at Montage,” he said. “My buddy wore a Trump T-shirt and when we got up there, he said, ‘Maybe this wasn’t a good idea.’ I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. You’re entitled to your opinion, just like anybody else.’ You wouldn’t believe how many people came up just to shake his hand.” Steve also likes Trump’s preposterous promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico —and have Mexico pay for it. Bob insists it can be done. As he steered us toward the Viewmont Mall, I reminded Bob that back in 2007, I visited Yuma, Arizona, with Pennsylvania Army and Air National Guard troops sent to give the appearance of securing the border. I saw firsthand how futile it is to try and police nearly 2,000 miles of mostly wild terrain, let alone wall it off. Bob was unmoved. He said if I traveled the interstates, I would see that American contractors are “building walls all over the place,” mostly to block traffic noise in residential areas. After asking if he really thought the two types of structures were even remotely comparable (he did), I told Bob I could buy a $50 ladder at Lowe’s and scale Trump’s Wall. “I’d rather shoot you off a ladder than try to find you crawling under the wire,” he said. He was grinning, but not kidding. Talk about false equivalency.     Some for, some against We parked in the Viewmont lot and quickly attracted interest. The first to walk up was Holly Lane, a registered Democrat from New York who was in the area visiting friends. A 66-year-old IT professional, Holly is also an amateur photographer who couldn’t pass on the chance to snap a shot of the Trump Truck. I asked Holly if she was a fan of The Donald. “Not really,” she said, but she still wasn’t sure who to vote for. “We’ll have to wait and see,” she said. Edie Walters, 57, and her son, Leonard Kakareka, 28, of Dalton, made up their minds long ago. Republicans and self-described conservatives, they are voting Trump. “I really want that wall,” said Leonard, a former carpenter on disability. He said the wall would cut the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants from Mexico — and keep Mexico from stealing American fish. This charge against our southern neighbors was new to me, but obviously important to Leonard. Edie also stood up for Trump, saying, “He is gonna make America great again.” “What does that mean?” I asked. She said that building the wall, for instance, would put a lot of people to work. So would increasing the number of border guards. “So it’s like a jobs program?” I asked. “Yes!” Edie replied, adding that Trump “tells it like it is,” a mantra repeated many times by the Trumpeters we met. “But he’s been shown to have been not a man of his words many, many times,” I said. “He forgets,” Edie said. “He’s old... He’s not a speaker.” Trump is 70. Hillary is 68. Monday night, they will face off for the first of three debates. The people I met Thursday all said they were looking forward to the event. None of them were deplorable. They were fellow Americans who see this race differently than I do, but discussed it with me calmly and respectfully. No one is irredeemable — even Donald Trump. Scathing indictment But he is deplorable and dangerous. That he is a candidate for the presidency is a scathing indictment of both major parties. As Vice President Joe Biden admitted back in July, the political class — particularly Democrats — have lost touch with the working class. The disconnect has become so vast and visceral that millions of Americans have turned to a wealthy, foolhardy fabulist who lies just about every time he opens his mouth. That’s a shame, and there are truckloads of blame to go around. Contact the writer: kellysworld@timesshamrock.com; @cjkink on Twitter.

Carrero for The Victoria Advocate Wagner's Hardware and Gifts • WHERE: 110 N. Esplanade St., Cuero HOURS: Hardware Store: 8 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays; Gift shop: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, 9 a.m.- 4 p.m. Saturdays. Closed Sundays • MORE INFORMATION: Call 361-275-5134 CUERO - When customers walk into Wagner's Hardware and Gifts they're in the atmosphere of an early 1900s hardware store. It's been in the Wagner family for three generations, in a location that has always been a hardware store. Almost all building infrastructure is original including the wall cabinets, display units, longleaf pine floor and wall shelving. The only updated infrastructure is the inner shelving. The building, located at 110 N. Esplanade, was built in 1891 by R.C. Warren and operated as R.C. Warren Hardware. Walter Pettit Wagner bought the store in 1945 from family members of R.C. Warren. Walter Pettit Wagner ran the hardware store with is wife, Faye Wagner, until he died in 1957. His son, Walter Robert Wagner, started helping his mother manage the store after his father's death. Walter Reed Wagner and his wife, Beverly Wagner, bought the store in 1989 from his grandmother, Faye Wagner, who worked at the store until her death in the late 1990s. Beverly Wagner, 59, said she doesn't know if the store will pass on to the next generation of Wagners and if her son or daughter will own or manage the family business. "We are passionate about keeping the old hardware store going," she said. "If it will go to the next generation, if it will be continued, we don't know. If it happens that will be wonderful. If it doesn't, if they follow their own paths, that's wonderful too, because that's really what life's about." Commercial stores such as Walmart have not hurt the business, Wagner said. The store is diversified because of the customer service and the convenience of locating products. Although the business is a privately owned hardware store, the Wagners keep the products competitively priced. "Our niche is different because not everybody wants to go into the big boxes, they want to go in and out and get what they want. They know where it is. We don't move it around," she said. The Wagners sell products from craftsmen from across the United States. For example, they sell knives made by a blacksmith from Arizona who makes hammer forged carbon steel knives. "You can see how that's made," she said. "Look at all the wood, I mean, he does that by hand. See the blade goes all the way through." The store sells lamps that are made by a craftsman in Arkansas. The store has lamps in house that were made from an old-time lantern, water pump, saddle and a wagon hub. The store also sells original safes that were made in the 1800s. By the safes and lamps, the store features Amish furniture made by hand from Pennsylvania. "You see how diverse we are?" Wagner asked. "This is how we set ourselves apart from the other stores." Genelle Goyen, owner of Goyen Electric Inc. in Victoria, said Wagners Hardware and Gifts has anything someone could possibly want. Goyen bought a candle during a recent visit, but planned to come back again to purchase small statues and cards. "I like it because it's unique," Goyen, 79, said. "You just don't go find it on every corner like your major franchises. It's an education when you come here. You see things that you forgot about or you never knew existed." On the walls top shelves of the hardware store sit items original to the store when the Wagners first bought it and before. These items are not for sale. A wagon wheel that sits on one of the shelves brought back childhood memories for Goyen. "My family had a farm in East Texas," Goyen said. "I remember when they had a wagon. What they did to plow their fields, they used a mule." Old lanterns on the shelf reminded her of the storm cellar that was on the farm. Her family would keep canned food and use the cellar when bad weather came. The hardware store sells antique items such as machinist tool boxes, cannon balls and plow discs. The store sells simple items as well such as glass milk jugs filled with marbles. "It takes me back to the first grade," Wagner said. "Pop the little top and drink the chocolate milk." Most of the outdoor furniture available at the store are from a craftsman in San Antonio who the Wagners have worked with for 23 years. The furniture is made from wolmanized pine wood and with no staples or nails, Wagner said. In addition, the hardware store sells full service electric, plumbing and steel power equipment. The store has an in house steel power equipment repair shop and will work on equipment sold from the businesses or elsewhere. When customers walk up stairs from the hardware store to the gift shop that opened in 2002 they see historical pictures of Cuero from the 1900s that show old businesses in town and the Turkey Trot - now Turkeyfest - the town hosts yearly. "We're preserving the past for future generations to see," Wagner said. The gift shop sells a variety of antiques and crafted products including wool blankets hand woven from Mexico, a German beer table, an antique roll top desk, railroad carts and theater seats. The gift shop sells ducks carved of old cedar posts from a craftsman in Colorado. The shop also sells cow hides that are tanned in Brazil that can be used to cover furniture or hang on the wall. The Wagners get their hardware inventory from a major hardware wholesaler, unique crafted items from craftsmen across the U.S. and antiques from contacts they have made over the last 20 years, Wagner said. "Our big passion is to continue to offer quality products, excellent customer service, really unique products, and a place where even if you don't come in and purchase something that you feel welcome and it feels inviting," Wagner said. "A positive experience in any business grows 10 fold."

But from the time she learned about the group in 2011 when her youngest of three children, Alexander, joined the U.S. Marine Corps and she read about them on a website dedicated to families of Marines, Schuetz can’t help but think of those women. “I feel the lord placed it on my heart,” Schuetz said. “It’s a whole new avenue of military families I didn’t know about. That’s the most heartbreaking thing you can have happen to your family. I said, ‘I’ll take care of it.’” True to her word, Schuetz has made it her mission to honor and celebrate Gold Star Mothers and to educate the people in Stockton about them. Gold Star Mothers Day was declared as the last Sunday of September by Congress in 1936 “but hardly anyone knows it,” Schuetz said. Most people she encounters don’t even know what a Gold Start Mother is, she said, although presidential candidate Donald Trump’s disrespect for a Gold Star family that spoke at the National Democratic Convention in July put a spotlight on them. Schuetz turned a more positive, and powerful light on Gold Star Mothers for the first time five years ago when she and her mother in law, Eunice Schutez, created luminary kits and invited friends, family, neighbors and fellow members of The Bridge church to light the candles placed inside bags at dusk on the last Sunday of September. She’ll celebrate Gold Star Mothers Day today in the same way, but after five years, she’ll be joined by many others. Eunice Schuetz gathered some of her neighbors in her home on Monday and Tuesday to put together 400 luminary kits. They worked in assembly-line fashion with materials donated by The Bridge, Raley’s, the Lodi Wal-Mart and Carando Technologies. Joan Hinds filled plastic bags with sand “because I have no skills,” she said. Oscar Vasquez separated white lunch sacks, through which Deanna Schuetz had punched a star in the middle to allow the light to shine through, into groups of four. Kasia Vasquez and Juanita Chvez assembled the kits and Rusty Haley, a friend from The Bridge, and neighbor Jill Berdahl tore apart stacks of perforated cards of information that are included in each sack. Recipients, including those who visited their booth at Weberstown Mall on Friday and Saturday, are asked to set up the bags with battery-powered tealight candles at dusk today. (The sand helps hold the bag and candle in place). Watching the group work together — without Deanna, who was returning from a run for Marines in San Diego held last weekend — it was obvious that it was a labor of love. “It’s an appreciation of the military,” said Eunice Schuetz, who comes from a family of those who’ve served. “It’s for what the guys have done,” Kasia Vasquez said. “To lose a child in that fashion would be the worst,” said Berdahl. “Most of us don’t like war anyway. We think, ‘what a waste.’ To honor them like that is pretty darn cool.” Chavez had a brother who served in Vietnam. He came home, but she feels for the mothers and families of those who didn’t. “I have a heart for soldiers,” Chavez said. Oscar Vasquez said “we’re servants and patriots.” Every year, Deanna Schuetz has overseen the assembling of 400 luminary bags. The first year, she and Eunice did the work themselves. Little by little, church members and Eunice’s neighbors have joined in. Deanna also led the distribution effort. She started by giving them out at church. Then she went to businesses and walked neighborhoods. This is the first year she’s arranged to set them up at Weberstown Mall. “It’s not about us,” Deanna Schuetz insists. “The word has to get out. It’s not on everybody’s mind. I’m after Hallmark. I will write to the director of the company, because this needs to be on their calendars. It’s for parents back to World War I, and the Civil War, and what happened to those families. It first became public in the first World War, and it’s never on a calendar. When I talked to someone in (Hallmark) customer service, she said. ‘you’re right. We tend to forget Gold Start Families.’ “It would be devastating to be a Gold Star Mother. I can’t even imagine.” Her son, now a reserve in the Marine Corps, deployed to Afghanistan and returned home safely. Deanna Schuetz, who gets choked up talking about the mothers who weren’t as fortunate as she is, has those women and families in her heart every day. She’s only asking others to offer their appreciation one day a year, and to light a candle today, at dusk. — Contact reporter Lori Gilbert at (209) 546-8284 or lgilbert@recordnet.com.

A guy by the name of George Garrett found the Mi Box at his local Walmart in Ohio and after picking it up brought it home to record his unboxing experience… In the detailed video, George shows that the Mi Box comes with a voice remote, power adapter, and HDMI cable in the box as well as several free offers for Sling TV, VUDU Movies & TV, CBS All Access, and a 3-month free trial for Pandora’s premium services. The video also reveals how the hardware compares to the previous budget Android TV device, Google’s Nexus Player. The Mi Box has a similar plastic construction while being a bit smaller in size and also being slightly taller off the table. Also revealed in this video is the presence of a full-size USB port which should allow for expandable storage. There’s also an auxiliary port for plugging in a 3.5mm audio device. The remote also gets an appearance in this video, showing buttons for navigation and voice search, but also for power and volume, something we’ve yet to see on a standalone Android TV box. Once plugged into a TV and turned on, the Mi Box boots up like any other Android TV device and comes with the usual interface. Xiaomi also has the device set up to recommend several apps for various streaming services such as Sling TV, VUDU, HBO NOW, Red Bull TV, CBS Sports, WATCH ESPN, and more. Out of the box, though, the Mi Box only includes Google’s suite of Android TV apps and the Live Channels app. Interestingly the Mi Box comes with Android 6.0.1 out of the box rather than Android Nougat. As mentioned, Xiaomi has yet to officially release this product, but we’re expecting to see perhaps see it mentioned at Google’s October 4th event.

In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Vice President Muhammad Jusuf Kalla said the UN needs reforms to make it stronger and more relevant to 21st-century challenges and realities. Kalla said the nation has a commitment to increase its peacekeeping force to 4,000 personnel by 2019 and fights terrorism both regional and globally. As the world’s most populous Muslim nation and its third-largest democracy, Jakarta sees Islam modernity and women’s empowerment as going hand-in-hand with democracy, tolerance, pluralism and peace, he said. Selections of the new non-permanent Security Council members in 2019-2020 will be made in mid-2019. MONTENEGRO Sniper kills man in jail A sniper has shot dead a prisoner in broad daylight in a yard at the Balkan nation’s highest-security jail, officials said on Friday. The victim, named only by the initials D.Dj, was shot in the chest on Thursday while walking in the grounds of the main jail in the capital, Podgorica, prison authorities said in a statement. The prisoner died of his injuries later on Thursday, the statement said, adding that he had been jailed for extortion in 2014. “Clearly this is a clash of criminal groups and this brutal murder requires the maximum engagement of all institutions involved in implementing justice,” the statement said. Local media identified the victim as Dalibor Djuric, saying he was the 10th person killed in feuds between drugs gangs in the past two years. Earlier this month, police arrested nine men suspected of belonging to a drugs gang responsible for a surge in violence in the nation’s top tourist destination. UNITED STATES Boy blamed for fire Police say a 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the arts-and-crafts section of a Wal-Mart store in the Southern California desert, leading to losses of more than US$1 million. The store in Barstow remained closed for a third day on Friday because of the damage. Barstow police said in a statement that the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees tried to put it out with fire extinguishers, but failed and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters arrived and extinguished the blaze, but serious damage was done by both fire and water. Police looked at surveillance video and saw the boy with a scooter and a backpack. He was found on a street corner later in the day. He was arrested and taken to juvenile hall. UNITED STATES Dummy caught in truck A California driver has been cited for using a mannequin — not the required human being — while driving in a carpool lane. The Orange County Register reported that Brea police found the mannequin on Wednesday in a truck on the congested No. 57 freeway. The truck veered out of the carpool lane close to an officer’s motorcycle. As the officer attempted to warn the driver to be careful, he noticed the passenger was not a passenger. Police say the driver acknowledged using the mannequin in the carpool lane for some time. The driver told police that he would now accept that he needs to sit in traffic like everyone else. California requires that a vehicle have a minimum of two people for carpool lanes. Driving alone can bring a fine of at least US$481. This story has been viewed 1295 times.

Dunwoody Police blotter: Drug arrest after jaywalking stop, $10k stolen from safe From Dunwoody Police reports dated Sept. 1 through Sept. 8. The following information was pulled from Dunwoody’s Police-2-Citizen website and is presumed to be accurate. On Sept. 2 at shortly before 5 p.m. in the 100 block of Perimeter Center East at Ashford Dunwoody Road, an officer attempted to stop a suspicious person for jaywalking. When the officer made contact, the suspect fled and a foot chase ensued. The 19-year-old man from Decatur was arrested and charged with barbiturate possession, obstruction-resisting an officer, and with pedestrian crossing other than at a sidewalk. Police found possible Xanax on him as well as cyclobenzaprine and Skelaxin, both muscle relaxants. On Sept. 2 at about 7 p.m., someone broke into the home of a couple, both age 76, and stole $1,500 in jewelry and $300 in cash. A door and drywall valued at $200 was damaged during the burglary. On Sept. 3 at about 5 a.m., someone broke into the Chevron Food Mart station at 4249 Dunwoody Club Drive and stole $10,000 out of an iron safe. On Sept. 4 at about 12:40 p.m., a 28-year-old man from Charleston, Miss., was arrested and charged with shoplifting for stealing a $149 Little Tikes Baby Bouncer from Walmart. On Sept. 5 at about 11 p.m., a 76-year-old man reported to police that someone stole from a hotel in the 4300 block of Ashford-Dunwoody Rd. a gold ring valued at $2,500, $800 in cash, a gold Seiko watch valued at $2,500, and a gold nugget ring valued at $5,000.

The Timber Ridge Improvement District would allow the developer to pay the town to issue bonds to provide low-cost financing for the various improvements for the 150-home subdivision. The improvement district would raise money through a property tax assessment to repay low interest rate bonds used to pay for a roundabout at the intersection of Rumsey Drive and North McLane Road and Forest Park Court as well as street lighting, landscaping, sewer, water and other infrastructure for the subdivision. The town would pay for the cost of setting up the improvement district initially, but then sell some $2 million in bonds to recover the upfront money and pay for the infrastructure. The money for the facilities themselves would come from the developer, with repayment from the bonds funding with taxes paid over time by the homeowners. The improvements to Rumsey Drive will cost about $855,000. The roundabout will cost about $256,000. The improvements for Forest Park Road will cost about $548,000. True Life Companies is developing the 27-acre subdivision, the first new subdivision approved since the Great Recession relented. Developers have promised a community park, walking paths, sidewalks, streetlights and the roundabout at Rumsey Drive near the Payson Public Library. The development would also connect Rumsey Drive through to Walmart to the east and on the south end. Protests from residents blocked a plan to also make Forest Park Drive a through street instead of a dead end.

Isn't there an ordinance or something that prevents street lights from being put in? Some idiots several yrs. ago said they couldn't see the stars if there were street lights. So the town stopped them. When or why is it being changed for this subdivision? I live in Stone Creek and it is so dark I am afraid to go outside at night.

Forget the roundabout. Who is it in town that wants them and why? The ones already here are dangerous, too small, confusing and not built right. What is wrong with stop signs? Forest Park put thru would take some of the traffic off the already crowded streets and would be a fire escape. Does the town realize that anything they approve anywhere affects everyone in town? Maybe not at the moment but sooner or later it will. Remember the water restrictions, then someone gets approval to build a swimming pool?

Has the town of Payson (not just the Round Up) ever taken an actual poll to see if anyone really wants these things? Perhaps these plans were submitted while the previous 'regime' was still in power and prior to the election results?

Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com OVERLAND • She darted into her bedroom, eager to show off the sanctuary of an 11-year-old girl. It is an infusion of pink and purple, colors replayed in her clothes and highlighted in her hair. Mazy shares the room with two guinea pigs and Squirt, a goldfish that has outgrown its name. Here, she closes off the world when she needs to. Outside of this small house she shares with her parents and brother lies the pain of the past, the hope of the future, the unknown that keeps Mom and Dad awake at night. On a floor lamp in the corner hangs a poster board sign. “I’m just a girl,” it reads. In smaller letters, Mazy added: “... in a boy’s body.” As a fifth-grader, Mazy has now lived nearly a third of her life as the person she says she was supposed to be. Born Malachi, she never identified as a boy. Before she could talk, Mazy would slide into her mom’s high heels and put on her tops, cinching them at the waist for a makeshift dress. When Mazy was 3, she pleaded for a toy kitchen for Christmas, which she got. But when she begged for a princess dress, Mom initially said no. “For me, I gave birth to a son and boys don’t normally wear dresses,” Amber Gilleylen, 35, said. “I didn’t put a lot of stock into it.” Through kindergarten and first grade, while still dressing as a boy, kids at school peppered Mazy with mean comments. She wanted to play with the girls, who told her to go play with the boys. By second grade, she was coming home every afternoon crying. “I want to start over. Be a girl like I’m supposed to be,” Mazy would tell her mom. “I don’t think that’s how it works,” Amber told Mazy. “I just don’t fit in, Mommy, and I need you to help me make this stop.” Mazy’s grades were horrible. She couldn’t sleep at night. “I’m thinking: ‘What am I doing wrong? I want her happy,’” Amber said. The solution was simple, she said. “All I have to do is let her be herself.” But that would be the hardest thing Amber and her husband, Donté, ever had to do. Turning point As a second-grader, Mazy would come home from school, go into her room and put on girls clothes. Eventually, she began wearing them around the house. Along the way, Mazy was growing out her hair. One day, while her mom was sitting on the front porch, Mazy appeared in a cheerleader uniform. About the same time, Donté drove up. “Uh, what’s going on?” he asked Amber. A few minutes later, Donté, 35, said he was going to get gas. Amber and Mazy jumped in the car. Donté gave Amber a look that said: “Let’s not do this.” Letting her out of the house as a girl was too dangerous. People would not understand. And if her parents were struggling with it, how could they expect those who don’t know Mazy to embrace her new identity? Amber assured Donté it would be fine. Amber and Mazy went inside the convenience store to buy milk, passing a woman who was on her way out. “She’s so beautiful,” the woman said. Mazy looked up at her mom. “She called me a girl. A real girl,” Mazy said. “She doesn’t know.” It was a turning point for Donté. “You’re right,” he said to Amber. “It’s not so bad.” Inside the car, it became a celebration. “I honestly don’t think she stopped talking about that for weeks,” Amber said. Mazy decided soon thereafter she wanted to go to school as a girl. Amber wrote an email to school administrators, Mazy’s teacher, counselor and social worker. “Mazy wants to come to school as herself. This is not a stunt, and I’m not asking.” Amber received a call from the assistant principal the next day. “We are so excited to meet Mazy. Let us know what we can do to accommodate her,” the assistant principal said. It was a refreshing response after family and friends, more often than not, would suggest Mazy was just going through a phase. And Donté also had reservations: “How do you know this is real? How do you know this is not a mistake?” “Questions,” Amber said, “that were honestly sitting in the back of my mind.” Mazy’s official debut would come on the last day of second grade. She chose a “My Little Pony” outfit from Walmart. Pink striped shirt with pink shorts. “Are you sure you don’t want to be Malachi anymore?” Amber asked one last time. “I don’t want anyone to know I was ever a boy,” Mazy replied. Donté vacillated from supporter to protector. There are people who will not be kind. Daddy’s little girl may not be accepted as such. The worries of her parents were unfounded. At least that day. “Ultimately, she had an amazing day,” Amber said. “It was the first time I saw Mazy smile in I don’t know how long. “We met a whole new person.” • Questions and answers about gender identity Bullying at school Mazy was now Mazy. No looking back. With her parents on board, out went the boy clothes. No more mention of Malachi. But not everyone saw Mazy as a beautiful little girl, like the woman at the gas station had. When Mazy tried to join the Girl Scouts, some parents objected, saying they should not be forced to accept something they do not approve of. Children at school bullied her. One student spit in her food. Another kicked her in the shins. Mazy was falling behind, unable to focus. Her nights included insomnia and panic attacks. In the middle of fourth grade, her parents decided to pull her out of school. Amber would teach her at home. “We have not turned back,” Amber said, sitting in Mazy’s bedroom. While Amber talked about home schooling, Donté pulled in a chair from the kitchen, grabbed a white board and challenged his daughter to a game of tic-tac-toe. “I’ve lost my free time. But that’s OK,” Amber said. “I am more content knowing Mazy will be OK. A big, huge weight is gone. It’s a million times better.” Home schooling, however, may not last beyond fifth grade. Mazy and her parents have talked about going back into the Ritenour School District next year for middle school. “Social environments to navigate are important to her,” Amber said. Mazy’s parents say it is better to confront problems than run away from them. That will include what bathroom Mazy will use. And whether they tell school officials that their daughter is transgender. But this is the best fit for now. Getting Mazy caught up in her studies. Taking away the anxiety of an unpredictable outside world. “We want to give her a fair chance,” Amber said. Last year, Donté and Amber had Mazy’s name changed on her birth certificate. Mazy Star Maria is the name their daughter chose: Mazy because she liked the way it sounded; Star because “I think they are one of the most beautiful things in the whole world”; and Maria because that was Amber’s grandmother’s name. It was another part of letting go. Malachi Devonté is a name Mazy’s parents spent a great deal of time selecting. Malachi is a biblical name, a nod to Donté’s Baptist upbringing, the son of a pastor. Devonté was chosen because of its similarity to Donté. The gender marker on the birth certificate remains male. Biologically, that is the correct designation. And Mazy’s parents want to keep it that way for now. In case their daughter has any health problems specific to genitalia, insurance navigation will be less cumbersome. Going from Malachi to Mazy did, however, put a strain on her parents’ marriage, even threatening it. “The D word was definitely on the table for a minute,” Amber said. Stresses remain. They are estranged from family and friends. And Mazy’s parents still worry about her future. “This is an extremely dangerous path for Mazy,” Amber said of her biracial transgender girl. Her parents have seen the statistics regarding hate crimes and suicide when it comes to those who look very much like their daughter. They are worried, but letting Mazy guide them. “Making her be someone she isn’t isn’t going to make her happy,” Amber said. “No good will come from that.” What happens next? Mazy is concerned. Puberty is imminent and the hormone blockers a therapist has OK’d for her to take are not covered by the family’s insurance. As a result, the process is out of reach for Donté, a fast food restaurant cook and Amber, a stay-at-home mom who has been unable to work since a serious car crash three years ago. “This is a very real struggle in our house right now,” Amber said. “Mazy doesn’t want to transition into a boy and she is freaked out about it. She says: ‘Mommy, don’t let me get hair on my face, get a deep voice.’” Her parents continue looking for ways to get the hormone blockers covered through insurance and hope to find answers from a parent support group they belong to. Meanwhile, Mazy continues to see a therapist twice a month. Mazy has purged her bedroom of any sign of Malachi and eschews the name. But Amber has not quite let go. “I still have a bag of Malachi’s clothes. They are for me. Every once in a while, they come out and I smell them.” They are a reminder that the child she gave birth to was a boy. A boy whose parents had to mourn his loss to fully accept they had a girl. It was tough, Dontè said. But necessary. Mazy’s parents have asked her who she is attracted to. Nobody yet, Mazy says. It’s her parents preparing for what could be next. If she likes girls, is she gay? If she likes boys, is she straight? If she likes both, is it OK? Parents pondering. Worrying. Accepting. As Amber shared her family’s story, Mazy sat quietly, playing a video game. “You still miss him don’t you?” Mazy said, catching her mother off guard. Amber paused, looked at her daughter but didn’t answer. She continued talking about Mazy’s home schooling schedule. But a few minutes later, Amber circled back to Mazy’s question, answering it indirectly. “I almost forget she was born a boy. ... She’s a girl. “Just a girl.” Mazy from Yuting Jiang on Vimeo. • Read more: Parent dives into Jefferson County transgender saga, helps create new schools policy • Listen: Reporters discuss their work on the “Inside the Post-Dispatch” podcast We are not allowing comments on these stories.

America's war: the killing of Jaiden Dixon and Tyler Dunn Saturday 24 September 2016 03.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close The most common adjective employed by weather reporters on Saturday 23 November 2013 was “treacherous”. But in reality there was not a hint of betrayal about it. The day was every bit as foul as one would expect the week before Thanksgiving. A Nordic outbreak of snow, rain and high winds barrelled through the desert states and northern plains towards the midwest. There was precious little in the news to distract anyone from the weather. A poll gave Barack Obama his lowest approval ratings in years. The same day, he announced a tentative deal with Iran over its nuclear programme. That night, Fox News was the most popular cable news channel; The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was the highest-grossing movie. It was just another day in America. And as befits an unremarkable Saturday, 10 children and teens were killed by gunfire. They died in altercations at gas stations, accidents in bedrooms, standing on stairwells and walking down the street, in gangland hits and by mistaken identity. Like the weather, none of them would make the national news because, like the weather, their deaths did not disturb the accepted order of things. Every day, on average, seven children and teens are killed by guns in America. Firearms are the leading cause of death among black children under 19, and the second greatest cause of death for all children of the same age, after car accidents. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kids killed by guns: America’s daily nightmare Video by Laurence Topham I picked this day at random, and spent two years trying to find out who these children were. I searched for their parents, pastors, baseball coaches, and scoured their Facebook and Twitter feeds. The youngest child was nine, the oldest 19. Four years ago, for a moment, there was considerable interest in the fact that large numbers of Americans were being fatally shot. On 14 December 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot his mother, then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School and shot 20 small children and six staff dead. Mass shootings comprise a small proportion of gun violence, but they disturb America’s self-image in a way that the daily torrent of gun deaths does not. “Seeing the massacre of so many innocent children … it’s changed America,” said the Democrat senator Joe Manchin, who championed a tepid gun-control bill. “We’ve never seen this happen.” The truth is, it’s happening every day, only most do not see it; 23 November 2013 was just one of those days. Here are two of the boys’ (they were all boys) stories. Jaiden Dixon, Grove City, Ohio Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jaiden Dixon outside his Grove City home. Photograph: Courtesy Facebook/Nicole Fitzpatrick School mornings in Nicole Fitzpatrick’s home followed a predictable routine. As soon as her three sons – Jarid, 17, Jordin, 16, and Jaiden, nine – heard her footsteps, they would pull the covers over their heads because they knew what was coming: the lights. The older two would take this as a cue for the inevitable and get up. But Jaiden would try to string it out. He would climb into his mother’s bed. Then came the cajoling. “I’d tickle him,” Nicole says. “I’d pull him by his ankle.” They had a deal. If he could get himself ready – “all the way ready: socks, shoes, shirt, everything” – the rest of the morning was his. “He could play Minecraft, watch Duck Dynasty.” It was Friday 22 November, the 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy’s assassination, and the papers were full of nostalgia for the nation’s lost innocence. They might have found it on Nicole’s street in Grove City, a dependably humdrum suburb of Columbus, crowned “best hometown” in central Ohio that year. It was its dependability that convinced people to stay. Nicole went to school with the parents of the children her kids went to school with. Jaiden was ready that morning with time to spare. When Nicole threw him his socks, he threw them back, telling her he wanted to try out as a pitcher for his baseball team. He was playing on his Xbox when, shortly after 7.30am, the doorbell rang. This was not part of the routine, but nor was it out of the ordinary. The teenage girls at the end of the road would pop around if they were short of sugar or needed a lift. Slowly, curiously, Jaiden walked around the door. That’s when Nicole heard the 'pop' Jaiden opened the door gingerly, hiding behind it, poised to jump out and shout, “Boo!” when one of the girls showed her face. But nobody stepped forward. Time was suspended as the minor commotion of an unexpected visitor failed to materialise. Nicole craned her neck into the cleft of silence to find out who it was. She looked to Jarid; Jarid shrugged. Slowly, curiously, Jaiden walked around the door. That’s when Nicole heard the “pop”. Her first thought was, “Why are these girls popping a balloon? What are they trying to do, scare me to death?” But then she saw Jaiden’s head snap back, first once, then twice, before he hit the floor. “It was just real quiet. It was like everything stopped. And I remember staring at Jarid.” She knew what had happened. It was Danny. Danny Thornton was Jarid’s father. Nicole had met him years earlier at Sears, where he made keys. She was 19; he was 28. “We were never really together,” she says. “It was a back-and-forth kind of thing.” She hadn’t seen him since July. He’d found her over a year earlier, in January 2012, when he was in need of help. “He was getting ready to be evicted, and we decided to let him stay. He could spend time with Jarid and keep him under control, and I could help him get a job.” While he was staying, Danny got to know Jaiden. He took him bowling. He told Nicole that Jaiden made him laugh, even that he preferred him to his own son. But Nicole needed her room back. That made Danny angry, and he didn’t deal with anger well. His criminal history included charges of felonious assault, domestic violence, attempted possession of drugs and carrying a concealed weapon. He was also a semi-pro, super-middleweight boxer, 5ft 11in and around 160lb, who favoured the southpaw stance: right hand and right foot forward, leading with right jabs, and following up with a left cross, right hook. “He moved all his stuff out,” Nicole says. “I don’t know where. I didn’t care.” What she also didn’t know for some time was that, as he was packing, he told Jarid, “I have no problem making you an orphan. I’m not going to be living out of my car at 47. I have no problem shooting your mom and shooting your brothers.” He’d end his life in a shootout with the cops, he said. Danny had talked to her about shooting other people. “He had twins. He was pissed off with the mom for filing child support on him. And he talked about if he knew where she lived, he’d shoot her and shoot the babies,” Nicole’s best friend, Amy Sanders, tells me. “He had a list – an actual, physical list – of people he wanted to kill. Nicole always thought if she was nice to him, she wouldn’t be on his list. And unfortunately she was the first one.” Jarid didn’t tell his mother what Danny had said until September. “I stopped dead in my tracks,” Nicole says. “I said, ‘Jarid, he’s going to kill me.’ And Jarid said, ‘He’s just blowing off steam.’ I was petrified.” But time passed, and she began to wonder if Jarid was right. Gun Nation Then Danny’s mobile phone subscription expired. Nicole had been paying it, but Christmas was approaching and she couldn’t afford it. On 20 November she wrote a text telling him his contract was up: “The phone’s yours. You can go and turn it on at any provider.” The message sat on her phone for a while, unsent. “I knew what he was capable of,” she says. “But I had to look out for my kids. I had to look out for me.” She pressed send. He replied within an hour: “What fucking took you so long?” Nicole forwarded the message to Amy. “I swear he’s gonna kill me one day,” Nicole texted. “In two years, when nobody suspects him.” Two days later, this was the man who sped away in a blue Toyota, leaving Jaiden with a bullet in his skull. “And I struggle to try and understand,” Nicole says. “Did he shoot whoever answered the door, or was Jaiden his target? Because, honestly, he could have stepped one foot in that house and shot me, shot Jarid, shot Jordin.” Jarid fled the house, asking a neighbour to call 911. Once he got hold of the emergency services, he could barely make himself understood. “Sir, please calm down so I can understand what you’re saying,” the operator says. “We’ve got to learn what’s going on.” “My dad just shot my baby brother,” Jarid replies. “Who shot him?” “Danny Thornton. D-a-n-n-y T-h-o-r-n-t-o-n.” There is desperation and the occasional expletive interspersed with formal niceties: “Sir”, “Ma’am”, “fuck”, “please God”. “C’mon, Jaiden. C’mon, baby.” Nicole did her best to focus. She put one hand over the wound and the other on the back of Jaiden’s head, where she could feel the bullet. She scooped him up, then laid him back down. Still unconscious, Jaiden lifted his left arm three or four inches off the ground and let it fall. “I freaked out,” Nicole says. “I said, ‘He’s still alive. He’s still OK.’ I was thinking, this is what they do on TV. CPR. Mouth to mouth. And all it was, was just gurgle…” The emergency services arrived and took over. Nicole felt there was still hope. “I hugged the boys and was saying, ‘Be strong. We’ll get to the hospital and get him fixed.’ I kept thinking, ‘Just get him to surgery, get the bullet out.’” With Danny’s whereabouts still unknown, the suburb’s security apparatus curled into a tight foetal ball. Within five minutes of the first 911 call, Highland Park Elementary, just one block away, went into lockdown. School hadn’t started, so the police diverted buses and told parents arriving in cars to take their children home. But Danny was long gone, heading eastbound on Interstate 270 to Groveport, 20 minutes away, where his ex-partner, Vicki Vertin, with whom he had an 18-year-old daughter, worked as a dental hygienist. Vicki came out to meet him in the lobby. She hadn’t seen Danny for 12 years, but still lived in fear of his temper. He was wearing a grey hoodie and had his hands in the front pocket. “Haven’t seen you in a while,” Vicki told him. Danny took out his gun and shot her in the stomach. By now, the 911 dispatch office was in overdrive. Calls were pouring in. One of Vicki’s co-workers was on the line. It took them six minutes to link the two shootings. Two of Danny’s friends also called the police. He’d told them that he’d “killed two people and that he’s not going back to jail”, and “he will not go down without a fight with police”. More schools went into lockdown. Vicki’s family were taken to a protective room. Nicole, meanwhile, had arrived at the hospital. Detectives pulled her aside to ask if she had any idea where Danny would be going. That was when she found out he’d shot somebody else. An hour and 45 minutes after he shot Vicki, Danny was traced to a Walmart parking lot. It was 9.46am. A shootout ensued in which one policeman was injured and Danny finally got his wish: suicide by cop. I keep replaying seeing him falling to the ground. I keep replaying: ‘I should have done this, I should have done that' Vicki’s first thought when she woke from surgery was that he could still be out there. ‘“Did they get him?” she asked her dad. “No,” he replied. She tried to get out of bed: “Oh my God, he’s coming back.” Her father clarified: Danny had been shot dead. It was the first time in years she’d felt safe. Across town, Nicole was told that Jaiden wouldn’t make it. The neurologist told her that Jaiden’s CT scan was one of the worst she’d ever seen. The bullet had taken a path straight to the back of his brain, where it had ricocheted, causing irreparable damage. They put Jaiden on a ventilator while a decision was made about organ donation. “I don’t remember feeling anything,” Nicole says. “All I remember is having this image of him in his shoes. He’d just put his shoes on, and his T-shirt was on the floor. And now he’s in a hospital gown with a thing down his throat. All in about an hour or so.” Jaiden was pronounced dead at 3.47pm the next day. Until they wheeled him away to the operating room, Nicole kept it together, but witnessing that was too much to bear. “I couldn’t see the doors close,” she says. “It was almost like they were taking him to have his tonsils out.” She had been up for 45 hours. “I just remember breaking down and crying, and then somebody put me in a wheelchair and took me out. I didn’t go back to the hospital at all.” The fog did not clear until the viewing. “It was maybe a week after he died,” she recalls. “He was lying in his casket. And because I’d been able to touch him so much at the hospital, I went right up and kissed him, and I grabbed his hand and it was cold as stone and hard. That was when the reality hit me: Oh my God. My baby’s gone.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jaiden Dixon with his mother Nicole Fitzpatrick. Nicole’s world is now divided into before and after. “It was like, before I was in a theatre watching this movie, and since then it’s been like walking into a parking lot and trying to adjust to the bright lights from being so engrossed in this movie for so long.” It’s not as though the movie was necessarily uplifting. As a single mother of three, she remembers being exhausted, overwhelmed and, at times, very down. “There were nights when I would come home and just order pizza because I didn’t feel like cooking. And I would stare at the TV, and Jaiden would be out or upstairs or whatever. And I wish I’d gone and played with them.” The first time I met Nicole was in her office, four months after Jaiden’s death. It was her birthday, but she hadn’t let on to her co-workers and had no plans. She was wearing a hoodie bearing Jaiden’s name and face and the word legendary. Her friend had set up a website so they could sell them to raise funds. But she found it difficult to see his face. “I have school pictures in the living room over the mantel. I catch myself diverting my attention so that I don’t have to look.” She was in therapy, but struggling with the advice. “They keep saying that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. They keep saying, ‘It’ll get better.’ But I’m kind of at the point where I don’t see it.” Five months later, she still couldn’t see it. We had dinner at the Longhorn Steakhouse and went back to her house to meet friends. If anything, she was in a darker place. Most evenings she stayed up late to avoid going to sleep. Her mind kept whirring – an apparently endless loop of what-ifs and horror sequences. “I keep replaying seeing him falling to the ground. I keep replaying: ‘I should have done this, I should have done that. I should have opened the door.’” In the reception area of St Joseph’s Cemetery, where Jaiden is buried, a range of pamphlets is assembled to assist the bereaved: Losing Your Mom, Losing Your Dad, Talking With Your Kids About Funerals, Grieving The Death Of A Grown Son Or Daughter, to name but a few. There is pretty much every permutation of grief but one – a pamphlet entitled Losing Your Young Child. Because that’s not supposed to happen. Tyler Dunn, Marlette, Michigan Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tyler Dunn at home in Marlette, Michigan. Photograph: Courtesy Facebook/Justice for Tyler Dunn Sanilac County has a lower population density than Finland and is slightly less racially diverse than Norway (it is over 95% white). According to Michigan’s department of agriculture, Sanilac leads the state in the acreage devoted to soy, corn, wheat, dairy farms and general cattle operations. Straight roads lead past silos, Dutch barns, grazing livestock and fallow fields, interspersed with the occasional township and homestead. Marlette, population 1,879, is Sanilac’s third-biggest town and a 25-minute drive from the county seat of Sandusky. The shiny blue water tower bearing the town’s name announces itself from afar to the left, while McDonald’s golden arches peer over the trees to the right. Brittany Dunn, 20, wouldn’t be anywhere else. “I’d rather live here than in the city,” she says. “It’s more laid-back,” agrees her grandmother, Janet Allen. I am sitting in a pizzeria with four generations of the Dunn family: Janet, Lora Dunn Bartz (Janet’s daughter), Brittany (Lora’s daughter) and Ciannah (Brittany’s seven-month-old baby), as well as Thomas Bartz, Lora’s husband. This vast expanse of land was Tyler Dunn’s playground. To a city dweller like me, the 11-year-old sounds like a character from Mark Twain. He loved trapping animals, hunting, catching fish in the creek behind the house, four-wheeling and dirt-biking in the summer, sledding in the winter. The Dunns lived three miles down a dirt road off Highway 53. Several miles from the nearest traffic light, even streetlight, and surrounded by fields, he was safe to do his own thing. That year, deer hunting season started on 15 November, pheasant shooting on the 20th. “Tradition here is that the opening day you can just about close all the schools, because the kids are going hunting,” Sanilac County sheriff Garry Biniecki tells me. But with the exception of Tyler, hunting season didn’t particularly excite the Dunns. None of his immediate family hunted, and although Tyler enjoyed field sports, there is little evidence he was particularly good at them. One winter, Brittany’s boyfriend took Tyler trapping, but for more regular hunting trips Tyler turned to his friend Brandon. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marlette, Michigan – population: 1,879. Brandon (not his real name) lived about a mile away, on a dirt road off Tyler’s. Brandon, who was 12, would sometimes pick up Tyler on his go-kart, and they would roam the neighbourhood. They had been friends since kindergarten, but weren’t inseparable. Once, Lora told Tyler he could no longer play with Brandon after Brandon abandoned him in town and went off with another friend. Brandon was living with his father Jerry, who owned a trucking company. Jerry often took his son hunting and occasionally trucking, too. If Tyler was over, Jerry would take them both. Jerry’s truck runs, ferrying milk and topsoil around the midwest, usually took him away for 11 hours at a time. He’d give the boys some money to help him out. Sometimes Jerry would have them sit up front; at other times, they’d be in the back playing video games. Tyler loved it. On Thursday 21 November, Jerry had taken the boys hunting. Tyler had slept over on Friday night, and on Saturday afternoon the boys were scheduled to accompany Jerry in the truck down to Springfield, Ohio, 260 miles south and back. Lora dropped Tyler’s bike off at the house around 2pm, but the boys never used it because it was too cold: –8C, with winds of over 25 miles an hour. Shortly before Jerry was about to leave, the boys said they wanted to stay home. He left them to it. He made this trip as often as three times a week, and Brandon took care of himself fine. Lora didn’t know that by the time she dropped the bike off, Jerry was already gone. “Tyler knew he wasn’t allowed there unless there was supervision,” she says. But he didn’t call, and nor did Jerry. Lora went out with Thomas to celebrate a girlfriend’s birthday 90 minutes away in Union Lake. Jerry checked in with the boys a few times. The last time Brandon called Jerry was around 6.30pm, to ask if he could order pizza. Almost two hours later, Brandon walked out of the house with his hands up, wearing red shorts with no shirt or socks, the police telling him to keep his hands where they could see them. He had just called 911 and told them he had shot Tyler. “Do you have any weapons?” the policeman yelled. “No,” Brandon said. “It’s on the kitchen floor.” I would want eye for eye. Brandon needs to be gone. I don’t think he should be able to live his life A policeman walked Brandon to his car as he pleaded: “It was an accident. I didn’t know the gun was loaded.” An officer went inside, where he found a lever-action rifle on the kitchen floor and Tyler on the dining-room floor, in a Mountain Dew T-shirt and sweatpants, with a large pool of blood surrounding his head. There was a huge wound on the left side of his head. The policeman found no pulse, called dispatch, and told them Tyler was dead. As he left, he saw a shotgun lying on the living room couch and four holes in the dining-room window. Nobody but Brandon will ever know for sure what happened that night, Sheriff Biniecki says. Brandon claims they were playing Xbox when he got a rifle out of Jerry’s closet to show Tyler. He asked Tyler to hold it while he went to get his milkshake from the bedroom. He came back and took the rifle from Tyler, who passed it to him butt first, the muzzle pointing in Tyler’s direction. Brandon was resting it against the wall when the gun got caught on his pocket and went off. Brandon sat in the car while police combed the house. He’d been crying and was visibly shaken. When they searched him, they found two 12-gauge Remington buckshot shells and a mobile phone. There was blood on his hands and on the phone. When asked how he’d come by the shells, Brandon said he’d found them earlier that day and stuck them in his pocket for safekeeping. Inside the property, the police found a veritable arsenal. In Brandon’s room was a Remington 1100 shotgun, loaded and perched against the dresser with one round in the chamber and four in reserve. There were two more single-shot shotguns near the closet. In the top dresser drawer, there was some marijuana in tin foil and two rolled joints. When asked later how many guns he had in the house, Jerry couldn’t remember. First he said seven or eight, then between five and 10. Brandon didn’t know Tyler’s address, but he could describe his house. The police went there to find only his sisters at home, who told them to call their grandmother. Janet came shortly after midnight and was told the news. She called Lora. There was no reply: she’d left her phone in the car to charge. When she came out, she saw several missed calls and dialled Janet. “Are you on your way home?” her mother asked. “No – why?” Lora replied. “I think you need to come home.” She wouldn’t explain why, but that didn’t unduly concern Lora. She assumed her daughters had thrown a party and got caught. Night falls heavy in Sanilac County, cloaking the land in uncluttered darkness. On dirt roads with no street lamps for miles, the flashing lights of stationary police vehicles announce themselves with the force of a lighthouse. On the way to her mother’s house, Lora saw the lights on Brandon’s road and drove towards them. She called her mother. “Mom, do you have Tyler?” “I think you’d better just come here,” Janet said. “And then she put the police officer on the phone,” Lora recalls. “Don’t go there. Just come here,” she told her, and Lora obliged. “There’s been an accident,” the policewoman said when she got to the house. “OK,” Lora said. “Your son’s in Lapeer county hospital.” “OK,” Lora said. “Why didn’t you tell me, because I just came through Lapeer?” “No, Lora,” the policewoman said. “He’s been shot and killed.” While Lora was halfway home, Jerry was at the sheriff’s office in Sandusky. It was 2am. He had been called and asked to pick Brandon up. The police asked him whether there were any custody issues between him and Brandon’s mother, Connie, and whether he often left his son alone. Asked if any of his weapons were loaded, he said they might have been. Finally, they asked if Brandon had taken hunter safety classes. Jerry said he was doing the apprenticeship programme, in which a child aged 10 or more can hunt for two years without a safety certificate if with an adult. Beyond that, he had given basic instructions. “I told him to hold the gun with the barrel pointing in the air. Never to point the gun at anyone, and never put any shells in the gun unless you are outside.” How the gun got into Brandon’s bedroom was a mystery to Jerry. He thought it had originally been in the living room and didn’t remember moving it. All the guns were his, apart from the 20-gauge, which he’d bought Brandon. He said the .30-30 rifle that killed Tyler had been in his closet the whole time; he’d put three rounds in it a year earlier and not touched it since. It was only then that Jerry was told why Brandon was there. Guns were more available in Brandon and Tyler’s world than for any of the day’s other victims Had Brandon not shot Tyler, a handful of minor episodes relating to his behaviour would probably never have amounted to anything. But he did, and over the next few days police interviews provided hints that, even if this was not an expected turn of events, it was always a possibility. In her police interview, Connie said she had always been nervous about the number of guns Jerry had in the house, and assumed they were loaded. And then there were the incidents at school: the day before hunting season began, Brandon had boasted that he had pointed a 20-gauge at a boy’s stomach while it was loaded without the safety on. He also joked that the boy should put antlers on his head and run around so Brandon could shoot him. The child who overheard them thought they were “goofing around” about the antlers; he also thought “they were serious” about aiming at the boy’s stomach. Guns were more available in Brandon and Tyler’s world than for any of the day’s other victims. In much of rural America, guns are an everyday part of life, for recreational and practical reasons. “Being a rural community, we have problems with everything from skunks to critters,” Sheriff Biniecki explains. “It’s not uncommon for a farmer to have a firearm handy.” With so many guns around, the potential for calamity is ever present. A few weeks earlier, two local men said they were shot at by a duck hunter. Five days after Tyler was shot, a 16-year-old shot himself in the foot while hunting 20 minutes away. Although Biniecki treats each gun death as its own discrete tragedy, one nonetheless detects in his voice a weary familiarity with cases such as Tyler’s. The key to preventing accidents, he says, is education and parental responsibility. “I think we need to use the opportunity to further educate parents that if you do have a gun, unload it and put it away. Teach your kids the safety rules. And then, over time, don’t get lax with it, because children are always curious. Put those two things together and bad things can happen.” In January 2013, in the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings, Barack Obama started a second term that became increasingly strident in its advocacy for gun control. He sought to shift the climate of caution by issuing “a presidential memorandum directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence”. But the problem has been ongoing. On 14 November 2013, nine days before Tyler was shot, Obama nominated Vivek Murthy for surgeon general. Republican legislators focused on Murthy’s support for an assault-weapons ban and a tweet he’d sent in 2012, after the mass shootings at a cinema in Aurora, Colorado. “Tired of politicians playing politics w/guns, putting lives at risk b/c they’re scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue. #DebateHealth,” he wrote. It took more than a year for him to be confirmed by the narrowest of margins, after the National Rifle Association rallied its members. On 20 February 2014, Jerry and Brandon appeared in district court. Jerry was a three-time felon, previously convicted, among other things, of dealing drugs and operating a vehicle while impaired. In the US, felons are not allowed to have guns, so Jerry was charged with possession, a crime carrying a maximum of five years in prison. For leaving two boys alone with loaded guns that ended in the death of one of them, he was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a 90-day misdemeanour. He was released on $2,500 bail. Brandon was arraigned in juvenile court and charged with careless discharge of a firearm, causing death, which carries a maximum two-year sentence. On 10 April, Brandon pleaded guilty; on 5 May, Jerry pleaded no contest. At a hearing on 1 May, Lora told me, Connie wept as her son stood in grey sweatpants and a hoodie, and the judge placed him in “intense probation” at her home. The next day he was sentenced. There were 29 terms to his probation. He was sent to a junior detention facility for 10 days, with a further 20 days to be enforced if he failed to comply with the other 28 restrictions (including a 7pm-to-7am curfew, participation in anger-management classes, random drug and alcohol testing, paying for Tyler’s cremation, and a minimum of 10 written assignments). The probation would be reviewed every 30 days, said the prosecutor, who expected it to last until Brandon was 18 or 19. Six weeks later, the judge sentenced Jerry to a year for weapons-firearms possession and 90 days for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Tyler’s family believes they both got off too lightly – particularly Brandon, who they are convinced shot Tyler on purpose. To them, the story doesn’t hang together. Lora doesn’t buy the idea that the latch got caught on his shorts: “I believe his finger was on the trigger.” Over pizza with Brittany, her mother, stepfather and grandmother, I ask what would constitute justice. Brittany pauses. “I would want eye for eye.” “You mean you want Brandon executed?” I ask. She nods. “Brandon needs to be gone. I don’t think he should be able to live his life.” I look around the table. “Does everyone agree?” They all nod. “And Jerry?” “He should have time for what he did,” Lora says. “He should probably sit inside for the rest of his life,” Brittany adds. “He had a role in it, but he technically didn’t pull the trigger.” According to the Sanilac County News, Lora has since filed suit against both Brandon and Jerry, seeking more than $25,000. I ask her if Jerry or Connie have reached out to them. She says they have had no contact since Jerry’s girlfriend came over, a few days after, to return Tyler’s effects. Would they have liked to? “It would have been nice for them to say something. Put a card in my mailbox or something.” “Even at the court they could have turned around,” Janet said. “Yeah, when he stood up in front of the judge and said it wasn’t his fault,” Lora recalls. “Well,” Janet says, “it wasn’t his fault. Because he wasn’t home.” *** This is not a story about gun control. It is a story made possible by the absence of gun control. Americans are no more violent than anybody else. What makes their society more deadly is the widespread availability of firearms. To defend this by way of the second amendment – the right to bear arms – has about the same relevance as seeking to understand the roots of modern terrorism through readings of the Qur’an. To base an argument on an ancient text is effectively to abdicate your responsibility to understand the present. Adopted in 1791, the second amendment states: “A well–regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” These 27 words have been elevated to the level of scripture, inscribed on a blood-soaked pedestal thwarting all debate, more than 200 years after its passing. None of the family members I spoke to raised the second amendment. Almost all believed guns were too readily available; none believed there was anything that could be done. But when I told them of other families who had lost children that day, they seemed shocked. It was as though they had lost a loved one in a war, unaware that the same war was simultaneously claiming other lives – indeed, unaware that a war was taking place. As though it were happening only to them, when in fact it was happening to America.

Tim Vizer tvizer@bnd.com i By George Pawlaczyk and Beth Hundsdorfer News-Democrat LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story EAST ST. LOUIS Taxpayers have paid thousands of dollars for annual mandatory audits of East St. Louis Township, none of which mention that Supervisor Oliver Hamilton and two others charged as much as $280,000 on taxpayer-supported American Express cards. The charges — which ranged from trips, gasoline and car washes to thousands spent at big box hardware stores — were made without the knowledge or approval of the township board of trustees on credit cards capped at $1,000 a month. There was not one month when the spending came in under the cap, township financial records showed. Even though taxpayers paid for the services, Dennis Ulrich, a spokesman for the auditing firm Scheffel Boyle in Belleville, said when it comes to an audit, he can speak only to “the client,” who in this case is Hamilton. Scheffel Boyle was paid $8,000 for the latest township audit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015. Hamilton, who signed a form that he personally accepted the audit findings, is the target of an FBI investigation into the credit card spending. He has declined to comment on the advice of his attorney. Since June, the News-Democrat has reported in a series of investigative stories that Hamilton, his sister, June Hamilton Dean, who is paid to be a financial consultant, and an office administrator, spent $280,000 from 2012 to July 2016 on their township credit cards, including $12,500 during a single trip to Walmart; thousands spent on trips to Las Vegas, Chicago and Los Angeles; tens of thousands on building supplies such as paint, drywall and special tools; more than $3,000 for car washes, detailing and oil changes for Hamilton’s personal vehicle, and nearly $40,000 in gasoline. Oliver Hamilton’s card accounted for $230,000 of the total spending. Ulrich declined to respond to a list of News-Democrat questions about township financial matters and limitations of the audit. He said state law prohibits him or his staff from discussing his firm’s report, “With anyone who is not a client.” He said that for the township audits, only a government official could be considered a client. “It is weird that the taxpayer can’t go in and ask questions about the audit, but that is the way it works,” said Mark Peecher, a certified public accountant who teaches business at the University of Illinois. “If (an auditor) sees an irregularity or a suspicion is raised, he should do something about it. But credit card (abuse) might not even be included in the audit’s working papers, so he might not know anything about it,” Peecher said. If (an auditor) sees an irregularity or a suspicion is raised, he should do something about it. But credit card (abuse) might not even be included in the audit’s working papers, so he might not know anything about it. Mark Peecher, CPA and professor at University of Illinois The outside audits covering fiscal years 2012-15, which are required by state law, do not mention that the credit card spending was not approved by the board of trustees. A federal grand jury session that was scheduled to meet Tuesday in connection connection with the investigation of township finances was canceled. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Fairview Heights would neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation, but the News-Democrat saw copies of subpoenas issued to potential witnesses or targets. Trustees have said they never received a breakdown of credit card charges. Trustees received only an overall monthly claim sheet that listed the credit card costs as a single, lump sum line item with no breakdown of what was actually purchased. The trustees routinely approved the line item credit card costs without discussion, according to board minutes. Every one of the monthly totals exceeded a $1,000 limit set by the board in February 2012, just a few months after Hamilton became supervisor. Trustee Edith Moore, who heads the Community Development Department for the city of East St. Louis and pushed the resolution to limit credit card spending, said of the credit card spending, “I don’t know anything about what is going on about that. Nothing.” Township debt a ‘growing concern’ The latest audit for 2015 states the township has compiled a deficit of nearly $3 million — debt that threatens its financial future as a “going concern.” This same warning has been repeated word for word in audits from 2012, 2013 and 2014. “The auditors should have submitted to the township a management letter, which would indicate irregular transactions and procedures that are not conducive to sound financial principles,” said Joe Behnken, a certified public accountant from O’Fallon. Behnken is a former Republican member of the St. Clair County Board. Oliver Hamilton, a Democrat, is also a member of the County Board and serves on the board of the East Side Health District. “A quick review of the budget versus an actual expenditure report would immediately bring to light excessive, unbudgeted expenditures” like the credit card purchases, Behnken said in a written response. Behnken also commented on copies of township checks made out to Hamilton that were intended for others, including $900 to help a woman who has three small children pay rent. The woman said she never received any money from the township. There also was a $3,000 payment to a St. Louis construction company where the check was made out to Hamilton. Part of the routine duties of the auditor would be to review (trustee board) resolutions that would affect financial management, such as the resolution limiting credit card spending. Any violation of the resolution should have been noted. Joe Behnken, CPA and former St. Clair County Board member “Part of the auditor’s responsibility is to review the check register and question any large payments made to employees other than normal payroll. The $280,000 paid to American Express would show up in a statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances and in the budget,” Behnken said. “Large undocumented payments” should be included in a management letter, Behnken wrote. “Part of the routine duties of the auditor would be to review (trustee board) resolutions that would affect financial management, such as the resolution limiting credit card spending. Any violation of the resolution should have been noted.” The latest audit shows that the township has 15 full-time employees and eight part-timers. In addition, two financial consultants are paid $33,000 each per year. They are June Hamilton Dean, who is also an East St. Louis City Councilwoman, and businessman George Laktzian, who has worked for the township for more than 40 years. The township has operating expenses of about $1.3 million per year that includes grants for a Summer Youth Program and a lunch program for senior citizens. Of the total operating expenditures, “general assistance” to the needy is listed as $118,073, or about 9 percent. The audits noted other irregularities, often without explanation, including: ▪  Salaries in the latest audit were budgeted at $431,985, with $424,171 spent. Janitorial supplies were budgeted at $2,572 but $7,406 was actually spent. ▪  In fiscal year 2014, a total of $406,329 was budgeted for salaries but the actual expenditure was $547,231 — $140,902, or 35 percent, over budget. ▪  Travel was budgeted at $5,000 with only $736 listed as being spent in fiscal year 2014, even though travel costs listed on monthly American Express bills totaled at least $8,000 for that year. ▪  Janitorial supplies were budged at $3,000 in 2014, but $18,944 was spent, a 600 percent increase. As for the capability of external audits to detect fraud, Evy Poumpouras, a faculty member of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, told CNBC in 2014, “You can’t put the onus on somebody else to keep your place clean.” She said internal financial controls should be relied upon to prevent misappropriation of funds.

The incidents occurred Wednesday night and were reported and investigated Thursday and Friday. Staff photo: Alisa Boswell The wall behind ARISE Sexual Assault Services is one of the 20 locations in Portales tagged with graffiti Wednesday night. Officials said more could still be reported. Portales Police Department Public Information Officer Charlie Smart said most of the buildings tagged were businesses across Portales, adding that there may still be more tagged buildings that have not been found or reported yet. “At this point in the investigation, we were able to locate two empty spray cans and were able to track the two empty cans back to Wal-Mart here in Portales,” Smart said on Friday. “Myself and Sgt. (Nathan) Hyde reviewed the security video and were subsequently able to identify the offenders.” Smart said seven suspects have been identified in the case with four having confessed upon being located and interviewed. He declined to name suspects until the investigation is complete and charges are filed. Smart said the dollar amount of the damage will be in the thousands. Each incident is being charged as a separate count with the charge likely to be unauthorized graffiti. If the damage to a property equals a $1,000 or under, the suspects will be charged with a petty misdemeanor, and if the damage is over $1,000, the charge is a fourth-degree felony. Eastern New Mexico University’s Greyhound Arena was vandalized across 50 percent of the building, according to ENMU Physical Plant Director Ted Fares, who said the damage cost the university $4,000. The Zeta Tau Alpha sorority building was also tagged, but he did not know the cost of the damages to that building. Wal-Mart, which was also tagged in the incident, declined to give the cost of the damage. Thai City restaurant representatives said they had not talked to their insurance company, and did not know the cost of their damages yet. Other damaged properties are not known.

Early Wednesday morning, protesters blocked Interstate 85, where they stole boxes from trucks and started fires before police used flash grenades in an attempt to disperse the angry crowd, an ABC affiliate in Charlotte reported. A group of protesters then tried to break into a Walmart store before  police  arrived and began guarding its front entryway, video footage by local media showed. Police officers wearing riot gear block a road during protests after police fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S. September 20, 2016. Reuters/Adam Rhew/Charlotte Magazine Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Earlier in the evening, police in riot gear reportedly used tear gas on protesters who threw rocks and water bottles at them as they wielded large sticks and blocked traffic. One officer was sent to the hospital after being struck in the head by a rock, police  said. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts urged for calm. "The community deserves answers and (a) full investigation will ensue," she said on Twitter, adding in a subsequent post, "I want answers too." Related Stories Why Killer Cops Aren’t Prosecuted The New American Cop Scott was shot by officer Brentley Vinson earlier in the day, according to Charlotte-Mecklenburg police. The shooting occurred when officers were at an apartment complex searching for a suspect with an outstanding warrant and they saw Scott get out of his vehicle with a firearm, the department said. Vinson fired his weapon and struck Scott, who "posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers," the department said in a statement. Vinson, who joined the Charlotte police force in July 2014, is black, according to the department. He has been placed on paid administrative leave. National Debate The fatal shooting came amid an intense national debate over the use of deadly force by police, particularly against black men. Police did not immediately say if Scott was the suspect they had originally sought at the apartment complex. WSOC-TV, a local television station, reported that he was not. Detectives recovered the gun Scott was holding at the time of the shooting and were interviewing witnesses, police said. Protesters and Scott's family disputed that the dead man was armed. Some family members told reporters that Scott had been holding a book and was waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. Source: Graphiq   Shakeala Baker, who lives in a neighboring apartment complex, said she had seen Scott in the parking lot on previous afternoons waiting for his child. But on Tuesday, she watched as medics tended to Scott after he was shot, she said. "This is just sad," said Baker, 31. "I get tired of seeing another black person shot every time I turn on the television. But (police are) scared for their own lives. So if they're scared for their lives, how are they going to protect us?" Source: Graphiq   About 200 people gathered earlier Tuesday night for a peaceful protest in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a white officer killed an unarmed black man last week in an incident captured on police videos. Lawyers for the family of Terence Crutcher, 40, disputed that he posed any threat before he was shot by Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby after his sport utility vehicle broke down on Friday.

Thanks to metallic matte lipsticks like Hard Candy's latest launch, you can try out the high-fashion look without the messy multistep process. They apply in a single swipe, no pressing, sealing, or blotting required. The Hard Candy Metallic Mousse lipsticks are just $6, and you can buy them at Walmart. They're also another great dupe of the metallic Kylie Lip Kits. I tried out Smoke & Mirrors, a shimmery amethyst, for a day and felt like a beautiful mermaid. (If you're into that vibe, we rounded up products that will speak to your inner underwater goddess.) My first time applying the metallic matte lipstick was definitely a learning experience. I applied two coats, and my lips turned into a hot, chunky mess. Every time I opened my mouth, I felt like the lipstick was forming little cobwebs between my lips—very cute. (To be fair, a coworker assured me that it actually didn't look that way.) The second time was the charm. With just one coat, I was web-free and good to go for the rest of the day. The metallic matte lipstick surprisingly stayed put despite a very moist and velvety finish. When I took sips from my water bottle, it only left a faint purple mark, not an entire great-aunt-Tilly-style imprint. The collection also includes Sweet as Honey (a bronze), Queen of Hearts (a magenta), Sandstorm (a rose gold), Gilded Cocoa (a, well, cocoa), Truffle (a faded rose), and Penny Talk (a copper).

Photo / AP Hillary Clinton has appeared in more than 30 primary debates during her two presidential campaigns, a deep history she can draw upon as she faces Donald Trump tomorrow. Here's a look at some key moments of Clinton's past debates that could influence her performance against Trump: 1 BULLYING CAN BACKFIRE Clinton's first 2000 Senate debate with Republican rival Rick Lazio, then a New York Congressman, shows what could go wrong for Trump if he tries to bully her. Lazio infamously walked over to Clinton's podium during the debate, demanding she sign a pledge to forgo a form of donations known as soft money. "Sign it right now," Lazio scolded Clinton, who gamely responded, "We'll shake on this, Rick." The move backfired with many female voters, who thought it was inappropriate. 2 HAVING IT BOTH WAYS Clinton vacillated during an October 2007 debate in Philadelphia when she was asked if she supported her home state governor's proposal to grant driver's licenses to immigrants living in the country illegally. Barack Obama and John Edwards pounced, accusing her of trying to take multiple sides of the issue. "I can't tell whether she was for it or against it," Obama said. Her tortured response encouraged her opponents to accuse her of being disingenuous. Against Trump, it's an example of how a defensive, legalistic response could hurt. Continued below. Related Content First of three debates will be a huge moment for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Cartoon: Auckland ratepayers v Duco Political Roundup: In defence of Gareth Morgan's new party 3 HUMOUR HELPS When Clinton was asked in 2008 by a New Hampshire moderator if she was likable enough, she responded with humour. "Well, that hurts my feelings," she said as the audience roared. Obama responded, "You're likable enough, Hillary". It came across as a putdown to many New Hampshire voters, who delivered Clinton a stunning victory. The exchange showed how Clinton's humour could be an effective countermeasure to Trump. 4 WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH Clinton and Obama engaged in one of their fiercest exchanges in January 2008, an episode that shows the risks of a drawn-out fight. Clinton refused to back down as tensions spilled out - a potential scenario against Trump. Clinton and Obama battled over whether the Illinois senator had praised Republican ideals and former President Ronald Reagan. Obama said he was working in the streets while Clinton was "a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart". Clinton said she was fighting those GOP ideas while Obama was practicing law and representing real estate developer Tony Rezko "in his slum landlord business in inner-city Chicago". 5 THE TAKEDOWN One of Clinton's strongest 2016 debate moments came before the New York primary, when she seized upon Bernie Sanders' lengthy interview with the New York Daily News in which he struggled to explain how he would break up large Wall Street banks. "Talk about judgment," Clinton said in a stinging response, noting Sanders' difficulty in explaining one of his "core issues". It showed that if Clinton's opponent reveals a weakness, she will take advantage of it. 6 THOSE EMAILS In the first Democratic debate, Sanders declared that Americans were "sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails". Clinton smiled broadly and laughed as the audience cheered. Sanders said voters cared more about economic issues, prompting Clinton to thank her opponent with a very public handshake. Trump, who has repeatedly criticised Clinton's use of a private email server, is unlikely to be as magnanimous. -AP By Ken Thomas Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Opinion: Goosebump sporting moments There are some moments in sport that stay with us for life.

Holiday hiring goes into high gear Maureen Wallenfang , USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 5:52 p.m. CDT September 25, 2016 Some stores plan to have hiring complete by the second week of October Buy Photo Stores get into the hiring spirit right now for the holiday season. Here, employees play Santa on Black Friday in Toys R Us in Grand Chute. (Photo: Maureen Wallenfang/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo Story Highlights Seasonal hourly pay rates are fairly consistent with full-time rates. Most seasonal positions offer no benefits other than a store discount. Those who intend to moonlight this holiday season should brush up their job applications this week. Some stores and shippers have announced hiring plans for the holidays and hope to get their staffs in place soon. The overall number of employees they intend to hire is about the same as last year, but with a tighter labor market and earlier shopping promotions, they want to secure workers quickly. “A lot of holiday hiring is already taking place,” said Jeff Sachse, the Green Bay-based job market analyst for Wisconsin’s Department of Workforce Development. “Many retailers have been running multiple promotions for earlier holiday shopping to spread out the workforce demands and the revenues,” he said. “As a result, if you’re starting to advertise your pre-holiday sales, then you typically need to have staff in place one to two weeks before that.” RELATED: Neenah plans for 184-unit apartment complex RELATED: The Buzz: Taj Mahal will not reopen "It's never too early," said Joanne Prete, general manager of J.C. Penney in the Fox River Mall. "We just got our hiring plan this week and we're starting now." Nationally, Penney's is in the midst of a three-year turnaround plan, and it's one of the few retailers that will hire more workers for the holidays: 40,000 hires, which is up 33 percent. "We're looking for 30 to 40 for our store," said Prete. "That's quite an increase. Last year it was around 20." Sachse said the tight labor market forces employers to get moving, and he said some will have hiring complete by the second week of October. “Unemployment in the Fox Valley is at 3.4 percent and that will affect the seasonal market,“ he said. “Seasonal employers are competing against year-round permanent employers.” Seasonal employers have an edge, however, because they attract an expanded worker pool that includes retirees, students and stay-at-home homemakers, he said. Still, companies have to get creative. “A number depend on social media for recruitment. They’re using Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram to reach out to a younger audience,” he said. “They recruit differently. They have dedicated hiring portals and in-store kiosks.” While seasonal job numbers are expected to remain about even with last year’s 738,800 jobs nationally, some of those jobs have shifted to behind-the-scenes work, according to Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “The sector with the biggest increase in holiday hiring in recent years has been transportation and warehousing, as more and more holiday shopping is done online,” said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer. Its hiring charts show Amazon, UPS and FedEx adding more seasonal employees every year while most bricks-and-mortar retailers stay level or reduce in-store staffs. Pay rates Seasonal hourly pay rates are fairly consistent with full-time rates, Sachse said. “They’ve been creeping up over the last three years. They’re now starting at about $9.50 to $11 an hour, depending on the employer. Costco will pay a little better.” He said he’s seen companies like UPS, Walmart and Target start workers at about $10 an hour. “Some stores in the mall might be a little lower. They’ll still be in the $9 to $9.50 range.” Most seasonal positions offer no benefits other than a store discount. The jobs are attractive to workers, however, because of flexible hours, short-term commitments and the ability to pick up extra cash for holiday spending. In the bigger picture, a seasonal stint can be a foot in the door for a permanent job. "I was brought on in October 39 years ago and here I still am," said Prete. Sachse said that practice is becoming more commonplace. “Since the recession, we have seen that a number of retailers do the bulk of their recruitment during their holiday season. Costco does this, for example,” he said. UPS and Toys R Us are two more businesses that in the past have reported they offered full-time jobs to 15 to 30 percent of their seasonal workers. Hiring nationally More stores and shippers announced hiring plans in the last few weeks. Macy’s will add 83,000 seasonal positions at its 880 Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores, call centers, distribution facilities and online fulfillment centers. That’s essentially the same number of positions as last year. It doesn’t give a specific breakdown by store, but says its upper Midwest district, which includes the Fox River Mall store in Grand Chute, will hire a total of 1,192 people. It will conduct a national hiring day Friday. UPS will hire 95,000 people to help with holiday shipping around the country, up from 93,000. Kohl’s will hire more than 69,000 seasonal workers, even with last year. Target will hire about 70,000, around the same number as last year.  Maureen Wallenfang: 920-993-7116, or mwallenfang@postcrescent.com; on Twitter @wallenfang 38 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://post.cr/2dutJQQ

More Media Starbucks attack, Live in Prime Backpack cleared Starbucks shooting LAS VEGAS (KSNV) - Las Vegas Metropolitan Police report that one person has been detained in connection with a fatal shooting at a Starbucks near W. Warm Springs Road and S. Rainbow Boulevard. SWAT has arrived on the scene. LVMPD identified the suspect as 34-year-old Pedro Garcia. He is currently booked into the Clark County Detention Center and faces charges of open murder with a deadly weapon, robbery with a deadly weapon, burglary while possessing a gun, and discharging a gun at or into an occupied structure, News 3 viewer Bryan Dunlap sent us this photo of a man with his hands up. Reportedly he was being taken into custody by police. Police say the suspect's backpack and his vehicle were being investigated at the time because the suspect allegedly said there was an explosive device inside. The backpack was later deemed to be safe. "We were less than five minutes away from walking into this situation," Dunlap said. "We watched one of the employees jump out of the drive-thru window and run across and police waved her over to get her to their side." Metro officers confirmed the shooting was fatal. According to LVMPD Lt. Dan McGrath, the victim was described as a man in his 40s and was a regular customer in the store. Officers say he did not have a known connection to the suspect. Police updated the media shortly around 1:20 p.m. and again at 3:15 p.m. The suspect, later identified by Metro as Garcia, was described by police as a Hispanic man in his 30s. LVMPD Lt. Dan McGrath says the suspect has a violent criminal history and should not have been in possession of a gun. Officers say the suspect first went through the Starbucks drive-thru and his card was declined. Seeing the customer was agitated, employees gave the man the water he asked for. Afterward, the suspect went around the building and parked his car at the back of a Bank of America and went inside the Starbucks. "We had this confrontation after he got denied ... he went back into the business and ended up shooting this individual who does not appear to be connected to him," said Lt. McGrath. "I was told the suspect shot into the air several times and threatened to shoot people in the business." Officers say the suspect and victim had some type of confrontation inside before the victim was shot. The suspect also fired shots into the air and threatened to shoot the people around him inside the Starbucks. The person who was reportedly shot in the chest was transported to Spring Valley Hospital, where he later died. Businesses in the immediate area were evacuated. People in nearby businesses, including Walgreens and Walmart, spent about an hour sheltering in place. "We were getting our nails done and we saw people running and some people screaming and someone ran in and said shut the doors ... we saw cops with sniper rifles hiding behind SUVs, pointed toward the Starbucks," said Amber Plourde. "We were single-file evacuated out of the back entrance of the salon." Plourde was in a nail salon near the Starbucks getting her nails done with family members when the situation unfolded. She tells News 3 there were 13 people hiding in a back room at the nail salon and described what she saw during and after the incident. "There was a man, young man, who must've helped the victim, sitting on a curb with blood on him, and he was obviously in shock and that really upset me and hit home," Plourde said. "Now I feel event worse for that poor young man knowing he tried to help, the man didn't make it." Radio traffic indicated that a backpack was found in the doorway of the Starbucks and the suspect indicated to authorities that it contained an explosive device. Metro officers later deemed that backpack to be safe. The original call was treated as a hostage situation, but according to Lt. McGrath, the suspect walked out of the business around seven minutes after the initial report of the shooting. According to Lt. McGrath, the suspect called into the dispatch center multiple times from inside the business and gave false suspect descriptions. The motivation for the shooting is unknown at this time. A teenager selling newspapers outside was caught in the crossfire after he walked into the Starbucks shortly after the shooting. "I looked to the right and there was people on the ground, then I looked to the left and there was somebody bloody on the ground," said 15-year-old Demontae Durggan. Durggan described to News 3 what he saw as he took cover on the ground with other customers inside the cafe. "When I was laying down he kept saying, 'Oh it's jammed, oh it's jammed,'" Durggan said. "When I looked at him, he looked nervous." Customers inside decided to take action after the deadly shooting. "First, we ran to the back where the refrigerators are, hid back there, and somebody locked the front door ... and we sat there for a while, calling the police," Durggan said. "I feel pretty lucky that he didn't go off and shoot everybody." A homicide investigation is now underway at the scene and the area is still taped off. Multiple agencies responded to the shooting, including authorities on the federal level. Police indicate the shooting occurred about 11:30 a.m. at 7260 S. Rainbow Blvd. This is the 124th homicide investigated by LVMPD in 2016. This is a developing story that will be updated as more details become available.

Laura Stoecker | Staff Photographer    A reader mentioned the Batavia Public Library as a favorite place to kill a few hours reading a book. "I love that library, even though I shouldn't speak of a building in terms of affection," the reader wrote. Rick West | Staff Photographer   Dave Heun     Readers came up with some interesting answers to my questions two weeks ago that came across like a "best of" survey, but were just different enough to require a little more thought. Today we share those answers, as well as my own take on these scenarios. We'll repeat the question for those who may have missed the original column. Question: If you had an hour for lunch at work during summer or fall, but were told it had to be taken outdoors, where would you go and what would you have? Readers: Along Fox River or near the Batavia Riverwalk, eating sandwiches from Burger King or Portillo's; Pottawatomie Park in St. Charles; an outside table at Deane's Market & Deli in Geneva with one of its sandwiches, or the outside patio at Atlas Chicken Shack with the lunch special; sit on the deck at Patten House in Geneva and have a shrimp po' boy sandwich; peanut butter and jelly sandwich, milk, fruit and maybe cookies in the Fabyan Forest Preserve; the outdoor deck at Pal Joey's in Batavia for the noon pizza special, salad and a root beer. Dave: The benches in a small wooded area in the southeast corner of Mount St. Mary Park has been an outdoor lunch spot for me in the past with a brown-bag meal, and would be the first place to come to mind. Question: If you were told to kill two hours reading and relaxing outside of your home, where would you go? Readers: My own garden under a shady tree; The Japanese Tea Garden by the Fabyan Villa; Sugar Grove Library; a lawn chair in Island Park in Geneva; Batavia Public Library, I love that library, even though I shouldn't speak of a building in terms of affection. Dave: Hard to beat the setting on the deck at our house, but a bench in Geneva's Island Park near the Fox River would be quite nice. Question: If someone told you to do something in the Tri-Cities you "haven't done in years" but always wanted to, what would that be? Readers: Geneva Christmas House Walk or some local garden walks; I loved biking, but after my first hip replacement, I worried about the bike slipping, but would like to bike the trails again along the Fox River; a river ride on the St. Charles Belle paddleboat; I've walked the Fox River bike path, but would like to bike it; sledding at the hill at Fabyan Forest Preserve windmill, even though at my age it might be dangerous. Dave: Play golf at the "new" St. Charles Country Club. Played the former course a few times, but don't recall playing the newer layout, which actually isn't that new any more. Sort of hard to do when you aren't a member. Question: If a visitor said, "Let's just have pizza tonight," which pizza spot is getting that order so as to best impress that visitor? Readers: Taylor Street Pizza in Geneva is the best; Salerno's on the Fox, best pizza and best leftovers; Doughocracy in Geneva, it has something for everyone; Salerno's is excellent pizza and not just run of the mill from most chains; the thin crust pizza at Rascal's in Geneva is great. Dave: It's hard to deny Salerno's, and I have a fondness for Aurelio's, but my favorite has actually been the thin crust at Morano's Pizza in Geneva. It reminds me of the old Tom's Pizza in St. Charles, which I loved. Question: When driving around the Tri-Cities, which street, intersection or portion of road makes you feel it is "an accident waiting to happen?" Readers: Fabyan Parkway and Hughes or Wenmoth roads; can't believe engineers allowed such an angle to Fabyan and routes 31 and 25; the parking lot at Trader Joe's in Batavia; the three-way stop on Hawk Drive after turning right off Randall Road, just north of Fabyan Parkway (heading toward Wal-Mart), too many people think it's a four-way stop and pull out in front of you; the merge on Fabyan Parkway near Resurrection Cemetery during rush hour; a tie between Fabyan and Randall and Keslinger and Randall, as both are terrible; trying to make left-hand turns on East Main Street in St. Charles from Second Avenue to Fourth Avenue during peak traffic hours as drivers jockey to switch lanes. Dave: Without a doubt, taking a left turn onto Route 31 off Fabyan Parkway in either direction is a "white knuckler." Question: If you had a sudden uncontrollable urge for something chocolate, where would you go and what would you get? Readers: Graham's in Geneva for chocolate-covered orange peels; hands down, the chocolate cake from Portillo's; a piece of dark chocolate from Trader Joe's; chocolate chip cookie from Graham's 318, double-dark bitter chip ice cream from Graham's, and chocolate cake from The Sugar Path in Geneva; I might buy a Lindt candy bar, but also would go to Graham's in Geneva. Dave: We live in a Willy Wonka chocolate wonderland around here with great choices, but Dairy Queen's chocolate extreme blizzard with brownie bits always solves the "uncontrollable" urge thing for me. dheun@sbcglobal.net Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: News Batavia Geneva St. Charles Heun, Dave Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Snow Elementary garden started as a small project for one class, but it then bloomed into a school-wide activity. CHLOE DAWSON / The State Journal — Dural Miller sees the Mary C. Snow Elementary garden as an extension of school learning opportunities. Photo courtesy of The Wild Ramp — The Wild Ramp helps local food producers in Huntington market their products and also provides customers with locally grown products. If Danny Swann had his way, empty lots across West Virginia would be turned into urban gardens. And instead of sitting indoors playing video games, kids would spend their spare time in the sun, wind and rain learning how to grow foods and flowers. Related Story: Highmark WV to fund Parkersburg, WV community garden “Seven or eight years ago I was a college kid in my early 20s and living in East Wheeling, kind of on the wrong side of the tracks,” Swann said. “I was working at a youth center and I wanted to figure a way to get kids outdoors, a way I could connect to them — gardening was a medium to do that.” He started with vacant lots in his neighborhood, setting one up as a children’s garden, and another as a more traditional community garden. A Community Garden is a property divided into individual garden plots. Participants plant, weed, water and harvest the herbs, vegetables and flowers they’ve sown. “I don’t know that it was much of a sell,” he said. “It was more just a contagiousness of activity itself — doing it, building a community garden. People started coming over to see what was going on, then they’d jump right in.  “It was the same with the kids — they started poking their noses around, figuring out what was going on and got involved. “It took very little encouragement from me. High school boys at the youth center started showing up at 5 a.m. on Saturday mornings to pick things for the farmer’s market so they could get a little cash in their pockets. Not a ton of cash, but a significant amount for a high school boy from East Wheeling.” Swann described the gardens as an enterprise. “It’s healthy for our community — in even as broken a community as East Wheeling is often perceived to be, you can make a life for yourself doing something that is healthy for the people you care about, as opposed to doing something that’s adding to the crime, drugs, prostitution or various other problems in our communities,” he said. Back to nature Gail Patton remembers when she first realized the “fresh” produce lining most grocery store shelves isn’t really fresh. She was in a grocery store in Barboursville, and overheard another customer asking a clerk where the produce came from. “The clerk said it came from Chilé, even the organics,” said Patton, a member of the board of directors of Wild Ramp, a year-round, community-supported market in Huntington that helps local food producers market their products while providing access to locally grown agricultural products. Everything marketed through Wild Ramp, including meats, is produced within at least a 250-mile radius; most is within 50 miles. “Think about how much travel time is involved, to get produce from Chilé to Barboursville, West Virginia,” she said. Related Story: Wild ramp accounts for local boost More and more, people are questioning where the foods they’re feeding their families come from and what’s being added to them. Locally grown foods eliminate the need for products to be shipped hundreds of miles and doused with preservatives and flavor enhancers, ensuring fresher, tastier menu items.  ThinkProgress, the political news blog, four years ago said the average meal travels 4,200 miles just to get to the table. By the time those long-distance meals make it to our plates, people like Tracey Lea Frisch say the “fresh-picked flavor” is usually long gone. “I think as a society we got away from growing our own food and being self-sufficient,” said Frisch, a Morgantown resident. “Then when we got to where we relied on (store-bought) foods and prices went up. Now the pendulum is swinging back.” Urban gardens now are turning up in backyards, on rooftops and in containers all across West Virginia, reconnecting individuals and communities with the state’s agricultural roots while bringing the health benefits of locally grown produce into homes.    West Virginia State University Extension’s Melissa Stewart sees it as a natural progression. “For myself, it’s knowing my daughter can go out and pick a tomato off the vine and know it hasn’t been treated with anything,” Stewart said. “That’s the food safety mechanism we’re starting to put in place.” Life-changer WVSU Extension and the American Heart Association teamed together in 2005 to develop a community garden in Charleston’s Carroll Terrace neighborhood, a low-income housing area in the city’s East End Historic District.  “We’re finishing our 11th growing season,” Stewart said. “We hit it before the curve, I guess. What we’ve seen is a definite mindset — the millennial population wanting to get back to the earth, back to a slower, easier pace,” she said. “I see it as a step somebody can take, something they can do. ... In a day and age when people are becoming more concerned about how things are grown or how they are treated in our food system, this is an area where they can have distinct control.”  Stewart said community gardens get fresh vegetables and herbs into the hands of people who otherwise might not have access to them. Plus, at least during the growing season, “people won’t have to decide if they’re going to buy the medicine they need or healthy groceries” because they’re growing their own food. “They know they can feed themselves from the garden, so they can begin to balance their food needs with health care needs,” she said, noting participants have come to realize “value and pride” in growing produce for their own needs or to sell. Swann said it’s a life-changer, particularly in what he termed “food deserts,” which are neighborhoods “where people have trouble getting their hands on healthy foods even if they wanted to. “What they’ve got (in those neighborhoods) is Slim Jims and Doritos and Mountain Dew,” he said. “To see kids being raised on those things or comparable items is disheartening. That’s why we’re trying to give people the skills” to grow their own foods. “There’s a lot of people who aren’t cut out for farming, and that’s totally fine,” Swann added. “It’s not for them to walk out in a field at 6 a.m. and still be there at 6 p.m., working in the hot sun. But they can still appreciate what we’re doing and participate in other ways.” ‘A different option’ Dural Miller sees the school garden project at Mary C. Snow Elementary on Charleston’s West Side as the ultimate learning project. Initially started three or four years ago to ensure special education students could enjoy out-of-school activities, Miller said the garden quickly became a school-wide project: About 200 of the school’s 350 students routinely volunteer in the garden — raised beds where they plant fruits, vegetables and herbs. Adult volunteers are currently turning a nearby abandoned house that was donated to them into a food storage facility and allow them to teach the community how to can vegetables. A vacant lot behind the school is being turned into a mini-farm with a high tunnel, which is an unheated greenhouse that extends the growing season. The high tunnel will allow them to plant space-intensive crops like tomatoes. “I’m thankful to be able to do it,” said Miller, who started the non-profit Keeping Your Faith Corp. to help build a stronger, healthier West Side community. “I’ve got a bunch people helping me who believe we can make a difference. I’m so blessed, it makes me happy just coming out here and looking at the garden, seeing the progress we’ve made.” Miller sees the garden as an extension of school learning opportunities. Without the kids even realizing it, he said they’re honing their reading, math and science skills even as they learn how to grow their own foods. “We use it as a teaching tool: They’re reading instructions, measuring things, and we let them come and harvest what they can take,” he said. The rest we take to homeless shelters.”  They’re also working with kids at a nearby juvenile center to grow vegetables, harvest, clean them and then sell them. “It’s about giving a kid a different option, an option they might not know they have,” Miler said. “We’re showing them how they can learn a skill that can benefit them in their life. ...  “They’re troubled youth, but they’re doing great in this program. They’ve been learning how to grow vegetables, and how to be entrepreneurs as well.”  Miller said the gardens are fostering change — “a bright change.”  “We were picking some vegetables (the other day) and a guy said, ‘So this is where it comes from. I thought these came from a store.’ He said if he could grow things here he could probably do it anywhere,” Miller said. “To be able to do things they couldn’t do before, that’s exciting. It’s exciting for them to show their parents and tell their parents what they’ve been doing, and parents get to look at something good they’re doing, something positive. It’s positive, too, for kids to be able to do something.” Related Story: West Virginia students learning to help provide fresh produce to schools Building community One of the most exciting aspects of the garden projects, Miller said, is how they’re changing his community. “We always loved our neighborhood, but certain people had kind of given up a little bit,” Miller said. “This new project, it’s put hope and pride back in the neighborhood.” Ture’ Johnson, supervisor at KISRA’s Paradise Farms in Dunbar, said urban gardening is planning the seed for the future. KISRA, the Kanawha Institute for Social Research & Action Inc., is a faith-motivated initiative launched by Ferguson Memorial Baptist Church in 1993. “The reason we started Paradise Farms was to give the individuals we work with — most of them have a criminal past — a chance to farm, a way to venture into entrepreneurship, make things grow and make some money,” Johnson said. “And it gives the community surrounding Paradise Farms access to organic-ish produce.  “The reason I say ‘organic-ish’ is we use every practice that an organic grower uses, but what we grow in our hydroponic system has not been deemed organic so we’re not allowed to say it’s organic.” Paradise Farms has a greenhouse in addition to its outside beds, container gardens, hydroponic and aeroponic growing systems. Hydroponics uses mineral nutrient solutions, in water and without soil. Aeroponics is a vertical growing system resembling a magazine rack that uses an air or mist environment without soil or an aggregate medium. Both are set up for year-round use, “but it depends on how crazy the summer weather is,” Johnson said. “Our (aeroponics) towers are up to 11 levels high,” he said. “That means we can grow 44 different types of produce or 44 of the same, all in that one aeroponics tower.  “It allows us to maximize space vertically as well as horizontally,” Johnson added. “That’s one reason I’m glad to be part of Paradise Farms, it gives me a chance to learn about this cutting edge technology. A lot of folks are used to the same old in-ground growing, which is fine. But we wanted to find ways we could maximize our efforts on the growing side.” But Johnson said it’s more than just growing food, “it’s a national security-type thing.” “What we do here is definitely mission work,” he said. “We’re not in it just to make a buck; if that was the case, we wouldn’t be growing lettuce. We take a more holistic approach. “This program makes people more socially conscious of a problem we face here in the state and nation — there’s not enough food produced here to take care of our own. There’s a bigger picture here, one we can have our fingerprints on, helping folks battle whatever illnesses and diseases on. We’re letting them know if they eat right now, they’ll spend a lot less time later on dealing with doctors, medications and whatever else.” Call him ‘Earthtone’ Martinsburg’s Matt Denton has been producing herbs, greens, and microgreens for over a year at his Herban Sprout, an organic operation that sells primarily to local restaurants. The centerpiece of his operation, an 18-by-18 foot greenhouse, operates on solar power and is completely off the grid. Many of the materials he used to build it have been repurposed — it’s sided with reclaimed pallet board, for instance. Windows salvaged from half-century-old buildings allow light in, and two rewired fans from his grandparent’s basement provide circulation. “I generally don’t like the word ‘hippy,’” Denton said. “I prefer ‘earthtone.’ When people hear the word ‘hippy,’ their minds automatically go to dirty, stinky, pot-smoking people. ‘Earthtone’ has a cleaner feel, a cleaner ring to it.  “An ‘earthtone’ is someone who is in tune with nature, in tune with the earth, who consciously tries to minimize their ecological footprint — someone who has found a way to get off the treadmill of consumption. Unfortunately, a lot of people get up on the treadmill and walk and walk, then go to bed, get up and do it all over again. “A lot of what I’m doing is educating people, teaching them there’s different choices out there,” he added. “People don’t have to go to Walmart and get their groceries.” Morgantown’s Travis Boothe considers himself a social activist, teaching people to work together for the common good. Boothe, a fourth-year economics major, figures gardening is a logical expression of that mission, and, with his landlord’s permission, started one in the backyard of the house he rents in Morgantown’s Southpark neighborhood.  “There’s a lot of people who see urban agriculture as something dirty hippies do,” he said. “I don’t think that’s true. People in my generation, millennials, I think we’re waking up to the fact we have to find ways to take care of ourselves and provide for our needs in ways that may be considered unconventional by many standards.” Boothe said about a dozen neighbors have taken advantage of his invitation to grow food in his oversized backyard. “Right now, it’s just a backyard thing, but in the future, my goal has always been to expend, to grow the concept,” he said. “I’d love to see lots opened up in the city, maybe just make them on public land and allow anybody to come in and plant a plot or two. That’s always been my goal, free access to land where people can grow not just food, but sustainable agriculture on an urban level.” Growing hope Joey James chairs Morgantown’s Green Team, established in 2007 to advise the city manager and council on environmental issues. He said the Green Team sees urban agriculture “as an opportunity to not only promote local foods and healthy eating, but also a way to reduce emissions.” “I think we see nationwide, a kind of discussion arising about making productive use of our land in cities,” James said. “We’re seeing discussion about green roofs and urban bee keeping, there’s a movement towards local food production. And more and more people are keeping chickens in urban areas.” James sees urban gardening as “quintessentially American and West Virginian, taking land and making use of it, really providing for ourselves.” He said passage of an urban agriculture ordinance seemed like a no-brainer, at least until some residents in a Hopecrest, an upscale part of town, took exception to a neighbor keeping chickens on her property. “That’s the issue holding us up,” James said. “There’s been a lot of debate about what is the appropriate number of birds, is it appropriate to have birds in town. People have very strong opinions about that.” James said they still hope to see Morgantown adopt an urban agriculture ordinance, and “figure out some way we can facilitate and provide guidelines to people who want to do it.” “It’s a polarizing issue in the city,” he added. “We have people who view (animals) as a nuisance, they don’t want to have to look at (their neighbor’s) overgrown garden. They don’t care about eating healthy; they figure if you want to eat healthy you should go outside city limits. But we’re a rural state — if there’s any place this should work, it’s here.” It hasn’t been as contentious in other areas. Wheeling, for instance, has embraced efforts to foster change. “Seven or eight years ago, people asked me why I was bothering, the crack heads were just going to destroy anything we planted,” Swann said. “But that never happened. There’s no such thing as a crack head — these are human beings who have had trauma in their lives seeking a way to escape and that escape takes them to drugs.  “It’s somebody’s son or grandson selling drugs standing on street corners selling drugs, maybe they’ve got two kids and got every one of their school pictures in their purse. Maybe they’re prostituting themselves. But they can tell you everything about their kids, and the great tragedy in their lives is they haven’t been able to kick their addiction.” Swann sees what they’re doing as growing hope. “We’re not saving the world,” he said. “But we’re chipping away at it, working towards a healthy society. I believe very strongly the work we’re doing is worthwhile.” This story first appeared in the print edition of The State Journal. Click HERE to subscribe. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter!

The fair is free and open to the public. “We cannot ignore the high rates of obesity, diabetes, and cancer in the Latino community,” said LULAC National President Roger C. Rocha, Jr. “Through the Latinos Living Healthy initiative, LULAC is providing Latinos with the information to recognize the negative consequences of unhealthy habits while providing solutions to live healthier lives.” The Feria de Salud will offer free health services including blood pressure tests, osteoporosis screenings, vision exams, dental check-ups, flu shots, BMI tests, and HIV tests.

(read more) Letter to the Editor / Published: September 25, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     I am writing as a concerned driver. Recently, I changed banks and now drive on the Highland Park Boulevard daily. At the intersection of Wilkes-Barre Township Boulevard and Highland Park Boulevard, there are numerous pedestrians walking and pushing strollers on the boulevard due to lack of sidewalks. There is no sidewalk for about 500 feet from the busy intersection to the entrance of Wegmans grocery store parking lot. The traffic is heavy and cars travel at high speeds. I fear someone, especially young children, will be hit and injured or killed on that stretch or Highland Park Boulevard. Many of the poorer residents walk to Wal-Mart to shop and risk serious injury due to no sidewalk. I am not a resident of Wilkes-Barre or Wilkes-Barre Township, so I have no knowledge of whom to contact so this hazard can be addressed. I realize funds are limited, but a lawsuit for personal injury due to negligent traffic conditions which place public safety at risk would cost more than installing a 500-foot sidewalk.

The best of these one-liners are not merely entertaining but also get at substantive issues that resonate for voters. We’ll have to wait until Monday evening to see what the candidates have up their sleeves. But it’s not too early to speculate about some lines of attack or counterattack that might be used when the candidates meet at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. for that first presidential debate of this general election. The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will almost certainly be pressed by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, or by the moderator, Lester Holt, on the issue of his tax returns. He might reply by offering to release them as soon as Clinton releases the videos of the speeches to Goldman Sachs for which she and Bill Clinton were paid a total of $875,000 by that Wall Street investment bank in 2013. Mrs. Clinton may describe Trump or his language as sexist, racist, xenophobic, making fun of people with disabilities — a veritable “basket of deplorables.” Trump may ask why, if he’s really so horrible, did Clinton accept his campaign contributions and happily show up with Bill Clinton to rejoice at Trump’s wedding. Trump will probably describe Clinton as having been a failure as secretary of state and weak when it comes to protecting America against radical Islamic terrorism. Clinton may reply by pointing out that Trump offered to let Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi pitch his tent on Trump’s Westchester County, N.Y., estate, even though Libya was responsible for the Pan Am 103 terrorist attack. Clinton will probably express skepticism about Trump’s plans for the economy and national security. Trump can reply that Clinton and her crowd were in charge from 1992 to 2000 and again for the past eight years, and that if today’s America doesn’t feel particularly peaceful or prosperous, Clinton and her crowd are to blame. Clinton will try to make hay out of what she says are Trump’s business dealings with Russia, or Russians, and his supposed coziness with Vladimir Putin. Trump can point out that the Clinton Foundation took money from lots of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and that Bill Clinton also collected half-million-dollar speaking fees for appearances in Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates. Secretary of State Clinton handed the Russian foreign minister a button with a Russian word she thought meant “reset” but in fact meant “overcharge.” Clinton will claim Trump’s proposed tax cuts will bust the federal budget. He can counter that the real budget busters will be her plans to expand Obamacare and to make college “free.” Clinton will claim that Trump is anti-union. Trump can point out that Hillary was on the board of directors of Walmart and that members of the Walton family that controls Walmart have donated large sums to her campaign. Walmart has opposed efforts to unionize its employees. If by this point in the presidential campaign you don’t feel particularly enthusiastic about either candidate, remember that depressing enthusiasm is a kind of political tactic in its own right, designed to assure that only the most highly motivated voters go to the polls. Beyond all the debating points and the back-and-forth are some even more basic questions. Which of these two would you want to keep watching after election night? Which one can sketch a vision of the country that inspires some hope? If all else fails, “Monday Night Football” is on ESPN, Falcons at the Saints. One thing is for sure: That game will be the only big competition on Monday night that features any Saints.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive State voters to weigh cost of restrictive cages for farm animals Saturday Sep 24, 2016 at 6:14 PM Sep 24, 2016 at 6:14 PM By Steve LeBlanc The Associated Press BOSTON — When voters head to the polls in November, supporters of a pro-farm animal ballot question want them to have one question in their minds: What would it feel like to spend their entire lives without enough room to stand up, turn around, stretch their arms and legs and lay down again? Opponents hope voters will have their eyes on their wallets instead, arguing that approving the ballot question will drive up the costs of eggs and meat. The proposal, Question 3 on the ballot, is aimed at improving the living conditions of farm animals, not just in Massachusetts but at any farm that wants to sell eggs and meat in the state. The question would "prohibit any farm from knowingly confining any breeding pig, calf raised for veal, or egg-laying hen in a way that prevents the animal from laying down, standing up, fully extending its limbs or turning around freely." Framers of the question have their sights set far beyond Massachusetts, where only one egg-producing farm could be affected if the proposal becomes law. The question would also bar businesses in Massachusetts from selling any eggs or meat produced under those confining conditions — even if the hens, calves or pig were kept outside of the state. Supporters say everyone should show concern for farm animals. "Whether you're a vegetarian, or a meat-eater, or anything in between, everybody should be able to agree that a baby veal calf, a mother pig, an egg-laying hen ought to be able to stand up, lie down, turn around and extend their limbs," said Paul Shapiro, of the Humane Society of the United States, the largest contributor to the ballot question. "We wouldn't allow that type of cruelty for a dog or a cat." Shapiro made the comments during a debate Tuesday sponsored by WBUR-FM and The Boston Globe. Some major companies, including Wal-Mart and McDonalds, have already said they plan to make the switch to cage-free eggs. But Bill Bell, of the New England Brown Egg Council, said even supporters have acknowledged that the question could drive up the cost of eggs, although supporters and opponents differ on how big an increase. "If you believe that eggs should be produced in a cage-free environment, you can buy those eggs right now," Bell said during the debate. "This is America and the marketplace responds." Bell urged voters to reject the question, saying it will have unforeseen consequences. "To begin with, it will increase the price of food substantially for everyone, including especially those least able to afford it," he said, adding that farmers care about the well-being of their hens, if only because happier hens produce better. If approved, the ballot question wouldn't fully take effect until 2022, giving farms times to adapt to the new rules. While both sides passionately defend their views, so far only backers of the question have been raising money to make their case to the public. Bakers of the question have reported raising $1.7 million so far in direct contributions and another $545,000 in in-kind contributions, like donated staff times. The state's most recent campaign finance deadline passed this week without any opposition group filing a fundraising report with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance. The single biggest source of funding for Citizens for Farm Animal Protection — the group pushing the ballot question — has come from the Maryland-based Humane Society of The United States, which has contributed more than $1.5 million in direct and in-kind contributions.

Tyre King, 13, was commemorated at the First Church of God in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday morning, while community members demanded a better future for their kids. King was shot multiple times by Bryan Mason on September 14 in an alley east of downtown Columbus when he pulled out a BB gun from his waistband that looked 'practically identical' to a real firearm, police said.  Scroll down for video  Hundreds gathered to mourn Tyre King, 13, (left) at his funeral today after he was shot dead by Columbus, Ohio, police officer Bryan Mason (right) on September 14  Tyre was an eighth grader in a young scholars program at Linden-McKinley STEM Academy who enjoyed sports like hockey, basketball and football  Hundreds filed by a white casket draped with yellow roses before a hearse carried the boy's body to a cemetery where he was laid to rest His youth football coach Michael Bell said  there was a need for more programs to keep kids off the streets, while Pastor Benita Favre called for changes to help a 'generation of kids who are totally out of control' Hundreds filed by a white casket draped with yellow roses before a hearse carried the boy's body to a cemetery where he was laid to rest, The Columbus Dispatch reported.  Tyre was an eighth grader in a young scholars program at Linden-McKinley STEM Academy who enjoyed sports like hockey, basketball and football, according to his funeral program.  'He lit up a room. He demanded your attention,' said Michael Bell, who coached Tyre King on his youth football team.  Bell said there was a need for more programs to keep kids off the streets, while Pastor Benita Favre called for changes to help a 'generation of kids who are totally out of control'. 'How long are we going to let pain and anger control us? How long are we going to be the victims?' she said. 'When are things going to change and we're going to be victors?' On September 14, officers were investigating an armed robbery report and spotted three males who matched the description of the suspects, authorities said (pictured, the funeral service card) Police chased King, who pulled out a BB gun that looked 'practically identical' to a real firearm (pictured, Police Chief Kim Jacobs displaying a photo of the type of BB gun) King was shot dead by Mason in an alley, exacerbating racial tensions in Ohio's biggest city (pictured, a rally for King days after his death) On September 14, officers were investigating an armed robbery report and spotted three males who matched the description of the suspects, authorities said. Two of them ran away when officers tried to speak with them. The police chased the pair into a nearby alley and tried to take them into custody. That's when Tyre pulled out a BB gun, and Officer Mason fired his weapon, hitting the boy repeatedly, police said. Tyre died at Nationwide Children's Hospital at around 8.22pm - approximately one hour after he was shot.  At a press conference, officers said the BB gun looked 'practically identical' to a police weapon.

Share this article Share The Umarex 40XP Blowback BB Pistol retails for $50 and is readily available to buy at stores such as Walmart. It is not known where King purchased the laser sight. Because the officer was white and the boy black, the case has brought inevitable comparisons with the 2014 fatal shooting in Cleveland of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Columbus police are early in their investigation but say the differences in the Wednesday night shooting of Tyre King and the Cleveland case are stark. 'The only thing similar in nature is the age, race and outcome,' said Columbus police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner. 'The facts are not similar, and that must be reiterated.'  A grand jury will determine whether Mason will be charged for King's death. (pictured, mourners at King's funeral today) Mason, a veteran of the Columbus police department for almost 10 years, was put on administrative leave, a standard procedure after police shootings. The boy's death has inflamed racial tensions in Ohio's largest city while adding to a growing number of black people who have been killed by police across the country.  Attorneys for King's family have called for an independent investigation, calling into question Mason's involvement in other shootings. The head of the local police union has said Mason did what he was trained to do under the circumstances. Evidence in the shooting investigation will be presented to a grand jury to determine if the officer's actions were justified or charges are warranted.  Another funeral is scheduled on Saturday night in Oklahoma for 40-year-old Terence Crutcher, who was shot and killed by Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby on September 16.  Shelby was charged with manslaughter in the shooting of Crutcher, who was unarmed.

Clinton has been through the debate gauntlet in two New York Senate campaigns as well as in presidential primary match-ups against then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders this year and other challengers. Here's a look at some key moments of Clinton's past debates that could influence her performance against Trump: Bullying can backfire Clinton's first 2000 Senate debate with Republican rival Rick Lazio, then New York congressman, shows what could go wrong for Trump if he tries to bully her. Lazio infamously walked over to Clinton's podium during the debate, demanding she sign a pledge to forgo a form of donations known as soft money. "Sign it right now," Lazio scolded Clinton, who gamely responded, "We'll shake on this, Rick." The move backfired with many female voters, who thought it was inappropriate. Having it both ways Clinton vacillated during an October 2007 debate in Philadelphia when she was asked if she supported her home state governor's proposal to grant driver's licenses to immigrants living in the country illegally. Obama and John Edwards pounced, accusing her of trying to take multiple sides of the issue. "I can't tell whether she was for it or against it," Obama said. Her tortured response encouraged her opponents to accuse her of being disingenuous. Against Trump, it's an example of how a defensive, legalistic response could hurt. Humor helps When Clinton was asked in 2008 by a New Hampshire moderator if she was likable enough, she responded with humor. "Well, that hurts my feelings," she said as the audience roared. Obama responded, "You're likable enough, Hillary." It came across as a putdown to many New Hampshire voters, who delivered Clinton a stunning victory. The exchange showed how Clinton's humor could be an effective countermeasure to Trump. When the going gets tough Clinton and Obama engaged in one of their fiercest exchanges in January 2008, an episode that shows the risks of a drawn-out fight. Clinton refused to back down as tensions spilled out — a potential scenario against Trump. Clinton and Obama battled over whether the Illinois senator had praised Republican ideals and former President Ronald Reagan. Obama said he was working in the streets while Clinton was "a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart." Clinton said she was fighting those GOP ideas while Obama was practicing law and representing real estate developer Tony Rezko "in his slum landlord business in inner-city Chicago." The takedown One of Clinton's strongest 2016 debate moments came before the New York primary, when she seized upon Sanders' lengthy interview with the New York Daily News in which he struggled to explain how he would break up large Wall Street banks. "Talk about judgment," Clinton said in a stinging response, noting Sanders' difficulty in explaining one of his "core issues." It showed that if Clinton's opponent reveals a weakness, she will take advantage of it. Those emails In the first Democratic debate, Sanders declared that Americans were "sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails." Clinton smiled broadly and laughed as the audience cheered. Sanders said voters cared more about economic issues, prompting Clinton to thank her opponent with a very public handshake. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Clinton's use of a private email server, is unlikely to be as magnanimous.

In the tourist meccas of Leavenworth and Chelan, hunters of an already scarce affordable house or apartment face an additional pressure: Landlords who can make more money by renting to short-term visitors at much higher rates. Both these tourist towns prohibit residential homes within city limits to be used as short-term vacation rentals, but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening on the sly. “We are seeing an uptick in that type of housing within city limits,” says Leavenworth Mayor Cheri Farivar. “We have a ban on it now, because of the difficulty of finding out where these properties are.” Mary Signorelli, an agent with REMAX real estate in Chelan, says the short-term rentals, even outside that lakeside city’s limits could still affect pricing to rent or buy. “That type of thing does probably drive up the rental price,” she said. “The fact of the matter is, there are not a lot of rentals in Chelan. For young families, just finding houses in the core part of the city is very difficult. Houses (listed for sale) in the $250,000 to $300,000 range don’t stay on the market very long.” A search of the popular vacation rental website, vrbo.com, showed 292 vacation homes, cottages, apartments and rooms available in Leavenworth and its surrounding area from Sept. 20 to Sept. 22 — random dates chosen as a base of comparison. That compares to 146 in Greater Chelan, but only 24 in the the greater Wenatchee area. Another popular rental website, Airbnb, shows 121 rentals — from tiny houses to deluxe homes — available in Leavenworth on those dates, and 53 in Chelan. A one-bedroom, craftsman-style cottage set up for short-term tourist stays could rent for around $170 per night through one of these websites. That’s more than $5,000 if rented for a month. A search of local real estate listings shows that a no-frills smaller home advertised for rent to a year-round tenant could go for $1,000 to $1,500/month. Hotel employees and others on lower to lower-middle incomes in these cities share housing or simply live elsewhere and commute. Vacation rentals may help push prices up, these experts say, but are not the main reason for either city’s dearth of housing that service workers and entry-level professionals can afford. Supply and demand is the real problem. The solution is not a quick fix, but they’re working on it. “Demand is high. People want to live in Leavenworth,” Geordie Romer, an agent for Windermere real estate said. “With the small footprint of Leavenworth (within city limits), there isn’t a lot of room.” The tourist cities are looking at rule changes that could encourage higher-density housing options. “We’re hoping to increase availability of housing, both rental and apartments. That’s our goal,” said Leavenworth’s Farivar, a real estate appraiser by profession with more than 30 years’ experience. With barely two meetings under its belt through August, Farivar’s “Mayor’s Housing Affordability Task Force” was just getting started with an analysis of the local market that she says will yield “ways, great ideas, outside the box, to increase availability of housing.” “Given the city’s small size, we’ll likely have to do things that are passive — streamline building procedures to encourage builders to build more housing and more value-priced housing,” she said. Three new housing developments are under construction now in Leavenworth that would increase supply by 50 new homes, she said, adding that she doesn’t yet know what these homes will sell for, but is eager to see how pricing will be affected when they hit the market. “Right now, the average cost of a house in Leavenworth is 30 percent higher than in Wenatchee,” she said. “A market correction could be coming, but the demand is so much higher than the supply that I don’t see how. She added, “I don’t see any solution that isn’t market oriented.” Chelan Mayor Mike Cooney also identified affordable housing as a high priority for both himself and the city council. He points to several recent advances to creating more, higher-density dwellings: A group of community leaders with diverse backgrounds and reputations for getting things done has been assembled to study the issue and make suggestions. The owner of the now-vacant Regency Manor nursing home has agreed to remodel the building into 26 housing units that will rent at rates that “workforce-level” employees can afford. They should be ready to rent in November. The city is working aggressively to assemble needed funding to extend city water to the area around Lake Chelan Airport. With municipal water there, some 100 acres could be developed into moderately priced housing. This could happen in about two years. The city is working to change the zoning on 100 to 200 acres of former Naumes Family property in the Walmart area, off of Highway 97A, to be sold and developed for affordable single-family and multiplex housing. “We’re trying to turn over every stone in our community,” Cooney said. “The term ‘affordable’ brings a lot of different connotations. We’re focused on trying to find the best workforce housing.” He added, “The places we’re looking at are all going to be nice places… with amenities like gardens and recreation areas. It’ll be a good lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle. People are going to be proud of their homes. Between now and five years, we will have seriously answered the call for the need. Our council is dead set on getting this done, and so am I.” Keeping vacation rentals out of residential neighborhoods within city limits seems to be of interest in both these communities. Bans currently in effect will likely remain so. “The neighborhoods in Leavenworth are very jealous of their residential style of life,” Mayor Farivar said. “Right now, 80 percent are against overnight rentals within city limits; 20 percent are in favor. I’ll tell you, it’s an emotional discussion. People are fearful Leavenworth could turn into a Jackson Hole (Wyoming), where every house is a vacation rental. We don’t want that.” She added, “If the ban is upheld and overnight rentals are stopped, those homes may free up as homes for sale or rent. We are moving cautiously toward a solution.” Reach Christine Pratt at 509-665-1173 or (javascript required to see email). Follow her on Twitter at @CPrattWW.

Share Email Name: Alison, Bob, and Angus Masey Location: Highland Park — Los Angeles, California Size: 600 square feet Years lived in: 5 years; rented Alison and Bob's mini Craftsman may be petite, but it's loaded with warm and fuzzy anecdotes. Whether given or found on the side of the road, every single item inside seems to have fatefully found its way there without being sought out, and each one with a great story to boot. From the pink velvet chairs in the living room to the corner bookshelf behind the dining table, this couple has no lack of conversation starters or generous (and talented) artistic friends. My favorite story they told me is about the pink velvet chairs that represent Alison's self-proclaimed "grandma" sensibilities. The chairs are from the home of photographer Bootsy Holler's grandparents and also a prop in her incredibly moving series "Ruby & Willie." The images capture the time capsule that was her grandfather Willie's home — left untouched since the death of her grandmother Ruby in 1978. The chairs now reside in Alison and Bob's living room, juxtaposed with a closeup from the series of the chairs' wood carvings. Apartment Therapy Survey: Our Style: Obviously we like a modern look, but we never want our space to feel stark. Alison can veer a little grandma, and Bob's modern sensibilities help balance us out. We're definitely not going for catalog perfect. We like to add in items that don't quite make sense (our pink chairs) to keep it from being stale. Inspiration: Our biggest inspiration is adulthood. Bob spent a lot of years living with roommates in punk houses in DC. And Alison spent 7 years living in a 300 sq. ft. studio in Seattle, that looked like grandma's attic. We're both shocked that we've reached a point in our lives where we are making grown up decisions like buying new furniture, not just using whatever we found on the side of the road (although we did find our current dining room table in the alley behind Bob's old house.) Other inspirations to note: Alison's best friend Laura, who designed the living room remotely from Seattle and lives in a stunning A-frame on Lopez Island. And Travel: the pillows at the Ace Hotel rooftop bar, Korakia Pensione, Tulum Mexico, Pioneer Town. Favorite Element: We love that we've figured out a way for the home office to double as TV lounge by repositioning the rolling desk. A TV is tough to design around. Alison: I love all the pink. I don't know if Bob realizes how much pink is in our house. I'm always trying to sneak it in in different ways. Biggest Challenge: Our landlady made a lot of great choices in the renovation process but we struggle with the eye-popping green tile in the shower. We've tried several strategies — mute it with neutral-colored shower curtain and towels, or lean into it with pop art colors — but it's tough to wrangle. What Friends Say: How are you going to have a kid in this house? Both because we try to avoid clutter and it's TINY. We have no idea. Biggest Embarrassment: It's what we refer to as "the Ugly Chair." It's a gold velour, stuffed swivel rocker, and it is ugly… but I swear to you it is the most comfortable piece of furniture on the planet. When guests see its hideousness, we actually make them sit in it and they inevitably agree. It feels wonderful. And we will never get rid of it. Even though it doesn't go with anything and even a clever reupholstering probably wouldn't improve it much. But we're open to ideas. Anyone have suggestions? Proudest DIY: Our outdoor couch. Outdoor furniture is crazy expensive and often hideous. We built our outdoor couch in an afternoon from redwood lumber, deck screws, and coffee-colored stain. It cost about $130 to build. Then we found cheap attractive cushions online (WalMart) that we weatherproofed with ScotchGard. Biggest Indulgence: Our coffee table. It's probably the most expensive piece we've bought together. Bob had a vison of the perfect table: glass top because it's a small space, with a base that was attractive, and we found it at Sunbeam Vintage so we went for it. We've never been sorry. Best Advice: Don't think a functional space can't be stylish. We didn't even attempt to make Bob's office look good until recently. We had a ton of books and gear, and we really needed a space to just stash crap. We ended up re-working our closet storage space to accommodate a lot of what was laying around, which freed up space for us to be creative. And we finally decieded on a wall color. That took about 4 years. Dream Sources: We really love for the objects in our house to have meaning, so our dream sources are really our talented friends. Artists, photographers, furniture makers, quilters, ceramics artists. Our dream is to be able to pay them what they deserve for their incredible work. Thanks, Alison and Bob!

(AP) — Hillary Clinton has appeared in more than 30 primary debates during her two presidential campaigns, a deep history she can draw upon as she faces Donald Trump on Monday night. Clinton has been through the debate gauntlet in two New York Senate campaigns as well as in presidential primary match-ups against then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders this year and other challengers. Here's a look at some key moments of Clinton's past debates that could influence her performance against Trump: FILE - In this Sept. 13, 2000 file photo, then-New York Republican Senate candidate Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. offers then-New York Democratic Senate candidate, first lady Hillary Clinton, a pledge to stop using "soft money" during their first debate in Buffalo, N.Y.

Bernie Sanders this year and other challengers. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) __ BULLYING CAN BACKFIRE Clinton's first 2000 Senate debate with Republican rival Rick Lazio, then New York congressman, shows what could go wrong for Trump if he tries to bully her. Lazio infamously walked over to Clinton's podium during the debate, demanding she sign a pledge to forgo a form of donations known as soft money. "Sign it right now," Lazio scolded Clinton, who gamely responded, "We'll shake on this, Rick." The move backfired with many female voters, who thought it was inappropriate. __ HAVING IT BOTH WAYS Clinton vacillated during an October 2007 debate in Philadelphia when she was asked if she supported her home state governor's proposal to grant driver's licenses to immigrants living in the country illegally. Obama and John Edwards pounced, accusing her of trying to take multiple sides of the issue. "I can't tell whether she was for it or against it," Obama said. Her tortured response encouraged her opponents to accuse her of being disingenuous. Against Trump, it's an example of how a defensive, legalistic response could hurt. __ HUMOR HELPS When Clinton was asked in 2008 by a New Hampshire moderator if she was likable enough, she responded with humor. "Well, that hurts my feelings," she said as the audience roared. Obama responded, "You're likable enough, Hillary." It came across as a putdown to many New Hampshire voters, who delivered Clinton a stunning victory. The exchange showed how Clinton's humor could be an effective countermeasure to Trump. __ WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH Clinton and Obama engaged in one of their fiercest exchanges in January 2008, an episode that shows the risks of a drawn-out fight. Clinton refused to back down as tensions spilled out — a potential scenario against Trump. Clinton and Obama battled over whether the Illinois senator had praised Republican ideals and former President Ronald Reagan. Obama said he was working in the streets while Clinton was "a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart." Clinton said she was fighting those GOP ideas while Obama was practicing law and representing real estate developer Tony Rezko "in his slum landlord business in inner-city Chicago." __ THE TAKEDOWN One of Clinton's strongest 2016 debate moments came before the New York primary, when she seized upon Sanders' lengthy interview with the New York Daily News in which he struggled to explain how he would break up large Wall Street banks. "Talk about judgment," Clinton said in a stinging response, noting Sanders' difficulty in explaining one of his "core issues." It showed that if Clinton's opponent reveals a weakness, she will take advantage of it. __ THOSE EMAILS In the first Democratic debate, Sanders declared that Americans were "sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails." Clinton smiled broadly and laughed as the audience cheered. Sanders said voters cared more about economic issues, prompting Clinton to thank her opponent with a very public handshake. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Clinton's use of a private email server, is unlikely to be as magnanimous. __ On Twitter, follow Ken Thomas at @kthomasDC In this photo taken Dec. 13, 2007, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen.

A march of a few hundred people turned chaotic after dusk, after protesters attempted to follow police in riot gear into the lobby of an uptown hotel. Officers used tear gas, and then a reporter heard a gunshot and saw a man lying in the street near the hotel entrance. The man, who was not identified, was taken to a hospital with injuries that medics said were "life-threatening"; officials announced on Twitter that the man had died, then later tweeted that he was on "life support." No other information was given. In the aftermath of the Tuesday afternoon death of Keith Lamont Scott, anger in the streets turned to looting and arson and property damage in the swanky downtown, and North Carolina's largest city joined the list of communities across the country that have erupted amid a growing debate on racial bias in policing. Near midnight, the governor declared a state of emergency and sent the National Guard and state troopers to assist local police. Seven police officers and two civilians were taken to hospitals for injuries, officials said. In Tulsa, meanwhile, protesters called for the arrest of the officer involved in a fatal shooting of a black man there on Friday. President Barack Obama called the mayors of both cities to offer his condolences and pledge help, the White House announced. To date, law enforcement officials have fatally shot 706 people this year, 163 of them black men, according to a Washington Post database tracking fatal police shootings. A growing divide in public rhetoric over that toll has been stoked by a summer of high-profile deaths captured on social media and the deadly assaults on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. The latest encounters come as the presidential race has tightened, and both candidates have offered positions and solutions. At a news conference Wednesday, Charlotte police insisted that Scott had a gun and was posing an "imminent deadly threat" when officers shot him outside an apartment complex near the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Scott's family, however, said he was unarmed when he was killed and was instead reading a book in his car while waiting to pick up his child from school - a detail that quickly went viral on social media and was seized upon by protesters here. Officers were searching for another man, a suspect with outstanding warrants, when they spotted Scott emerging from a vehicle and armed with a handgun, police said. "The officers gave loud, clear verbal commands" telling Scott to drop the weapon, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said. "Mr. Scott exited his vehicle armed with a handgun as the officers continued to yell at him to drop it. He stepped out, posing a threat to the officers." Putney said police recovered a gun and found no book at the scene. "It's time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story is a little bit different as to how it's been portrayed so far, especially through social media," the chief said. The police chief also said the officer who shot Scott was in plainclothes, wearing a vest with a police logo, and was accompanied by other officers in full uniform. The plainclothes officer wasn't wearing a body camera, but the other officers were. Whether authorities can defuse the anger on the streets could hinge on that body-cam footage. The shooting has thrust Charlotte to the fore of a national debate about access to police body cams. Putney said Wednesday that the department won't release any footage until a police investigation is complete. A new state law effective Oct. 1 forbids police agencies from making body-camera footage public without a court order. "At a time when you're seeing other states becoming more transparent, North Carolina is taking this tremendous step backward," said Mike Meno, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina. The violent protests and conflicting accounts in Charlotte proves "just how misguided this new law is," Meno said, and shows exactly why public access to such footage is crucial. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, however, said she does not believe the new law will apply to the footage and said she's asked the chief to show it to her and a small group of community leaders such as the NAACP chair. The new legislation is just the latest national controversy over equity and civil rights to develop out of North Carolina. In recent months, progressive forces have clashed with conservative ones over black voting rights, bathroom use for transgender people, and now police shootings and body-camera access - and in response have carried out boycotts and protests. Those have been peaceful, as were Tuesday's demonstrations, initially. In the first hours after the shooting, a large crowd gathered near the university, some chanting "black lives matter" and "hands up, don't shoot." As the protest grew in size and anger, police appeared in riot gear and fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Some protesters began smashing the windows of police cars. By early Wednesday, demonstrators had shut down traffic on Interstate 85. Some opened the backs of tractor-trailers, took out boxes and set them on fire in the middle of the highway, according to local news reports. A truck driver told news station WSOC that people stole cargo from her trailer. A few dozen appeared to have broken into a nearby Walmart, then dispersed when authorities arrived. Attorney General Loretta Lynch pleaded Wednesday for protesters to remain peaceful, criticizing the violence that injured police and demonstrators alike. "Protest is protected by our Constitution and is a vital instrument for raising issues and creating change," she said at a Washington conference. "But when it turns violent, it undermines the very justice that it seeks to achieve." North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said Wednesday in a statement that his office "will do everything we can to support the mayor and the police chief in their efforts to keep the community calm and to get this situation resolved. It's very important that we all work together as a team to solve a very difficult issue and to bring peace and resolution." In a Facebook Live video widely circulated leading up to the protest, a woman who identified herself as Scott's daughter said officers used a stun gun on him, then shot him four times with their service weapons. She added that Scott was disabled. "My daddy didn't do nothing; they just pulled up undercover," she said in the video. It was unclear whether she was present and witnessed the event. By Wednesday afternoon, the video had been taken down. Authorities said the officer who shot Scott is black, and they identified him as Brentley Vinson, who has worked for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police force since July 2014. He was placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. This city was the scene of another high-profile police shooting in September 2013, when Charlotte-Mecklenburg officers fatally shot Jonathan Ferrell, a 24-year-old black man who had crashed his car in a residential neighborhood several miles from the complex where Scott was killed. Officer Randall Kerrick fired 12 rounds at Ferrell, who was unarmed, striking him 10 times. Police said Ferrell ignored officers' instructions. Last year, the jury deadlocked during Kerrick's trial. While most jurors voted to acquit the officer, four voted to convict him. After a judge declared a mistrial, the state said it would not seek another trial. Ferrell's family and the city of Charlotte settled a lawsuit stemming from the shooting for a reported $2.25 million. But anger from the 2013 shooting never went away, lurking beneath the surface until Tuesday night, when it exploded again into the open. Jibril Hough, a local activist who organized protests during Kerrick's trial, said the current Charlotte demonstrations stem from lingering frustrations over Ferrell's shooting death three years ago. "I think what we went through with Kerrick here in Charlotte, even though it wasn't as explosive, I think that weathered on us," he said. "What happens is that 9 times out of 10, the cop will get off. He'll get paid leave. He'll get early retirement. He'll basically get paid for the killing. Nothing is being done to really change anything." "What you're seeing is people have been put in that situation for so long and they're tired of talking," he added. "They're tired of talking and talking and candlelight vigils and dialogue and nothing getting done." Hough said he did not agree with the violent turn the protests have taken. But, he said, there's a "boiling point" - and some people in Charlotte have reached it. <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 워싱턴포스트 다른기사 보기 이메일 웹출판 :   2016-09-25 00:03   김동균 기자 입력.편집 :   2016-09-25 00:02   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 SKT, '루나S' 태권브이 에디션 한정판 1천대 판매 세종∼평택 국도 개통 세종시 중심에 조성되는 국립중앙수목원 이미지 농민들 '트랙터 몰고 청와대로' 제네시스 EQ900 '북미 올해의 차' 최종 후보 SKT, '루나S' 태권브이 에디션 한정판 1천대 판매 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

Hillary Clinton is prepared for Monday’s presidential debate after expressing her exasperation last week that she’s not leading Trump by fifty points. She’s publicly branded him as a racist, a xenophobe and a misogynist. She’s got to stop advertising for him, it’s only helping him in the polls. Angelina Jolie’s decision to file for divorce against Brad Pitt on Tuesday was met with general relief by Hollywood’s liberal movie industry. The couple had become insufferably self-important. The last time Angelina and Brad dropped by the White House, they offered to adopt Sasha and Malia. New York’s disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner faces possible prison time after he got busted Tuesday sexting a fifteen-year-old girl. He sent no lewd photos this time. Everyone in Hollywood agrees that Anthony Weiner should be a bigger star considering all the exposure he’s had. Hillary Clinton proposed a huge hike in estate taxes Thursday including a top rate of sixty-five percent tax on the estates of wealthy Americans in order to pay for the social programs she’s proposing. The reaction was near-hysteric. Chelsea just enrolled in Trump University to learn a trade. President Obama’s half-brother in Kenya, Malik, told reporters Friday he will vote for Donald Trump when Kenya holds a mock U.S. election in November. It had to happen. Somehow you knew that the only Obama to vote for Donald Trump would be the one who has a Kenyan birth certificate. President Obama vowed Tuesday to bring in one hundred and ten thousand refugees this year saying the U.S. must not resist global integration. That’s daunting. If global integration in the U.S. works as well as racial integration did in the U.S., there’ll be no ozone left by the time the riots are over. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called for peace in Charlotte and an end to the nightly rioting that began Monday. It split the country. Some say the lawlessness embarrasses America while others think that people have a right to celebrate O.J.’s victory at the Emmy Awards as long as they like. Charlotte residents rioted, looted and burned Tuesday after one year of race riots in Baltimore and Ferguson, New York bombings, and mass shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino. It’s like we’re a Third World country. ISIS Friday issued a statement asking Americans to leave something for them. North Carolina’s governor declared a state of emergency in Charlotte Thursday and called out the National Guard. The streets are chaotic. With the looting, burning and violence, the only safe place to hide is inside the public restrooms, unless you’re transgender, and then you’re really screwed. Wells Fargo Bank executives ordered bank employees in Charlotte to stay home Thursday and avoid risking getting injured by the street rioters. Their absence from work did not stop the looting. Wells Fargo workers were told to telecommute and open up bogus bank accounts from home. Charlotte’s police chief sought calm after black protestors rioted following a police shooting Tuesday. They ran through the streets burning cop cars and smashing business windows. The rioters in Charlotte looted a Wal-Mart, and took everything in the store except the Taylor Swift CDs. The NFL and Carolina Panthers considered moving Sunday’s home game out of the Charlotte area when the Minnesota Vikings come to town due to this week’s race rioting. It should make for great television. If the inner cities riot over police treatment, imagine how they’ll react to a Viking invasion. Donald Trump soared to a five-point lead over Hillary Clinton in the Rasmussen Poll of voters nationwide Thursday. He’s definitely high energy onstage. If you are watching a Donald Trump speech on TV and turn off the volume it looks like he’s acting out a Jackie Chan movie for his friends.

The San Francisco-based company said in an announcement that it had been in “deep discussions to be acquired by a prominent public company” but, after those talks broke down, it had no option but to shut down. Dot & Bo contacted customers via email to inform them of its closure, which is effective today, while its website now directs to the same notice. The three-year-old company said it grew business 16-fold over its lifetime, and served “millions” of customers during that period. “We are humbled to have had such loyal customers and are extremely proud of the impact we made on the home furnishings market, but ultimately we were unable to find backers with the necessary vision to help us achieve our mission,” it added. The company declined to comment further when we asked for more information. Unlike many in the capital intensive e-commerce space, Dot & Co had not raised a huge amount of funding from investors, despite a founding team with impressive credentials — CEO Anthony Soohoo, for one, previously spent time with Apple, Yahoo and Trinity Ventures. Trinity Ventures and Oak Investment Partners are among its backers. The startup began life targeting young consumers with a ‘story-centric’ approach to selling furniture and home items, but earlier this year it increased its focus on business customers with a new service that offered free advice and consultancy to companies looking to spruce up or redevelop their work space. Despite successful exits like Jet.com to Walmart for $3 billion and Dollar Shave Club to Unilever for a reported $1 billion fee, there have been less successful e-commerce ventures shutting their doors of late. In one such example, One Kings Lane, an e-tailer once valued above $1 billion, was sold to Bed Bath & Beyond this year for an undisclosed price that Recode reported to be as low as $30 million.

Target said Jason Goldberger, who had been with the company for four years, will leave immediately. His role will be split between Chief Information Officer Mike McNamara and Chief Merchandising Officer Mike Tritton. McNamara will be responsible for the website and digital strategy and Tritton will take over the pricing and promotional functions of the job. “Taking this body of work in a new direction will help advance our efforts in these key areas during a pivotal time for Target,” Chief Executive Brian Cornell said in a statement. Goldberger's departure is the second high-profile exit at Target in less than a month. Chief Marketing Officer Jeff Jones left the company last month and joined Uber Technologies Inc. The leadership shake up at Target comes as its rivals gear up to better compete with Amazon. Wal-Mart Stores Inc last month splashed out over US$3 billion (RM12.37 billion) to acquire e-commerce startup Jet.com. Target's online sales contribute about 3 per cent to its overall revenue. Recognizing the need to boost growth, the Minneapolis-based retailer spent US$1.4 billion in 2015 to improve its e-commerce business. Target also said it will spend US$1.8 billion this year and US$2 billion a year starting in 2017 to improve its e-commerce operations. Target's online revenue grew 31 per cent in 2015, below the 40 per cent growth Chief Executive Brain Cornell promised investors. For the second quarter, online sales grew 16 per cent, a deceleration from 23 per cent in the first quarter. Brick-and-mortar sales have also suffered, with Target reporting its first quarterly drop in comparable sales in two years during the second quarter. The company lowered its forecast for the rest of the year, saying it expects sales to be flat to down 2 per cent in the two remaining quarters. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Movie accent expert breaks down 32 actors’ accents Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Target to offer more deals, extend free shipping until January Wal-Mart reviews Welspun records after Target pulls sheets Wendy’s says it finds more unusual card activity at restaurants Target offers to pay hack victims US$10m in settlement Swatch sues Target, claims it copied watch designs Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Man pleads guilty to coworker's death in Wilson County Andy Humbles , ahumbles@tennessean.com 2:29 p.m. CDT September 23, 2016 Michael York (Photo: Wilson County Jail) A man pleaded guilty to second degree murder Friday for the death of a coworker in a case prosecutors allege the defendant used the victim’s ATM card 10 minutes after the shooting. Michael Wayne York, 32, of Lafayette was sentenced to 30 years without parole. He was booked in Feb. 8, 2015 and time spent in jail will count toward time served. York was charged with criminal homicide and especially aggravated robbery after officers found Brian Christopher Petroff, 36, shot to death in the early morning hours of Feb. 7, 2015 at the intersection of Winter Drive and McCowan Drive. York and Petroff left work together from Steves & Sons in Lebanon around midnight shortly before the body was found, police said after the shooting. Petroff was shot multiple times, including twice to the head, prosecutors said. The prosecution told the court there was evidence that showed York used and tried to use Petroff’s ATM card multiple times hours after the shooting that included at a Lebanon gas station and Walmart. Attorneys alleged the ATM card had transactions after Petroff was found dead and video showed York using and trying to use the card. Police also found blood that matched the victim on York’s boots and Petroff’s driver’s license in jeans owned by York at the defendant’s Macon County residence, according to the prosecution. York initially told police he got the ATM card from a third party, and then that the shooting was in self-defense, prosecutors said. Reach Andy Humbles at 615-726-5939 and on Twitter @AndyHumbles.

REUTERS/Dan Riedlhuber/FilesMore CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp <TGT.N> said on Friday Chief Digital Officer Jason Goldberger, who had been with the company for four years, has left the retailer and his role will be taken over by two senior company executives. The Minneapolis-based retailer said Goldberger's role will be split between Chief Information Officer Mike McNamara and Chief Merchandising Officer Mike Tritton. "To provide clear accountability and speed up decision making, we will be transitioning Jason's responsibilities to two current leadership team members," Chief Executive Brian Cornell said in a statement. "Taking this body of work in a new direction will help advance our efforts in these key areas during a pivotal time for Target," Cornell said. McNamara will be responsible for Target's website and digital strategy while Tritton will now oversee the pricing and promotions team, the statement said. Target has struggled to rev up online growth which has lagged that of larger rivals like Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> and Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, which recently splashed out over $3 billion to acquire e-commerce startup Jet.com. In 2015, Target's tech spending stood at $1.5 billion. Target has said it will spend $1.8 billion this year on improving its e-commerce operations and $2 billion a year starting in 2017. Goldberger's departure is the second high profile exit at Target in less than a month. Chief Marketing Officer Jeff Jones left the company last month to join Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].

NOEL ESPINOZA The Brownsville Herald Friends and teachers remember him as a likeable person with a great sense of humor during difficult times. Stvan Francisco Rivas, 22, a student at The University of Texas at Brownsville and an employee of EyeMasters in Brownsville, apparently died Saturday morning after the vehicle he was driving plunged in the Laguna Madre with the collapse of the Queen Isabella Causeway. Patty Rosas, who had known Rivas since childhood, said he attended Russell Elementary, Central Middle School and Pace High School. Id remember him as the sweetest thing in the world, Rosas said. He would think of me as his little sister and Id think of him as my big brother. Rosas said Rivas had gone to visit friends on South Padre Island and he was returning to work in Brownsville when the causeway collapsed in front of him. He was staying with some friends on the Island and then decided to come back, Rosas said. He was alone. He was best friend with my brother, Gilbert, Rosas said. He lived in Brownsville, but his parents moved to Houston five or six years ago. Jacqueline Aguilar, a friend and a co-worker, said Rivas was supposed to work Sunday at EyeMasters, where he had been a lab technician since January. Were all taking it hard, Aguilar said, adding that she last saw Rivas Sept. 5 and talked to him the previous Saturday while he was visiting his family in Humble, Houston suburb. He was a nice person, Aguilar said. If one needed a favor or to talk to someone, he would be there to listen and to cheer you up. He was always making us laugh. His presence was always felt. Rivas, a member of the U.S. Marines Corps Reserve, lived with an aunt in Brownsville. Friends said he had a knack for keeping things lively. He wasnt just an employee, but also a friend, said Edwina Garcia, another employee of EyeMasters. He was a wonderful person. Laura Villarreal, a UTB math instructor, said she knew Rivas, but didnt know he was among the victims of the bridge collapse until Monday morning. He stood out in class, Villarreal, who remembers Rivas as Steve, said. He always teased and joked around, but he wasnt a slacker. He was a good student and he was likeable. In addition to Rivas, officials have listed among the dead Gaspar Hinojosa, 52. Port Isabel Fire Marshall Robert Harris has been missing since Saturday and is considered among the victims. Another person pulled out of the water hasnt been identified yet. Born in Mexico City, Rivas will be transported to Calvary Hill Funeral and Memorial Park in Humble, where final services will be held. According to Buena Vista Funeral Home, funeral services were held Monday at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Brownsville.

I do my best to give her everything she needs to succeed and live up to her full potential. However, corporations are not living up to their full potential by paying their fair share and contributing to the schools our kids attend. My daughter is 8 years old and just started third grade. I’m very involved with her school and with PTA. It concerns me that she is expected to learn the same content in less time and in larger classrooms than students in other states. Oregon students are on such a tight schedule during the day that they barely have time to eat their lunches. In addition I know firsthand that PTA/PTOs have to work harder than ever to raise funds to support school needs and that families are bearing the burden of supplying basic needs to teachers in their classrooms, like tissue, notebooks and markers. Simply put, kids in Oregon are not getting the same quality of education students in other states receive. According to the Oregon Department of Education, in 2014-15 schools in Deschutes County spent an average of $9,969 per student, which is 20.7 percent below the national average. And we rank near the bottom in length of school with an average of 169.5 days, over two weeks shorter than the national average. In the upcoming biennium, the state estimates we will face a funding gap to current services. This means across-the-board cuts to our already poorly performing schools. For years, the legislature has been looking for an answer to this problem. However, we’ve finally found one. Measure 97 would move Oregon from dead last in the nation in corporate taxes, according to the Anderson Economic Group. This would generate an estimated $3 billion annually in revenue that would be dedicated to public education, health care and senior services by law. Only about 1,000 of Oregon’s some 400,000 companies will be affected by Measure 97. And according to the Legislative Revenue Office, 85 percent of the revenue raised will be paid by corporations with more than $100 million in Oregon sales, the vast-majority of which are head-quartered out-of-state. According to the Oregon Center for Public Policy, during the last four decades, the tax burden in Oregon has shifted from corporations to working families. In 1973, corporations paid 18.5 percent of all Oregon income taxes. Today they pay just 6.7 percent, a decline of nearly two-thirds. Proportionally, these c-corporations that do over $25 million in Oregon sales pay far less in taxes than what you and I pay. And that is putting our kids, grandchildren, nieces and nephews at risk. I pay my fair share in taxes, and I try to make sure that students like my daughter and students across Oregon are getting a world-class education. It’s time that these corporations — Wal-Mart, Comcast and Monsanto among them — also pay their fair share to contribute to our kids’ education. The bottom line is that if a company is doing over $25 million in sales, they can afford to contribute to our students’ education. I would do anything for my daughter. I’m just asking that big corporations do something for her and the thousands of other students in Oregon. I hope you’ll join parents like me in voting yes on Measure 97 this November. — Michelle Calvillo lives in Bend. 15117338 View next article in Opinion     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

To be fair, Mr. Rivera was posed the question and he obliged with an answer the best he could. But he made a critical mistake that far too many have been making regarding the violent protests we have seen in Charlotte and previously in other cities across America. By merely condemning the method of protest and not the premise, you essentially give legitimacy to the premise of the protest. If you legitimize the premise of these protests, you must legitimize any means of protest, given the nature of these particular grievances. What would be the “right way” to protest such horrific injustices if they actually existed? After all, we are not talking about proposed tuition hikes or whether individuals can use the bathroom of their choosing. The claim is that people of color are being targeted for execution by law enforcement. If you give any credence to that claim, how could you denounce any method of protest? There is a hypocrisy regarding violent protest that has existed since the founding of our country - a founding predicated by men who took up arms in violent protest over some disagreements about taxation representation. The hypocrisy is as follows: If you disagree with the protest, then the method of protest is condemned and the perpetrators are vilified as criminals and savages. If you agree with the protest, then any methods used are justified, the protest is celebrated, perhaps commemorated with a national holiday and the perpetrators get their portraits engraved on official currency. Appearing on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien," former NFL star Marshawn Lynch defended the national anthem protests by Colin Kaepernick by saying, "I would rather see him take a knee than stand up, put his hands up, and get murdered." EDITOR’S NOTE: Here’s video of the segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRTo4xst_x0 Lynch’s reference to the infamous Ferguson narrative put forward by the left - an incident that never happened  - not only went unchallenged by O'Brien but the late-night host joined his sidekick and the studio audience in a round of applause adding, "Alright, I'm with you on that.” (Note: Ever wonder why there seems to be no fear of police brutality during violent protests? It would stand to reason that individuals who spend their lives in constant fear of being murdered by police without provocation might be slightly hesitant to antagonize police officers while committing acts of violence during a protest.) If you accept Lynch's claim (as Conan O'Brien and apparently many others in America do), that African-American men are "murdered" while their hands are raised high above their heads, then you must accept any and all means necessary to end such outrageous practices-even violent protest. There are two rules to any successful protest. The first is that there must be a legitimate reason for the protest, or at least a truthful one. The second is that there must be the possibility of a positive end result. In the case of the violent protests we have seen in recent years, neither rule applies. The entire premise of the protests is based on a false narrative that delegitimizes the movement to begin with. If the movement is illegitimate, then there can be no positive end result. You cannot remedy a problem that does not exist. And the police are not about stop shooting people who present a threat to their lives. If a positive end result were possible, perhaps one day we would see a portrait of men running through the broken window of a Wal-Mart carrying flat-screen TVs right next to the portrait of men throwing boxes of tea overboard in Boston harbor in some museum. That is unlikely to happen. Before condemning violent protests, you must ask yourself this question: Do you condemn the rationale behind the protest or simply the methods of carrying out the protest? If you only condemn the violence, then you must ask yourself another question: What length should people go to fight for freedom and equality? Is violence not a legitimate recourse against the oppression of human beings? We must not denounce the violence but the movement itself in its entirety. The violence might be justified if the movement were not completely based on a lie.

The series of panels honors the original 28,000 families and corporations that purchased 53,000 seats in the old Trans World Dome to bring the Rams to St. Louis in 1995. A federal judge has ruled that the Los Angeles Rams must provide season tickets or refunds on deposits for the St. Louis PSLs. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com It seems like only yesterday that thousands of otherwise sensible St. Louisans were applying for the chance to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars just to have the right to spend more hundreds or thousands of dollars to watch the St. Louis Rams play football. In fact, as a federal district court reminded us last week, it was 21 years ago. An entire generation of children has grown to adulthood, grown facial hair and gotten tattoos since the mad scramble for “personal seat licenses” in January 1995. It seemed like a rip-off then, and sure enough, it was. U.S. District Court Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr. ruled last week that everyone who got one of the original PSLs to watch the Rams play football in St. Louis might be entitled to some sort of refund someday, but they’re not entitled to buy (and presumably, resell at a premium) tickets to watch them play in Los Angeles. It was just another football-related disappointment in a city that should be used to them by now. Given everything that’s happened since, it’s weird to recall how St. Louis lost its collective mind in 1995. Things were kind of desperate. We’d been through the Great Flood of 1993. McDonnell Douglas was being stalked by Boeing. The NFL had abandoned St. Louis in 1987. The Cardinals were on an austerity kick and Major League Baseball players were on strike. But against all odds, the Missouri Legislature had ponied up half the cost of a new, built-on-spec domed stadium downtown. When St. Louis failed to get an NFL expansion team in 1993, it needed an NFL tenant in the worst sort of way. That’s exactly the way we got the Rams. The late Jerry Clinton, the beer wholesaler who’d gotten the stadium off the ground, had been shoved aside by local bigshots who deemed him insufficiently rich. They formed FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium) and began trailing their coat in Los Angeles. They needed a really rich guy to show the NFL, so they signed up a Columbia, Mo., real estate tycoon named Stan Kroenke. Due diligence was in short supply. FANS Inc. had negotiated one of the worst leases in the history of sports. Kroenke spotted the hole in it right away, the part that gave the team permission to move after 20 years if the stadium wasn’t up to the league’s top standards. He bought a minority stake in the Rams that included first right of refusal for the rest. And then he bade his time, because 20 years is nothing to a real estate man. FANS Inc. set about selling PSLs to raise the money it had promised the Rams if they’d move to St. Louis. PSLs were a new concept then. They’d been brought to the NFL a couple of years earlier by Max Muhleman, a Charlotte, N.C., marketing executive. They were used to help finance a stadium for the expansion Carolina Panthers. The NFL loved it — a new way to get richer by using other people’s money. PSLs were an easier sell than taxpayer financing because they were like user fees: Only the people who actually went to the games had to pay. Of course most new stadiums these days, including the new Busch Stadium in St. Louis, are built with taxpayer money and PSL money, too. In early 1995, FANS Inc. put 46,000 PSLs up for sale and got applications for 73,710. About 53,000 eventually were sold. Most of them were for the cheaper, upper-bowl seats in what would soon become the TWA Dome. But others were for the $4,500 lower-bowl seats. In St. Louis, we’re easy. Most of the money went to the Rams, in one form or another. Part of it paid for Rams Park, the now empty practice facility in Earth City. The lease gives the Rams the option to buy that property for $1 in 2024. If anyone thinks Stan Kroenke won’t try to exercise that option, he hasn’t been paying attention. Even before the Rams’ lease on the stadium, now Edward Jones Dome, hit its 20-year reopener clause, Kroenke was buying property in Inglewood, Calif. It was going to be a Walmart. Sure it was. Meanwhile, as the Rams endured one losing season after another, the bottom fell out of the PSL resale market. The Rams had been selling their own PSLs, creating two classes of PSLs, the original FANS Inc. ones and those sold by the team itself. It turns out the FANS Inc. PSLs have a termination clause in the event the team relocates. The Rams-sold version doesn’t. The judge ruled that fans with the Rams-sold PSLs might be able to apply them in Los Angeles, depriving Kroenke of a few thousand dollars. We can only hope so.

 UPDATE 1-With U.S. drone rules set, firms race for flight data Reuters Sep. 23, 2016, 2:48 PM 223 facebook linkedin twitter email print (Rewrites throughout, adds industry comments, examples of drone use, details on FAA waivers for drones) By Nick Carey and Nandita Bose Sept 23 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc's launch this week of drone test flights simulating emergency medical-supply deliveries highlights a race for data to prove such deliveries can be performed safely. UPS's medical emergency at the Children's Island summer camp off the Massachusetts coast was fictional. But gathering data about the drone's flight and others like it is a vital part of a new effort to convince U.S. regulators to loosen the reins on using robotic aircraft for deliveries. UPS's test flight was handled by drone maker CyPhy Works, in which it owns a stake. "The technology for drones is there and it's moving extremely fast," said CyPhy founder Helen Greiner. "But it's also true that we need to prove we can operate them safely and reliably." The UPS-CyPhy test comes amid a burst of U.S. drone activity, including companies focusing on package delivery. Amazon.com Inc is focusing on tests abroad, but UPS and others want to win over the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, whose primary concern is safety. The Obama administration estimates the commercial drone industry could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy and support up to 100,000 new jobs by 2025. The FAA's rules published on Aug. 29 dictate conditions for commercial drones. The aircraft must weigh under 55 pounds (25 kg), may not fly over people not involved in operations and must remain within the operator's line of sight. Drone makers, retailers and package delivery companies are now angling for waivers, largely to operate out of the line of sight, using small tests to collect data on everything from air speed to operating in bad weather and the frequency of accidents. To obtain an FAA waiver exempting them from certain rules, companies must spell out a business case and use data to prove their drones are safe. Some drone proponents have chafed at how slowly the FAA has moved to regulate drones, said Logan Campbell, CEO of drone consulting firm Aerotas. "The only way things could move more quickly is if everyone were to share their data," he said. "But ... no one wants to lose their competitive edge so that's not going to happen." An FAA spokeswoman said the agency grants waivers "if we find the proposed operation can be safely conducted using risk mitigation strategies." Ben Marcus, CEO of drone software provider AirMap, said the "big burden is being shifted from regulators ... to actual operators and developers" to demonstrate their technology can function safely. STEP BY STEP The FAA's cautious approach has encouraged some companies to test package delivery drones overseas. Amazon is testing deliveries in the United Kingdom, where it can fly drones out of the line of sight. Since the FAA's most recent guidance, more is happening in the U.S. market. PrecisionHawk is developing a system enabling drones to detect objects in the air and on the ground to avoid collisions - technology that could help deliver packages. Vice President Tyler Collins said PrecisionHawk received an FAA waiver last month to operate out of the line of sight, based on years of data from crop inspections, as doing so would save farmers time and money. Package delivery vehicles maker Workhorse Group has developed the HorseFly drone which launches from a vehicle's roof. In current testing, the driver must stand and watch the drone. CEO Steve Burns said Workhorse has applied for an FAA waiver in a few rural ZIP codes to allow the driver to continue his route while the drone is in the air. Once Workhorse proves its case, it will seek a waiver for more ZIP codes. Burns said the HorseFly costs only 2 cents per mile to operate versus package delivery vehicles, some of which get 5 miles to the gallon - making traditional vehicles far more expensive to run. "What we're doing is of interest to people who deliver things - we have their attention," Burns said. UPS is using drones to manage inventory in warehouses, as is Walmart Mart Stores Inc, which can also gather data. Adam Shaw, CEO of drone seller Maverick Drone Systems, has seen an uptick in company requests for drones to scan barcodes in warehouses. Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx Corp, UPS's main rival, said this week FedEx has robotics programs under way including drones, but declined to provide details.

Peter Buckley, our outgoing state representative, says it would solve the state’s fiscal problems for the foreseeable future. He should know. His long service on the Joint Ways and Means Committee has made him an authority on Oregon’s finances. I’ve been running these columns by him to avoid factual errors. I'm covering two subjects in two more columns: the taxes corporations now pay, and whether consumers, not large corporations, will pay for Measure 97. Both are points of contention. This week, taxes. Proponents of Measure 97 claim Oregon has the lowest corporate taxes in the nation. Opponents deny this, citing our statutory rates of 6.6 percent on taxable income up to $1 million and 7.6 percent on income greater than $1 million. If corporations paid at those rates, Oregon would rank in the mid-range nationally. But they don’t. Corporations enjoy 51 tax credits created by the Oregon Legislature. That’s in addition to the corporate income tax breaks in federal tax rules, which matter because Oregon uses a corporation’s federal return as the starting point for figuring its state tax obligation. Other Oregon rules changes and some corporations’ use of tax shelters have also lowered corporate tax bills. (See the 2016 report “The Gaming and Decline of Oregon Corporate Taxes” on Oregon Center for Public Policy’s website.) Because of these fairly recent federal and Oregon tax breaks, corporations have succeeded in shifting an ever-increasing share of state income taxes and property taxes onto individuals. In the mid-'70s, corporations paid 18.5 percent of Oregon’s total income taxes; last year it was 6.7 percent. In the 1987-88 fiscal year, businesses paid about half of all property taxes levied in Oregon and households paid about 42 percent. By the 2014-15 fiscal year, the business share of property taxes was about 40 percent, the household share 54 percent. Oregon has an alternative to its business income tax. It’s the minimum tax based on a corporation’s sales. We must understand this tax and who pays it, because the minimum tax is what Measure 97 would raise. In 2013 more than two-thirds of the 29,475 corporations that paid Oregon income taxes paid only the minimum tax. Included among them were 398 corporations with Oregon sales of at least $25 million. And of those, 78 had Oregon sales in excess of $100 million. Currently the minimum tax starts at a paltry $150 on sales up to $500,000. It rises to $30,000 on sales of $25 million to $50 million; $50,000 on sales of $50 million to $75 million; $75,000 on sales of $75 million to $100 million; and $100,000 on sales above $100 million. This means corporations like Walmart are probably paying Oregon taxes equivalent to 1/10 of 1 percent of their sales here! Measure 97 would require all C corporations (shareholder-owned and taxed separately from their owners’ income taxes) to pay a minimum tax of $30,000 and also pay 2.5 percent on their Oregon sales of $25 million or more. If it passes, large corporations will finally bear a fair share of funding the public good.
