Apparently, Kim’s sobriety is being called into question again after new housewife Eden Sassoon started talking about her own experiences with alcoholism, overdoses, and losing her sister. And this was probably the last thing she wanted to focus on as she was planning her big party. According to a new tweet, Kyle Richards revealed that she was a bit stressed out over the party as some of the pieces weren’t falling into place. In addition, Richards knew that Eden might confront her sister about some of the things that were said behind her back. While Kyle wanted to keep the peace with her sister, one can imagine she had a lot going on. And this resulted in a cringeworthy moment for Kyle Richards. “I love you, but complaining about a Walmart being nearby at your party is a little cringeworthy…I’m a target person though!” one person wrote to Kyle on Twitter after watching Tuesday’s episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, where Richards questioned her party planner about a Walmart being nearby where she was hosting her party. Don't miss tonight's #rhobh & our Great Gatsby party ???????????? thank you @david_meister for my dress!! A photo posted by Kyle Richards Umansky (@kylerichards18) on Jan 31, 2017 at 3:45pm PST Kyle’s expression was one of surprise and skepticism. And while some people saw her reaction as being one of shock that a Walmart would be near her fancy party, others saw her reaction as one of confusion. Was there a Walmart near her that she didn’t know about? Her reaction caused some discussion on Twitter as some people thought that Kyle was implying she was too good for Walmart and hinting that she was better than people who shopped there. But as it turns out, this was not the case. “You misunderstood. I WANTED one. Just didn’t believe there is one b/c I’ve never seen one around here,” Kyle Richards explained on Twitter, sharing that she would love to have a Walmart nearby where the party was because she loves shopping there. As it turns out, Kyle Richards was just confused as she hadn’t seen a Walmart near there, so when the party planner suggested going to Walmart to pick up some last minute supplies, Richards was just confused as to what location he was referring to. As it turns out, Kyle would have probably gone with him. But maybe Richards had other things to worry about other than locating the nearest Walmart. Just days prior, she had learned that Eden Sassoon was talking about Kim Richards and her sobriety behind her back. While Kyle didn’t want to say anything, she was nervous about Sassoon confronting Kim at her own party, and she was surprised when Eden approached them to have a conversation. Bumped into @doritkemsley at @accesshollywood this morning. Discussing #rhobh & #celebapprentice tune into #rhobh tonight at 9:00 @bravotv A photo posted by Kyle Richards Umansky (@kylerichards18) on Jan 17, 2017 at 8:29pm PST “Eden and PK rode with us and some of our friends. Dorit lets me know that Eden said I enable Kim. I know Lisa Rinna said that before, so is that why Eden said that? Nobody who has uttered the word “enabler ” has ever witnessed any enabling. I resent having to defend myself against something so far from the truth. I’m not allowing it to ruin my night though. I’ve been so excited about this party that I’m basically letting it go in one ear and out the other,” Kyle Richards explains in her Bravo blog about the confrontation, shifting her focus from her sister to the property. “The house and party looked beautiful. Yes, I was nervous about the cold weather and a few things, but it all turned out great. I always torture my party planner Glenn Schneider. I have to give him a shout out just for dealing with me!” Kyle Richards concludes in her blog about the party that was a twist on her annual white party. What do you think of Kyle Richards’ comments about Walmart? Do you think she was truly surprised to hear about a potential store in the area?

An Ottawa school bus driver has been fired after she left a busload of children in a Walmart parking lot while she went inside the store. Ottawa Student Transportation Authority (OSTA) general manager Vicky Kyriaco told CBC News the driver, who was driving children home from Cedarview Middle School, didn't follow proper procedure when she made the pit stop Thursday afternoon. OSTA general manager Vicky Kyriaco says the driver was fired for failing to follow proper procedure. (Waubgeshig Rice/CBC) According to OSTA, the driver turned off the ignition and went into the Walmart store at Strandherd and Longfields drives in Barrhaven for about 20 minutes. The children on the bus, which was full at the time, range in age from 11 to 14. Kyriaco said it appears the driver was experiencing some sort of "emergency," but the precise reason for the stop isn't clear. 'We want to make sure that [parents] know this isn't going to happen again.' - Vicki Kyriaco, OSTA "Certainly everyone has their own personal health circumstances that might require a pit stop, but no matter what, there should always be communication with the operator," Kyriaco said. "There are alternate options certainly to make sure the students are safe and that we also deal with the driver's needs." According to OSTA procedure, a driver who has to leave children on a bus for whatever reason must contact the dispatcher to ensure the safety of the passengers, said Kyriaco. The driver did not follow procedure in this case. Principal notified parents Brian Begbie, principal of Cedarview Middle School, sent an email to parents of the children on route V158 Friday afternoon. In it, Begbie quotes a letter he received from OSTA: "Some students have reported that their bus driver parked their bus at a Walmart before completing her run, yesterday. According to these students, the driver left students unattended on the bus for a period of approximately 20 minutes. The driver had turned the bus off and removed the keys. "No injuries have been reported. We are committed to ensuring the safety of your children and wanted you to know that there had been unusual circumstances with your child's trip home yesterday." Driver 'removed' "OSTA and the Operator have conducted an investigation. It has been concluded that the driver was not authorized to stop and did not communicate her intentions appropriately. She has been removed from this route and will no longer be driving any OSTA routes."  Kyriaco said she found out about the situation Friday morning and took immediate action to safeguard student safety. "We want parents to understand that we really are committed to the safety of their children while they're riding the bus. We want to make sure that they know this isn't going to happen again. And, at the time, they were in a secured vehicle. They were safe and they'll continue to be riding on a safe bus."

(David Thurton/ CBC News) A class-action lawsuit filed against Walmart Canada Corp. is seeking $10 million in damages on behalf of customers who purchased contaminated food at a Fort McMurray Walmart after last year's wildfire. Calgary-based Higgerty Law filed a statement of claim in Edmonton Court of Queen's Bench on Feb. 3. It seeks compensation for Alberta consumers who purchased or consumed products from Walmart's Fort McMurray location. The action relates "to the negligent and irresponsible" sale and provision of consumer goods "which were unfit for human use or consumption following the Fort McMurray wildfires in 2016, due to smoke and toxin contamination." The lawsuit follows action taken by Alberta Health Services in January against Walmart. AHS filed 174 Public Health Act charges against the company in relation to the alleged sale of wildfire-contaminated products and goods. Court documents show the alleged health act violations occurred at the Walmart outlet on Hospital Street between May 24 and May 29, 2016. Law firm considers class-action suit against Walmart for allegedly selling wildfire-contaminated food Walmart faces 174 charges related to sale of fire-contaminated food The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of several groups: People who purchased contaminated products or goods but didn't consume them and didn't receive a full refund; People who purchased uncontaminated products and disposed of them after becoming aware of the risk of contamination but did not receive a full refund, and; People who used or consumed contaminated products or goods and experienced "resulting illness, damages for any out-of-pocket medical expenses, damages for lost wages, damages for any future care expense, and damages for pain and suffering." "Our clients are concerned that their families' health may have been compromised," co-counsel Patrick Higgerty said in a news release Friday. "While the full scope of the health impact on the affected families is not yet known, we will be seeking damages to compensate everyone affected. Consumers who have called us are universal in their call for the facts to be revealed and those accountable be held responsible." Clint Docken with Higgerty Law said five people have signed up for the class action and they're still accepting more claimants. William Young, a warehouse technician at the Sears store in Fort McMurray, is the representative plaintiff in the lawsuit. In the news release from Higgerty Law, Young said he was "one of the essential personnel who came back early to help in the recovery process." The statement of claim says Young purchased various products including eggs, sausages, milk, energy drinks and water between May 25, 2016, and May 29, 2016. "Walmart needs to be held accountable for directly putting us in danger, and for not implementing a better plan of action in the wake of such disasters," Young said in the news release. "We'd like to see that this doesn't happen again, and we'd like to be compensated for the damages we have accumulated as a result of Walmart's negligence." None of the allegations in the statement of claim have been proven. Walmart hasn't responded to CBC's request for comment. A court has not certified the class-action.  Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Saturday Mainly sunny 0°C Sunday Sunny 6°C Monday Sunny 4°C Tuesday Sunny 4°C Wednesday Sunny 11°C More Weather | | Latest Edmonton News Headlines Job losses not responsible for Edmonton's rising unemployment rate, city economist says ATCO faces $10M lawsuit for explosion at Fort McMurray home Edmonton woman can't communicate with unconscious father's doctors in Turkey Silver Skate Festival returns to the river valley video Vince Li, man who beheaded passenger on Greyhound bus, given absolute discharge Edmonton Index Promos Spruce Grove, Parkland County get more bus routes to Edmonton Mother of Canadian killed fighting ISIS questions delay in returning son's body Alberta carbon tax rebates too generous, says Alberta Party Battle against fentanyl must include input from drug users, says former drug user Top News Headlines Community leader in Minnesota 'overwhelmed' with calls from Somalis aiming to walk across Canadian border video Vince Li, man who beheaded passenger on Greyhound bus, given absolute discharge Trump considers signing a 'brand new order' on immigration read comments 'It was my choice to make:' Over boos from crowd, Trudeau says electoral reform scuttled for national unity read comments video 'Hunting is not about killing for me': Trophy hunter sees shooting big game as form of conservation read comments video Most Viewed Storm of reaction to news Syrian refugee charged with sex assaults 'A dream for everybody who wrestles': Alberta man makes debut on WWE Raw ATCO faces $10M lawsuit for explosion at Fort McMurray home Job losses not responsible for Edmonton's rising unemployment rate, city economist says Edmonton woman can't communicate with unconscious father's doctors in Turkey Lawsuit seeks $10M damages for Walmart consumers after Fort McMurray wildfire 'Can you hear me?': New phone scam tricks you into answering 'yes' Teenage girls touched at WEM water park, man charged with 6 counts of sexual assault Alberta family escapes house fire after cat wakes owner Don't Miss Luggage mangled on Air Canada flight 'looked like it was out of a war zone' Post-fire construction boom in Fort McMurray expected to surpass height of oilsands frenzy Video Red Deer man punches cougar at Tim Hortons to save dog YEAR IN REVIEW Edmonton's best restaurants 2016 Exclusive Son caught Edmonton mother fatally stabbing her daughter, police sources say Video Syrian family's arrival at Edmonton airport becomes music jam session Explore CBC CBC Home TV Radio News Sports Music Life Arts Kids Local Documentaries Comedy Books Parents Indigenous Digital Archives Games Contests Site Map Stay Connected Apps RSS Podcasts Newsletters & Alerts Services and Information Corporate Info Public Appearances Commercial Services Reuse & Permission Terms of Use Privacy Policy CBC Shop Help Contact Us Jobs Doing Business with Us Renting Facilities CBC Radio-Canada ©2017 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 10, 2017 at 12:23PM It's no secret that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in online retail. But it's still astounding just how dominant it's been in recent years. New data from Slice Intelligence shows Amazon took 53% of all the sales growth of online retailers in the US last year. Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau has been tracking e-commerce sales growth around 15.5% through the first three quarters of the year. Put another way, despite its size, Amazon continues to take share of the growing e-commerce market, and competitors such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are struggling to keep up. Image source: Amazon.com. $53 billion in retail sales up for grabs While the U.S. Census Bureau hasn't released its estimates for the fourth quarter of 2016 yet, extrapolating out the steady growth rate of the first three quarters results in $53 billion in online sales for 2016. In addition, the majority of retail growth in the United States comes from e-commerce. In 2015, 62% of total growth came from online sales. Slice's numbers may be a bit off, considering Amazon saw an increase of "just" $16 billion in sales across all of North America. Still, the company is undoubtedly taking market share as its sales growth outpaces the overall industry. With e-commerce accounting for such a significant share of retail growth in the United States, Amazon's biggest competitors, like Wal-Mart, are really feeling the hurt. While Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% last year, Wal-Mart's overall U.S. sales increased just 3.3% through the first three quarters of the year. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales fared a bit better, increasing 7%, 11.8%, and 20.6% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. The third quarter was boosted by the acquisition of Jet.com. Overall, Wal-Mart's organic e-commerce sales still appear to lag the industry. How is Amazon dominating retail? Even if you're skeptical of Slice's claim that Amazon took 53% of online sales growth last year, it's clear that Amazon accounts for a huge share of the retail growth in the United States. Not just e-commerce growth, but overall retail sales. Slice had a few thoughts to share on why Amazon has been able to stay ahead of the competition: Faster shipping. Amazon's average ship time fell about 1.5 days over the past two years, and it remains more than two days faster than the average competitor, according to Slice's data. Wal-Mart recently started offering free two-day shipping on about 2 million select items, but its selection pales in comparison with the 50 million Prime-eligible items on Amazon. Subscriptions. Amazon's subscribe-and-save feature allows customers to automatically reorder a product, receive free shipping, and get a discount to boot. That's quite an incentive to become a repeat customer. Ease of ordering. Products such as Amazon's Echo smart speaker or its Dash buttons make ordering products from Amazon easier than putting on pants -- the very pants I ordered from Amazon. Undoubtedly, however, the biggest factor fueling Amazon's continued dominance of retail in the United States is its Prime program. Prime makes customers extremely loyal. It's what fuels 55% of online shoppers to check Amazon.com first (and maybe last). And it causes shoppers to spend more on Amazon than their non-Prime counterparts. Last year, Amazon added "tens of millions" of new Prime members, according to its fourth-quarter earnings release. Unlike the previous two years, when Amazon experienced around 50% annual growth in membership, the company didn't provide a growth rate. That may be because Prime membership is nearing saturation in markets such as the United States. Estimates show more than half of U.S. households are already Prime members. Still, with a growing majority of households subscribed to Prime (even if that growth is slowing) and going to Amazon as their first online shopping destination, it looks as if Amazon will continue to take share of the U.S. retail market for the foreseeable future.

Instead, the retailer is offering free two-day shipping without a membership fee on as many as two million items, lowering the minimum purchase required for free shipping to $35 from $50. All current ShippingPass members will receive a refund on their membership.   "In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes," Marc Lore, President and CEO, Walmart U.S. eCommerce wrote on the retailer's blog. "It no longer makes sense to charge for it."   While the two million items that qualify for two-day shipping "make up the vast majority of what customers buy online," according to Lore, Amazon's marketplace offers at least 30 million products available through Amazon prime in comparison.   Lore remains positive about customer-centric changes the retail is working towards, writing "I’ve been here for four months and I couldn’t be more excited about how fast we are moving. It feels like a startup. We’ve rolled out a new leadership team and organizational structure that’s highly customer centric. We’ve got everybody working on new ways to serve our customers."

By Ben White and Mary Lee 02/10/17 08:00 AM EST WHITE HOUSE PUSHES TRUMP INC. — Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dawsey and I look at the remarkable extent to which the White House is willing to promote Trump family brands, from the president’s Mar-a-Lago club to Ivanka Trump’s clothing and accessories business. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday took the remarkable step of public urging people to buy Ivanka Trump’s goods following the flap with Nordstrom. She did so from the White House, a clear violation of federal ethics rules. Nothing is likely to happen to Conway because her boss probably enjoyed the comments and the Office of Government Ethics has no real power to impose any punishment. One unfortunate part of all this for Ivanka Trump is she really has nothing to do with any of it. Story Continued Below From the piece: “People close to Ivanka Trump say there is no way for her to fully divest from her branded products business because she owns it all herself and would have to shut down her company in order to eliminate any perceptions of conflicts. And they say she cannot do that because of existing multi-year contracts with various retail outlets and other partners. “Defenders say that Ivanka Trump would never discuss anything related to her personal businesses with the various CEOs who attend White House meetings or private dinners with her. This includes Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon who attended a recent dinner. Wal-Mart carries Ivanka Trump products. Some on Wall Street have also speculated about potential conflicts given all the financial executives who attend meetings with the first daughter. The list of finance executives who have attended meetings with her include investment banker Adebayo Ogunlesi, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Critics say this could raise the possibility of financiers providing favorable credit terms to Ivanka Trump for her various business endeavors. But people close to Trump say she has no lenders to her businesses and no debt. “She doesn’t owe anyone anything,” one person close to Trump said. Read more. TRUMP SMACKED DOWN BY APPEALS COURT — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “A federal appeals court has turned down President Donald Trump’s attempt to revive his controversial travel ban executive order. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the Justice Department’s request to lift a Seattle-based judge’s restraining order that blocked authorities from carrying out the limits Trump sought to impose on travel to the U.S. by refugees and by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. “The White House could take the issue to the Supreme Court, but the prospects for such an appeal are uncertain due in part to the high court being short a justice and split evenly between Democratic and Republican appointed justices.” Read more. TRUMP RESPONSE — Via Twitter: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE.” ABA FILES SUIT OVER FED DIVIDENDS — ABA President Rob Nichols and Washington Federal CEO Roy Whitehead in a WSJ op-ed: “Legal action against the government is always a last resort, yet it’s one that we must turn to when alternatives are unavailable and matters of principle are at stake. “That’s the situation in which America’s bankers find themselves today. In 2016 the government wrongfully withheld $1.1 billion in contracted dividend payments to the industry, reducing the money that banks use to make job-creating loans and investments in our hometowns. That amount will balloon to $17 billion over the next 10 years for all affected banks” Read more. The lawsuit is here. RUH ROH — WP’s By Greg Miller, Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima: “National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said. “Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election” Read more. FSR IS MAKING A LIST, CHECKING IT TWICE — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida and Zachary Warmbrodt: “The Financial Services Roundtable on Friday morning released its wish list for 2017. At the top: changing the structure of the CFPB to a commission; repeal of the Durbin amendment, which limits the fees that financial institutions can impose on debit card transactions; and setting capital standards based on risk rather than simply size, FSR President Tim Pawlenty told POLITICO “The organization would also like to see a more coordinated approach to cybersecurity regulations across agencies, as well as progress toward the white whale known as reform of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Read their overall priorities here, on cybersecurity here, and on housing here. TOOMEY TO YELLEN: DROP STRESS TESTS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Sen. Pat Toomey told Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in a letter this week that the central bank should stop stress tests of the country’s biggest lenders. The Pennsylvania Republican said the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process was hampering lending, adding to compliance costs and increasing systemic dangers” See the letter.

Consumer Sentiment at 10:00 a.m. expected to dip to 97.9 from 98.5. PURDUE OPPOSES BAT — Sen. David Purdue (R-Ga.) in a Wash. Times op-ed: “[T]he fourth idea being crammed into this comprehensive proposal by the House is the so-called ‘border adjustment tax.’ This 20 percent tax on all imports is regressive, hammers consumers, shuts down economic growth, and is proven to grow the federal government. “Increased consumer prices would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs. This is exactly the wrong approach. Why would we do this at a time when millions of Americans are struggling to get from payday to payday?” Read more. ** A message from American Bankers Association: The Durbin Amendment, which imposed government price caps on debit card interchange rates, was supposed to help consumers. Instead, it poured $42 billion into big-box stores’ pockets and left customers empty-handed. Government price controls are a lose-lose for Americans. Let’s repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** CHINA-U.S. RELATIONS FROZEN — NYT’s Mark Landler and Michael Forsythe: “When the White House announced this week that President Trump had sent President Xi Jinping of China a letter wishing him a happy Chinese New Year, it did not disclose a major reason for the friendly gesture: Mr. Xi has not gotten on the phone with Mr. Trump. “Stung by Mr. Trump’s unorthodox telephone call with the president of Taiwan and his subsequent assertion that the United States might no longer abide by the ‘One China’ policy, Mr. Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected. Administration officials say they believe he will only do so after Mr. Trump publicly commits to recognizing a single Chinese government in Beijing.” Read more. FREEZE BROKEN — FT’s Demetri Sevastopulo: “Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping that the White House will respect the ‘One China’ policy, in a move that will ease tensions between the powers, according to two people familiar with the call. In his first conversation with the Chinese leader since entering the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he would abide by the diplomatic formula that Beijing and Taipei agreed in 1992.” Read more. MORE ON THE HENSARLING MEMO — Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg: “We believe this measure would offer relief to the banks, but do not see how it could pass the Senate. As a result, our view remains that banks will enjoy the most upside from the new regulatory focus that will exist once Trump installs his own people at the Federal Reserve, CFPB, FDIC and OCC. … “To us, the issue is not whether the House could pass such a bill. That seems to be a given. It is how to get such a measure through the Senate. Our view is that Democrats will not support such a material approach to changing the rules for bigger banks. And there is little probability they would support changes to the CFPB's authority. This is why we believe this bill is more about sending a message on how the GOP wants to change the law.” Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform: “This awful bill has always been a giveaway to Wall Street, and if anything it appears to be getting worse. It would hack away at crucial rules that prevent reckless banks from blowing up the financial system and the broader economy.” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), ranking member of Senate Banking: “It took less than three weeks for House Republicans to show their hand on how they will renege on candidate Trump’s campaign promises to hold Wall Street accountable and help working Americans.” ABE-TRUMP PREVIEW — Bloomberg’s Margaret Talev: “Trump’s accusations of currency manipulation against Japan aren’t a priority for him in talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe planned for Friday, an administration official said. “The automobile industry will be an important topic in the talks, the official said. The official declined to address specifics about it or how the president would approach discussions on import taxes.” Read more. KUSHNER FAMILY DEAL — NYT’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael J. De La Merced: “The Kushners, the New York real estate family whose scion is a close adviser to President Trump, are in negotiations to buy the Miami Marlins baseball team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. “The Kushners — led by Joshua Kushner, a venture capitalist, and Joseph Meyer, his brother-in-law and key lieutenant for the family’s investments — have pursued the Marlins for several months, devising a complicated financial arrangement that would include bringing in partners later, these people said. Mr. Kushner is the younger brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law.” Read more. CEA DEMOTED — WSJ’s Josh Zumbrun reports: “The White House Council of Economic Advisers is being demoted by the Trump administration, which said in a statement Wednesday that the president’s cabinet won't include the chairman of the CEA, an official that President Donald Trump also has yet to name. “The diminished stature for the CEA, which was part of President Barack Obama’s cabinet and has advised presidents for over seven decades on the economic impact of their policies, means Mr. Trump will likely rely more heavily on other advisers, such as Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is head of the National Economic Council, and Peter Navarro, the trade critic who is leading the National Trade Council.” Read more. NAMES FOR CFPB HEAD — CNBC’s Ylan Mui reports: “The White House is considering a top official at Fannie Mae to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to two people familiar with the discussion. “Brian Brooks is currently the mortgage financing giant's general counsel and has close ties to Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin. Brooks represented several of the investors in Mnuchin's purchase of failed subprime mortgage lender IndyMac for $1.6 billion in 2009. The bank was renamed OneWest, and Brooks joined the company as vice chairman.” Read more. #3 JOB IN DOJ — Bloomberg’s Tom Schoenberg reports: “The new U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, spent most of his Senate confirmation hearing answering questions about his civil rights record. The fate of remaining Justice Department probes of banks’ complicity in the financial crisis, though, may fall to a lawyer who spent much of the Obama administration representing the interests of banks and other corporations. “Trump last week nominated Rachel L. Brand, 43, a onetime senior counsel at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to become associate attorney general, the No. 3 job in the Justice Department. The position, which requires Senate confirmation, supervises the civil, antitrust and environmental divisions, among others, making it an important overseer of many of the department’s probes of corporations.” Read more. TWITTER’S NEW AD STRATEGY — WSJ’s Deepa Seetharaman and Ezequiel Minaya report: “President Donald Trump has made Twitter Inc. more visible than ever. Now, the company has to find a way to cash in. “Twitter said Thursday it would revamp its advertising strategy, shifting away from older products like promoted tweets in favor of video ads, which executives said tend to attract big brands like car makers. The social-media service also plans to grow its data-licensing business, which charges companies that mine the billions of tweets flowing through the service every day.” Read more. TRUMP’S WALL: $21.6B — Reuters’ reports: “President Donald Trump's "wall" along the U.S.-Mexico border would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion, and take more than three years to construct, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters on Thursday. “The report's estimated price-tag is much higher than a $12-billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.” Read more. PHYSICAL COMMODITIES RULE — POLITICO Pro’s Victoria Guida reports: “Three Senate Democrats today urged the Federal Reserve to toughen its proposed capital and disclosure requirements on banks that own and invest in physical commodities. “The rule, proposed in September, would particularly affect Goldman Sachs, which along with Morgan Stanley was grandfathered in to being able to extract, transport and store physical commodities, which other banks cannot do.” Read more. DEUTSCHE BANK CONFLICT OF INTEREST — ProPublica’s Jesse Eisinger reports: “If you measure President Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest by the amount of money at stake, or the variety of dicey interactions with government regulators, one dwarfs any other: his relationship with Deutsche Bank. “In recent weeks, Deutsche Bank has scrambled to reach agreements with American regulators over a host of alleged misdeeds. But because the president has not sold his company, the bank remains a central arena for potential conflicts between his family’s business interests and the actions of officials in his administration.” Read more. ** A message from American Bankers Association: When the Durbin Amendment was passed in 2010, retailers pledged that consumers would see the savings. Years later, the truth is out: big box stores have pocketed an extra $42 billion—and, according to a Federal Reserve study, just 1 percent of retailers are passing savings onto customers. Even worse, many consumers lost access to free checking and debit card rewards. Enough with broken promises and consumer harm. It’s time to end this lose-lose for consumers and repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben Mary Lee mlee@politico.com About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

Yet it popped up in a recent screen for companies poised to benefit from sweeping corporate tax changes proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives. (And Regeneron shares popped Thursday.) On the other hand, Deere (DE) is up 22% over that stretch, yet it screens as a company that could get pinched by the new tax plan. It’s early to speculate on precisely how corporate taxes will change. But Donald Trump is reportedly warming to a House plan...

She said there was suspicious circumstances pertaining to the area in Cleveland in which she picked him up and left him and she felt very uneasy. The bag was found to contain men's underwear, two cell phones and an unloaded BB gun. Lyft requested a police report be filed. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 39, was charged with the theft of lighters, cell phones and memory cards at Walmart Jan. 31. He concealed some items in his pants and removed other items from their packaging and concealed them in different locations in the store. He had previously been issued trespass warnings from other Walmart stores in the area. Property damage, Mayfield Road: A woman reported at 2:40 a.m. Feb. 1 someone slashed a tire on her vehicle while it was parked at Spoto's Bar & Grill. There were no suspects identified. Open container in a public place, Warrensville Center Road: An East Cleveland man, 45, was cited Feb. 1 for having an open container of beer in his vehicle after an officer found him parked in the Walmart parking lot with loud music playing. He said he was waiting for his mother, who was inside the store shopping. Receiving stolen property, Ellison Road: Officers stopped a vehicle after observing it speeding and driving erratically around 1 a.m. Jan. 28. The driver was issued multiple traffic citations and found to be driving under suspension. The vehicle's license plate was registered to another vehicle and it was later learned the owner lived in the same Willoughby Hills apartment complex as the driver.

Burglary, Burger Road: A woman reported at 1:26 p.m. Feb. 2 a man had just ran out of her daughter's home with a laptop computer and left in a pickup truck that was being driven by someone else. She witnessed the incident when she arrived at the home to drop off groceries. She said her daughter does not always lock the door. It was later determined two laptop computers and a video game system had been stolen. The suspects were not located. Disorderly conduct, Warrensville Center Road: Officers responded to Walmart Jan. 19 for a report of two men arguing for unknown reasons. One of them had left, but the other continued to yell, curse and use racial slurs in the presence of children and others in the store. The Cleveland man, 26, was subsequently cited for disorderly conduct and obstructing official business. Burglary, Wilmington Road: A woman reported at 3:30 p.m. Jan. 24 two men tried to force their way into her home while she was there working. She said they ran off and left in a pickup truck when she yelled for them to get away from the door. She believed one of them was prying on the door with a crowbar. The suspects were not located. Theft, Cedar Road: A Shell employee said Jan. 26 a man drank a Red Bull drink without paying for it and was not entering the Speedway store across the street. Officers located him at that store and he appeared to be drunk. A Taser had to be deployed because he would not comply. He then began to claim he was God and of his current royalty status. The South Euclid man, 45, was taken to the hospital for an evaluation. He was charged with theft and obstructing official business. See more South Euclid news at Cleveland.com/south-euclid.

  You are here: Home > Opinion > Editor's Pick Made in USA is hypocritical political correctness By Chen Weihua 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China Daily, February 10, 2017 Adjust font size: US President Donald Trump won the 2016 election partly by cashing in on people's anger over excessive political correctness. Yet his words and deeds are cultivating a new political correctness in his country. It is about keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States and bringing them back from overseas, as he said in his inaugural address that his rules are "buy American and hire American." Walmart, the largest US company, has been running a TV ad about its commitment to purchasing $250 billion in the US and create 1 million jobs at home. It is nothing new for US businesses to promote themselves by tapping into the public's patriotism, but more of the mare under pressure now to do so after Trump threatened to punish those outsourcing their jobs abroad. Under such pressure, Carrier decided in late November to keep several hundreds of jobs in its Indiana plant instead of moving them to Mexico as previously planned. Last month, Ford Motors cancelled its $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and said it would instead invest $700 million in an existing plant in Michigan to make electric and autonomous cars. Trump also warned General Motors last month by tweeting "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" He has pressured Apple CEO Tim Cook to make iPhones in the US, instead of China, where the devices are assembled by a massive army of Chinese workers. Such a bid to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US may sound great to some voters. But it is against the free market principle, does not make any economic sense and won't help US consumers. The Walmart commercial features a factory scene where workers are hammering and welding, with sparks flying like fireworks. It does not look remotely like a factory with state-of-the-art facility or high automation, which should be the case for an advanced economy. Walmart's campaign has already been called into question when some products with "Made in America" labels are accused of not meeting the government criteria, as many parts are made abroad. In a globalized world, it is increasingly hard to find a product, especially a high-tech one, that is made totally by one country. Apple's iPhones are assembled in China but really designed in California. Its parts come from more than 700 suppliers from all over the world, and the assembly cost is less than $10, not big value. US consumers, however, will have to pay $30-40 more if they want an iPhone assembled in the US and $100 more if more of the components are made in the US. The Made-in-the-USA mania now seen in the US is not only against the basic economic law of comparative advantage, it is also going to hurt the most vulnerable US consumers and turn the US into a "Third World" economy. In fact, the factory scene depicted in the Walmart ad is probably hard to find now in China's developed coastal region. Those factories have long been relocated to the low-cost hinterland of West China or else to other countries which have lower labor costs. As a shrewd businessman, Trump should know all this well. The United Kingdom's Daily Mirror reported last week that Trump International Hotel, opened in Washington last October, contains rooms where almost everything in them was made outside the US. It is sad to see such hypocritical political correctness of Made in USA permeating the world's most advanced nation in the 21st century. The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in weather Police: Brockton kidnapper raped the victim, is a Level 3 sex offender previously deemed too dangerous to release Thursday Feb 9, 2017 at 3:26 PM Feb 10, 2017 at 7:55 AM Rebecca Hyman rhyman@tauntongazette.com RAYNHAM - The woman who was kidnapped in Brockton Wednesday morning was raped and burned with a lit cigarette and a cigarette lighter while held captive before being dumped partially clothed in the parking lot of a Raynham Walmart, Raynham Police Chief James Donovan said. The suspect, Nathaniel Simmons, 49, of Brockton, is a registered Level 3 sex offender ruled too dangerous to go free in 2008 after being convicted of raping three women in the 1990s, according to a Taunton Daily Gazette story from May 2008. The judge who made the ruling in 2008 said: “He demeaned victims, three of whom had been his friends. He punched them, threatened them, wielded a knife, used a knife and pushed them. He admits to getting a thrill from his control over these victims.” Raynham police had initially charged Simmons with kidnapping, assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, failure to stop for police and negligent driving Wednesday. But based on the evidence of rape and additional offenses obtained during the investigation, Raynham police amended the charges against Simmons, Donovan said Thursday afternoon. Simmons is now scheduled to be arraigned in Taunton District Court on Friday, Feb. 10 on charges of kidnapping, aggravated rape, four counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a car window twice, a cigarette lighter and a lit cigarette); three counts of assault and battery for allegedly biting, slapping and spitting on the victim; and several motor vehicle offenses including failure to stop for police. The victim was found partially clothed in the parking lot of Walmart on Route 138 in Raynham by strangers who came to her aid at approximately 3 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, Donovan said. The victim told police she did not know the suspect and he had abducted her earlier in the day in Brockton. In the Walmart parking lot the victim yelled for help and when witnesses intervened the suspect fled in a gray Ford Taurus, according to a statement issued by Raynham police Wednesday night. The victim was taken by ambulance to a hospital for medical care. She did not have any life-threatening injuries, Donovan said. Responding officers spotted the Ford Taurus on King Philip Street and attempted to stop it, Donovan said. Instead, the suspect refused to stop and sped up attempting to elude the officers, he said. As the Taurus approached the intersection of King Philip and South Main streets it rear-ended a green Jeep Cherokee waiting to take a left turn onto South Main. The Jeep in turn hit a gray Subaru Outback. The suspect was arrested at the crash scene at approximately 3:15 p.m. Wednesday. No one involved in the three-vehicle crash was transported to a hospital, according to fire personnel on scene. Police found several items of the victim’s clothing and a machete that the suspect had apparently thrown from the car while fleeing down King Philip Street, according to the police statement. After being released from prison after serving a sentence for a 1994 rape conviction, Simmons was charged with raping two other women at knife-point in 1998. He was still on probation when he committed those offenses. Simmons was eventually convicted of both subsequent rapes and was sentenced to serve eight to 10 years in prison. Prior to his scheduled release in 2007, then-Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter’s office filed a “sexually dangerous person petition” to keep him locked up. The petition is a civil action requesting a court order a convicted sex offender detained if the prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt he is a high risk to re-offend. District Attorney’s office spokesperson Gregg Miliote said at the time the petitions are filed in a small percentage of sexual assault cases. Bristol County Superior Court Judge John P. Connor said in his May 22, 2008 decision ordering Simmons held: “The defendant has made an attempt to draft a prevention relapse plan, but has not had it reviewed and critiqued by his peers. The examiners conclude that the defendant has not progressed to the point of being able to control his deviant sexual urges.” Following the court's ruling, Simmons was to remain detained at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in Bridgewater for a period of one year to life. Each year, he would have had an opportunity to file a petition to the court claiming he was no longer a risk to re-offend. It was not known as of deadline Thursday when Simmons was released. He is listed with the state Sex Offender Registry Board as living at 347 Summer St., Brockton, and working at 225 John Hancock Road in the Myles Standish Industrial Park in Taunton.

The US giant could re-brand Wal-Mart products sold at bargain ­prices in the States as Asda for the UK market. PA:Press Association 5 Asda’s owner Walmart has hinted it will make its UK prices even lower than bud­g­et rivals That would hugely ramp up the competition that’s brought low prices in recent years. Wal-Mart, known for its competitiveness on price, admitted yesterday it has responded slowly to German budget chains in the UK. Chief administration boss Scott Price has now raised the stakes, saying it will use its bargaining power to “inv­est more aggressively in price”. 5 He said Asda would be able to sell at UK prices “that no one else can match”. The US giant has traditionally let Asda, which it bought in 1999, make its own way. But Sean Clarke, Asda’s chief exec since last July, used to work for Wal-Mart in Asia and knows it well.

Saturday, February 11, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Wal-Mart aims to leverage British arm Asda back to health February 10, 2017, Friday LONDON: Wal-Mart is throwing its weight as the world’s largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda thrived for a decade as Britain’s cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Wal-Mart in 1999 and remains the third-biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi and Lidl have steadily cut into Asda’s market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more British shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda’s president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Wal-Mart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent’s purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. “One thing that maybe we would criticise ourselves for is that we didn’t start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn’t focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price,” Price told Reuters in an interview. “What Sean is able to do with his global experience at Wal-Mart is to know what levers to pull,” he said, in a reference to Clarke’s time with Wal-Mart in Japan, Canada and most recently as chief executive in China. Working more closely with its parent, Asda will be able to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals, Price said. “He’s able to pull private (Wal-Mart) brands and put an Asda brand on it that is equal to the national brand in the UK in terms of quality and sensory, but at a price that no one else can match,” he said of Clarke. In return, Wal-Mart was looking for more ways to exploit the areas where Asda has excelled, for example with a popular olive oil originally sourced by Asda and now sold across the group, including in the United States and 10 other international markets. From its headquarters in Leeds in northern England, Asda claimed to be the first of Britain’s major grocers – which also includes market leader Tesco, No. 2 Sainsbury’s and No. 4 Morrisons – to spot the threat from the discounters. With fewer stores in the more affluent southeast of England than its rivals and the vast majority of its business in the large stores that have become less fashionable in recent years, Asda was most exposed. After it lost its price advantage and failed to offer other reasons to shop there, performance slumped. Wal-Mart added to Asda’s problems by diverting key executives from Britain to the United States and focusing too much on cutting costs and maximising short-term profit at the expense of investing to protect market share, analysts said. The result has been nine straight quarters of underlying sales decline since the middle of 2014, which translated into a more than 1 per centage point loss in market share, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 per cent, versus more than 28 per cent for Tesco. David Cheesewright, CEO of Walmart International, in June expressed disappointment at Asda’s weak performance and said it would shift from protecting profit to protecting market share. The data shows signs of improving. In November Asda reported a like-for-like sales decline of 5.8 per cent for the third quarter to Sept 30, compared to the second quarter when it reported a fall of 7.5 per cent, its worst drop in quarterly sales. A further material improvement is expected when it reports fourth quarter sales on Feb. 21, with analysts forecasting a decline of 2-3 per cent. Monthly industry data has also shown a better performance over Christmas and January. While sales fell 1.9 per cent year-on-year by value in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, according to Kantar, Asda increased the number of shoppers visiting its stores. The improvements reflect the early work of Clarke and former Sainsbury’s executive Roger Burnley, who joined as chief operating officer in October, analysts said. That includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat –key ranges that either drive customers into stores or, if you get them wrong, out. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said there are also signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with, for example, new items in the frozen and chilled areas and in its ‘Extra Special’ premium brand. At the same time Asda has developed complementary services and partners within its stores, such as with sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee’s, while more freedom is being given to individual managers when it comes to the layout of their stores. It looks likely to be a long road to recovery, however. “Things are going a bit better but they’re going a bit better from a catastrophic level of performance,” one senior UK retail industry executive told Reuters, asking not to be named. “Everybody thinks you can turn around a business in a year or two and you can’t. This is a five-year project,” he said. He questioned whether Wal-Mart would provide the necessary investment. “Their instinct is to save their way to victory.” Price said Wal-Mart was committed to Asda and has tasked Clarke with building a sustainable business model. While Asda has said it will cut prices equating to 1.5 billion pounds of savings to the customer over five years from November 2013, washing through at about 300 million pounds a year, Price declined to say what additional investment was required in the stores. “We are making very solid progress, (but) there’s no timeline (for recovery),” he said. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

It’s her daughter’s birthday. But every year, two weeks earlier, she now marks another anniversary: the day that same daughter disappeared. Kelsie Schelling was 21 years old and eight weeks pregnant when she vanished on Feb. 4, 2013. She had her first doctor’s visit and had seen a sonogram of her baby earlier that day. After the trip to the doctor and a shift at work, the Denver woman drove two hours south to Pueblo to visit her boyfriend and the father of her child, Donthe Lucas. But exactly what happened once Schelling got to Pueblo remains a mystery. She hasn’t been seen since. Watch Liz Gelardi and James Dougherty's video version of this story in the player below or by clicking here. What happened to Kelsie? “Her phone was going straight to voicemail,” Saxton says. On Feb. 7, Pueblo police found Schelling’s car, a black 2011 Chevy Cruze, at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in southern Pueblo. They pored over surveillance tape and found an unidentified black man had pulled up and parked it, then walked away. Police started looking over surveillance footage from other businesses and discovered that Lucas had parked the car at a Walmart three miles west of the hospital on Feb. 5, the day after Schelling was last seen. She wasn’t with him in the video. Donthe Lucas was Schelling's boyfriend and eventually became a person of interest in her disappearance. (Photo by James Dougherty, Denver7 Photographer) Then, police watched as video from Feb. 6 showed the unidentified man get in the car and drive off. He dropped the car at St. Mary-Corwin the next day and still hasn’t been identified. But the location of the car proved noteworthy later, when Lucas told investigators he had at one point dropped Schelling off at Parkview Medical Center – almost 4.5 miles north of St. Mary-Corwin. Parkview confirmed Schelling was never there. A lawsuit filed by Saxton and Schelling’s father in 2015 against Lucas, his family members and various members of the Pueblo Police Department that contains bits of the police investigation and unveils some of the details about the time leading up to Schelling’s disappearance. It contains records of text messages Schelling and Lucas exchanged in the days leading up to her disappearance. Since the two agencies now handling the case consider it to be an open investigation, the details are not public record and were not released to Denver7. The lawsuit has since been dropped, but is one of the only public documents that detail police records in the case. The ultrasound that Kelsie got before driving to Pueblo, where she disappeared. (Photo courtesy Laura Saxton.) According to the messages, Lucas had wanted Schelling to come down to visit him a day earlier, but she told him she had to make her Feb. 4 doctor’s visit. Eventually the next day, she agreed to come to visit him after she got off work. She arrived at the same Walmart where Lucas was eventually seen with her car just before midnight Feb. 4, but Lucas wasn’t there. The two exchanged messages, and around 12:30 a.m., Schelling sent Lucas another message wondering why he still hadn’t shown up, according to the suit. It was the last time anyone knew she was alive. At some point, Schelling left the Walmart and went to another address. Phone records show Lucas called her phone again just before 4 a.m. on Feb. 5 and that the two phones were close to one another at the time, according to the suit. At 11:39 a.m., Lucas was seen at a Pueblo bank, where he allegedly withdrew $400 with Schelling’s debit card. Not long afterward, the Walmart surveillance video showed him dropping Schelling’s car off and being picked up. Saxton’s lawsuit says Lucas’ mother and grandmother were in that car. Charges dropped against boyfriend; family gets scammed Pueblo police eventually identified Lucas as a primary person of interest in Schelling’s disappearance and arrested him on felony identity theft and misdemeanor theft charges for allegedly using her debit card to make the withdrawal. But the charges were dropped and no one else was arrested in connection with Schelling’s disappearance. “It was pretty much a debacle from the beginning,” Saxton says. She continues to have reservations about the work Pueblo detectives did on the case and maintains that she believes Lucas had something to do with her daughter vanishing. A photo of Schelling from before she disappeared. (Photo courtesy Laura Saxton.) The 2015 suit accuses the department of failing to properly process her car, not submitting evidence and lying to Saxton and her family about possible evidence found in and on the car. It also claimed that the lead detective on the case failed to follow up on a tip from a fisherman who said he had hooked a woman’s body in Lake Minnequa, which sits in between the Walmart and the hospital where Schelling’s car was found. But in October 2015, Saxton got a glimmer of hope when, through the Facebook page she started to find her daughter, a message arrived from someone saying Schelling was alive. The mysterious messenger knew explicit details of the case and said Schilling wasn’t killed, but instead was human trafficked. The messenger told Saxton to bring $25,000 to a McDonald’s in Vancouver, Washington, and she’d get her daughter back. She contacted local police to loop them in on the deal in case it was a set up. But before it could even take place, Vancouver police found out she was being scammed. Saxton was back to square one, her daughter still a ghost. New investigators, increased reward bring hope In Saxton’s mind, Lucas’ story just doesn’t add up – despite the fact that no formal charges relating to Schelling’s disappearance were ever filed against him. Pueblo police say he remains a person of interest because he was the last person known to see her alive. Requests to speak with Lucas for this story went unreturned. Lucas was arrested on charges relating to him allegedly using Schelling's debit card, but the charges were eventually dropped. (Photo courtesy ABC News.) “I have no doubt that Danthe – her boyfriend, the father of her child – is responsible for her disappearance,” she said. “I can’t sleep at night. I hope he can’t either.” But she says she has hope that new leads will soon come in the case. The Pueblo Police Department has assigned a new lead detective to the case and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation joined on to assist last spring – a welcome sign, according to her, since she says the department had been reluctant to turn the entire case over to the bureau. Pueblo police did not directly address the early days of the investigation when asked, but the department says it is hopeful that after four years, someone might be willing to break their silence about the case. “I think Kelsie’s case is very solvable. I think it should’ve been solved a long time before now, and we’re not giving up…there will be a resolution to this,” Saxton says. She says she hopes the added help from CBI, which is involved with a task force devoted to missing persons cases and cold cases in the state, will help turn up new evidence. “We’re hopeful that somebody is going to see this and just say it’s time, the suffering needs to end,” Saxton says. “We’re just praying really hard about that – that someone will come forward with some piece of information that will lead us to where she is.” The family doubled the reward for information on the whereabouts of Schelling or her remains to $100,000 for the month of February in the hopes of getting more leads. CBI Director Michael Rankin says his when his team is brought in they re-examine and scrutinize the evidence and details collected in the case so far. Laura Saxton stands in front of the state Capitol in Denver on Colorado Missing Persons Day. (Photo by James Dougherty, Denver7 Photographer) “I think that the starting point [is] let’s take a look at, first of all, what happened? What do we know? What’s been done to further that investigation, and then, where can the CBI plug in to further advance the investigation and hopefully the prosecution as well,” Rankin said. He showed up to a Colorado Missing Persons Day Event organized by Saxton at the state Capitol in Denver on Feb. 3 to reinforce the agency’s support for families with missing loved ones. Dozens of families of missing people in the state and of cold case murder victims’ flanked him as he thanked her personally. And the next day, on the anniversary of Schelling’s death, Saxton and other family members revisited the Walmart in Pueblo where the pregnant 21-year-old was last known to have been, releasing purple balloons in her memory and in the hopes her case will someday be solved. “To lose somebody and to not know what happened to them, to not be able to have answers, to bury them, to honor them…your mind constantly runs,” Saxton says. “I hope she’s found. I pray to God she’s found.” Schelling would have celebrated her 26th birthday on Feb. 18. --- Anyone who may have information regarding Kelsie Schelling’s disappearance is asked to contact the Pueblo Police Department at 719-553-2538 or Colorado Bureau of Investigation at 303-239-4300. Saxton has also created a website dedicated to helping find her daughter. The Family of Homicide Victims and Missing Persons is also a resource for families of murdered and missing persons and does extensive work in Colorado. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Feb 9, 2017 at 4:16PM Can Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) save the craft-beer industry? Few are aware that the deep-discount retailer has been selling its own craft beer for almost a year now, but as more people discover it, there's the potential for it to revive industry sales. No laughing matter Before you laugh, there might be some very good reasons this could happen. After years of double-digit growth, craft breweries are expected to post just single-digit gains for 2016. Even though there are more than 5,000 U.S. craft breweries in existence today, more than at any other time in the country's past, the Brewers Association industry trade group estimates that volumes grew only around 8% last year. Others think it could be even lower. Image source: Wal-Mart. The market analysts at IRI, for example, say its channel checks indicate fourth-quarter volumes rose only 3% from the year-ago period, leaving full-year volumes up just 5%.  Much of the weakness is due to reports of soft sales from the largest names in the industry. Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM), which many consider to still be the face of craft beer, suffered an 8% drop in depletions in the third quarter and expects them to fall by as much as 6% for the full year, compared with previous guidance that saw them as possibly being flat. (Depletions are shipments to distributors and retailers and are considered a reliable industry proxy for consumer demand.) Similarly, Craft Brew Alliance, New Belgium Brewing, and even Anheuser-Busch InBev's Shock Top brand are all suffering from slack sales. While a few of these might not fit the industry definition of what constitutes a craft brewer, beer drinkers still view their beer as craft. That showing would coincide with IRI's data showing that brewers such as Boston Beer and Pabst were down sharply in the last three months of 2016, with Craft Brew Alliance, New Belgium, and Gambrinus down by low- to mid-single-digit rates. It's not all bad news, as brewers such as Lagunitas and Dogfish Head, among others, were up by double-digit percentages. Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) also surged, and though much of that increase might be attributable to its imported Corona brands, it also has its Ballast Point craft brand to thank, as it's been living up to its reputation as the fastest-growing craft beer. Wal-Mart to the rescue? So how is Wal-Mart going to save the industry? First, the retailer isn't actually brewing beer on its own in Bentonville, Ark., but rather contracts with WX Brands, which describes itself as developing "exclusive brands of wine, beer, and spirits for retailers around the world." It packages Wal-Mart's craft beers under the Trouble Brewing brand and offers a number of beer labels such as Cat's Away IPA, After Party Pale Ale, and California-only Pacific Drift. A 12-pack of a Wal-Mart craft brew sells for around $13. Image source: Wal-Mart. While you might not find many hipsters shopping Wal-Mart's craft-beer aisle looking to pick up some 'Round Midnight Belgian White, with more than 4,600 stores nationwide it remains the most heavily trafficked grocery store in the country, and stocking its shelves with "craft beer" has the potential to introduce more people to craft labels than just about any other outlet. The mass merchandiser might not break any sales records or have Boston Beer worrying it will be stealing market share from it, but as the supermarket giant told The Street last year, "We want to bring craft beer to the masses." Although there's a level of snobbery in the craft-beer market that would exclude a Wal-Mart beer from being considered truly craft, the retailer has a unique ability to put craft beer front and center for the American consumer in a way no one else is able to. Beer drinkers who might normally not consider anything other than some mass-produced suds might now join the traditional craft-beer crowd that's constantly on the prowl for new flavors and tastes. And anything that introduces more people to craft beer can't be all bad. Even if what they're drinking is a Wal-Mart Red Flag Amber, it's a development that might very well reverse the craft-beer industry's sinking fortunes.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 9, 2017 at 1:00PM February will be a busy month for investors. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report this week, looking to extend its streak of impressive earnings beats. Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports next week, aiming to convince investors that its transition to a softwarecentric company will eventually return it to growth. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) will report in two weeks, in the midst of a major shift in its e-commerce strategy . Sky-high expectations Graphics chip company NVIDIA destroyed analyst estimates throughout 2016, with its latest quarterly report in November beating expectations by a wide margin. Its gaming business is booming, driven by strong demand for its Pascal graphics cards and the soon-to-launch Nintendo Switch game console. The data center and automotive businesses, both much smaller than gaming, are growing at an even faster rate. Image source: NVIDIA. When its fourth-quarter results are revealed after the market close on Thursday, Feb. 9., all eyes will be on whether NVIDIA can keep up its incredible growth rate. Its stock more than tripled in 2016 as revenue and profit expanded rapidly, but with AMD set to launch competing high-end graphics cards in the next few months, NVIDIA's significant market share may take a hit. NVIDIA's early focus on pushing its graphics chips as machine learning accelerators has paid off in a big way. The data center segment, which includes NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs aimed the data center and high-performance computing , nearly tripled year over year during the third quarter. That kind of growth rate can't go on forever, but it's clear that NVIDIA has struck gold. With the stock now trading for around 60 times trailing-12-month earnings, the company will need to continue to impress investors in order to keep the stock price afloat. Any disappointing numbers could send this highflier tumbling. A tough quarter Cisco Systems, the dominant provider of networking hardware, doesn't expect a remarkable fiscal second quarter. The company sees its revenue declining by 2% to 4% year over year even after excluding divestitures, a slowdown that reflects both uncertainty among its major customers and its ongoing shift to a recurring revenue business model. Image source: Cisco Systems. Cisco's core switching and routing businesses were inconsistent throughout 2016, with growth in some quarters and declines in others. This was counteracted by solid growth in its smaller businesses, including collaboration, data center, and security. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, though, both the data center and collaboration segments suffered 3% year-over-year revenue declines. Security posted a double-digit increase, but the results raise questions about Cisco's growth strategy. Its fiscal second-quarter results are expected after the market close on Feb. 15. Analysts aren't expecting much, with the average estimate calling for a 3.2% decrease in revenue and a slight dip in adjusted earnings per share. Cisco recently announced a major acquisition, agreeing to pay $3.7 billion for software company AppDynamics, a move that should help accelerate its shift toward software. But Cisco remains dependent on hardware, and weakness in its core businesses will continue to hurt its results. Two-day shipping for everyone After testing a subscription shipping program similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart has scrapped that effort, instead shifting to free two-day shipping on millions of items for orders over $35. This is far more generous than Amazon's non-Prime free shipping offer, which has a minimum order of $50 and shipping times that vary. Image source: Wal-Mart.http://corporate.walmart.com/galleries/e-commerce Wal-Mart has been accelerating its push into e-commerce, paying $3 billion for start-up Jet.com last year and putting Jet's CEO in charge of its entire e-commerce business. The company's online grocery service, which allows customers to place orders online and pick up for free at hundreds of Wal-Mart locations, is another facet of the e-commerce strategy, one that can't be duplicated by online-only retailers. Wal-Mart will report its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on Feb. 21. The retailer's e-commerce business has been accelerating in recent quarters, a sign that the company's initiatives are having a positive effect. Wal-Mart's stores are still the core of the business, and they enable initiatives like online grocery pickup. But Wal-Mart will need to greatly expand its e-commerce business to avoid being left in the dust. Timothy Green owns shares of Cisco Systems.

Scott Markley, a spokesman for the big-box retailer, said the deal is part of Walmart's January 2013 U.S. Manufacturing Commitment to buy an additional $250 billion in U.S. products to support American jobs over 10 years. Renfro Corporation, a long time producer of socks and hosiery products for Walmart, is based in North Carolina but has had a manufacturing facility in Fort Payne since the late 1980s. "The products that Renfro supplies to Walmart that are made in its U.S. factories include Athletic Works, Fruit of the Loom Work Gear and Dr. Scholl's healthcare products," Renfro CEO and President Bud Kilby told AL.com. "Both Walmart and Renfro share in the commitment for products made in the USA and this new arrangement was a result of that common interest." Kilby said Renfro began selling socks to Walmart in the late 1970s. As Walmart has grown over the years, so has Renfro, which now has 5,000 employees worldwide and 628 in east Alabama. Renfro has already begun filling the new manufacturing positions in Fort Payne and will continue to do so through 2018 as the company's capacity increases and Walmart's product offering evolves. "Our expanded program at Walmart represents meaningful growth in our business," Kilby said. "We expect the offering to continue to expand at Walmart, resulting in continued job growth at our U.S. factories." Walmart expects to help create 1 million jobs by purchasing American-made, grown, assembled and sourced products through 2023. In addition to Renfro, the chain is working with California Innovations to move production of the Ozark Trail "super cooler" out of China to a factory in Atlanta, creating 350 jobs. Edgewell Personal Care, which makes personal hygiene products, is also working with Walmart to create 272 jobs by bringing production from Canada to Delaware. "We're making a tangible impact on communities across America," Markley said. "In the three years since we launched our initiative, we've seen factories opened, jobs created and American products added to our shelves in stores and online." Renfro is a global business, but has manufactured products in its own U.S. factories continuously since 1921. The company has other plants in Mount Airy, N.C.; Los Angeles; Cleveland, Tenn.; and Clinton, S.C. Kilby said there are advantages to manufacturing in the U.S., such as lower energy costs, reliable labor and infrastructure, and closer proximity to the consumer market. "We want to offer good jobs to people here in the U.S.," he said. "This builds stronger communities and serves all of our interests."

Walmart says it will begin to source materials from American-based companies like Renfro Corporation in an effort to invest in U.S. manufacturing. Renfro Corporation believes the investments will create around 442 jobs in textile manufacturing, namely by providing Walmart with athletic socks. Renfro Corp. currently has 605 employees and is the largest employer in Fort Payne’s hosiery industry, according to the DeKalb County Economic Development Authority.  These new jobs will push the company over the 1,000 mark. Additionally, Walmart will partner with six universities across the country to help advance sustainability in the production of textiles. Across the country, Walmart said it plans to create up to 34,000 jobs and spend $6.8 billion in capital investments. The investments will go towards construction and remodeling stores, as well as expansion of new services such as its new Online Grocery Pickup. The company’s announcement also follows a commitment made in 2013 to purchase an additional $250 billion in American-made, sourced, and assembled products through 2023. Walmart believes the commitment will produce around one million jobs. 34.444255 -85.719689 Filed in: Northeast Alabama Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Meet the newest Duggar baby UPDATE: Jackson County deputy shoots, kills teen after 2 taser attempts UPDATE: Triple homicide suspect Boyette dead, Rice in custody in Georgia Latest News Bo Jackson to lead annual charity bike ride April 29 Super Bowl Champion surprises his mother with 1,000 flowers March of Dimes walk Marshall Co.

Timothy Green, Todd Campbell, and Brian Feroldi (TMFBargainBin) Feb 9, 2017 at 8:40AM When a company manages to raise its dividend every year for decades, investors should take notice. A quarter-century of annual dividend hikes earns the title of Dividend Aristocrat, an exclusive club of a just few dozen companies. Out of those companies, three of our Fool contributors think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), and Nucor (NYSE:NUE) are the best buys. Here's why. All-in on e-commerce Tim Green (Wal-Mart): Retail behemoth Wal-Mart has increased its dividend every year since first declaring one in 1974. Dividend growth has been slow in recent years, with the current quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share representing just a 2% increase. But Wal-Mart is going through an important transition as it aggressively goes after the e-commerce market. These investments, along with higher wages and better training for its employees, are knocking down the company's profits. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart can no longer ignore the threat of Amazon.com and other online retailers. The company made a big move to acquire startup Jet.com last year, installing Jet CEO Marc Lore as the head of its entire e-commerce business. After toying with an Amazon Prime-like subscription service, Wal-Mart is now offering free two-day shipping on millions of items for orders above $35. Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy is simple: Offer the best prices and fast, free shipping with no strings attached. Analysts expect Wal-Mart to produce $4.33 in earnings per share both in 2016 and 2017, down considerably from a few years ago, reflecting the headwinds created by the company's investments. The payout ratio based on these estimates is about 46%, leaving Wal-Mart some room to continue raising the dividend even if earnings continue to languish. With a dividend yield of 3% and a management team that's thinking long-term, Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat worth considering. The medical device king Brian Feroldi (Medtronic): The world's population is aging, which is a terrific tailwind for the healthcare industry in general. As a leading provider of medical devices, Medtronic is a healthcare giant that looks well positioned to benefit from the trend. Medtronic has grown into a behemoth thanks to its long history of expanding its treatments to address an ever-increasing range of diseases. While the company is likely best known for its pacemakers, Medtronic also sells devices that treat diabetes, treat neurovascular disease, assist with pain management, and more. This diversification makes Medtronic far more than just a one-trick pony. Beyond product diversification, Medtronic has also made a lot of progress at getting its products into the hands of providers around the globe. Roughly 44% of the company's revenue comes from international markets, which adds yet another layer of diversification to its business. When combined, these two factors have helped to ensure that the company's top and bottom lines move forward each and every year. That's one reason it has been able to increase its dividend for 39 consecutive years. Looking ahead, I think that the company's current product lineup and its recently announced partnerships with Fitbit and Mazor Robotics provide investors with plenty of reasons to expect more of the same. That makes Medtronic a great Dividend Aristocrat to consider adding to your portfolio today.  Betting on economic growth Todd Campbell (Nucor): Nucor's shares are currently yielding 2.63%, management has increased the dividend every year for 44 straight years, and the stock is the biggest weighting in the Pro Shares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF, but President Donald Trump is the real reason investors ought to stash this stock in their portfolios. Trump won the fight for the U.S. presidency on his plans to reinvigorate the economy, and if his plans succeed, then U.S. steel demand could jump. On the campaign trail, Trump advocated for billions in new spending on projects that could benefit Nucor, the nation's biggest steel producer. Nucor's products are used to construct highways, bridges, utilities, airports, and high-rise buildings, and that diversification makes this company a solid pick for investors trying to get exposure to GDP growth. If tariffs mean fewer steel imports, and demand for U.S. steel grows, then rising revenue could give management plenty of financial flexibility to increase dividends in the future. As fellow Fool Dan Caplinger recently pointed out, Nucor sold 5.82 million tons of steel in Q4, up 14% year over year, and Nucor's revenue rose 14% to $3.96 billion. Clearly, this company's already got momentum heading into this year, and if that momentum builds because of Trump, then this stock is worth owning in dividend portfolios.

News Business Business News GlaxoSmithKline, Asda, IBM: Business news in brief, Thursday 9 February Brexit boost for pharmaceuticals giant; Walmart aims to battle Aldi and Lidl; Tech company to train 25 million Africans for free Thursday 9 February 2017 09:29 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online WalMart boss admits it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets iStock GlaxoSmithKline reveals earnings boost from Brexit-hit pound GlaxoSmithKline has revealed a boost to annual earnings from the Brexit-hit pound but warned over a potential hit from looming competition to its blockbuster asthma drug. The FTSE 100 drugs giant, which makes a significant amount of its earnings overseas, posted a 36 per cent surge in underlying operating profits to £7.8bn for 2016 thanks to the pound’s plunge since the EU referendum. It said it hopes to make “continued progress” in 2017 but cautioned over “uncertainty” if US regulators allow generic competitors to its asthma drug Advair. The group said if generic competition to Advair launched in the US in the summer, it could wipe out earnings growth and even leave earnings per share lower. Outgoing chief executive Sir Andrew Witty said: “Clearly, this year we face some uncertainty as to the level of our earnings performance, given the possibility of substitutable generic competition to Advair in the US.” But the group is hoping its new asthma medicines will help offset the sales blow. Presenting his last set of results, Sir Andrew unveiled a 17 per cent surge in annual revenues to £27.8bn and a 21 per cent leap in the fourth quarter. With the benefit of the weak pound on overseas earnings stripped out, full-year revenues were 6 per cent higher, while operating profits lifted 14 per cent. PA Walmart aims to bring struggling Asda back to health Walmart is throwing its weight as the world’s largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda thrived for a decade as the country’s cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Walmart in 1999 and remains the third biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi and Lidl have steadily cut into Asda’s market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Walmart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda’s president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Walmart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent’s purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. “One thing that maybe we would criticise ourselves for is that we didn’t start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn’t focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price,” Price told Reuters in an interview. Reuters Profits surge for Hargreaves Lansdown after Brexit shares frenzy Financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown has seen half-year profits surge by more than a fifth thanks to share dealing frenzy in the wake of the Brexit vote. The Bristol-based investment supermarket said it saw client-driven share deals jump by 51 per cent to 1.95 million in the six months after the EU referendum. It added there was no sign yet of a slowdown in share trading, as the so-called Trump Bump following the US president’s election continues to boost global stock markets. The share dealing boost helped pre-tax profits leap 21 per cent to £131m in the last six months of 2016, while the group also notched up another record for assets under administration – up 13 per cent since June 30 at £70bn. But the uncertainty caused by the decision last June to leave the EU also saw nervous investors withdraw cash and invest less, with net new business falling by 16 per cent in its first half, at £2.34bn against £2.77bn a year earlier. The group said it saw a “partial recovery” in investor confidence after the US presidential election, while it continues to benefit from an ongoing share dealing boom. PA IBM to Train 25 million Africans for free to build workforce IBM is ramping up its digital-skills training programme to accommodate as many as 25 million Africans in the next five years, looking toward building a future workforce on the continent. The US tech giant plans to make an initial investment of 945m rand ($70m) to roll out the training initiative in South Africa, a country where 31 per cent of 15-to-24 year-olds are unemployed, according to Statistics South Africa. At the same time, the programme will be started at IBM’s offices in Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco and Egypt, enabling an expansion of the project across the rest of the continent. The move may help bring and keep digital jobs in Africa instead of losing them to India, said Hamilton Ratshefola, IBM’s country manager for South Africa. As many as 50,000 such jobs are currently farmed out from Africa, predominantly to India, Ratshefola said. The company has worked in partnership with the United Nations in extending the initiative throughout Africa. IBM is also talking to a number of other potential partners, including mobile phone companies, to further scale the programme, Ratshefola said.  Bloomberg Dunelm slumps as retailer warns of ‘transitional year’  UK home furnishings retailer Dunelm reported a slide in first-half profit and indicated that the rest of the year may not be any easier, sending its shares tumbling. The company is in “a transitional year”, chief executive John Browett said in a statement on Wednesday. Dunelm shares fell as much as 11 per cent in London to the lowest in more than four years. Browett’s comment “sounds a bit ominous”, Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said in a note. “When you say that ‘this is a transitional year’, then it usually means that profits will be down.” The retailer, which has doubled its store numbers since going public just over a decade ago, is experiencing growing pains at a time when sterling’s Brexit-induced drop is causing it to raise prices and online competition is intensifying. Business in the first half of the year was “slightly softer than normal”, Browett said by phone, adding that conditions remain challenging. Bloomberg VW labour bosses accuse brand chief of breaking cost-cutting deal Volkswagen’s works council has accused top executives of breaching a cost-cutting deal, risking fresh turmoil at the German carmaker as it struggles to overcome its emissions scandal. In a letter to VW brand chief Herbert Diess, seen by Reuters, the labour leaders said he and personnel boss Karlheinz Blessing had breached the terms of November’s “future pact” by ruling out possible hirings in the first half of 2017 and cutting temporary jobs more quickly and deeply than agreed. “The management board with its actions is undermining the terms of the future pact,” the labour leaders said in the letter delivered to Diess on Tuesday. VW is under pressure to make cuts at high-cost operations in Germany to fund a shift to electric cars and mobility services in the wake of its emissions scandal, while still grappling with billions of euros in costs related to that scandal. Reuters Denmark joins race to host EU drug agency instead of London after Brexit The Danish government on Wednesday teamed up with the former head of drug company Novo Nordisk in its campaign to become the new host of the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. “EMA should be situated in a place where there is a strong tradition of putting the patient in focus... We have that in Denmark,” said Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen in a statement. Denmark is not the only country courting to EMA and will compete with offers from other EU members including Sweden, Spain, France and Poland. Denmark is home to a cluster of pharmaceutical and biotech companies, including Novo Nordisk, the world’s largest diabetes drug maker, Lundbeck and Genmab. The government appointed former Novo Nordisk chief execuutive Lars Rebien Sorensen as a special envoy being tasked with promoting the Danish offer. Reuters Barcelona rejects Airbnb plan to limit rentals in fresh clash Barcelona’s city hall rejected a proposal by Airbnb to limit the number of home rentals in the city, setting off a fresh clash between the platform and local authorities vowing to clamp down on unregulated tourism. The city hall said the plan to limit home listings in the central Barcelona area of Ciutat Vella doesn’t go far in enough in tackling the use of unlicensed rentals for tourists. While Airbnb hoped the new limits would ease tensions after a year marred by sanctions and public backlash from locals complaining about crowds in central Barcelona, the city hall said Airbnb must stop advertising all properties without a licence while adding that it would keep sanctions against the home-rental platform unchanged. “Airbnb’s response is a joke,” said Agusti Colom, Barcelona’s councillor for companies and tourism, at a press conference on Tuesday after the plan was made public. “The law is clear. You can’t advertise tourist apartments on these platforms if they don’t have a licence number, so what Airbnb needs to do is to remove them.” Bloomberg EU fines 3 battery recycling companies for forming cartel  The European Union has fined three battery recycling companies a combined $72m (£57.5m) for forming a cartel that artificially kept the purchasing price for used car batteries low.  EU Antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said Wednesday the companies were purposely “reducing competition in this essential link of the recycling chain”.  The US company Johnson Controls received full immunity because it revealed the cartel to the EU, but British firm Eco-Bat Technologies was ordered to pay €32.7m (£28m) and Recyclex from France €2.7m. Campine of Belgium has to pay €8.1m.  The EU recycles practically all of its car batteries. By keeping the purchasing price low, the companies hurt used battery sellers, mainly small and medium-sized companies.  AP More about: GSK Glaxosmithkline Asda Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. The one-time 'Sock Capital of the World,' Fort Payne, Ala., will soon get 442 new jobs making socks for Wal-Mart as part of the retailer's $250 million commitment to American manufacturing. The Renfro Corp., the single largest producer of socks in DeKalb County, Ala., recently landed a deal with Wal-Mart that should swell employment at Renfro's manufacturing plant in Fort Payne by more than 70 percent. The deal is the latest in Wal-Mart's 4-year-old commitment to buy an additional $250 billion worth of U.S. products to support American jobs, Wal-Mart spokesman Scott Markley said. "With changes in energy costs and labor costs overseas, it is increasingly cost effective and efficient to manufacture closest to the point of consumption," Markley said. "And it is just good business. Our customers tell us that where products are made is most important second only to price." The brands include Fruit of the Loom, Russell, Dr. Scholl's, and Faded Glory, among others. "They've been a supplier of socks to Wal-Mart for a very long time," Markley said. "They're sold under various brands." Renfro Corp. CEO Bud Kilby wasn't immediately available Wednesday. But county officials said Renfro now has about 605 employees, so the additional jobs will push employment for the hosiery mill to more than 1,000 workers. "Renfro is the largest employer in our hosiery industry," said Jimmy Durham, executive director of the DeKalb County Economic Development Authority. "We're also seeing an increase in sales and production from our other hosiery mills." While Wal-Mart's decision to stock more Renfro socks is a shot in the arm for Fort Payne, it still won't nudge the sock production numbers for the city, which has some 14,000 residents, back to the heyday. At its peak in the 1990s, Fort Payne had more than 120 hosiery mills with some 7,500 workers who made one out of every eight pairs of socks worn worldwide, according to a 2016 New York Times article. Fort Payne produced 600 million dozen pairs of socks at its peak, Durham said. Job loss accelerated after Gildan, a company based in Montreal, Canada, bought in 2007 V.I. Prewett & Son Inc., a homegrown hosiery mill and moved production elsewhere, including Honduras. "We lost at least 6,500 employees. Our unemployment spiked to about 16.9 percent," Durham said. "Now we're back down to about 5.9 percent unemployment," he said. "We've been very fortunate to get some good automotive and other companies." Dan Bartlett, Wal-Mart executive vice president for corporate affairs, said Wal-Mart is hiring more workers and buying more American goods as it expands its store network, e-commerce services and training for more than 225,000 frontline associates this year. "With a presence in thousands of communities and a vast supplier network, we know we play an important role in supporting and creating American jobs," Barlett said in a statement last month. "Our 2017 plans to grow our business — and our support for innovation in the textile industry — will have a meaningful impact across the country."

Senate Bill 284, which was filed on Monday and given a committee “do-pass” recommendation on Tuesday, was approved by the full Senate after several lawmakers said they’ve been inundated with emails and phone calls from a second group of liquor store owners who said they were caught by surprise by the bill. SB284 sponsor Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, defended the bill as consumer-friendly legislation that will enable grocery stores to obtain permits to sell wines of all types. Currently, grocery store chains operating in Arkansas, such as Walmart U.S., Kroger’s, Edwards Food Giant and Brookshire’s, can only sell Arkansas and other small farm wines that produce less than 250,000 gallons of vinous product year. “This is a bill that the Grocers Store Association has been working on since 2015. There were some concerns then and they pulled it down and worked on it with different areas of the wine industry in the state of Arkansas for two years now,” Hester said. “This is a simple change to allow the grocery stores to carry the product and brands that best suits their customers (needs).” Sens. Linda Collins-Smith, R-Pocahontas, and Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, peppered Hester with several questions about why the bill was pushed through committee so quickly without input from a group of liquor store operators who said they were not involved in negotiations before HB284 was filed. Elliott also questioned Hester concerning a one-page missive circulating at the State Capitol by opponents of SB284 that grocery stores and other retailers won’t have to abide by the same rules and restrictions that now govern liquor stores, such as store setback rules on the distance from school and churches and prohibitions that prevent most wine retailers from selling groceries. Hester testified he was well aware that some liquor store owners were upset with his bill, but said his legislation would open up the state’s liquor industry to “free market” principles. He also dismissed concerns that Walmart and other “big box” grocery store chains would have an unfair advantage in obtaining volume price discount on out-of-state wines, and offering food products at wine tasting events that liquor stores can’t. “Some factions of the liquor store owners (will) support this bill, others will not,” Hester said. “Today, if the liquor stores want to pass bills where they can sell crackers, I would be supportive of that.” After a few other questions about other details of the six-page bill, the Senate approved the bill by a vote of 18-11. Three senators voted present and two did not vote. Afterward, members of a newly-created group of about 400 liquor store owners from across the state, called United Beverage Retailers of Arkansas (UBRA), said Hester bill’s caught them off-guard. Tom Smith, owner of Spirits Liquor in Little Rock, said two years ago the liquor stores and small wineries across the state were solidly united against a similar bill. He said Walmart and the grocery groups only sought out a few “county-line” and dry county liquor store owners to help pen Hester’s bill. “We were not invited to the table. (This) really took me out of the blue … and got me by surprise, I did not know that these discussions were going on,” Smith said. “Last time around two years ago, we had the wineries on our side and we had all the county line liquor stores. They took those two groups right away from us.” Francois Guilloux, owner of There Performance Group, a Little Rock-based data analytics and consulting firm for the liquor store industry, told Talk Business & Politics that SB284 will negatively impact smaller, independent liquor stores across Arkansas. “This bill will have devastating impacts on the wine and spirits industry in Arkansas,” said Guilloux, who has sent hundreds of emails to liquor store owners and lawmakers. “We estimate that close to $80 million of cash flow is in jeopardy for a group of 1,000 small businesses and over 2,000 jobs are at risk in Arkansas.” Supporters of SB284 say the independent liquor store owners are exaggerating the economic impact of SB284, citing how similar legislation in Tennessee, Florida and other states allow retail sales of wine. During a bill signing ceremony on the other side of the State Capitol on Wednesday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to jump into the fray, saying he would remain “neutral” on SB284 and “the interested parties should seek some common ground.” “When you have those competing interests, I was counting on them communicating and talking and working out consensus. I think they thought they had a consensus bill that they were presenting,” the governor said. “We are continuing to monitor that. We are hearing from some people that had some concerns about it, so we will continue to watch that as it goes through the process.” Hutchinson said lawmakers need to balance any “competing interest” between all the interested parties. “The legislation tries to do, (but) we will see if there needs to be modifications as it goes through the legislature,” he said. Late Wednesday evening, Hester’s bill was on the agenda of the House Select Committee on Rules, which generally deals with all legislation concerning alcohol, cigarettes, tobacco, lobbying, code of ethics, pari-mutuel betting and other similar bills. One particular note discussed by some lawmakers interested in SB284 is the potential revenue that it would generate from increased wine sales. In Hester’s bill, a grocery store seeking a wine permit would pay $1,000 for building space of less than 35,001 square feet. Larger stores with space over 75,000 square feet would pay $5,000 for wine permits. According to the bill, fees from the wine permits would be equally divided between the “Arkansas Wine Grant” program and the Tourism Development Trust Fund, which would be designated to the Department of Parks and Tourism to promote the state’s wine industry.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

"It not only has changed our program, it's changed our university," coach Gary Gilmore said. "I've been here 21 years, and at no time have I seen groups of people so proud to wear our gear, put our sticker on their car. You go to Wal-Mart and there are 10 or 12 people walking around with our gear on where in the past it's been all Clemson and South Carolina stuff." All those new fans, along with the old ones, want to know what the Chanticleers will do for an encore. Coastal Carolina led the nation with 96 home runs last season, and players accounting for 79 of them are gone. Only three everyday players are back, but the weekend rotation returns, including CWS Most Outstanding Player Andrew Beckwith. So does star reliever Bobby Holmes. "The expectations are every bit equal to last year," Gilmore said. "The way we have to go about it may be a little bit different as far as how we put our team together and what the team's skill sets allow us to do. The goal is the same. It's to get back to Omaha. The one thing I did find out is that if you get there, anything can happen." Seth Lancaster, who missed the CWS after getting hurt in super regionals, moves from second base to third. He hit seven home runs, most of any returning player. "We're not going to hit 108 home runs," Gilmore said, "but I think we'll hit more than people give us credit for." The Chanticleers plan to be more aggressive on the bases. Billy Cooke is back after stealing a team-leading 27 bases. The Chanticleers finished with 112, and Gilmore said this team should be capable of 150. Beckwith (15-1, 1.85 ERA) led the nation in wins, threw two complete games in the CWS and was the winner in the title-clinching victory against Arizona. Alex Cunningham (10-4, 3.62) and Jason Bilous (3-1, 4.43) are the other weekend starters. Holmes (7-2, 4.20) is the bullpen ace. Newcomers Wood Myers at second base, Jordan Gore at shortstop and Cory Wood in left field will join the lineup. Myers played at a junior college last season after spending two years at North Carolina, Gore transferred from South Carolina and Wood was one of the top high school players in North Carolina last year. The Chanticleers will play their first season in the Sun Belt Conference after moving from the Big South. "We can't come out and play passive and say, 'Hey, we did this last year so it's going to be given to us,' " Beckwith said. "Everyone is going to (target) us. I think the Sun Belt is a little bit better competition, and our guys need to embrace it." Some things to know: NEW COACHES There are 30 new head coaches in Division I. Most notable are David Pierce at Texas, Greg Goff at Alabama, Steve Bieser at Missouri, Nick Mingione at Kentucky, Travis Jewett at Tulane, Lane Burroughs at Louisiana Tech, Greg Lovelady at UCF and Mark Wasikowski at Purdue. MARQUESS' FINALE Mark Marquess will retire after this season, his 41st at Stanford. He has 1,585 career wins, and his team is picked second behind Oregon State in the Pac-12. Marquess won national titles in 1987-88 and has led the Cardinal to the CWS 14 times, most recently in 2008. ACTIVE WINS LEADER Mike Martin, entering his 38th season at Florida State, takes over for Augie Garrido as the active career wins leader. Martin has 1,898. Garrido had an all-time record of 1,975 in 48 seasons. He coached the past 20 at Texas before being reassigned as special assistant to the athletic director last May. MORE OFFENSE The 2016 team average of 0.61 home runs per game was highest since 2010, team scoring of 5.57 runs a game was highest since 2011 and the team batting average of .275 was highest since 2012. The national fielding percentage of .967 was the best since at least 1970.

Matthew Argersinger and Andy Cross (TMFMattyA) Feb 10, 2017 at 2:02PM In this episode of Market Foolery, Mac Greer, Andy Cross, and Matt Argersinger talk about Coach (NYSE:COH), which beat earnings forecasts as it continues its long recovery; Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which also beat expectations and showed itself again to be a virtual money-printing machine; and Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA), which suffered during the holiday season much like the brick-and-mortar retailers that sell much of its athletic gear and apparel. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 31, 2017. Mac Greer: It's Tuesday, January 31st. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Mac Greer, and joining me in studio we've got Motley Fool Chief Investment Officer Andy Cross, also of Motley Fool Hidden Gem's fame, and we've got Matt Argersinger from Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio. Gentlemen, welcome. Matt Argersinger: Hey. Andy Cross: Hey, Mac. Argersinger: Glad to be here, Mac. Greer: Guys, let's get right to it. We've got lots of earnings news and I want to start with Under Armour. Matt, the stock just getting shellacked on Tuesday. Weaker than expected earnings and the company announcing that its CFO was leaving because of personal reasons. Argersinger: Shellacked is definitely the right word. Anytime you're, you've guided for revenue growth of 20% and it comes in at 12%, and then you guide for the following year of growth of 11% to 12% when you're also expecting 20%, or at least the market's expecting 20%, it's not gonna be a good day for your stock. And so when I look at Under Armour, what we have to remember, this is still very much a retail story. In other words, about 60% of Under Armour's revenue still comes from wholesale sales to department stores, to sports retailers, and it was a really bad holiday season for department stores and in-store retail sales. I looked at this report from Kiplinger that in-store sales for this past holiday were up just 1.4% year-over-year, which is a pretty anemic growth rate for retail sales. And so we also know that obviously traditional retail faces a lot of structural headwinds, and so anytime you have slower traffic to department stores, that's gonna force a lot of promotional discounting, retailers are trying to move a lot of inventory through, and what happened with Under Armour is there was a lot of discounting. Kevin Plank at least thinks that a lot of Under Armour's brand sort of got shuffled in with the other competitor brands, a lot of discounting, not a lot of sell-through, and therefore, you see the results that we see today. And especially, we gotta also remember that about 85% of Under Armour's sales still come from North America. They're growing great overseas, but North America was a really weak retail market and that's what we see with Under Armour's results. Greer: And we had some big retailers like Sports Authority go bankrupt over the last year. How much were they hurt by that, you think? Argersinger: I don't think . . . that hurt a little bit, but I remember that was probably in the single-digit percentage points. They've kind of moved past that, but still, it's a factor and I think Kevin Plank also mentioned in the conference call that they expect to get a lot of that volume back, that they necessarily didn't in the fourth quarter. Cross: You know I thought the pollsters had a bad forecasting year with Brexit and the U.S. election, but I gotta say, Matt and I were talking about this before the show. It just seems like Under Armour missed the forecasting mark pretty dramatically here. I think we've been thinking about this retail shift that's been going on and I just think that's just, when I think of Under Armour in this kind of quarter, especially around the holiday sales, and what they're looking out for 2017. They did miss the mark and I was just wondering if it's a consumer shift or if it's really just a forecasting miss on their part. Argersinger: Right, back in October, so this is October, this is right before getting into the holiday season and they were confident with their guidance, they thought they were gonna have a good holiday season, certainly guiding to 20% growth, and we were kinda also talking about the show, maybe this is why the CFO suddenly is leaving. Maybe there was some, just sort of missing the picture, like you said about what the retail environment really looks like. Greer: And taking a longer view, guys, Under Armour is a Motley Fool recommendation. They've delivered 26 straight quarters of 20% or higher sales growth up until this most recent quarter. And shares have been a really market crusher over the past five and ten years, right? Cross: From a growth investing perspective, the 20% sales, 20% revenue, those are beauty and usually, typically, the market underestimates those. So you think about investors, typically, Peter Lynch has written about this, underestimate those true growers as long-standing growth players. It's just that, when it sours and when it goes south, investors tend to flee the ship pretty quickly and dramatically. Greer: And we got a couple of questions on Twitter from some longtime listeners. Brendan asking whether this is a overreaction or a real concern and Sam asking whether this is a buying opportunity. Argersinger: Those are two great questions. I can't call it an overreaction, because this is a pretty dramatic slow-down. We talked about consistent 20% growth, now we're in the low double digits. Cross, you had an interesting number I think. The $2 billion in market value that Under Armour's losing this morning or today is equivalent to what, you said five years worth of operating profits? Cross: Yeah, maybe like $400 million in operating profits on $4 billion of sales, so yeah, you're looking at about five years of operating profits out the window in less than a day. Argersinger: But you also have to say, if you were an investor and you were looking for this company to grow at a 20% rate for the next several years, it's a totally different trajectory today going forward. And the question is, can they get back to that growth? They must, if they want to justify the valuation on the stock, which is still, which was high going in and it's still actually relatively high, even after losing 20% to 25% in the stock today. So I don't think it's an overreaction. I don't feel like this is an opportunity where you say I'm backing up the truck on this company. I think you have to be a little cautious. Maybe if you had a small position you were looking at, this might be a great time, but I wouldn't be the person who says I gotta go in 10% of my portfolio in Under Armour today on this miss. Cross: You know, also part of this, Matt, is I think is Kevin Plank was very honest about the assessment, but when you look at what happened with FitBit earlier this week, I mean the whole idea of consumerables and the amount of investments that Under Armour has made into the wearable market, they've spent $700 million in the past couple years I think, in kind of buying and going into the technology field. But concerns about the athletic market, what is the real growth potential behind that? Greer: Connected fitness, Andy. Cross: Connected fitness, but is it more of a trend? So I think investors are pairing these all together and thinking about the retail space, as well as the athletic space that Under Armour and Nike play into and wondering is the growth days, especially in North America, have they kind of slowed down? Greer: Well let's talk about that as we wrap up this conversation. Matt, Under Armour right now has a market cap of around $9 billion and falling. Nike has a market cap of around $90 billion, so we've got $9 billion and $90 billion. If I'm an investor in Under Armour or if I'm looking at this as a potential investment, should I be thinking of Under Armour as just an early stage Nike or is that really kind of an apples and oranges comparison? Argersinger: That's a great question. I like the comparison. In fact, my team in MDP, when we were looking at Under Armour, the past several months, we've compared it to Nike, looking at Nike as a public company over the last three decades, roughly. And it's interesting, if you look at Nike's history, Nike would have periods where its, year on and year end the growth is 25%, 30%. And all of a sudden, they'll have a year where growth slows down to 10% or even falls, revenue even falls. And you can go back and understand the explanation for it, but in reality, what you have is an interesting picture of a company that, over the last 20 years, has done exceptionally well for investors, Nike has. It's followed a very volatile trajectory, it's had years like this where all of a sudden 25% growth turned into 12% growth. And so if you're a long-term shareholder in Under Armour, I think you can take confidence in that and say you know what, maybe this is a company that's just going through some early growing pains, it can still be on that sort of $90 billion future market cap trajectory like Nike. Cross: And let's not forget Nike does most of their sales internationally, Under Armour does almost all, as Argersinger says, 85% of the sales domestically, so Under Armour has a lot of potential around the globe, which is that the margins there aren't quite as strong as they are in the US. Greer: Well let's switch to another retailer, Andy. Coach reporting better than expected earnings, shares up on the news. North American same-store sales for Coach rising 3%. Is this still all about handbags? Cross: Woo-hoo, 3%! It's like yay, great. But compared to where they were a few years ago, as Coach goes through their turnaround, the stock really has dramatically underperformed, sadly, over the last few years and this is an investment we have on stock advisor and watch carefully. I'm encouraged. I think we're seeing the turnaround come, Matt and Mac. 3% does not sound like a lot, and yes, Mac, it is mostly handbags, but Stuart Vevers, who's the new creative director, not new, he came in a couple years ago, and Victor Luis who's the CEO as of a few years ago, as longtime CEO Lew Frankfort stepped down, I really like what they're trying to do differently than what we're seeing in Under Armor. They're actually really pulling back on some of the discounting, they're trying to get that under control, they're trying to really rebrand and rebuild the brand of Coach. Stuart Vevers, from the creative side, really trying to bring back the sex appeal to what Coach may be, a little bit Mac, and we're starting to see it play out in the financials and so while 3% doesn't sound phenomenal compared to where they were, it's actually impressive. And importantly, it's the third consecutive quarter of comp growth, which is what you really want to see from Coach. Argersinger: I like that point because if you go back to Under Armour for a second, Kevin Plank on the conference call said we really, as Under Armour, we want to be perceived as a premium full-priced brand. We don't want to be lumped into all the discounted brands that are our competitors and compete on that level and I think that's what you want to see from Coach. I think for years, they probably found themselves falling into that, we've gotta discount these to move the inventory and things like that. And that does some long-term damage to the customer perception of the brand. And so if Coach can rekindle that, that's a good first step. Cross: There's a very interesting parallel, Matt, with Coach and Under Armour, not to draw too much to it, but Coach really invented the kind of handbag market that could serve at a higher price point than what you may find elsewhere, but not nearly as high as what some women were paying for like Louis Vuitton or for Prada, so they really kind of, especially in Japan, which is where they really had a lot of success early on, Lew Frankfort built this, and they ran that up and then they started seeing some of the pricing points. Michael Kors came in and started offering some very fierce competition, and then you started to see them get into the discounting game, and started to see their discount stores take on more of a share than their high-end stores. And I don't know if Under Armour is kind of in that spot right now, 'cause they basically created that performance . . . Greer: Athleisure wear. Cross: Well, performance gear, really. That was their heart and soul. Greer: Right. Cross: There are a little bit of parallels, it's taken Coach a long time to get back to where they were and it was some tough sledding for shareholders for many years. And now, from where Coach is, at a little bit of a baseline, and at 16 times earnings, I think your opportunity to make money in Coach over the next few years is much better than what it has been over the last couple years. Greer: What about the fashion market is so, so fickle? And you were talking about their rebranding, Andy. One thing that Coach has done recently is they have signed Selena Gomez, she's a pop singer, and they're really going after a younger market. Do you think Coach can pull that off? Cross: I think they can. I think they couldn't before. But with the fresh thinking that Stuart Vevers has brought in, the creative director, as I mentioned, and Victor Luis, I think that they are bringing a perspective, the new 1941 handbags they launched last year are starting to have some appeal, they're playing across higher price points that I mentioned, but also not foregoing the lower price points. There are rumors swirling around about Kate Spade on the market and whether Michael Kors or Coach will be bidding on Kate Spade. They also bought Stuart Weitzman shoes last year for $700 million, I believe. And that line was actually up 26% last quarter, so you're starting to see Coach really take some little bit more risks. They've moved away from what I think, if you looked at Coach four or five years ago, the kind of Coach bags they had there, I think just lost a little bit of their luster, a little bit of their appeal to the consumer and they're starting to get more into those traditional lines and a little bit more hip with Stuart and I like that. Greer: And I was doing some research on their website this morning. They have actually some nice men's wallets from $100 to $200 and I compare that to my binder clips, which I use for my wallet. And you can get a box of 100 heavy duty binder clips for around $4. Cross: Yeah. Are you in the market? Greer: I'm gonna stick with the binder clips for right now. Do you go wallet? Or what's your . . . Argersinger: I have a business card holder that has become my wallet. Greer: Nice. Argersinger: So I don't know if that qualifies as a wallet. Greer: Front pocket, back pocket? Argersinger: Back pocket. Greer: Really? And you're sitting on it? George Costanza style? Argersinger: No, I take it off, I take it off. Greer: That just seems uncomfortable. Argersinger: I never have much cash anymore. Cross: Dude, my brother pulled out his wallet the other night and it was like George Costanza. I was like what do you got in there? He started pulling out his glasses, put 'em on ... Greer: Cross, what are you doin'? Argersinger: Starbucks receipt from five years ago. Cross: I was not, but my wife bought me a wallet that has my initials on it so I feel like I'm obligated to use it, it's one of those thin ones. And I rotate between the front and the back, I gotta say in the front, it's not quite as . . . it looks a little, not as attractive. Greer: Give the binder clip a shot. That's all I'm saying. It's better than the money clip. Money clips get stretched. You can buy these in bulk. 100 for four bucks. Argersinger: Four bucks. Four cents a binder clip probably lasts for years. Greer: But something tells me I'm not Coach's target market. You think that's fair? Cross: Yeah, I think that's fair. I think that's fair, but I think as we'll find out in the next segment, I don't know if we'll be carrying money clips either in the next few years. Greer: Well that is a good segway to our final story. Mastercard reporting better than expected earnings. Share is dipping a little on Tuesday. Matt, this stock, when you look at the one-year chart, the five-year chart, the 10-year chart . . . Argersinger: Doesn't matter. Greer: It just crushes the market, it's like they're just throwing all sorts of money at investors. And it's up around 20% over the past year. Argersinger: Right. We've actually had Mastercard on our watch list in MDP for I think almost since the beginning, or for a couple years since my team took over MDP. We should have bought it, it was stupid for us not to because we're always waiting for a good price or what we think is a good price in Mastercard, but there really is never a bad time to buy it. It just produces dramatic cash flows, consistent growth, and it's a story, as Cross alluded to, the story away from cash. The trend away from cash, to cashless transactions, to credit card use, especially outside of the United States. It's just unrelenting. And you've got Mastercard, Visa, American Express, of course the big brands. Visa's bigger than Mastercard, but Mastercard's growing a little faster. I think the results were as solid as usual, I think the stock's down a little bit because the strong U.S. dollar, which we've seen over the last few months, is hurting them a little bit 'cause they're seeing more of their growth outside of the U.S. and so when you see the euro and the pound just getting smashed the last three months or so, that's gonna hurt the results a little bit. But otherwise, this is a machine, I really don't know why you wouldn't buy at any price. Cross: I mean it's a business that's growing at least two times faster than global GDP, two or three times on the top line and their so little reinvestment needs. They generate $5 billion in operating, $4 or $5 billion in operating cash flow every year, and they spend $300 to $400 million on capital expenditures and software and the rest, they just buy back stocks. They bought back three and a half billion last year and they bought back $1.1 billion last quarter. So it's just one of those compounding machines that continues to hum along into a market that is shifting and I think dramatically, I think we've seen a little bit of the S curve come and we're gonna start seeing more and more adoption. Four out of five transactions around the globe are still in cash, so as the adoption grows, the more electronic commerce. And Mastercard takes a little nibble of all those transactions. Last year, Mac, they did almost $5 trillion of gross dollar transactions across their platforms. That's about a third the size of the U.S. GDP. Greer: That's a lot. That sounds like a lot. Cross: And they just take a little nibble of that, and that network, Visa's network, they're extremely stable and they're hard to break into. Now you do find some regulatory concerns around the globe when you have that amount of market share and that locked in cost and whether the pricing is a little too high and even 1% or 2% of the transactions, they start sometimes facing some concerns about regulatory concerns, but really, Mac, it's a machine and the stock is not expensive and you're going to find consistent growth and investors like that like us. Greer: And how often do you guys use cash these days, 'cause I very rarely use cash. I can carry the same $20 for like a week or two. Argersinger: I was thinking before the show, when we were talking about it, I think the only time I pay cash is when I go to my barber. I have a barber in my neighborhood that I go to and it's because he takes credit cards, but he prefers cash, so I just give him cash, but that's literally the only time I ever go to the ATM. Cross: Me too. I went to 7-Eleven instead of Starbucks this morning and I paid for my coffee with cash. It was just such an odd experience. I pulled out the cash from my wallet and I gave it, and the guy dug through his cash register and gave me change and I was like, I don't know. It was just like . . . Greer: And then what do you do with the change? Cross: Right, exactly. I look for something to like donate it, into like, they donate to animals or whatever it might be, some kid's fund, and they didn't have it, so I just stuck it in my pocket, I'm like what am I gonna do with this? My daughter will find it and probably swallow it. Argersinger: That's the point about Mastercard sort of growing overseas and the point that four out of five transactions globally are still in cash. I spent the fall in Berlin, where you always use cash. You're expected to use cash and they look at you funny if you're at a restaurant and you say I want to pay with credit card, you have to tell them, because they have to go get a special machine, and bring it over to the table. It's a crazy phenomenon, but it's amazing how accustomed we are, in the U.S., to not using cash. Yet in Europe, of all places, where you think it's just as advanced as we are, nope. They're still using cash, probably 90% of the time. Cross: Yeah, I mean mobile payments, as we've talked about many times before, is a growth market. There are a lot of players in there. Mastercard and Visa, tied to it certainly, but obviously Apple Pay and PayPal all players in there. It is just going to be a growth market. Very interesting to see how BitCoin plays all into this and the Blockchain technology when it comes to transactions. But I think Mastercard and Visa too, both recommendations of ours, will continue to do well in that space for many years to come. Greer: Okay, well we will end it there. Matt and Andy, thanks for joining us. Cross: Thanks Mac. Argersinger: Thanks Greer. Great job.

Chris Hill, Taylor Muckerman, and Jason Moser (TMFWizard) Feb 10, 2017 at 11:46AM In this episode of Market Foolery, Chris Hill welcomes Taylor Muckerman and Jason Moser to the show as they dig into the latest news from Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), which just made a steep cut to its sales forecast and announced a round of layofs. They also provide an update on Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), which saw its buyout bid from Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) drop significantly now that it is clear that regulators will insist on bigger divestitures before they allow the merger to happen. Finally, the team answers a listener question regarding heavy equipment manufacturer Cummins (NYSE:CMI). A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on January 30, 2017. Chris Hill: It is Monday, January 30th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I am Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today from Million Dollar Portfolio, Jason Moser. And from Stock Advisor Canada, Taylor Muckerman. Good to see you gents. Jason Moser: What's up dude? Taylor Muckerman: Good to see you. Hill: We got a little bit of snow today. Muckerman: We did Hill: How about that, you wake up, you look outside and there's snow on the trees Muckerman: The perfect amount, the roads are perfectly fine and it looks pretty Moser: I takes the forecast of it to go ahead and just throw the public school system into complete chaos. Just the forecast of it Hill: Yeah. Moser: I mean school started two hours late today, but it was like . . . Hill: Where do you live? Not for me, I got to wake my son up, he was like "Is school . . .?" I was like, "No buddy, schools on, chop, chop, let's get moving." Muckerman: There you go. A little pat on the rear and out to the bus. Hill: Exactly. We're going to dip into the full mail bag. We are going to start, though, with a pair of stocks that are heading south very quickly. Fitbit does not report their fourth quarter until late February and today the company confirmed, what some had feared and at least one person in this studio had predicted, which is that this report is going to be ugly. Fitbit lowered their sales guidance and they are laying off 6% of the work force. Let me just . . . stick with me on the numbers here, because when companies offer guidance, they are offering a range. Which makes perfect sense, they are not going to be able to predict it down to the dollar. The sales guidance range that Fitbit had offered was, "Well, we think sales are going to come in somewhere between $725 and $750 million." They came out today and said, "Actually, it is going to be around $580 million," which is a massive drop and the stock, not surprisingly, down about . . . at one point it was down 16% to 17%. It has come back up a little bit, but it is still down 11% to 12% percent. Moser: Yeah, I would warn investors who are thinking that maybe this is the opportunity to pick up shares on the cheap to give that notion a lot of thought. You need to be able to identify the catalyst that will turn this thing around, because I don't think there is one personally. I am not trying to be glass half-empty Jason here. It is just the way it is. We have talked about Fitbit a lot since it went public. It's really been a bad investment. I don't like saying that. I like what they stand for, right. I mean they are really trying to do a good thing, I think, in making people more aware of their health and encouraging fitness and what not. At the end of the day, it is a gadget company, it's a one-trick pony, for the most part. Its one trick, it turns out, to kind of suck. It is not very good at what it does. Muckerman: It has got a class action lawsuit, or did for the heart rate monitoring and then it couldn't measure your steps properly. Moser: I mean any time you have a situation where you feel like, "Okay, I am wearing this thing for this one reason" and now, it's being brought into question as to whether it actually does it well or is it even doing it correctly. It is hard to gain that trust back, I think, ever. Most consumers who maybe on the fence in thinking maybe, maybe not. There are plenty of reasons to go ahead and think maybe not now. Like you said, this was a major, major guidance cut. The midpoint of guidance from then to now, that is about a 20% change. This is a company that is going to be very dependent on growing that top line in order to improve its business. This is essentially . . . what is going on right now is like GoPro 2.0, in you're seeing this company has hit its peak and now, I think, what we are going to see here now going forward is a lot of ratcheting back of guidance. They're obviously going to be cutting cost, unfortunately letting some people go, you're going to see margins starting to compress, you are going see cash start to burn, and you're going to start to see these guys try to figure out what do we do here to sort of right the ship. I am not saying that's an easy answer, because I don't know what they do. It is a great example of where you have a company where the co-founders who are leaders there,forward thinking cultures. Those are all great qualities, but they are just that, they are qualities. I think it is important to note that those are things that we like to find in investments, but they don't mean that they will actually be good investments. Muckerman: This comes at a time when people are spending money. Consumer confidence is as high as it is in January, in the last 12 years. Across any month, a lot of that has to do with the election. People thinking their taxes might get cut and what not. Consumer confidence is up, holiday sales were strong, but this isn't a sticky product. Gartner Research said that in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, 30% of the folks that have a smartwatch or a fitness tracker have stopped using it within a year. So, if you are not getting people to reup on the newest product in your cycle, and people obviously don't see the benefit of continuing to use it, it is just a dying breed and they are trying to say that maybe they can help save lives by teaming up with healthcare companies. I think they teamed up with Medtronic to allow their Fitbit app to input its data into Medtronic platform to combine the analysis of diabetic's glucose levels with their activity levels to try to monitor that. So maybe there is a future there. It is going to take some proving to do that and this is still a small test with Medtronic and less and less people are using their product in the first place. Moser: I think it best to just adjust the market opportunity. Muckerman: Yeah. Moser: I think initially when this company went public, the perception at least was the market opportunity was as big as the number of people on the face of this planet. Everybody could wear one and that is just turning out to just not be the case. Hill: You mentioned, Jason, you thought this was GoPro 2.0. I was thinking this morning, when I was reading though the coverage of this. This is reminding me actually of Flip Cam. Remember Flip Cam? Which was revolutionary until the iPhone came along and Android phones mirroring what the iPhone was doing and then all of a sudden, everybody who has a mobile phone has a camera in it. Then it ends up getting acquired by Cisco Systems and then Cisco Systems quickly writes down that entire thing. I have said this before, I think the likely outcome for Fitbit is an acquisition of some sort and to your point, Taylor, about them partnering up with Medtronic. They ought to be . . . if they are not talking to Medtronic about . . . because Medtronic is a big company . . . Muckerman: Yes it is, yeah. Hill: . . . that is very well-established in terms of medical devices. That is one of the things I was trying to think about. Okay, if you think someone's going to buy Fitbit, and I think someone is, I don't know what the price is going to be, but I think someone will buy them. Then the question becomes, "Well, who's the likely candidate?" Any time we talk about potential acquisitions, our mind tend to go toward . . . tend to go broader than what makes sense and they also tend to go to "Well, who has got the money?" So in the tech . . . Moser: Well at this point, I even think I even have the money. Hill: But you hear that all of the time. It's like, "Well, you know Apple could buy them." Well yeah, you know, look what Apple has. Moser: They have a phone, they don't need it. Hill: They are not going to buy them. But Medtronic actually makes sense to me, as opposed to . . . Jason, one of the companies I was thinking about was . . . well, who's spent money on health fitness app recently? Under Armor. Well, yeah, I don't think Under Armor is going to buy this company. Muckerman: No, because they will just embed this in their clothes and not have you wear something on your wrist. Maybe an insurance company out there lowering your premiums based on . . . like Progressive has the thing that you plug into your car, so if you drive more safely, your insurance premium goes down. Maybe if you are more active, your insurance premium with this Fitbit. I could see people strapping it to their dog collar and "Get out there and be somebody pup." Moser: Look at an example of a business where you probably thought acquisition at some point or another. LeapFrog, right? We talked about LeapFrog a lot on the way down and how it was kind of neat what they had, but you could tell more and more that their window for their market opportunity kept on getting smaller and smaller because kids were just making their initial devices like Kindles and iPads and iPods and what not. I look at Fitbit and I think who wants to actually take on that headache. I have always been somewhat critical of Apple on the Apple Watch side because I felt like they built a device that tries to do to much as opposed to something where, given their resources, the technology, the brand power, I think Apple could actually develop a Fitbit style, truly dedicated fitness device that could completely wipe Fitbit out. Without even thinking twice, because of everything I just said there, the finances, the resources, the brand power, what not. I don't even know that I would look Fitbit ultimately as an acquisition at this point because you got to figure, who really needs it, right? I don't know that anybody actually needs it, because what they're doing isn't necessarily so special. Muckerman: You could develop it for cheaper than you can buy it. Moser: Sure. Hill: Let's move on to Rite Aid. If there is a stock that's making Fitbit feel better itself today, it is Rite Aid. Shares are hitting their lowest point since 2014 after Walgreens lowered the buyout price by nearly $2 billion. And just to refresh everyone's memory, October of last year they agreed to a buyout at $9 a share, today that gets lowered to $6.50, maybe as much as $7.00 a share, which is a pretty big haircut. Muckerman: Yeah it is. It is really dependent on the amount of stores that they would have to divest in order to make this deal happen. If they have to divest 1,000 or less, they will probably get $7, if they have to divest up to 1,200, which is what many people are thinking, likely $6.50 per share. But when you are looking at it, you see Fred's, I think was a Tennessee-based pharmaceutical store that said they would originally buy the stores when the deal was thought to be approved. But now the FTC is coming out and saying that there is still some question marks here. Maybe having to divest more than the original 867 stores, so seeing that haircut immediately . . . and shares weren't even trading up to the $9 level to begin with. Hill: Right. Muckerman: Some uncertainty right from the very get go. Hill: Just to be clear, what is driving this is that Walgreens is looking, "How do we get this deal done?" If there is a silver lining for the shareholders of Rite Aid, it's that Walgreens is committed to getting this deal done. It is going to be at a lower price. Muckerman: They extended the deadline. I think the deadline was this past Friday. They extended it out to July 31st. There has been a private equity firm, Cerberus, that has come out and said that they would like to potentially buy these stores if Fred's can't make it happen. There is some action on that side of things to help get the deal done, but you are still looking at what price Walgreens is going to pay and what price Rite Aid shareholders are willing to accept. Hill: Isn't Cerberus the mythical three-headed dog who guards the gates of hell? Muckerman: That is their logo, I think, as well. Hill: If you're a business, and a company called Cerberus is calling you up and wants to do a deal. You're in trouble. Muckerman: Scratching your head. Hill: Either run the other way or you're in trouble. Muckerman: They have the money though. Moser: What's going on right now shows you that Rite Aid is in a position of total weakness. They are at the mercy of a suitor and it needs the suitor more than the suitor needs them. We are seeing a lot of consolidation in this sector. Walgreens buying Rite Aid, CVS buying Target's pharmaceutical division. You go back and you read the 8-K that the press release that came out when this deal was initially announced, I think back in late 2015, it was really interesting to see more or less the termination fees here involved. It basically all falls on Rite Aid's shoulders. I think Walgreens knew going into this, that there were going to be some antitrust concerns at least or some questions. So that initial price was one where they set that mark and said "Okay, we may have to divest some here and if that is the case, we will be able to make all of this stuff happen." In most cases, the onus really fell on Rite Aid's shoulders to make sure this deal happened. If it doesn't happen, most scenarios result in Rite Aid actually having to pay Walgreen a termination fee regardless. So when you think about it from that perspective. Muckerman: Wow, that's kind of backwards. Moser: Walgreens is a much bigger company. It has close to three times as many stores, a much bigger market gap, more financial resources. At the end of the day, this is a deal that is going to happen. They are going to divest what they need to divest. If you are a Rite Aid shareholder, there is light at the end of the tunnel from that perspective. It goes to show you, Rite Aid has been in a position of weakness for some time. Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com. You can also hit us up on Twitter @marketfoolery is our Twitter handle. From Todd Whitcomb in Utah, "I am attempting to value Cummins Incorporated and I was curious to get your expert opinion. Thanks. Love the Show." Taylor, Cummins for those unfamiliar, this is a heavy equipment maker. Engines, power generation, turbo technologies, big stuff. Muckerman: Yeah, we're talking 15 liter, 12 liter engines. A company that has had a good run. We talked right before the show. It is up about 60% over the last year. That makes me wonder if the valuation might be a little to rich. If you look at some of the metrics that it is trading at, like a price to earnings, just north 21 times. The five year average has been right around 15. The price to book, not as bad, right around 3.5 times. Price to book historically over the last five years around 3.2. You are looking at a lot of these areas where this company does business: mining . . . its mining business is down about 45% from its all-time high. Its marine business is down about 40%. Oil and gas is still down 80%. There is some upside there, but they're not expecting the bottom to flatten until at least the middle of 2017, maybe even later into the year. You might be able to get a better price, especially because we have seen this run up, when results really haven't caught up to that share price performance. Hill: I was going to say, that's surprising to hear you tic off the various percentages of how their business units have fallen. I can see a six . . . I mean this is a $25 billion company. I could see a 60% run up like that if they were flat out crushing it. Muckerman: They're not. Hill: They're not. Muckerman: In the U.S., revenues are still falling. They are looking at China to be a stronger segment, because obviously heavy machinery companies, you're not going to succeed on a global basis unless China is helping you out. So they do have a favorable outlook for China, more near-term than North America. The balance sheet is there, they have some time to wait it out, maybe some M&A on the technology side. If not, you could certainly see some share buybacks or an increase in the dividend as a likely possibility. There is some upside there, in term of where it is at now, I don't have a price target or anything like that. It does appear a little richly valued based on the last five years worth of multiples. Hill: So this is one of those companies we get questions about from time to time and the name pops up, in part because it is one of those spaces that I think certainly over the last few years when you think of Caterpillar and sort of the ups and downs that Caterpillar has gone through. This type of industry becomes more interesting to watch. It is not the sexiest industry in the world. Muckerman: Right. Hill: But it becomes more interesting. Muckerman: One thing that you will look at with these cyclical industries that rely on oil and gas and commodities. If the price to earnings, or the pork value is a little high, maybe it is because earnings have been depressed, so it might be toward the bottom of the cycle. You always want to look a little deeper than just these multiples. If you look at enterprise value to revenue, the spread between its five year average and where it is at right now isn't necessarily as high those other two that I mentioned. You really want to dive in a little bit closer, because earnings could be depressed based on cyclicality. Hill: So I looked up the origins of this company. Started by a man named Clessie Lyle Cummins. Clessie, there is a name that I've never heard in my life before. Muckerman: Bring it back. Hill: Grew up in rural Indiana. Never had formal education past the eighth grade. Is just one of those people that just makes you shake your head in wonder at what he is able to do once he starts working and innovating. He was awarded 33 patents for his various inventions. Set five world records for endurance and speed for trucks, buses and race cars. Really amazing. I love stories like that. There are the people that are highly educated and do amazing things, and there are people who have the brains, don't get the formal education and do them anyway. Muckerman: Roll their sleeves up and get it done. Moser: Yeah, and you hear about that stuff and you think about financial implications there and how much money ends up making and yada, yada, yada. It is natural to think about, wow, it would be so great to make all of that kind of money. Those are the people that just do it, because they love it. That is just what they love doing. For them, the money is like one of those things that just comes from building really great products and ideas. Muckerman: Really fast cars apparently. Hill: Yeah. Muckerman: Or trucks and buses. Hill: Thanks for being here guys. Moser: Thank you.

Calgary-based law firm Higgerty Law says it filed the suit at Court of Queen’s Bench in Edmonton on Feb. 3. Alberta Health Services charged Walmart last month with 174 violations of the province’s Public Health Act; none of the accusations has been proven in court. Higgerty Law says it is seeking damages for anyone who was not refunded for food that had to be thrown out _ whether or not it was contaminated _ as well as anyone who got sick. The claim also seeks special and punitive damages and health-care costs. Last May’s wildfire forced more than 80,000 to flee the northern Alberta city and residents were not allowed to return for a month.

(Cameron Smith) Print Email Cameron Smith By Cameron Smith AL.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 10, 2017 at 8:40 AM comments I don't like to think about it, but Sappho is getting old. It didn't seem that long ago that my wife and I bought her out of the back of a pickup truck in the Walmart parking lot in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. A farmer's black lab had gotten together with a golden retriever, and he wanted to get rid of the little fur balls that resulted. That's about as Alabama of a start as any dog could have.  She shredded and chewed her way into our hearts. It's funny how dogs do that. We trained her with little pieces of hotdog. All she has ever wanted to do is retrieve things. We simply oriented all her training around that. It's one of those cases where nature didn't really care if it was nurtured or not. Yeah, I know. Sappho is one of the goofiest dog names ever. But I'm a classics major who's too creative for my own good. She's a great dog. That's saying something. Some dogs are just dogs. Others are even good dogs. But great dogs--it's like they leave a paw print on your soul. My first dog was like that too. Mary Poppins was a formidable giant schnauzer, but she was the most gentle of giants to my siblings and me. She would literally stand between people she didn't know and us. It was her not so subtle way of protecting her pups. There are a handful of times I remember my father actually crying. The day we had to put Poppins down was one of them. Sappho's stature might be a little less intimidating than Poppins, but she loves my boys just as much. For some dogs, the arrival of children means they take a back seat. Sappho didn't mind; the boys were just new people to play with. For eight years, they've poked, prodded, and squeezed on her. She hasn't so much as growled at them. The older two boys play with her in the yard, sneak her food at the table, and look at her the same way I looked at Poppins all those years ago. My youngest has taken a particular liking to her. He'll cuddle up next to her on the sofa and frequently fall asleep using her for a pillow. When she least expects it, he'll run up to her and give her a bear hug in the kitchen. She knows he's part of our pack.  To say she's just a dog doesn't give her the credit she's earned. She's been a companion on our adventures, a teacher focusing on the simple things, and a comfort on some awfully bad days. Dixie, Emmitt, and Fire are just a few of the canines that come to mind who truly impacted people I care about. Those great dogs might be gone, but they made their people a little better--a little more patient, a little more forgiving, a little less likely to leave food out on the counter. Sappho's coat has thinned to the point where she needs a sweater to keep warm, her teeth are worn from years of chewing, and she has gas so bad that it can clear a whole house. But it doesn't matter. She's earned that comfortable spot on the couch as a member of our family. Old dogs like Sappho don't need to learn new tricks to warm our hearts, but they do need to know that we appreciate them in the hustle in bustle of life. I'll be sure to do that when my bright-eyed friend greets me at the door tonight.

Staff Reports / Published: February 10, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Woman charged for sexual assault Pottsville police reported that about 3:30 p.m. Feb. 3, Brittany Marks, 24, of Frackville, was arraigned and re-committed to Schuylkill County Prison where she is being held in lieu of $20,000 straight cash bail on a separate charge. The latest charges, filed by Pottsville police detectives, include statutory sexual assault, indecent assault and corruption of minors. Police said they received information indicating that a juvenile boy fathered a child with Marks while he was 15 years old at the time and the infant was born in June of 2016. During the course of the investigation, police said, they learned from Schuylkill County Children and Youth Services that the juvenile was interviewed and admitted having sex with Marks, police said. Marks was also interviewed and also admitted to both knowing the boy’s age at the time and also with having a sexual encounter with him in September 2015, police said. Police also said a DNA test was completed confirming the boy as the father of the child. Pottsville man jailed for assault A 19-year-old Pottsville man was jailed after Pottsville police responded to a report of a domestic disturbance about 11 p.m. Monday at 800 W.

The woman also said that Everitt was wanted by several police departments, including state police, for domestic violence.

The woman also said that Travares left her several threatening text messages saying he was going to kill her one way or another and that he was going to damage both her home and vehicle, police said. In one message, police said, the woman reported Travares was going to burn her house down and said he hoped her children were inside at the time. Police investigate stabbing incident FRACKVILLE — A Maryland man was jailed after being arrested about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday by state police at Frackville in connection with an assault in Frackville.

Short term: Prices are stalling. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 69.03. The projected upper bound is: 70.93. The projected lower bound is: 67.14. The projected closing price is: 69.04. Candlesticks A big white candle occurred. This is generally considered bullish, as prices closed significantly higher than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “low,” it may be the first sign of a bottom. If it occurs when prices are rebounding off of a support area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or retracement level), the long white candle adds credibility to the support. Similarly, if the candle appears during a breakout above a resistance area, the long white candle adds credibility to the breakout. During the past 10 bars, there have been 7 white candles and 3 black candles for a net of 4 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 26 white candles and 24 black candles for a net of 2 white candles. Three white candles occurred in the last three days. Although these candles were not big enough to create three white soldiers, the steady upward pattern is bullish. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 94.0956. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 8 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 59.48. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 81 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 273.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a buy 7 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 5 period(s) ago.

JULIE OLIVER / POSTMEDIA Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Related Stories Trustee says board showed lack of communication over vanished school funds For nearly 2 1/2 years, members of the parent council at Leslie Park Public School say, they have felt as though they needed to keep a secret. At least $14,839.41 vanished from the school's fundraising account, according to a council investigation. The parents at the school haven’t been told of the full extent of the loss. The parent council accuses the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board of repeatedly preventing them from detailing to parents what happened at the small school of 115 students in a residential area near Greenbank and Baseline roads. The board says it couldn't reveal the details about the missing funds since the matter was under police investigation. Since no charges were laid, the investigation was "not a matter of public record" and there were limitations on what it could reveal, the board said, although it has since agreed to reimburse the school council for the entire amount. How thousands of dollars went missing, who took it, and why parents were kept in the dark has been revealed through documents obtained by Postmedia and through interviews with members of the school’s parent council. In September 2014, Dave Wright went to the bank to determine how much money was in the Leslie Park Public School parent council’s bank account, which was used to keep the proceeds of fundraisers such as pizza days, cake walks and movie nights. Wright, the school’s newly elected parent council treasurer, was checking to see how much money was left in the account from the year before. It was one of his first acts as treasurer — a role he’d taken over from Corinne Reynolds who had left the school at the end of the previous academic year. The numbers didn’t make sense to Wright. He said he felt butterflies in his stomach. The account — which had a balance of $10,616.81 in January 2011, the last time a financial report had been prepared by the council — was overdrawn by $121.94. More than $6,500 from school council fundraisers since that time also wasn't accounted for. The money had vanished. "I thought 'I'm just going to report this and the police are going to come in, the cop cars are going to pull up on the lawn, and this is what is going to happen,'" Wright told Postmedia. “I went immediately to the principal and I went into his office and closed the door and said 'It's bad.'" After Wright told the principal, the principal contacted the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. The board's advice was for the council to make an official complaint to police, which they did. What followed was a multi-year investigation and the painstaking tracking of the spending in the account by the council. It was a challenge made more difficult because there were no financial reports prepared by the council for three years between 2011 and 2014, a direct violation of OCDSB policies, according to Wright. "All we had was the numbers, trying to figure out where each nickel and dime was going," Wright said. Bank records obtained by the council showed unusual withdrawals beginning in July 2012. The first odd withdrawal was a $150 cheque Reynolds — who acted as both the school's former treasurer and council chair — had written to herself.  The cheque was supposedly for Walmart gift cards. Later there was a $100 cheque issued to her now former husband. Then $200.59 was supposedly spent on a camera. There was another $300 cheque supposedly for Walmart gift cards, a $705 cheque for the rights to show movies at school that were never actually purchased and $900 for the supposed purchase of a table. Some of the cheques were made out to herself using both her married and maiden names, a review of the bank records revealed. In November 2012, a second camera was supposedly purchased, this time for $300. "I've never seen them," Wright said. The bank account required two signatures on every cheque, but the person who previously co-signed the cheques had left the school when her children graduated. When Wright went to the bank, that woman's name was still on the account. It appears no one from the bank ever checked to see if there were two signatures — that was the responsibility of the account holder, the council was told. While some of the transactions in the account matched purchases made by council, the majority of the transactions did not, Wright said. In total, there were 319 transactions in the school council account between January 2011 and September 2014, including 196 cheques. There were 113 cheques that only had a single signature; 13 of them bounced because of insufficient funds, according to the council investigation. Wright said the handling of the school council's finances seemed to violate several school board policies regarding school councils and fundraising. It was even more concerning as it continued after a massive fraud was uncovered at the Rockcliffe Park Public School council in February 2012. But unlike the school in Rockcliffe, where large sums of money were owed to creditors, Leslie Park owed only a few hundred dollars to a pizza supplier, making the loss of money easier to suppress from parents and the public, Wright said. In a written statement to Postmedia, the school board's executive officer, Michele Giroux, said the school council opted to maintain a bank account at a separate financial institution than the school, and neither the principal nor the school district had any access to or oversight of the account. However, board policy that came into effect in September 2013 requires financial reporting at school council meetings. That wasn’t being done at Leslie Park, according to Wright. The board said policy has since changed so that a school council must provide signing authority to the treasurer and two other officers. Other policies surrounding financial management were changed in 2013 and 2014, Giroux said, although it wasn't clear how the mismanagement at Leslie Park was able to continue until September 2014. The financial investigation report undertaken by the parent council took two years to compile and during that time, the work being done by the council was mostly kept secret. At first, council members thought they had to let police conduct their investigation. But as the weeks dragged into months and then years, they became more concerned about the silence. Parents at the school still hadn’t been told about the missing money. The council says the school board stymied them whenever they asked to go public. By February 2016, the board provided council with $2,000 to "offset any loss that may have otherwise been determined had there been sufficient information to quantify that a financial loss was actually incurred." The council responded in a letter to the board that they felt transparency to the school parent community was essential. The council also said they had begun preparing a media release on their own and asked for the board's assistance. "Full disclosure of what happened will bring closure to this ongoing saga and as well assist in an effort to recoup our actual losses," the letter said. Instead the school authorized a much more sanitized version for the parents in the school's spring newsletter. Under the title "School Council Transparency", the newsletter advised parents only of "discrepancies" in the school council account balance and transactions "that could not be fully accounted for." There was no mention of a specific amount, although it did make an admission that the school hadn't been in compliance with OCDSB policy. It was around this time, in April 2016, that the school council learned from the board that police had met with Reynolds. In an email obtained by Postmedia and sent to the school board superintendent of instruction, Frank Wiley, Ottawa police Const. Michael Dosdall wrote that Reynolds "quickly admitted to wrongdoing" and "wanted to make things right." Dosdall wrote that Reynolds couldn't remember "what all happened" but seemed confident that she could pay back as much as $5,000 in restitution. Dosdall warned that once any money is paid back it is a civil agreement, and police wouldn't be able to charge anyone criminally. However, proceeding that way would ensure the school recovered some of the money. Attempts to reach Dosdall by Postmedia were unsuccessful. When Postmedia approached Reynolds earlier this week, she said she had agreed to pay back $5,000 and that she had written a letter of apology. She disputed that the amount missing was as high as council claimed, however. She has not been criminally charged, and the board said the police investigation is finished. The board wouldn't say whether they had recovered any of the missing funds. The amount allegedly recovered from Reynolds is disappointing to council, whose members thought they had an agreement with the board that the amount that would be paid back would be twice that much. One email in June 2016 from Wiley to council members indicated that the board had proposed a $3,500 settlement. In an August 2016 letter to the school board, the council members said that agreement for anything less than $10,000 was unacceptable. The letter also again demanded that the school community be provided the details of what happened. "Since the OCDSB and our council have always agreed that we need to promote financial responsibility in our schools, we simply do not understand why you would not want to hold someone fully responsible in this case," they wrote. When still nothing happened by November 2016, Wright publicly presented a report on the full scope of council's investigation into the missing funds. That meeting was well attended by council members, but only a handful of other parents. Of the 17 parents present, only six weren't already on parent council, according to a draft copy of the meeting minutes. Post media contacted Wright and the council after receiving a copy of that report in late January. It was also during that meeting that the council presented a letter they wanted to send to the parents. That letter outlined the details of what had happened as well as a link to the financial report. To date, the council has not received approval from the board to send the letter to parents or to post it on the school's website or Facebook page. The council alleges that the school's principal also recommended changes to the meeting's minutes, which must be publicly posted on the school's website. The first draft version of the minutes indicated that Wright had presented a report on the missing money, including the approximate amount. According to council members, those references were removed by the principal, along with a notation about how council wanted to advise the parents about what had happened in subsequent copies. "I do not have any detailed knowledge of this issue, but can say generally that the school council is the approval authority for their minutes and the minutes should reflect the decisions made at the meeting," Giroux said in her statement to Postmedia. At the January school council meeting, council co-chair Karen Adelberg was pulled aside shortly before the meeting and was told by the board that the school would get all its money back. She made the announcement during the meeting. However, Adelberg said the council wasn't told if it is money that was repaid by the person who took it, or if it’s money being paid out of the school board's budget. "This whole thing wasn't about trying to squeeze the board for money," said Wright. "We wanted the person responsible to take accountability for it." Leslie Park Public School is one of eight Ottawa schools the school board recommended for closure in a report last year. aseymour@postmedia.com Twitter.com/andrew_seymour   How $15,000 vanished from an Ottawa school council's bank account — and stayed secret By Andrew Seymour First posted: Thursday, February 09, 2017 11:29 PM EST | Updated: Thursday, February 09, 2017 11:35 PM EST For nearly 2 1/2 years, members of the parent council at Leslie Park Public School say, they have felt as though they needed to keep a secret.

Julie Oliver / Postmedia Share Adjust Comment Print For nearly 2 1/2 years, members of the parent council at Leslie Park Public School say, they have felt as though they needed to keep a secret. At least $14,839.41 vanished from the school’s fundraising account, according to a council investigation. The parents at the school haven’t been told of the full extent of the loss. The parent council accuses the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board of repeatedly preventing them from detailing to parents what happened at the small school of 115 students in a residential area near Greenbank and Baseline roads.  The board says it couldn’t reveal the details about the missing funds since the matter was under police investigation. Since no charges were laid, the investigation was “not a matter of public record” and there were limitations on what it could reveal, the board said, although it has since agreed to reimburse the school council for the entire amount. How thousands of dollars went missing, who took it, and why parents were kept in the dark has been revealed through documents obtained by the Citizen and through interviews with members of the school’s parent council. In September 2014, Dave Wright went to the bank to determine how much money was in the Leslie Park Public School parent council’s bank account, which was used to keep the proceeds of fundraisers such as pizza days, cake walks and movie nights. Wright, the school’s newly elected parent council treasurer, was checking to see how much money was left in the account from the year before. It was one of his first acts as treasurer — a role he’d taken over from Corinne Reynolds who had left the school at the end of the previous academic year.  The numbers didn’t make sense to Wright. He said he felt butterflies in his stomach. The account — which had a balance of $10,616.81 in January 2011, the last time a financial report had been prepared by the council  — was  overdrawn by $121.94. More than $6,500 from school council fundraisers since that time also wasn’t accounted for. The money had vanished.  “I thought ‘I’m just going to report this and the police are going to come in, the cop cars are going to pull up on the lawn, and this is what is going to happen,'” Wright told the Citizen. “I went immediately to the principal and I went into his office and closed the door and said ‘It’s bad.'” After Wright told the principal, the principal contacted the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. The board’s advice was for the council to make an official complaint to police, which they did. What followed was a multi-year investigation and the painstaking tracking of the spending in the account by the council. It was a challenge made more difficult because there were no financial reports prepared by the council for three years between 2011 and 2014, a direct violation of OCDSB policies, according to Wright. “All we had was the numbers, trying to figure out where each nickel and dime was going,” Wright said. Bank records obtained by the council showed unusual withdrawals beginning in July 2012.  The first odd withdrawal was a $150 cheque Reynolds — who acted as both the school’s former treasurer and council chair — had written to herself. Leslie Park Public School’s former treasurer and council chair Corinne Reynolds - The cheque was supposedly for Walmart gift cards. Later there was a $100 cheque issued to her now former husband. Then $200.59 was supposedly spent on a camera. There was another $300 cheque supposedly for Walmart gift cards, a $705 cheque for the rights to show movies at school that were never actually purchased and $900 for the supposed purchase of a table. Some of the cheques were made out to herself using both her married and maiden names, a review of the bank records revealed. In November 2012, a second camera was supposedly purchased, this time for $300. “I’ve never seen them,” Wright said.  The bank account required two signatures on every cheque, but the person who previously co-signed the cheques had left the school when her children graduated. When Wright went to the bank, that woman’s name was still on the account. It appears no one from the bank ever checked to see if there were two signatures — that was the responsibility of the account holder, the council was told. While some of the transactions in the account matched purchases made by council, the majority of the transactions did not, Wright said. In total, there were 319 transactions in the school council account between January 2011 and September 2014, including 196 cheques. There were 113 cheques that only had a single signature; 13 of them bounced because of insufficient funds, according to the council investigation. Wright said the handling of the school council’s finances seemed to violate several school board policies regarding school councils and fundraising. It was even more concerning as it continued after a massive fraud was uncovered at the Rockcliffe Park Public School council in February 2012. But unlike the school in Rockcliffe, where large sums of money were owed to creditors, Leslie Park owed only a few hundred dollars to a pizza supplier, making the loss of money easier to suppress from parents and the public, Wright said. In a written statement to the Citizen, the school board’s executive officer, Michele Giroux, said the school council opted to maintain a bank account at a separate financial institution than the school, and neither the principal nor the school district had any access to or oversight of the account. However, board policy that came into effect in September 2013 requires financial reporting at school council meetings. That wasn’t being done at Leslie Park, according to Wright. The board said policy has since changed so that a school council must provide signing authority to the treasurer and two other officers. Other policies surrounding financial management were changed in 2013 and 2014, Giroux said, although it wasn’t clear how the mismanagement at Leslie Park was able to continue until September 2014. The financial investigation report undertaken by the parent council took two years to compile and during that time, the work being done by the council was mostly kept secret.  At first, council members thought they had to let police conduct their investigation. But as the weeks dragged into months and then years, they became more concerned about the silence. Parents at the school still hadn’t been told about the missing money. The council says the school board stymied them whenever they asked to go public.  By February 2016, the board provided council with $2,000 to “offset any loss that may have otherwise been determined had there been sufficient information to quantify that a financial loss was actually incurred.”  The council responded in a letter to the board that they felt transparency to the school parent community was essential. The council also said they had begun preparing a media release on their own and asked for the board’s assistance. “Full disclosure of what happened will bring closure to this ongoing saga and as well assist in an effort to recoup our actual losses,” the letter said. Instead the school authorized a much more sanitized version for the parents in the school’s spring newsletter. Under the title “School Council Transparency”, the newsletter advised parents only of “discrepancies” in the school council account balance and transactions “that could not be fully accounted for.” There was no mention of a specific amount, although it did make an admission that the school hadn’t been in compliance with OCDSB policy. It was around this time, in April 2016, that the school council learned from the board that police had met with Reynolds. In an email obtained by the Citizen and sent to the school board superintendent of instruction, Frank Wiley, Ottawa police Const. Michael Dosdall wrote that Reynolds “quickly admitted to wrongdoing” and “wanted to make things right.” Dosdall wrote that Reynolds couldn’t remember “what all happened” but seemed confident that she could pay back as much as $5,000 in restitution. Dosdall warned that once any money is paid back it is a civil agreement, and police wouldn’t be able to charge anyone criminally. However, proceeding that way would ensure the school recovered some of the money. Attempts to reach Dosdall by the Citizen were unsuccessful. When the Citizen approached Reynolds earlier this week, she said she had agreed to pay back $5,000 and that she had written a letter of apology. She disputed that the amount missing was as high as council claimed, however. She has not been criminally charged, and the board said the police investigation is finished. The board wouldn’t say whether they had recovered any of the missing funds. The amount allegedly recovered from Reynolds is disappointing to council, whose members thought they had an agreement with the board that the amount that would be paid back would be twice that much. One email in June 2016 from Wiley to council members indicated that the board had proposed a $3,500 settlement. In an August 2016 letter to the school board, the council members said that agreement for anything less than $10,000 was unacceptable. The letter also again demanded that the school community be provided the details of what happened. “Since the OCDSB and our council have always agreed that we need to promote financial responsibility in our schools, we simply do not understand why you would not want to hold someone fully responsible in this case,” they wrote. When still nothing happened by November 2016, Wright publicly presented a report on the full scope of council’s investigation into the missing funds. That meeting was well attended by council members, but only a handful of other parents. Of the 17 parents present, only six weren’t already on parent council, according to a draft copy of the meeting minutes. The Citizen contacted Wright and the council after receiving a copy of that report in late January. It was also during that meeting that the council presented a letter they wanted to send to the parents. That letter outlined the details of what had happened as well as a link to the financial report. To date, the council has not received approval from the board to send the letter to parents or to post it on the school’s website or Facebook page. The council alleges that the school’s principal also recommended changes to the meeting’s minutes, which must be publicly posted on the school’s website. The first draft version of the minutes indicated that Wright had presented a report on the missing money, including the approximate amount. According to council members, those references were removed by the principal, along with a notation about how council wanted to advise the parents about what had happened in subsequent copies.   “I do not have any detailed knowledge of this issue, but can say generally that the school council is the approval authority for their minutes and the minutes should reflect the decisions made at the meeting,” Giroux said in her statement to the Citizen.  At the January school council meeting, council co-chair Karen Adelberg was pulled aside shortly before the meeting and was told by the board that the school would get all its money back. She made the announcement during the meeting. However, Adelberg said the council wasn’t told if it is money that was repaid by the person who took it, or if it’s money being paid out of the school board’s budget. “This whole thing wasn’t about trying to squeeze the board for money,” said Wright. “We wanted the person responsible to take accountability for it.” Leslie Park Public School is one of eight Ottawa schools the school board recommended for closure in a report last year. aseymour@postmedia.com Twitter.com/andrew_seymour Smart soles and other high-tech ways to stop falls New global vaccine initiative is looking to Canada for support Video Connect With Us Email Alerts Get the latest news in your mailbox as it happens Weather Weather Currently Feels Like We want you to have the most accurate weather report you can.

The world's largest beverage maker's shares fell 3.1 per cent to US$40.73 (RM181.06) in morning trading on yesterday. Coca-Cola has been offloading much of its low-margin bottling business to cope with falling demand for carbonated beverages in North America. It has also been stepping up efforts to reduce sugar in its beverages, amid growing pressure from health experts and governments who have blamed sugary drinks for a rise in obesity. Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc, has also been building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio. Global volumes of its non-carbonated drinks, which include tea, juices and energy drinks, rose two per cent in the fourth quarter, while soda volumes fell two per cent. Costs related to the refranchising of Coca-Cola's US bottling operations look to be a more meaningful drag on the company's full-year profit than analysts were expecting, brokerage Cowen & Co said in a note to clients. The company forecast 2017 adjusted earnings to fall 1-4 per cent from US$1.91 per share in 2016. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of US$1.97, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company's shareholders more than halved to US$550 million, or 13 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$1.24 billion, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. The quarter included a US$919 million charge related to the refranchising of its bottling operations. Excluding items, the company earned 37 cents per share, in line with estimates. Net operating revenue fell about six per cent to US$9.41 billion, the seventh straight drop, but beat estimates of $9.13 billion, helped by higher sales of its sodas in North America, its biggest market. Volume sales rose one per cent in North America, including a one per cent growth in sales of its carbonated sodas such as Sprite and Fanta. However, global volume sales for the company fell one per cent in the fourth quarter, hurt by high levels of inflation in certain Latin American countries. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Ringgit likely to trade easier vis-à-vis greenback next week Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Coca-Cola may pull products from Vermont to comply with GMO law Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Pennsylvania State Police at Fogelsville were investigating the incident that occurred between about 3 and 3:10 p.m. Wednesday outside the store at 1091 Mill Creek Road, according to a news release. The man told police he was walking across the crosswalk when the driver of a maroon Jeep Liberty, possibly from the model years 2002-07, failed to stop and had to swerve into the opposing lane, barely missing the pedestrian, police said. The driver, described as male in his late 40s to mid-50s, then followed the victim in the Jeep. Once the man got to his van, the driver drove toward the victim and accelerated, according to police. WATCH: Know these 2? Verizon robbers at large The Jeep struck the victim's shopping cart, pushing it into the victim, police said. The driver then backed out of the parking lot away from the victim and left in an unknown direction. Police ask anyone with information on the driver or incident to call police at 610-395-1438.

The suspect convinced her to buy gift cards from Walmart and Target and provide him with the redemption codes in an effort to pay her grandson's bond. It was reported the woman lost over $11,000 as a result of the scam. General assistance, Jefferson Drive: A woman said Feb. 1 her husband, a military veteran, was walking his dog when he observed a U.S. flag being flown upside down. He did not know if it was a sign of protest or if it was unknowingly being flown in that manner. She only wanted to make police aware of the situation. General assistance, Millridge Road: Officers were asked to speak to an eight-year-old child at Millridge Elementary School Feb. 1 about stealing school property. The principal said he was taking small items, such as erasers. Property damage, Strathaven Drive: A resident reported Feb. 1 her mailbox had been damaged. It was determined a city plow was responsible for the damage and the city would replace the mailbox. Disturbance, Golfview Lane: The nursing staff of an assisted living facility said Feb. 1 the daughter of a former resident was threatening them. Officers learned she had been talking on her cell phone about the poor quality of the staff, while she was removing items from her mother's former room. As no threats were actually made, officers simply waited on the property until the East Cleveland woman, 50, left the facility. Impaired driving, Interstate-271: A Seven Hills man, 41, was arrested for OVI Feb. 2 after he ran his vehicle off the road and crashed into the center berm. He was taken to the hospital for treatment and later booked into jail. Theft from auto, Bishop Road: A UPS employee reported Feb. 3 someone entered his vehicle while he was working and stole $575 cash. The incident, believed to have occurred around 10 p.m. the previous night, is under investigation. Attempted burglary, Cranbrook Drive: A resident reported at 4:45 p.m. Feb. 4 a man, who appeared to be drunk or on drugs, was trying to get into her house. When she asked what he wanted, he told her "I am here for you." Responding officers subsequently located the Bedford man, 24, on Brainard Road, near Fitworks. It was determined he was schizophrenic. He was taken to the hospital and placed in lock-down. Charges are pending against him in county court. Theft, Alpha Drive: A boy, 14, told police Feb. 4 his iPhone was stolen from an unlocked locker at Skyzone. It was later found in possession of another child, who returned it. Disturbance, Wilson Mills Road: Officers responded to Denny's around 6 a.m. Feb. 5 for a report of a man, 41, who was refusing to leave after he was found sleeping in a booth. They learned he was homeless and had an active warrant with University Heights police. Officers from that city were unable to pick him up so he was given a ride to a bus stop. Receiving stolen property, Wilson Mills Road: Officers located a stolen vehicle occupied by four men at the gas pumps at True North Shell Feb. 5. The driver, a 20-year-old Euclid man, was subsequently arrested for receiving stolen property. A 22-year-old passenger, of Euclid, was arrested on a warrant and turned over to Euclid police. The other two men were released at the scene and the vehicle was recovered for Cleveland police.

(Source: Southaven Police Department) MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - A simple trip to Walmart turned into a nightmare for one Southaven woman. Instead of quickly getting in and out of the store, she ran into car problems, but now police are wandering if her car problems were part of a crime. Southaven Police Department is working to identify a man seen on surveillance video. The man walks up to the woman and tells her that her car appears to have oil leaking from it. He offers to help her out. "She declines so she goes ahead and drives to the Ford dealership," Lt. Mark Little said. Mechanics at the Ford dealership said someone cut her car's transmission line Police said they don't know if the man in the video had anything to do with the woman's car trouble. In fact, they said he may have just been a Good Samaritan trying to help. Still, they want to talk to him to find out what he knows. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5.

So what does that mean for Riverhead’s bustling shopping district? “I think residents like Route 58 because it’s a compact shopping district where they can get their wares and goods and then get right back out to rural areas or farm fields,” town Supervisor Sean Walter said. But in this era of remote and online shopping, the supervisor said the town “has to be wary,” adding that he hopes the Town Board can begin a master plan update of Route 58 zoning this year. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we will have some additional funding this year to maybe start that study, because I want to be ahead of the curve if it’s true that box stores could be coming to an end,” Mr. Walter said. An examination of building applications pending or underway along Route 58 showed 13 projects in various stages of development. Here’s where they all stand. EAST OF THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE • In 2016, the Town Board changed zoning once again to permit movie theaters on Route 58, having previously limited them to downtown Riverhead in hopes of drawing a multiplex there. The owner of the former Walmart shopping center, Manhattan-based Philips International, has submitted an application to raze the Walmart building, replace it with a multiplex and create two new restaurants at the north end of the property. “We are negotiating a lease with Regal Entertainment Group at this point,” said Andrew Aberham, international director of sales and leasing for Philips International. “We’re pretty far along. We’re not at the finish line, but we’re definitely closer to the finish line. Time is critical here, so we’re moving on all fronts.” Regal, the country’s largest movie theater chain, is the same company Mr. Walter tried to lure to the former Woolworth site in downtown Riverhead several years ago, an offer Regal ultimately turned down. A theater was also proposed in 1996 for Riverhead Centre, the complex anchored by Home Depot, but Regal eventually dropped out of that project, which had been stalled by a lawsuit. A Regal spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on its possible interest in the Route 58 site. “We’re excited about it,” Mr. Aberham said of a possible deal with Regal. “The Riverhead market is definitely in need of a movie theater.” • Developer Richard Israel’s Riverhead Commons development at the former Rolle Brothers site, across from Firestone, has been in the proposal stages since 2011. Mr. Israel’s company bought the property in 2009. Riverhead Commons calls for one restaurant and three retail spaces comprising approximately 50,000 square feet. It was last before the Riverhead Planning Board in October, when issues under discussion included the location of an RPZ (reduced pressure zone) valve to protect water from contamination and whether to require a cross access easement with a medical office proposed for Ostrander Avenue, enabling cars to exit away from Route 58. • The southeast corner of Route 58 and Ostrander Avenue, site of a former gas station, could also be redeveloped. In October, owner TSA Capital received Planning Board approval to add 14,378 square feet of property acquired from an adjacent church, which would make it possible to build a new gas station in the same spot. Chris Kent, the attorney for TSA, said at the time that no convenience store was planned, just a gas station. • After twice being hit by cars barreling off the Route 58 traffic circle, Pizza Hut asked to be let out of its lease late last year. Michael Hartofelis, an attorney for property owner Bell Boulevard Realty LLC, told the Riverhead Zoning Board of Appeals in December that Pizza Hut would surrender its lease for the site and that an urgent care walk-in clinic called STAT Health was interested in taking over the location. STAT Health recently appeared before the town Architectural Review Board. • Tire Country, which took over the 1,933-square-foot former Meineke Muffler building, seeks to build a 3,067-square-foot L-shaped addition that would stretch behind Friendly’s. That application was granted several zoning variances by the ZBA in December. • A Popeye’s chicken has been proposed for a vacant one-acre lot on the north side of Route 58, east of Malvese. That application has been before the Planning Board once and no action has been taken on it yet. WEST OF THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE • A 2,590-square-foot Sonic drive-in fast food restaurant was proposed for land across from Apple Honda on Route 58 in January 2016. It called for 40 indoor seats, 16 outdoor seats and 22 drive-in parking stalls. Town planning and building administrator Jeff Murphree said the town asked Sonic to supply more information following a public hearing but hasn’t heard from them since. • A similar situation exists regarding Zwanger Persiri’s proposal for a radiology center at the southwest corner of Route 58 and Osborn Avenue, according to Mr. Murphree, who said he has not heard back from the applicant. That property is currently being used to store cars from the adjacent Apple Honda, which is constructing a previously approved two-story 7,433-square-foot showroom and office building just east of its existing building. • Just west of the proposed Sonic site, Apple Honda has proposed a 60,048-square-foot retail center on 12 acres east of Riverhead Centre on Route 58. That project received preliminary site plan approval from the Planning Board in September. • The Shops at Riverhead, proposed by Brixmor Property Group has been the source of criticism dating back to 2012, when the developers clear-cut the entire 41-acre site, with town approval, to allow for construction of Costco, to date the only tenant at the site. Neighbors and town officials said the clear-cutting led to noise and dust and that the trees Brixmor planted to shield neighbors often died. Now, Brixmor is back with plans for 120,450-square-foot of additional retail on a different section of the property. In January, the Planning Board granted preliminary site plan approval, with the stipulation that Brixmor build a 10-foot sound wall to protect private homes to the east. Ulta Beauty, PetSmart and Marshalls/Home Goods are among the proposed tenants, according to the applicant. • Peconic Bay Medical Center is currently building a 3,500-square-foot annex at the northwest corner of Route 58 and Kroemer Avenue. The project, approved in 2015, is aimed at reducing emergency room traffic at PBMC’s main Roanoke Avenue campus, according to hospital president and CEO Andrew Mitchell. • Directly across the street, Barclay Ehrler received site plan approval in 2016 for a 14,400-square-foot retail building on a vacant 1.5-acre lot, a property Mr. Ehrler told the Planning Board he purchased 20 years ago and has been trying to develop for more than a decade. • Just west of Walmart is the second of two hotels developer Lee Browning planned for Route 58. The 114-room Hilton Garden Inn was built in 2007 and a 140-room Marriott Residence Inn hotel is now being erected directly beside it.

STAT Health recently appeared before the town Architectural Review Board. • Tire Country, which took over the 1,933-square-foot former Meineke Muffler building, seeks to build a 3,067-square-foot L-shaped addition that would stretch behind Friendly’s. That application was granted several zoning variances by the ZBA in December. • A Popeye’s chicken has been proposed for a vacant one-acre lot on the north side of Route 58, east of Malvese. That application has been before the Planning Board once and no action has been taken on it yet. WEST OF THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE • A 2,590-square-foot Sonic drive-in fast food restaurant was proposed for land across from Apple Honda on Route 58 in January 2016. It called for 40 indoor seats, 16 outdoor seats and 22 drive-in parking stalls. Town planning and building administrator Jeff Murphree said the town asked Sonic to supply more information following a public hearing but hasn’t heard from them since. • A similar situation exists regarding Zwanger Persiri’s proposal for a radiology center at the southwest corner of Route 58 and Osborn Avenue, according to Mr. Murphree, who said he has not heard back from the applicant. That property is currently being used to store cars from the adjacent Apple Honda, which is constructing a previously approved two-story 7,433-square-foot showroom and office building just east of its existing building. • Just west of the proposed Sonic site, Apple Honda has proposed a 60,048-square-foot retail center on 12 acres east of Riverhead Centre on Route 58. That project received preliminary site plan approval from the Planning Board in September. • The Shops at Riverhead, proposed by Brixmor Property Group has been the source of criticism dating back to 2012, when the developers clear-cut the entire 41-acre site, with town approval, to allow for construction of Costco, to date the only tenant at the site. Neighbors and town officials said the clear-cutting led to noise and dust and that the trees Brixmor planted to shield neighbors often died. Now, Brixmor is back with plans for 120,450-square-foot of additional retail on a different section of the property. In January, the Planning Board granted preliminary site plan approval, with the stipulation that Brixmor build a 10-foot sound wall to protect private homes to the east. Ulta Beauty, PetSmart and Marshalls/Home Goods are among the proposed tenants, according to the applicant. • Peconic Bay Medical Center is currently building a 3,500-square-foot annex at the northwest corner of Route 58 and Kroemer Avenue. The project, approved in 2015, is aimed at reducing emergency room traffic at PBMC’s main Roanoke Avenue campus, according to hospital president and CEO Andrew Mitchell. • Directly across the street, Barclay Ehrler received site plan approval in 2016 for a 14,400-square-foot retail building on a vacant 1.5-acre lot, a property Mr. Ehrler told the Planning Board he purchased 20 years ago and has been trying to develop for more than a decade. • Just west of Walmart is the second of two hotels developer Lee Browning planned for Route 58. The 114-room Hilton Garden Inn was built in 2007 and a 140-room Marriott Residence Inn hotel is now being erected directly beside it.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 9, 2017 at 1:00PM February will be a busy month for investors. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report this week, looking to extend its streak of impressive earnings beats. Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports next week, aiming to convince investors that its transition to a softwarecentric company will eventually return it to growth. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) will report in two weeks, in the midst of a major shift in its e-commerce strategy . Sky-high expectations Graphics chip company NVIDIA destroyed analyst estimates throughout 2016, with its latest quarterly report in November beating expectations by a wide margin. Its gaming business is booming, driven by strong demand for its Pascal graphics cards and the soon-to-launch Nintendo Switch game console. The data center and automotive businesses, both much smaller than gaming, are growing at an even faster rate. Image source: NVIDIA. When its fourth-quarter results are revealed after the market close on Thursday, Feb. 9., all eyes will be on whether NVIDIA can keep up its incredible growth rate. Its stock more than tripled in 2016 as revenue and profit expanded rapidly, but with AMD set to launch competing high-end graphics cards in the next few months, NVIDIA's significant market share may take a hit. NVIDIA's early focus on pushing its graphics chips as machine learning accelerators has paid off in a big way. The data center segment, which includes NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs aimed the data center and high-performance computing , nearly tripled year over year during the third quarter. That kind of growth rate can't go on forever, but it's clear that NVIDIA has struck gold. With the stock now trading for around 60 times trailing-12-month earnings, the company will need to continue to impress investors in order to keep the stock price afloat. Any disappointing numbers could send this highflier tumbling. A tough quarter Cisco Systems, the dominant provider of networking hardware, doesn't expect a remarkable fiscal second quarter. The company sees its revenue declining by 2% to 4% year over year even after excluding divestitures, a slowdown that reflects both uncertainty among its major customers and its ongoing shift to a recurring revenue business model. Image source: Cisco Systems. Cisco's core switching and routing businesses were inconsistent throughout 2016, with growth in some quarters and declines in others. This was counteracted by solid growth in its smaller businesses, including collaboration, data center, and security. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, though, both the data center and collaboration segments suffered 3% year-over-year revenue declines. Security posted a double-digit increase, but the results raise questions about Cisco's growth strategy. Its fiscal second-quarter results are expected after the market close on Feb. 15. Analysts aren't expecting much, with the average estimate calling for a 3.2% decrease in revenue and a slight dip in adjusted earnings per share. Cisco recently announced a major acquisition, agreeing to pay $3.7 billion for software company AppDynamics, a move that should help accelerate its shift toward software. But Cisco remains dependent on hardware, and weakness in its core businesses will continue to hurt its results. Two-day shipping for everyone After testing a subscription shipping program similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart has scrapped that effort, instead shifting to free two-day shipping on millions of items for orders over $35. This is far more generous than Amazon's non-Prime free shipping offer, which has a minimum order of $50 and shipping times that vary. Image source: Wal-Mart.http://corporate.walmart.com/galleries/e-commerce Wal-Mart has been accelerating its push into e-commerce, paying $3 billion for start-up Jet.com last year and putting Jet's CEO in charge of its entire e-commerce business. The company's online grocery service, which allows customers to place orders online and pick up for free at hundreds of Wal-Mart locations, is another facet of the e-commerce strategy, one that can't be duplicated by online-only retailers. Wal-Mart will report its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on Feb. 21. The retailer's e-commerce business has been accelerating in recent quarters, a sign that the company's initiatives are having a positive effect. Wal-Mart's stores are still the core of the business, and they enable initiatives like online grocery pickup. But Wal-Mart will need to greatly expand its e-commerce business to avoid being left in the dust. Timothy Green owns shares of Cisco Systems.

Hot Topics: Fire & Ice Festival Taft Widening Windy and Hot Day Tiny House for Rent Love of Hiking TVHS Basketball RH Line Horse Rescued Police Calls Library Director to Retire Brady Murr-Andrews pleas guilty to crimes in several cases The 23-year-old will face at least 15 years in prison on multiple felony charges in three separate cases By Sam Lounsberry Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Posted:   02/08/2017 08:47:19 PM MST Murr-Andrews A man Loveland police chased from the north Wal-Mart last January after a reported shooting there took a plea deal Wednesday. Appearing in custody, Brady Murr-Andrews, 23, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault, a Class 5 felony, and first degree kidnapping, a Class 1 felony, the latter of which carries a mandatory prison sentence of 10-15 years. He avoids a charge of attempted murder with the plea. As part of the plea deal, Murr-Andrews also pleaded guilty Wednesday to two charges from separate cases; he admitted to committing forgery, a Class 6 felony, for cashing fraudulent checks in 2015 as well as contributing to the delinquency of minors, a Class 4 felony, for providing alcohol to three underage girls in 2015. An additional case against Murr-Andrews alleging counts of identity theft, forgery and theft will also likely be dismissed as part of the plea deal offered by the Larimer County District Attorney's Office, Eighth Judicial District Judge Susan Blanco said. The arrest affidavit in that case, though, shows that Murr-Andrews told police he was forced to cash forged checks by threats from 48-year-old John Krallis, the man Murr-Andrews admitting to assaulting and kidnapping last year. Murr-Andrews also reportedly received methamphetamine for cashing the checks, court documents show. Originally, Murr-Andrews faced an attempted murder charge for his involvement in the January 2016 police chase that led law enforcement to discover Krallis severely beaten and with bullets lodged in a vehicle suspected to have been abandoned by Murr-Andrews and 23-year-old Eric Mecseji. Advertisement Mecseji pleaded guilty to the same charges as Murr-Andrews in the case in December, and awaits a sentencing hearing March 2. Murr-Andrews will be sentenced April 13 to at least 15 years in prison, said Deputy District Attorney Bob Percifield, the prosecutor on the case. A pre-sentencing investigation will take place before that hearing for Percifield and Murr-Andrews' attorney Eric Vanatta to summon any witnesses to the case whose reports may affect the defendant's sentence. Murr-Andrews is currently being held in Larimer County Jail on $220,000 of five separate bonds that can be met by putting up property he owns or paying $22,000 in cash out of his own pocket through the services of a bondsman. Additionally, he is being held on a $300 cash-only bond. Sam Lounsberry: 970-376-7598, lounsberrys@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/samlounz.

WTVD By Stephanie Lopez Thursday, February 09, 2017 01:58PM APEX, North Carolina -- A group of firefighters in North Carolina are sending out a big thank you after a good Samaritan took care of their grocery bill for them. The firefighters at Apex Station 2 didn't see who did it, but they want them to know how much it meant to them. A Walmart receipt with a handwritten note saying "Thank you for all you do," is one of the only clues the firefighters have about who paid for their groceries Sunday, when they got an emergency call and had to leave everything behind. "The nice employees at Walmart told us that it was a lady behind us in line," Station 2 Engineer Jeffery Jones said. "But we never did actually get to meet her and tell her, thank you." The groceries were already purchased and waiting for them when they returned after the call, and they said that means a lot to them -- especially when they spend every moment of the day getting ready for the next emergency. "Making sure our gear is ready, making sure the truck is completely in service," Jones said. When asked how big of a difference can a few minutes make when it comes to their response time, firefighter Andrew Baker said. "It can sometimes mean life and death." By the time they get the call, to the time they're on the road, the station strives to spend no more than 90 seconds to get going. "It's important to us," Baker said. "We take a lot of pride in trying to get out." Now they want the mystery shopper to know she's always welcomed at Station 2. "We would like to tell her thank you from the bottom of our hearts," Jones said. "It makes me feel like there are still good people in the world," Baker said. "You don't get that every day, so to me it gives you a warm feeling inside to know that people really do care about you."

Durkin | 1:36 pm, February 9th, 2017   Please enable Javascript to watch. Every time that a major snow storm like this wallops the East Coast, local news reporters are given the unenviable task of heading out into the inclement weather to provide commentary on the storm. Today’s storm pelting Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia is no different; and during a live segment this morning on Fox 29 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, one SEPTA bus driver got caught up giving sneaky passengers the business. Steve Keeley, a reporter for Fox 29 in Philadelphia, was tasked with interviewing Walmart employees in the suburb of Warrington just as a SEPTA bus back to the city pulled up. But as Keeley and his cameraman hopped on board to grab an impromptu interview with the unidentified driver, a few of the Walmart employees appear to try and sneak on behind the live shot. That’s when the driver loses his cool in the middle of his sentence, firing off, “HEY! YA’LL BETTER PAY! I DON’T CARE IF IT’S SNOWING OUT THERE! YA’LL BETTER PAY!” Keeley managed brief exchanges with the young men, as the Fox 29 reporter joked that station news anchor Mike Jerrick will take care of the fees associated with the fare. “The SEPTA bus can pull into a Starbucks with Mike Jerrick’s credit card,” he added. If the name Mike Jerrick sounds familiar, by the way, he has worked himself into a few recent Mediaite headlines; the longtime Philadelphia anchor recently called out Kellyanne Conway‘s “alternative facts” flap by blurting out, “She’s good at bullshit!” live on the air, resulting in a temporary suspension. Of course, it didn’t take Jerrick long after his suspension to land a few eye rolls within minutes being back on air. Jerrick’s colleague Alex Holley, back in the studio, commented, “That’s a party bus,” before tweeting out a video of the SEPTA bus driver’s outburst. “Only in Philly,” Holley commented.

WTVD By Stephanie Lopez Thursday, February 09, 2017 12:36PM APEX, NC -- Apex firefighters are sending out a big thank you after a good Samaritan took care of their grocery bill for them. The firefighters at Apex Station 2 didn't see who did it, but they want them to know how much it meant to them. A Walmart receipt with a handwritten note saying "Thank you for all you do," is one of the only clues the firefighters have about who paid for their groceries Sunday, when they got an emergency call and had to leave everything behind. "The nice employees at Walmart told us that it was a lady behind us in line," Station 2 Engineer Jeffery Jones said. "But we never did actually get to meet her and tell her, thank you." The groceries were already purchased and waiting for them when they returned after the call, and they said that means a lot to them -- especially when they spend every moment of the day getting ready for the next emergency. "Making sure our gear is ready, making sure the truck is completely in service," Jones said. When asked how big of a difference can a few minutes make when it comes to their response time, firefighter Andrew Baker said. "It can sometimes mean life and death." By the time they get the call, to the time they're on the road, the station strives to spend no more than 90 seconds to get going. "It's important to us," Baker said. "We take a lot of pride in trying to get out." Now they want the mystery shopper to know she's always welcomed at Station 2.

It has been corrected. Bloomberg Amazon might be able to convince shoppers to adapt to a more automated grocery-shopping experience — if it’s sufficiently convenient. There’s one thing that every grocery store has to have in stock if it’s going to make customers happy: convenience. If, as has been suggested, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.74% is going to make a major move into the bricks-and-mortar supermarket space, convenience and time savings are where it has to differentiate itself. But there are questions about whether its apparently favored format, which includes many robots and few human workers, will satisfy grocery shoppers. “It seems really hard to imagine a day where the retail experience becomes a bunch of robots,” said James Lamberti, chief marketing officer of Quri, a retail intelligence and analytics company. “Robotics and tech will be behind the scenes, with more people servicing out front.” Lamberti thinks there are different reasons, or “occasions,” when people go to a grocery retailer, he said, whether it’s the quick in-and-out of grabbing lunch, or the meandering trip where shoppers wander the aisles. Changing those shopping behaviors will be difficult, but Morgan Stanley, in a note published Tuesday, noted that Amazon has done it before. Read also: Supermarkets’ best weapon against e-tailers: produce See also: Amazon takes on tech’s white whale: grocery shopping “In our view, behavior modification is Amazon’s core business model — bringing consumers to the site, converting them to Prime and (through leading selection, clean interface, powerful suggestion engine, and low-friction shopping/checkout) driving them to spend more across categories,” wrote the Morgan Stanley analysts. Those analysts estimate that the grocery business is a $770 billion segment of annual U.S. consumer expenditures. The next frontier for advancement in the grocery-store space is saving time in the shopping process, experts say. “A lot of the focus on saving time is in the kitchen,” said Darren Seifer, NPD Group’s food and beverage analyst, referring to factors like cook time. “Now there’s a shift going on because more consumers are using fresh food, which requires a little more prep. The notion of saving the consumer time while getting their groceries is how they have to think. There’s no one specific way to do it.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.53% has talked up its curbside grocery pickup service as an option for busy families looking for a way to save time on what otherwise might be an hours-long supermarket trip. According to the New York Post, Amazon is looking into a 10,000-plus-square-foot automated grocery store. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has taken to Twitter to rebut that report. .@nypost, whoever your anonymous sources are on this story https://t.co/VFyzGQcOAZ – they’ve mixed up their meds!— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) February 7, 2017 And on the NYPost article, if anybody knows how to get 20% margins in groceries, call me! :)— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) February 7, 2017 Even if Amazon isn’t planning stores like this right now, the existence of the Amazon Fresh offering and the Amazon Go convenience store show that the company has an interest in getting deeper into groceries. “While Amazon’s business has momentum — making up [about 5%] of its total addressable U.S. consumer expenditure market, driving [approximately] 50% of U.S. expenditure growth — grocery remains one of the greener fields, with only [about] 2% estimated online industry penetration,” Morgan Stanley wrote. “At some point over the next few years, Amazon may need grocery to maintain its same-store sales and strong overall gross merchandise value growth.” In the longer term, a study from the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen found that online grocery spending could capture 20% of all grocery shopping by 2025, totaling about $100 billion in sales annually. Here's what's behind the whiskey boom in the U.S.(3:46) Whiskey suppliers' gross revenues reached $8.1 billion in 2015 and are estimated to have grown further in 2016. The surging demand for whiskey in the U.S. has led to a boom in craft distilleries opening up across the country. “Traditional bricks-and-mortar stores have to think now about how they can get creative with tech-savvy consumers,” said Seifer. As Rupesh Pareskh, senior analyst for food, grocery and consumer products at Oppenheimer & Co., said he sees it, the equation for being a threat to Wal-Mart, Kroger Co. KR, -0.03% and any of the other players in the industry is good experience plus lower prices. “Grocery has razor-thin margins,” he said. “If they can do something to take the cost out of the grocery store, that could be viewed as a negative for other stores.” See also: Amazon is not the only online retailer developing a store for the future Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the per-store build cost for an Amazon bricks-and-mortar location is in the range of $6 million to $10 million. For now, online grocery would be the next step in digitizing grocery shopping, and consumers have not been quick to adopt it. The latest survey data from Morgan Stanley shows that the top reason people don’t shop online is they like to select fresh produce for themselves. Where Quri’s Lamberti sees e-commerce already cutting into the grocery business are for items that are commoditized and have long shelf lives, like cleaning products and paper goods. “It’s hard not to see Amazon cutting into that in a major way, but there are lots of occasions that aren’t about robots,” he said. Even if change is slow, it’s happening, and grocers have to be ready. The NPD Group says 52 million U.S. consumers are currently grocery shopping online, with 20 million planning to increase their online grocery-shopping activity in the next six months. Younger generations, like millennials, are among those favoring the online option. Amazon shares closed Wednesday up nearly 1% and are up 68% for the past year. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.36% is up 23.8% for the last 12 months.

The Friday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories National by The Canadian Press Posted Feb 10, 2017 2:50 pm MST Last Updated Feb 10, 2017 at 4:00 pm MST Highlights from the news file for Friday, Feb. 10. ——— TRUDEAU SETS STAGE FOR MEETING WITH TRUMP: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says areas where he disagrees with U.S. President Donald Trump will be addressed in a respectful way when the two men meet Monday. Trudeau has been walking a communications tightrope in recent days, refusing to speak directly to the president’s executive order banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trudeau, who was in Yellowknife Friday, says there are many areas where he sees eye-to-eye with Trump, including jobs for the middle class and economic growth. ——— TRUDEAU DEFENDS HANDLING OF ELECTORAL REFORM: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he abandoned a promise to overhaul Canada’s electoral system because he was afraid the result would be political discord and instability. He told a town hall in Yellowknife that he knows people are disappointed but suggests he’s prepared to accept the political consequences, whatever they may be. He explained that the idea of a ranked ballot was abandoned because too many people believed it would be a system that would favour the governing Liberals. ——— QUEBEC STUDENT BLOCKED FROM ENTERING U.S.: A Quebec student athlete is mystified as to why he was barred from entering the U.S. this week. Yassine Aber underwent a five-hour interrogation in which he was asked about religion and his Moroccan roots. The track and field athlete with the Universite de Sherbrooke said he was travelling to a weekend competition in Boston on Thursday when he ran into trouble at the Stanstead crossing on the Quebec-Vermont border. Aber was told he did not have a valid passport or visa to enter the country. Aber, who was born and raised in Sherbrooke, Que., says his Canadian passport is valid and does not expire until 2026. ——— TRUMP SAYS HE’LL PREVAIL ON TRAVEL BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump says his administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. And he says he has “no doubt” that he will win the court fight over his travel ban. His comments at a news conference came hours after Trump tweeted that Wednesday’s appeals court decision on the ban was “disgraceful.” The court ruled against reinstating the refugee and immigration order. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process ——— PAYPAL FREEZES MEDIA ORGANIZATION’S ACCOUNT: A community newspaper’s payment to enter a feel-good story about a family of Syrian refugees in an awards competition prompted PayPal to freeze the account of a national media organization as a suspicious transaction. The weekly Flin Flon Reminder entered the article as part of its submissions to the annual Canadian Community Newspaper Awards. Flin Flon publisher, Valerie Durnin, said when she tried to pay the $242.95 for the paper’s entries, PayPal flagged the payment as possibly not in compliance with its “acceptable use policy.” In an email, PayPal promised to follow up within 72 hours of its investigation, which it never did. Instead it reversed the payment. ——— CLASS ACTION SUIT FILED AGAINST WALMART CANADA: A Calgary-based law firm has launched a class-action suit against Walmart Canada, alleging the retailer sold potentially contaminated food after the Fort McMurray wildfire. The lawsuit seeks damages for anyone who was not refunded for food that had to be thrown out — whether or not it was contaminated — as well as anyone who got sick. The Alberta government has charged Walmart with 174 violations of the province’s Public Health Act. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. Walmart did not comment on the allegations, which have not been proven in court. ——— JOBLESS RATE FALLS MARGINALLY: Canada’s jobless rate dropped marginally in January to 6.8 per cent from 6.9 per cent. Statistics Canada says there was an increase in part-time jobs and a lesser gain in full time work. Economists described the overall job growth as “very impressive” and “remarkably strong.” ——— CANADA’S EAST AND WEST COASTS GET BLAST OF WINTER: Snow storms caused havoc in both the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia’s south coast Friday. Drivers in parts of the Maritimes faced snow squalls and blinding whiteouts as a fast-moving winter storm blew into Atlantic Canada. Parts of southwestern New Brunswick ended up with more than 30 centimetres of snow. The storm in British Columbia tied traffic in knots between the south coast and the interior. ——— POLICE TO SKIP CANADA’S LARGEST PRIDE PARADE: Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says his force won’t participate in the city’s annual pride parade. Saunders pointed to divisions within the LGBTQ community as the primary reason for his decision, but emphasized it “will have no impact” on the force’s outreach efforts. The presence of police in the parade emerged as a contentious issue when the parade was interrupted last summer by a protest from the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. ——— BC PREMIER APOLOGIZES FOR HACKING CLAIM: British Columbia Premier Christy Clark has apologized to New Democrat Leader John Horgan over her accusations that the Opposition was involved in criminal hacking of her Liberal party’s website. Clark said she made a mistake and jumped to conclusions. The apology came as an Independent member of the legislature came forward to say her staff had access to the private information — without any attempt at hacking. Vicki Huntington says her staff uncovered the private information on the B.C. Liberals website while looking for 2016 donations to the party. ——— Next Story Movie Trailers February 10, 2017 to February 16, 2017 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Rings (14A) 3:15pm / 6:30pm / 9:35pm The Space Between Us (PG) 2:55pm / 6:00pm / 9:15pm Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (14A) 3D 9:45pm 3:25 / 6:40pm A Dog’s Purpose (PG) 3:35pm / 6:50pm / 9:55pm La La Land (PG) 9:25pm Split (14A) 3:45pm / 7:00pm / 10:05pm XXX: Return of Xander Cage 3D 9:35pm 3:50pm / 6:45pm Monster Trucks (PG) 3D 12:20pm     660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL TSX, Dow hit record highs to end the week Feb 10, 2017, 5:41 PM Alberta Premier Notley heading to Washington at month’s end to talk trade Feb 10, 2017, 5:21 PM Whirling disease found in trout in world-class Bow River fishery Feb 10, 2017, 5:15 PM PC member files formal complaint; says Jason Kenney seeking to undermine party Feb 10, 2017, 5:14 PM Officers punched and bitten during coffee shop arrest Feb 10, 2017, 5:02 PM Ex-SNC Lavalin execs acquitted of bribery charges after wiretap evidence nixed Feb 10, 2017, 4:44 PM Couch potatoes: 'Intoxicated' New Brunswick men go through drive-thru on a sofa Feb 10, 2017, 1:30 PM Balloon man needs another month to raise $20K following lawn chair flight Feb 10, 2017, 1:12 PM Lawsuit filed in connection to explosion in Fort McMurray fire aftermath Feb 10, 2017, 1:04 PM Ontario cabinet ministers urged to trumpet trade with US in Trump era Feb 10, 2017, 12:36 PM Halifax abuzz after sighting of wayward sheep: 'He got a little spooked' Feb 10, 2017, 12:35 PM Sugary drink consumption predicted to harm Canadians' health, cost economy: study Feb 10, 2017, 12:25 PM BUSINESS SPORTSNET OIL & GAS ENTERTAINMENT Fed board member Tarullo announces resignation Feb 10, 2017, 12:26 PM Settlement in 38 Studios case ends lawsuit over failed deal Feb 10, 2017, 11:39 AM Ontario urges Ottawa to set up loan guarantees for softwood producers Feb 10, 2017, 11:06 AM Lawsuit filed over allegations Fort McMurray Walmart sold bad food after fire Feb 10, 2017, 10:22 AM Canada adds 48,300 new jobs, but wage growth and hours worked slip Feb 10, 2017, 6:52 AM West Coast Bias: When will the urgency to win take over in Winnipeg?

Ogg February 10, 2017 12:50 pm EST Print Email Tweet With stocks at record highs, investors have to be considering how they should be positioned. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last seen over 20,200 and the S&P 500 was up at 2,310. These are huge milestones for the stock market. With the bull market now almost eight years old, the reality is that the major stock indexes have risen more than 200% from their inflection point lows of March 2009. One prevailing trend that just will not go away is that investors have managed to find new reasons to buy every single sell-off. Those same investors are also looking for new and overlooked opportunities. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for its readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or avoid. What stood out for Friday, February 10, 2017, was that the analyst calls were dominated by the retail sector. Perhaps this is due to the proposed border adjustment tax looking dead on arrival, or perhaps there has been an inflection point where companies are finding their footing on how to deal with the online competition of brick and mortar. Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX) may be more in coffee and food than it is in retail, but this giant was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. Most downgrades from other analysts covering Starbucks were on valuation, but this call from Argus was based on a weaker sales outlook. Starbucks closed up 1% at $55.81 on Thursday, but after being indicated down 0.5% at $55.50 on Friday morning, it was up 0.3% at $55.97 in midday trading. Starbucks has a 52-week range of $50.84 to $61.64 and a consensus analyst price target of $64.56. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) was started with a Positive rating and assigned an $80 price target by Susquehanna in a much broader retail segment call. Wal-Mart has a 52-week range of $62.35 to $75.19 and a consensus price target of $74.04. Sears Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: SHLD) may not look like it was the subject of a very cautious call because its shares soared on Friday. Sears shares were up over 40% at $7.95 in early trading indications, but the stock’s mid-Friday gain was up 30% at $7.25, after previously closing at $5.54. That huge gain was based more on a restructuring and cost/debt cut rather than based on actual earnings excitement. Sears was started as Negative with a $4 price target at Susquehanna, which is the equivalent of a Sell rating elsewhere. J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) was started with a Positive rating and assigned a $8.50 price target at Susquehanna. The shares closed up 1.3% at $7.07 on Thursday, but after being indicated up another 1.5% at $71.7 on Friday morning, this was down by 0.6% at $7.03 in mid-Friday’s trading session. J.C. Penney has a 52-week range of $6.35 to $11.99. Friday’s full list of top analyst calls included other companies, like Ford, Intel, NVIDIA, Teva Pharmaceutical, Twitter, Alamos Gold, Fossil and others. More key analyst calls in the retail segment were seen as follows: Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NYSE: BBBY) was maintained as Buy at Argus, but the firm lowered its price target to $50 from $55 (versus a $40.33 prior closing price). Big Lots Inc. (NYSE: BIG) was started as Neutral with a $55 price target (versus a $52.97 prior close) at Susquehanna. Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) was started with a Positive rating and assigned a $192 price target. Costco shares were up 0.5% at $171.80 midday on Friday, in a 52-week range of $138.57 to $171.87 and with a consensus price target of $175.46. Dillard’s Inc. (NYSE: DDS) was started as Positive and given a $60 price target (versus a $57.29 close) at Susquehanna. Dillard’s was up 0.3% at $57.47 mid-Friday, versus a 52-week range of $53.61 to $88.58. Kohl’s Corp. (NYSE: KSS) was started as Neutral with a $41 price target (versus a $42.10 close) at Susquehanna. Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M) was started as Neutral with a $31 price target (versus a $32.37 close) at Susquehanna. Macy’s was down 2.1% at $31.67 midday on Friday, perhaps with this unenthusiastic rating not driving much hope for a merger. Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN) was started as Neutral with a $47 price target (versus a $45.55 close) at Susquehanna. Its shares were last seen down 2.8% at $44.36 in mid-Friday trading. The 52-week range is $35.01 to $62.82. Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) was started with a Neutral rating at Susquehanna. Its $70 price target compares with a previous close of $66.41, and Target shares were down 1.5% at $65.41 on Friday. The 52-week range is $62.94 to $84.14, and the consensus target price is $84.14. TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE: TJX) was up 0.1% at $76.22 midday, after Susquehanna started it as Positive with a $92 price target. Elsewhere in analyst research, Merrill Lynch has four Buy-rated stocks yielding 8% or more. There are also five safe strong dividends for investors if that elusive market sell-off ever comes to pass.

The Friday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories by The Canadian Press Posted Feb 10, 2017 4:50 pm EST Last Updated Feb 10, 2017 at 6:00 pm EST National Highlights from the news file for Friday, Feb. 10. ——— TRUDEAU SETS STAGE FOR MEETING WITH TRUMP: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says areas where he disagrees with U.S. President Donald Trump will be addressed in a respectful way when the two men meet Monday. Trudeau has been walking a communications tightrope in recent days, refusing to speak directly to the president’s executive order banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trudeau, who was in Yellowknife Friday, says there are many areas where he sees eye-to-eye with Trump, including jobs for the middle class and economic growth. ——— TRUDEAU DEFENDS HANDLING OF ELECTORAL REFORM: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he abandoned a promise to overhaul Canada’s electoral system because he was afraid the result would be political discord and instability. He told a town hall in Yellowknife that he knows people are disappointed but suggests he’s prepared to accept the political consequences, whatever they may be. He explained that the idea of a ranked ballot was abandoned because too many people believed it would be a system that would favour the governing Liberals. ——— QUEBEC STUDENT BLOCKED FROM ENTERING U.S.: A Quebec student athlete is mystified as to why he was barred from entering the U.S. this week. Yassine Aber underwent a five-hour interrogation in which he was asked about religion and his Moroccan roots. The track and field athlete with the Universite de Sherbrooke said he was travelling to a weekend competition in Boston on Thursday when he ran into trouble at the Stanstead crossing on the Quebec-Vermont border. Aber was told he did not have a valid passport or visa to enter the country. Aber, who was born and raised in Sherbrooke, Que., says his Canadian passport is valid and does not expire until 2026. ——— TRUMP SAYS HE’LL PREVAIL ON TRAVEL BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump says his administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. And he says he has “no doubt” that he will win the court fight over his travel ban. His comments at a news conference came hours after Trump tweeted that Wednesday’s appeals court decision on the ban was “disgraceful.” The court ruled against reinstating the refugee and immigration order. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process ——— PAYPAL FREEZES MEDIA ORGANIZATION’S ACCOUNT: A community newspaper’s payment to enter a feel-good story about a family of Syrian refugees in an awards competition prompted PayPal to freeze the account of a national media organization as a suspicious transaction. The weekly Flin Flon Reminder entered the article as part of its submissions to the annual Canadian Community Newspaper Awards. Flin Flon publisher, Valerie Durnin, said when she tried to pay the $242.95 for the paper’s entries, PayPal flagged the payment as possibly not in compliance with its “acceptable use policy.” In an email, PayPal promised to follow up within 72 hours of its investigation, which it never did. Instead it reversed the payment. ——— CLASS ACTION SUIT FILED AGAINST WALMART CANADA: A Calgary-based law firm has launched a class-action suit against Walmart Canada, alleging the retailer sold potentially contaminated food after the Fort McMurray wildfire. The lawsuit seeks damages for anyone who was not refunded for food that had to be thrown out — whether or not it was contaminated — as well as anyone who got sick. The Alberta government has charged Walmart with 174 violations of the province’s Public Health Act. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. Walmart did not comment on the allegations, which have not been proven in court. ——— JOBLESS RATE FALLS MARGINALLY: Canada’s jobless rate dropped marginally in January to 6.8 per cent from 6.9 per cent. Statistics Canada says there was an increase in part-time jobs and a lesser gain in full time work. Economists described the overall job growth as “very impressive” and “remarkably strong.” ——— CANADA’S EAST AND WEST COASTS GET BLAST OF WINTER: Snow storms caused havoc in both the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia’s south coast Friday. Drivers in parts of the Maritimes faced snow squalls and blinding whiteouts as a fast-moving winter storm blew into Atlantic Canada. Parts of southwestern New Brunswick ended up with more than 30 centimetres of snow. The storm in British Columbia tied traffic in knots between the south coast and the interior. ——— POLICE TO SKIP CANADA’S LARGEST PRIDE PARADE: Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says his force won’t participate in the city’s annual pride parade. Saunders pointed to divisions within the LGBTQ community as the primary reason for his decision, but emphasized it “will have no impact” on the force’s outreach efforts. The presence of police in the parade emerged as a contentious issue when the parade was interrupted last summer by a protest from the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. ——— BC PREMIER APOLOGIZES FOR HACKING CLAIM: British Columbia Premier Christy Clark has apologized to New Democrat Leader John Horgan over her accusations that the Opposition was involved in criminal hacking of her Liberal party’s website. Clark said she made a mistake and jumped to conclusions. The apology came as an Independent member of the legislature came forward to say her staff had access to the private information — without any attempt at hacking. Vicki Huntington says her staff uncovered the private information on the B.C. Liberals website while looking for 2016 donations to the party. ——— Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Edit Profile | Logout. Loading profile...

Customers Pam King and her son Rhys, 2, shop for organic groceries at Whole Foods Market Arroyo Parkway store in Pasadena, Calif. in this Nov. 7, 2007 file photo. While Whole Foods led the organic food craze in the U.S., mainstream grocery chains have jumped on board as more and more people began buying organic. Damian Dovarganes Associated Press i By Caitlin Dewey The Washington Post Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name - namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:09 Oroville Dam spillway: 'It's not supposed to do that' Pause 1:43 Water continues to rush down Oroville spillway on Friday 0:35 See dramatic aerial views of damaged Oroville Dam spillway 1:02 Union Pacific train derails into water south of Elk Grove 3:19 Sacramento Kings head coach Dave Joeger during pregame conference 1:14 UC Davis law student helps free people detained in San Francisco's airport after Trump refugee executive order 0:44 Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying 0:09 Mudslide closes all lanes of Interstate 80 in Sierra 1:08 Damaged Oroville Dam spillway undergoes more water releases 2:14 Ramping up water releases at Oroville Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Do we live in one of America’s unhealthiest states? Hawaii is America's healthiest state, Californians keep their smoking to a minimum and Kansas saw the largest increase in obesity in the 2016 America's Health Rankings Report from The United Health Foundation. (Natalie Fertig / McClatchy) In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than Millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. Walmart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 {mdash} the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:09 Oroville Dam spillway: 'It's not supposed to do that' Pause 1:43 Water continues to rush down Oroville spillway on Friday 0:35 See dramatic aerial views of damaged Oroville Dam spillway 1:02 Union Pacific train derails into water south of Elk Grove 3:19 Sacramento Kings head coach Dave Joeger during pregame conference 1:14 UC Davis law student helps free people detained in San Francisco's airport after Trump refugee executive order 0:44 Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying 0:09 Mudslide closes all lanes of Interstate 80 in Sierra 1:08 Damaged Oroville Dam spillway undergoes more water releases 2:14 Ramping up water releases at Oroville Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email How to spot GMOs on your grocery store shelf Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an organization pushing for GMO labels on food packaging, shares some tips for finding items on grocery store shelves that contain genetically modified organisms (GMO). As Vice President of Government Affair By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco - which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods - an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity - can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Walmart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges - but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

That's the warning the head of the association for new home builders has been issuing every chance he gets in recent months. Even with a "making-it-happen attitude" it will take five to seven years to get the supply of new homes up to a healthy level again, said Bryan Tuckey of the Building and Land Development Association (BILD). The inventory of new homes for sale in the Toronto region has sunk to historic lows, he said. There are various reasons, including lengthy provincial approval times for water and waste water servicing that's required before a single toilet can be flushed in a new neighbourhood. Figures from the Toronto Real Estate Board suggest a similar shortage exists on the resale market. People aren't listing their homes because they worry about what they'll be able to afford among the region's soaring prices. If government and builders don't figure something out soon, Toronto is heading down the road of cities like London and San Francisco, says Tuckey. "You have the most affluent parts of British society not being able to afford a home in London or in San Francisco where we see jobs being lost because people can't afford to live in communities where they want to work and play and live," he said. The census data released Wednesday reinforce his concerns, said Tuckey. It shows Toronto's population grew 6.2 per cent between 2011 and 2016, above the national average of 5 per cent. But that growth was exceeded by several communities outside the city including Brampton, Caledon, King, Markham and Bradford. For the second consecutive census, Milton has proved to be the GTA town with the biggest boom. It registered 30 per cent population growth in the census period. "We talk a lot about Toronto, and still, about 65 to 70 per cent of the growth is going to be outside Toronto. Plus, it's family oriented growth, so communities like Oakville, Brampton, Milton, Bradford, West Gwillimbury where growth was intended to happen," said Tuckey. He's not surprised that those families want what the industry calls ground-related homes — townhomes, semi-detached and detached houses. Some will happily sacrifice space for affordability. Tuckey calls townhomes the new single-family home even though they don't usually have big yards for the kids to play. To get that ground-related property, many are moving outside the city to the booming 905-area communities. In Milton, three-storey stacked townhomes and the more traditional two-storey towns with basements are the highest demand category among home buyers, said Royal LePage agent Amy Flowers, whose business is flourishing in the town that now stands at a population of just over 110,000. Those homes run between $500,000 and $600,000 on average for about 1,200 square feet of living space. Toronto buyers in search of the Holy Grail of GTA housing are typically paying between about $750,000 and $800,000 for that detached house with a yard, said Flowers. "Our buyer demographic is interesting," she said. "We're one of the only towns in the country where our median age is actually going down." In little more than a decade, the influx of families has transformed Milton. The old theatre has closed in favour of a multiplex near the highway. There's a Walmart. When Flowers moved into town about 15 years ago, it took about 10 minutes to drive across Milton. Now, with traffic, it is double that. When it comes to buying homes, Milton has its share of big-league competition. On Thursday there were only 68 freehold listings and eight condos listed on the TREB's Multiple Listings Service for Milton. Of those, four of the houses and half the condos were already conditionally sold. Like Toronto, list prices have pretty much lost any bearing on the final sale amount and competitive offers are routine, said Flowers. Buyers, who often experience the disappointment of three or four unsuccessful home bids, need to go in firm on the set offer date, advised Flowers. Home inspections are nice but they're not always possible, she said. If it all sounds familiar to Toronto's property scene, Flowers concedes one difference: "We don't have 30 offers on a house. We'll have more like five." But Milton has an edge over Toronto in that buyers don't have to pay a municipal land transfer tax. As well, the federal government's new mortgage stress test rules make it necessary for some to stretch their dollar by moving northwest of the city. It can be a long commute for downtown workers, but lots of couples use it as a halfway point between jobs in Mississauga-Brampton and Kitchener-Waterloo, she said. There is an influx of families moving in from Mississauga and Brampton, "looking for a nice safe place to raise their children," said Milton councillor Colin Best. The growth has brought some benefits, including a new hospital that is expected to open in the fall, he noted. But the supply of homes for newcomers is dire. Best said he's had realtors compare it the 1990s, before the population tripled. The town approved about 6,000 homes three years ago. They've only built 1,000. Of 11 zoning applications, only three developments are being built. Best said a lot of that is due to delays, development charges, appeals and labour turmoil in the building industry. Transportation is emerging as a big problem though. "I have people spending three hours a day commuting from Milton to Toronto," said Best. While GO has increased the number of Milton trains, he is dismayed that Metrolinx says it will be 2041 before his community gets the all-day, two-way service being rolled out in the coming decade across much of the rest of the Toronto region. "Sixty-three per cent of Halton Region goes outside the region to work. That's based on a previous census. It's probably worse now. If you come to the Milton GO train, the parking lot is full by 7:30 a.m. Twenty-five per cent of (those GO riders) are coming from the west," said Best. Don't even get him started on the rush hour traffic on Highway 401. The youth of the community has its challenges too, he said. There was a community dispute among older residents and younger families about whether the town should install a splash pad at Dorset Park. "It was quite the divide," said Best. While the province is rushing to build enough schools for the booming number of students in Milton, children are being bused and moved around in the transition. There are 16 kindergarten classes among four schools and at one point, consideration was being given to the idea of having one school just for kindergarten kids, said Best. "We've had clients who have had their kids in six different schools and sometimes the same household will have kids going to different schools," said Flowers. It's another reason to buy a resale home even though she acknowledges it's in her best interest to say so. "If you buy a resale house, that has everything all sorted and figured out. You'll know what school you're going to," she said. Besides, she adds, "If you're buying new, you're on a waiting list for a year to two years." It's just one more sign of the bifurcation of housing that has been happening in Toronto is also happening in the maturing communities surrounding the city, said Cherise Burda, executive director of the Ryerson City Building Institute. She favours the region's sweeping transit expansion. But Burda says she wonders too if some of the billions of dollars should perhaps be invested in housing closer to the city. We have a choice, she said: We can build out or we can build up. Building up is costly. Land on the periphery is cheap and municipalities make it cheaper by subsidizing infrastructure to entice the development charges new builds bring to the community. The census just shows that sprawl is continuing and opportunities are being missed, she said. "The fact that those are the economic options for developers and for home buyers shows that we're missing the types of policies to fix that," she said. The region needs more of what's called "the missing middle" — housing that falls somewhere between the highrise and the sprawl option. Before the war, families lived in flats downtown. It wasn't until after the war that the automobile spurred sprawl. In Paris and Barcelona, mid-rise apartments are the norm for family living. "We're going to buy the options we're given," said Burda. "We're not building enough infill development, we're not building enough townhouses and mid-rises — not just in downtown Toronto but also in suburban centres," she said. "If we look at downtown Toronto, 75 per cent of people walk, cycle or take transit," said Burda. The region would look very different and our lives would be better if we built homes that put people within easy access of transit and jobs. "There are all these plans for building houses in the periphery," she said. "We have enough land to keep building ground level housing for decades to come. But is that going to serve a population that doesn't want to drive to get to work?"

These three DIYs are exactly that. Whether they’re filled with love notes, candy or just come as they are, these handmade tokens of love are little reminders that someone in your life is special. I hope you have a little extra time this week (or weekend) to play around with some materials you may already have on hand and see what you come up with! Click through for instructions to make this Hanging Valentine Patch Pocket and for two more sweet Valentine’s gifts including a Custom Clipboard and a Ribbon Covered Heart that harkens back to the days when boxes of chocolates came festooned with a lot of ruffles and ribbons! –Caitlin *This post is brought to you in collaboration with Waverly Inspirations. This project, ideas, and words are from us here at D*S and were created by us, for you. Thanks for supporting our sponsors that help us create and publish original content like this. The Waverly Inspirations collection is available at Walmart. Hanging Valentine Patch Pocket Materials 2 differently patterned fabrics (We used Waverly Inspirations classic gingham and polka dot fabrics) Glue gun & glue Scissors Embroidery needle Embroidery floss or yarn Ruler Light cardboard Ribbon (We used Waverly Inspirations double ruffle edge ribbon in red and their scalloped grosgrain ribbon with white edging detail) Steps 1. Cut two 5″ x 4″ rectangles of the fabric that will be the background for the heart pocket. 2. Cut out a heart shape from the fabric you’ve chosen to be your patch pocket. Make sure it fits nicely on your background, with at least 2″ of background fabric surrounding the edge of the heart shape. (You’ll be cutting a heart shape from the background fabric too, so you’ll need room on the sides of the patch pocket.) 3. Turn your patch pocket heart shape over so that it’s right side down. Using your glue gun, apply hot glue to the edge of the heart pocket beginning at the top of right, top part of the heart, working your way around to the same spot on the left side of the heart. Be sure to leave the edge in between the two peaks of the heart shape unglued so you can actually use it as a pocket and put something in it! (Bottom line is don’t glue the entire heart on the background!) 4. Once your patch pocket heart is glued to the background, thread your needle and knot it. Start the process of sewing the patch pocket heart onto the background by bringing the needle through both the background fabric and the patch fabric from underneath. Once you’ve pierced both fabrics, pull your needle and thread all the way through until your knot stops underneath the fabric. Bring your needle just past the edge of the patch (on the background fabric) and push through to the underside. Repeat this process, left to right, from the same places on the patch heart peaks that you laid your hot glue on. Again, be sure to leave the edge in between the two peaks of the heart shape unattached so you can actually use it as a pocket and put something in it! 5. Cover one side of your cardboard with your wet glue using a paintbrush. Attach the background fabric with your attached patch pocket to the cardboard. 6. Cut an 8″ length of ribbon and match the two cut ends together and apply hot glue in between them so the ends stick together. Turn the cardboard over and apply hot glue about 2″ from the deep “V” point of the heart. Press the ribbon loop into the hot glue to attach it to the cardboard. 7. Cover the ribbon side of your cardboard with your wet glue using a paintbrush. Attach the second rectangle of background fabric to this side of the cardboard. Let dry. 8. Following the outline of the smaller patch pocket heart, cut through the cardboard, making a larger heart shape around the patch pocket heart. 9. Stuff your pocket with love notes or candy and hang in a spot to surprise someone you love! Ribbon Heart Materials Light cardboard Ribbon (We used Waverly Inspirations double ruffle edge ribbon in red and their scalloped grosgrain ribbon with white edging detail) Hot glue gun Pencil Ruler Steps Draw a line in the middle of a 5″ x 6″piece of cardboard. Cut lengths of ribbon to attach in a diagonal pattern on each side of the line. Using a hot glue gun, glue the ribbons to the cardboard on one side of the line. Repeat on the opposite of the line. Cut a heart shape out of the ribbon covered cardboard. Experiment with some more with fabric, ribbon and other embellishments. Cut hearts out of your results! Give to someone you love! P.S. These are great grouped together in a small fabric wrapped box with a sweet note. I Heart U Clipboard Materials Paintbrush (We used Waverly Inspirations 1/2″ stiff craft brush) Clipboard Craft Paint (We used: Red – Waverly Inspirations High Gloss Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in Crimson, Silver – Waverly Inspirations Metallic Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in Silver, White (to make light pink) – Waverly Inspirations Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in White Opal) Stick-on letters Masking or painters tape Steps 1. Tape off an area on the clip board on the diagonal. 2. Place the letters that spell out your message in the lower right corner working right to left to make sure that all of your letters fit. If you’re using a heart in your message, cut it out and place it with tape on the back to hold it in place. 3. Trace gently around the heart if you’re using one. You’ll be painting this freehand. 4. Remove the wax paper from the adhesive on the letters and attach them to the clipboard surface. 5. Paint in between your taped diagonal area. Use two coats for maximum coverage, letting the paint dry between coats. 6. Mix different paints together to create a custom color and finish like we did here. We mixed a high gloss red with a glittered white. Use your custom color for your heart or to embellish your diagonal metallic stripe. We added high gloss red scalloped edge to our metallic edge and then dotted on our custom color to create a faux eyelet. 7. Clip a love note to the board and stash it where your Valentine will discover it! jen says: February 10, 2017 at 2:48 pm who is the green head artwork by?

January 25, 2017 Hallie Forcinio KEYWORDS convenience / party tray / tray packaging / trays Reprints No Comments If you hosted or attended any holiday gatherings as 2016 came to a close, chances are good you enjoyed the ultimate convenience: a ready-to-serve party tray. The party tray concept is more convenient than ever. Although you can still order a party tray from your favorite grocery or deli and many restaurants, grab-and-go options are proliferating. For example, Hormel Foods, based in Austin, Minn., now offers nearly a dozen stock-keeping units in its Gatherings brand. Three relatively recent additions to the Gatherings line, Culinary Pairings, combine dried fruit, nuts and cheese with slices of Italian dry salami, sopressata or hot sopressata. The rest of the Gatherings lineup consists of two party trays with two meats and two cheeses plus crackers, a larger Supreme Party Tray and five smaller snack trays. When the party starts, each rectangular tray doubles as a serving platter. A circular two-piece tray holds a ring of party-ready shrimp, distributed by Beaver Street Fisheries, Inc., in Jacksonville, Fla., and sold by Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark. Sold frozen, the package is placed in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. Right before serving, the host removes a paperboard band and clear domed lid and then peels away the clear film covering the shrimp and the clear lidstock sealing a small tub of cocktail sauce, which rests in the center of the ring. For spur-of-the-moment gatherings, the lidstock and film are left in place, and cold water is run over the shrimp and the cocktail sauce tub to quickly thaw the two for serving.  Another tray packaging segment showing growth is vacuum skin packaging. A report published by Technavio, Elmhurst, Ill., in 2016, “Shift to Vacuum Skin Packaging Will Boost Revenues in Global Skin Packaging Market by 2020,” projects a 5 percent compound annual growth rate through 2020. Although used for other types of food and nonfood products, vacuum skin packaging is particularly popular for meat, poultry and seafood products. For example, a U.K.-based mail-order supplier of venison products, Holme Farmed Venison, uses it to protect its frozen products. Vacuum skin packaging helps lock in flavor and juices and extend shelf life as much as 30 percent versus conventional modified-atmosphere packaging. It also eliminates product discoloration and leaks for improved store presentation and enhanced food safety, imparts tamper evidence and can be coupled with easy-opening devices. Resulting packages are freezer-ready and provide high product visibility.  Meanwhile materials and tray-sealing equipment continue to evolve. On the materials side, a laminated, moisture-resistant paperboard tray offers a renewable alternative to plastic. The recyclable paperboard not only extends meat, poultry or seafood shelf life, but also boosts shelf impact. It is compatible with vacuum skin technology and easy-opening features and results in a leak-proof package. Because top and bottom surfaces can be printed, there’s no need for a label. As a result, packaging material costs drop and packaging line productivity increases. Tray sealers come in automatic and semiautomatic models and inline or standalone configurations. Many accommodate two, three, four or more lanes and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). Typical attributes include hygienic design, compact footprint, easy operation via a touch screen, speeds up to 150 trays per minute and compatibility with easy-opening and resealing features. Some vacuum skin packaging equipment applies lidstock without generating any scrap, which must be recycled or landfilled. Seal quality is assured by continual monitoring of heat, pressure and dwell time. Quick, toolless changeover reduces changeover time to a range of five to 10 minutes. On one model, an onboard carrousel shortens changeover time by holding tooling for up to four formats. When it’s time to make a change, the next tool can be preheated to further shorten downtime. Changeover tooling also may be stored on wheeled carts.  Common options include date coders, labelers, online gas analyzers for MAP, tray denesters, portioning equipment, automatic tray loaders and extended product loading areas. Instead of flat lidstock some tray sealers can accommodate a dome or lidstock equipped with a valve. A domed lid makes it possible to package a product that extends above the flange of the container in a shelf-life-extending modified atmosphere. The valve permits in-pack cooking or steam heating. Another option is multi-compartment trays which allow product from one compartment to be used while the rest of the package remains completely sealed to maintain any modified atmosphere and product shelf life. NP Did you enjoy this article?

A 36-year-old Harrisville woman entered the store with a male and a child before taking alcohol and soda to the restroom. Michigan State Police said she consumed the items without paying for them.  After exiting the restroom, police say the woman contacted a store employee about submitting an application for employment.  When the employee attempted to assist the woman with the application process, the woman grabbed the employee by the hair and ordered the employee to give her the money in the register, police said. The register was empty. The male whom the woman entered the store with then removed her from the store. Police quickly identified and located the woman. She was arrested on charges of unarmed robbery and retail fraud. Police say it is possible she could also face an assault charge stemming from the hair-pulling. The suspect was lodged at the Alpena County Jail.

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. Business Analysis: Why Whole Foods is now struggling Why Whole Foods is now struggling On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) Caitlin DeweyWashington Post Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name — namely, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods Market. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. The problem is one that CEO John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, also have seen falling stock prices. "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt too. A multinational food company likely owns your favorite organic brand Peter Whoriskey One of the essential questions of the organic movement is, "What foods are worthy of the USDA 'organic' label?" The legal definition of the word is hammered down in semi-annual meetings, one of which was held last week, that involve a federal advisory board and people working in the organic industry.... One of the essential questions of the organic movement is, "What foods are worthy of the USDA 'organic' label?" The legal definition of the word is hammered down in semi-annual meetings, one of which was held last week, that involve a federal advisory board and people working in the organic industry.... (Peter Whoriskey) Wal-Mart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 — the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6 billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco — which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a 2-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods — an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity — can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Wal-Mart began selling organic Rice Krispies Treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges — but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

(AP) — Eight months later, Coastal Carolina’s surprise run to the national championship in its first College World Series appearance still resonates in eastern South Carolina. “It not only has changed our program, it’s changed our university,” coach Gary Gilmore said. “I’ve been here 21 years, and at no time have I seen groups of people so proud to wear our gear, put our sticker on their car. You go to Wal-Mart and there are 10 or 12 people walking around with our gear on where in the past it’s been all Clemson and South Carolina stuff.” All those new fans, along with the old ones, want to know what the Chanticleers will do for an encore. Coastal Carolina led the nation with 96 home runs last season, and players accounting for 79 of them are gone. Only three everyday players are back, but the weekend rotation returns, including CWS Most Outstanding Player Andrew Beckwith. So does star reliever Bobby Holmes. Some feds miss out on pay raise as salary compression worsens “The expectations are every bit equal to last year,” Gilmore said. “The way we have to go about it may be a little bit different as far as how we put our team together and what the team’s skill sets allow us to do. The goal is the same. It’s to get back to Omaha. The one thing I did find out is that if you get there, anything can happen.” Advertisement Seth Lancaster, who missed the CWS after getting hurt in super regionals, moves from second base to third. He hit seven home runs, most of any returning player. “We’re not going to hit 108 home runs,” Gilmore said, “but I think we’ll hit more than people give us credit for.” The Chanticleers plan to be more aggressive on the bases. Billy Cooke is back after stealing a team-leading 27 bases. The Chanticleers finished with 112, and Gilmore said this team should be capable of 150. Beckwith (15-1, 1.85 ERA) led the nation in wins, threw two complete games in the CWS and was the winner in the title-clinching victory against Arizona. Alex Cunningham (10-4, 3.62) and Jason Bilous (3-1, 4.43) are the other weekend starters. Holmes (7-2, 4.20) is the bullpen ace. Newcomers Wood Myers at second base, Jordan Gore at shortstop and Cory Wood in left field will join the lineup. Myers played at a junior college last season after spending two years at North Carolina, Gore transferred from South Carolina and Wood was one of the top high school players in North Carolina last year. The Chanticleers will play their first season in the Sun Belt Conference after moving from the Big South. “We can’t come out and play passive and say, ‘Hey, we did this last year so it’s going to be given to us,’ ” Beckwith said. “Everyone is going to (target) us. I think the Sun Belt is a little bit better competition, and our guys need to embrace it.” Some things to know: NEW COACHES There are 30 new head coaches in Division I. Most notable are David Pierce at Texas, Greg Goff at Alabama, Steve Bieser at Missouri, Nick Mingione at Kentucky, Travis Jewett at Tulane, Lane Burroughs at Louisiana Tech, Greg Lovelady at UCF and Mark Wasikowski at Purdue. MARQUESS’ FINALE Mark Marquess will retire after this season, his 41st at Stanford. He has 1,585 career wins, and his team is picked second behind Oregon State in the Pac-12. Marquess won national titles in 1987-88 and has led the Cardinal to the CWS 14 times, most recently in 2008. ACTIVE WINS LEADER Mike Martin, entering his 38th season at Florida State, takes over for Augie Garrido as the active career wins leader. Martin has 1,898. Garrido had an all-time record of 1,975 in 48 seasons. He coached the past 20 at Texas before being reassigned as special assistant to the athletic director last May. MORE OFFENSE The 2016 team average of 0.61 home runs per game was highest since 2010, team scoring of 5.57 runs a game was highest since 2011 and the team batting average of .275 was highest since 2012. The national fielding percentage of .967 was the best since at least 1970.

MUST WATCH H&R Block CEO: Trump is right about tax reform 02:33 Story highlights Tax policymaking entails a series of trade-offs, David M. Smick says Smick: If Trump delivers on tax reform, he'll have to make some hard political choices David M. Smick is chairman and CEO of the macroeconomic advisory firm Johnson Smick International and founder and editor of the International Economy magazine. His new book is "The Great Equalizer: How Main Street Capitalism Can Create an Economy for Everyone." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Facing fierce criticism from the right on fiscal policy, President Donald Trump has developed a new sense of urgency. In an interview last weekend with Fox's Bill O'Reilly, when asked if Americans should expect a tax cut this year, instead of saying something along the lines of "yes, absolutely," Trump offered the more restrained, "I think so ... before the end of the year. I would like to say yes." David M. Smick Such an expression of caution is unusual for the 45th President. Yet Thursday, Trump suddenly shifted gears, promising to announce a "phenomenal" tax reform proposal in an amazingly short two to three weeks. Reforming the tax code is likely to be far more politically complicated than the Trump officials, most of whom are new to Washington, think. As a congressional staff aide and later an outside adviser, I worked on both the 1981 and 1986 tax reform packages. The process of seeking a consensus was difficult and time-consuming. In the case of the 1986 tax reform, it took years to resolve some serious differences. Trump will face a similar challenge in a much more compressed time period. Announcements are easy to make. Actually enacting tax reform is a lot more difficult. How liberals should spend their Trump-gotten gains (opinion) The details of the President's plan have yet to be announced, but a rough outline exists. The outline largely reflects the House Republican tax reform plan. And the answer to two questions will likely determine the success of the overall effort: Read More First, will the Senate (and perhaps even some House Republicans) kill the House's proposal for a border adjustment tax (which produces an estimated $1.4 trillion in new revenue over 10 years, the amount roughly needed for Trump's infrastructure spending and military modernization)? The new proposed border-adjusted tax system would place a 20% tax on imports while eliminating the corporate income tax. It is being heavily attacked by US importers, Walmart, Koch Industries and foreign governments. Proponents argue that US companies, by not having to pay taxes on exports, would for the first time face a level playing field in tax policy relative to their global competition. Second, will the Senate accept the House's use of "dynamic scoring" in determining the budget implications of tax reform? Dynamic scoring assumes tax incentives have some effect in creating greater tax revenue. Critics charge that dynamic scoring is "funny math." Proponents use the analogy of a small business. "If you expand your sales budget by $100,000, you wouldn't expect sales revenues to stay the same," they argue. Is GOP really softening on Obamacare? (opinion) Here's why these questions are relevant: If dynamic scoring is accepted, tax reform will include the immediate expensing for tax purposes of all capital investment, a huge stimulus for business expansion. As one congressional leader told me, "If there is no dynamic scoring, expensing is out," because the static revenue loss (on paper) as a result of the stimulus would not comply with the 10-year budget restrictions previously set by Congress. By the same token, if there is no border adjustment tax, the Trump fiscal stimulus is likely to be significantly smaller than originally envisioned. US tax policy will change, but there may be nothing "phenomenal" about the final result. Making tax policymaking entails a series of trade-offs. If the choice is between a border adjustment tax versus Trump's reckless call for 35% or higher tariffs aimed at US trade competitors, the choice is clear. Tariffs would risk a global trade war and almost certain worldwide recession. The border adjustment alternative would likely be consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization and would not lead necessarily to trade retaliation. The US corporate tax system would not be dissimilar to the value-added tax systems used elsewhere in the world to the disadvantage of American companies. Wall tax idea on Mexico is illegal and would hurt US (Opinion) But here's the ultimate question: Is the President's call for tariffs the opening bid in an elaborate effort to strike a deal on a border adjustment tax he wanted all along? In other words, by threatening the world with tariffs, does the border adjustment tax (and its $1.4 trillion in new revenue) become the reasonable and safe alternative? Or is the new President not that clever? When all is said and done, one thing is certain about tax policy: All policy changes produce unintended economic and political consequences. That's why enacting a border adjustment tax is hardly a sure thing. Finally, there is the issue of Trump's promise of individual tax rate reduction. Some of the administration's economic advisers have suggested the personal tax reductions be separated from the corporate tax stimulus, with the personal tax code to be addressed at a later time. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook Here's the problem: More than 80% of businesses in the United States use so-called "pass-throughs" to pay their taxes -- proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S organizations that all pay their taxes using the personal income tax schedules. Unless these firms are part of the corporate tax reform plan, small businesses and startups, which are already at a disadvantage relative to large corporations because of the complexity of the tax code, will fall further behind. The upshot is that many Democrats in Congress are open to supporting a plan that reforms the inefficient corporate tax system. Few Democrats will support a plan for individual tax rate reduction. Here's the problem: Can a President who won by promising support for the Rust Belt's "forgotten man" really agree to a plan that delays tax rate cuts for the middle class and pushes fiscal stimulus for the corporate class?

Sears to cut $1 billion in costs, reduce debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion Reuters 9 hrs ago (…) Daniel Acker a 2013 photo shows shoppers walking toward a Sears store in Peoria, Ill. Getting long-struggling Sears to stop bleeding cash has been about as easy as closing the U.S. military prison in Cuba, according to Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo byu Daniel Acker. Sears Holdings Corp. said Friday that it would cut costs by $1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. The announcement sent the struggling retailer’s shares up by as much as 40 percent before settling at $6.96, up 26 percent. The company also said it had sold five Sears full-line stores and two Auto Centers for $72.5 million in January, and had engaged Eastdil Secured to raise at least $1 billion from the sale of its real estate. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has struggled with years of losses and declining sales as shoppers shift online or to rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. On Friday, the company estimated its sixth straight quarterly loss, with comparable store sales falling 10.3 percent during the all-important holiday selling season. Sears has spun off some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, put some brands on sale and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert’s hedge fund as part of efforts to cope with the slump. Under the latest plan, the company said it would consolidate Sears and Kmart’s corporate and support functions and improve product assortment at its stores. Some measures outlined on Friday, such as inventory management, monetizing real estate assets and using data generated from its Shop Your Way membership program to understand customer preferences, have been part of previous cost-cutting exercises. Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area See how St. Louis stocks are faring Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog The company also reaffirmed that it would close 150 stores. Sears did not specify if the latest cost-saving plan would involve job cuts. It was too early in the restructuring process to discuss potential staff reductions, a source close to the company said. Sears said it would use proceeds from asset sales, improving profitability and working capital management to reduce its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017. The company had pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $2 billion and long-term debt of $3.7 billion as of Oct. 29. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The investment adage that gold is a safe haven for investors in times of trouble is only a cliché because it remains to be true.  Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer at U.S. Global Investors, says investors are buying gold by relying on simple investment-related math, USA Today reported Holmes also explained that investors are also bracing for unsavory ripple effects if Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on U.S. trading partners like China hurts U.S. consumers by resulting in higher prices of imported goods sold at U.S. stores such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot. “The collateral damage could be massive to economic growth,” Holmes says. Holding gold – which does not pay interest – has become more attractive due to the combination of lower bond yields and higher inflation readings, Holmes told USA Today. “When the real interest rate -- the rate of interest on, say, a 5-year U.S. government bond minus inflation – shrinks or turns negative as it has done lately, investors tend to buy gold as they're not missing out on the yield benefit of bonds,” USA Today explained. Five reasons USA Today cited as to why savvy investors should continue to invest in gold: Economic policy uncertainty in the U.S. under President Trump. Political anxiety surrounding the populist movement in Europe and elsewhere. Ongoing stimulus from global central bankers. Angst over rising inflation. The U.S. dollar falling in value versus foreign currencies. However, not all economic gurus are in agreement about how buying gold fits into the brave new world of a Trump presidency. "We’ve seen some market strategists recommend owning gold in the event that Trump causes World War III. Unlike potassium iodide, gold isn’t an antidote to radiation exposure," Newsmax Finance Insider Ed Yardeni recently explained. "But it might provide great protection from a number of lesser calamities that Trump’s detractors believe he might cause, including a global trade war or a domestic civil war," Yardeni wrote. "Our new president has hit the ground running, but there’s probably more mud than he expected," Yardeni wrote. "Gold might rally if he stumbles badly. Or else it might rally because Trump’s policies boost economic growth, as he promised. If so, the rebound in commodity prices that started at the end of 2015 may continue." Dr. Ed Yardeni is the President of Yardeni Research, Inc., a provider of independent global investment strategy research. (Newsmax wire services contributed to this report).

In an interview last weekend with Fox’s Bill O’Reilly, when asked if Americans should expect a tax cut this year, instead of saying something along the lines of “yes, absolutely,” Trump offered the more restrained, “I think so … before the end of the year. I would like to say yes.” Such an expression of caution is unusual for the 45th President. Yet Thursday, Trump suddenly shifted gears, promising to announce a “phenomenal” tax reform proposal in an amazingly short two to three weeks. Reforming the tax code is likely to be far more politically complicated than the Trump officials, most of whom are new to Washington, think. As a congressional staff aide and later an outside adviser, I worked on both the 1981 and 1986 tax reform packages. The process of seeking a consensus was difficult and time-consuming. In the case of the 1986 tax reform, it took years to resolve some serious differences. Trump will face a similar challenge in a much more compressed time period. Announcements are easy to make. Actually enacting tax reform is a lot more difficult. The details of the President’s plan have yet to be announced, but a rough outline exists. The outline largely reflects the House Republican tax reform plan. And the answer to two questions will likely determine the success of the overall effort: First, will the Senate (and perhaps even some House Republicans) kill the House’s proposal for a border adjustment tax (which produces an estimated $1.4 trillion in new revenue over 10 years, the amount roughly needed for Trump’s infrastructure spending and military modernization)? The new proposed border-adjusted tax system would place a 20% tax on imports while eliminating the corporate income tax. It is being heavily attacked by US importers, Walmart, Koch Industries and foreign governments. Proponents argue that US companies, by not having to pay taxes on exports, would for the first time face a level playing field in tax policy relative to their global competition. Second, will the Senate accept the House’s use of “dynamic scoring” in determining the budget implications of tax reform? Dynamic scoring assumes tax incentives have some effect in creating greater tax revenue. Critics charge that dynamic scoring is “funny math.” Proponents use the analogy of a small business. “If you expand your sales budget by $100,000, you wouldn’t expect sales revenues to stay the same,” they argue. Here’s why these questions are relevant: If dynamic scoring is accepted, tax reform will include the immediate expensing for tax purposes of all capital investment, a huge stimulus for business expansion. As one congressional leader told me, “If there is no dynamic scoring, expensing is out,” because the static revenue loss (on paper) as a result of the stimulus would not comply with the 10-year budget restrictions previously set by Congress. By the same token, if there is no border adjustment tax, the Trump fiscal stimulus is likely to be significantly smaller than originally envisioned. US tax policy will change, but there may be nothing “phenomenal” about the final result. Making tax policymaking entails a series of trade-offs. If the choice is between a border adjustment tax versus Trump’s reckless call for 35% or higher tariffs aimed at US trade competitors, the choice is clear. Tariffs would risk a global trade war and almost certain worldwide recession. The border adjustment alternative would likely be consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization and would not lead necessarily to trade retaliation. The US corporate tax system would not be dissimilar to the value-added tax systems used elsewhere in the world to the disadvantage of American companies. But here’s the ultimate question: Is the President’s call for tariffs the opening bid in an elaborate effort to strike a deal on a border adjustment tax he wanted all along? In other words, by threatening the world with tariffs, does the border adjustment tax (and its $1.4 trillion in new revenue) become the reasonable and safe alternative? Or is the new President not that clever? When all is said and done, one thing is certain about tax policy: All policy changes produce unintended economic and political consequences. That’s why enacting a border adjustment tax is hardly a sure thing. Finally, there is the issue of Trump’s promise of individual tax rate reduction. Some of the administration’s economic advisers have suggested the personal tax reductions be separated from the corporate tax stimulus, with the personal tax code to be addressed at a later time. Here’s the problem: More than 80% of businesses in the United States use so-called “pass-throughs” to pay their taxes — proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S organizations that all pay their taxes using the personal income tax schedules. Unless these firms are part of the corporate tax reform plan, small businesses and startups, which are already at a disadvantage relative to large corporations because of the complexity of the tax code, will fall further behind. The upshot is that many Democrats in Congress are open to supporting a plan that reforms the inefficient corporate tax system. Few Democrats will support a plan for individual tax rate reduction. Here’s the problem: Can a President who won by promising support for the Rust Belt’s “forgotten man” really agree to a plan that delays tax rate cuts for the middle class and pushes fiscal stimulus for the corporate class?

Share on Facebook A A Report an Error Share via Email Print The Canadian Press A new townhouse complex is under construction in Toronto on Thursday, November 3, 2016. By: Staff Torstar News Service Published on There’s a housing supply shortage looming in the Toronto area. That’s the warning the head of the association for new home builders has been issuing every chance he gets in recent months. Even with a “making-it-happen attitude” it will take five to seven years to get the supply of new homes up to a healthy level again, said Bryan Tuckey of the Building and Land Development Association (BILD). The inventory of new homes for sale in the Toronto region has sunk to historic lows, he said. There are various reasons, including lengthy provincial approval times for water and waste water servicing that’s required before a single toilet can be flushed in a new neighbourhood. Figures from the Toronto Real Estate Board suggest a similar shortage exists on the resale market. People aren’t listing their homes because they worry about what they’ll be able to afford among the region’s soaring prices. If government and builders don’t figure something out soon, Toronto is heading down the road of cities like London and San Francisco, says Tuckey. “You have the most affluent parts of British society not being able to afford a home in London or in San Francisco where we see jobs being lost because people can’t afford to live in communities where they want to work and play and live,” he said. The census data released Wednesday reinforce his concerns, said Tuckey. It shows Toronto’s population grew 6.2 per cent between 2011 and 2016, above the national average of 5 per cent. But that growth was exceeded by several communities outside the city including Brampton, Caledon, King, Markham and Bradford. For the second consecutive census, Milton has proved to be the GTA town with the biggest boom. It registered 30 per cent population growth in the census period. “We talk a lot about Toronto, and still, about 65 to 70 per cent of the growth is going to be outside Toronto. Plus, it’s family oriented growth, so communities like Oakville, Brampton, Milton, Bradford, West Gwillimbury where growth was intended to happen,” said Tuckey. He’s not surprised that those families want what the industry calls ground-related homes — townhomes, semi-detached and detached houses. Some will happily sacrifice space for affordability. Tuckey calls townhomes the new single-family home even though they don’t usually have big yards for the kids to play. To get that ground-related property, many are moving outside the city to the booming 905-area communities. In Milton, three-storey stacked townhomes and the more traditional two-storey towns with basements are the highest demand category among home buyers, said Royal LePage agent Amy Flowers, whose business is flourishing in the town that now stands at a population of just over 110,000. Those homes run between $500,000 and $600,000 on average for about 1,200 square feet of living space. Toronto buyers in search of the holy grail of GTA housing are typically paying between about $750,000 and $800,000 for that detached house with a yard, said Flowers. “Our buyer demographic is interesting,” she said. “We’re one of the only towns in the country where our median age is actually going down.” In little more than a decade, the influx of families has transformed Milton. The old theatre has closed in favour of a multiplex near the highway. There’s a Wal-Mart. When Flowers moved into town about 15 years ago, it took about 10 minutes to drive across Milton. Now, with traffic, it is double that. When it comes to buying homes, Milton has its share of big-league competition. On Thursday there were only 68 freehold listings and eight condos listed on the TREB’s Multiple Listings Service for Milton. Of those, four of the houses and half the condos were already conditionally sold. Like Toronto, list prices have pretty much lost any bearing on the final sale amount and competitive offers are routine, said Flowers. Buyers, who often experience the disappointment of three or four unsuccessful home bids, need to go in firm on the set offer date, advised Flowers. Home inspections are nice but they’re not always possible, she said. If it all sounds familiar to Toronto’s property scene, Flowers concedes one difference: “We don’t have 30 offers on a house. We’ll have more like five.” But Milton has an edge over Toronto in that buyers don’t have to pay a municipal land transfer tax. As well, the federal government’s new mortgage stress test rules make it necessary for some to stretch their dollar by moving northwest of the city. It can be a long commute for downtown workers, but lots of couples use it as a halfway point between jobs in Mississauga-Brampton and Kitchener-Waterloo, she said. There is an influx of families moving in from Mississauga and Brampton, “looking for a nice safe place to raise their children,” said Milton councillor Colin Best. The growth has brought some benefits, including a new hospital that is expected to open in the fall, he noted. But the supply of homes for newcomers is dire. Best said he’s had realtors compare it the 1990s, before the population tripled. The town approved about 6,000 homes three years ago. They’ve only built 1,000. Of 11 zoning applications, only three developments are being built. Best said a lot of that is due to delays, development charges, appeals and labour turmoil in the building industry. Transportation is emerging as a big problem though. “I have people spending three hours a day commuting from Milton to Toronto,” said Best. While GO has increased the number of Milton trains, he is dismayed that Metrolinx says it will be 2041 before his community gets the all-day, two-way service being rolled out in the coming decade across much of the rest of the Toronto region. “Sixty-three per cent of Halton Region goes outside the region to work. That’s based on a previous census. It’s probably worse now. If you come to the Milton GO train, the parking lot is full by 7:30 a.m. Twenty-five per cent of (those GO riders) are coming from the west,” said Best. Don’t even get him started on the rush hour traffic on Highway 401. The youth of the community has its challenges too, he said. There was a community dispute among older residents and younger families about whether the town should install a splash pad at Dorset Park. “It was quite the divide,” said Best. While the province is rushing to build enough schools for the booming number of students in Milton, children are being bused and moved around in the transition. There are 16 kindergarten classes among four schools and at one point, consideration was being given to the idea of having one school just for kindergarten kids, said Best. “We’ve had clients who have had their kids in six different schools and sometimes the same household will have kids going to different schools,” said Flowers. It’s another reason to buy a resale home even though she acknowledges it’s in her best interest to say so. “If you buy a resale house, that has everything all sorted and figured out. You’ll know what school you’re going to,” she said. Besides, she adds, “If you’re buying new, you’re on a waiting list for a year to two years.” It’s just one more sign of the bifurcation of housing that has been happening in Toronto is also happening in the maturing communities surrounding the city, said Cherise Burda, executive director of the Ryerson City Building Institute. She favours the region’s sweeping transit expansion. But Burda says she wonders too if some of the billions of dollars should perhaps be invested in housing closer to the city. We have a choice, she said: We can build out or we can build up. Building up is costly. Land on the periphery is cheap and municipalities make it cheaper by subsidizing infrastructure to entice the development charges new builds bring to the community. The census just shows that sprawl is continuing and opportunities are being missed, she said. “The fact that those are the economic options for developers and for home buyers shows that we’re missing the types of policies to fix that,” she said. The region needs more of what’s called “the missing middle” — housing that falls somewhere between the highrise and the sprawl option. Before the war, families lived in flats downtown. It wasn’t until after the war that the automobile spurred sprawl. In Paris and Barcelona, mid-rise apartments are the norm for family living. “We’re going to buy the options we’re given,” said Burda. “We’re not building enough infill development, we’re not building enough townhouses and mid-rises — not just in downtown Toronto but also in suburban centres,” she said. “If we look at downtown Toronto, 75 per cent of people walk, cycle or take transit,” said Burda. The region would look very different and our lives would be better if we built homes that put people within easy access of transit and jobs. “There are all these plans for building houses in the periphery,” she said. “We have enough land to keep building ground level housing for decades to come. But is that going to serve a population that doesn’t want to drive to get to work?” Editors' Picks Video: The world's biggest aircraft ready to fly after crash-landing Air Canada goes vintage with total airline makeover Man stuck for hours in muddy pond with just his nose above the surface Video: Dog Wick sees John Wick's pup revenge-killing Most Popular ‘Settler, please:’ B.C.’s racist historical signs have got to go, argues archaeologist It’s clear now — The already-rich Trumps just want to get richer Pucker up: Halifax Mooseheads proving a little affection can go a long way Five people facing charges after loaded guns, drugs found in Cole Harbour residence Toronto Views More...

Customers Pam King and her son Rhys, 2, shop for organic groceries at Whole Foods Market Arroyo Parkway store in Pasadena, Calif. in this Nov. 7, 2007 file photo. While Whole Foods led the organic food craze in the U.S., mainstream grocery chains have jumped on board as more and more people began buying organic. Damian Dovarganes Associated Press i By Caitlin Dewey The Washington Post LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name - namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 5:03 Miami doctor 'removed from all clinical duties' following attack on Uber driver Pause 2:23 One arrest as protesters block DeVos from D.C. middle school 2:32 Melania Trump's focus as First Lady is to end cyberbullying 8:39 Boy Scouts executive: 'We have not lost our way' 2:41 Heat's Goran Dragic says there's only one other player in the league as versatile as James Johnson 2:30 Heat's James Johnson goes for season-high 26 points in win at Brooklyn 1:47 President Donald Trump's Guantánamo 2:08 Critics thrown out of the County Commission chambers 1:33 Dutch water-management expert advises on sea-level-rise in Miami 0:50 Dion Waiters speaks to media after last-second shot beats Golden State Warriors Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Do we live in one of America’s unhealthiest states?

(Natalie Fertig / McClatchy) In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than Millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. Walmart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 {mdash} the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 5:03 Miami doctor 'removed from all clinical duties' following attack on Uber driver Pause 2:23 One arrest as protesters block DeVos from D.C. middle school 2:32 Melania Trump's focus as First Lady is to end cyberbullying 8:39 Boy Scouts executive: 'We have not lost our way' 2:41 Heat's Goran Dragic says there's only one other player in the league as versatile as James Johnson 2:30 Heat's James Johnson goes for season-high 26 points in win at Brooklyn 1:47 President Donald Trump's Guantánamo 2:08 Critics thrown out of the County Commission chambers 1:33 Dutch water-management expert advises on sea-level-rise in Miami 0:50 Dion Waiters speaks to media after last-second shot beats Golden State Warriors Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email How to spot GMOs on your grocery store shelf Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an organization pushing for GMO labels on food packaging, shares some tips for finding items on grocery store shelves that contain genetically modified organisms (GMO). As Vice President of Government Affair By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco - which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods - an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity - can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Walmart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges - but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

Time Shoppers walk into Sears in Peabody, Mass. (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) 10 CONNECTTWEET 17 LINKEDIN 41 COMMENTEMAILMORE No one should celebrate the slow-motion demise of once-venerable retailer Sears Holdings, but it's been a long time since the department store was where America shopped. And because Sears and its sister company Kmart are merely shells of their former selves after they destroyed so much value over the years for employees, customers, and investors, there may be a group of stakeholders secretly hoping the end comes soon: shopping malls. Store closings: Macy's is closing these 68 stores Is your local Sears or Kmart among 150 stores to be axed? See the list What happens when Kmart and Macy's close? Anchored to the past Anchor stores were once the lifeblood of the shopping mall, drawing both customers and other tenants. But retail and the malls have changed a lot since then, and anchor stores today exist more in name only. Consumers are more likely to shop the smaller retailers in the mall than stop in at the big department stores. The chains themselves realize this, which is why they're closing down hundreds of stores. Macy's announced in August it would be closing 100 stores in early 2017, on top of the dozens of others it closed over the past few years. J.C. Penney has closed 74 stores over the past two years. Kohl's closed 18 stores in 2016. Walmart said a year ago it would be closing 154 stores in the U.S., though most were its small-footprint Express stores. Real estate information firm CoStar has estimated nearly 1 billion square feet of retail space will need to be "rationalized" over the next few years. This could take the form of store closures, conversion to another use, or "rent roll downs." CoStar has reported that annual department-store retail sales tumbled 28% from their peak in 1999 to 2015. Sales per square foot have reportedly fallen to $330 from $350 a decade ago and many retailers want to get a break on the rent they pay. Certainly, mall operators such as General Growth Properties, Simon Property Group, and Macerich might agree to rent reductions for some of their tenants to help them survive the transition of retail from physical locations to online -- some analysts estimate half of all retail sales may come from the online channel by 2030 -- but they might also be rooting for anchors like Sears Holdings to go bankrupt so they can rent the space for more money. Getting more Seritage Growth Properties, the real estate investment trust that Sears Holdings Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert created in 2015 to serve as the vehicle to help the retailer monetize its asset portfolio, is making a mint off the company's woes. The REIT is taking Sears stores and carving them up into smaller parcels and renting out the space to other retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, Petsmart, and outlet department stores such as Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th. But where a Sears or Kmart store paid bargain-basement rents of just $4.39 per square foot, it's turning around and jacking the rents up on the new tenants. According to the REIT's last quarterly SEC filing, Seritage is getting rent that averages $12.24 per square foot, while on the most recent leases it's signed with tenants who haven't yet moved in -- some 55 leases in all -- it is getting $19.25 per square foot. Sears is also doing that with some of its stores, leasing out space to third-party retailers, and Macy's has entered into a strategic alliance with Brookfield Asset Management to map out a "predevelopment plan" for half of the 100 stores it will be closing. Don't let the door hit you on the way out This was obviously a good deal for Seritage, but it does come with substantial risk because the REIT's operations are predicated on Sears' continuing to exist and pay it rent, which it uses to finance its redevelopment projects. A bankruptcy by the retailer could cause the whole strategy to implode. Not necessarily so with the malls that Sears and Kmart occupy. While a Sears Holdings bankruptcy might lead malls to suddenly face the prospect of being flooded with zombie retail space, they would have the chance to redevelop the stores themselves and attract new tenants who would pay them, and not Seritage, significantly higher rents. Of course, a Sears Holdings bankruptcy carries risks for them, too. As noted, many retailers are reducing their footprints, not expanding them, so filling up the space may not be so simple, and for malls not in desirable locations, Sears Holdings' demise could be catastrophic. Credit Suisse says some 184 malls can be classified as "least valuable property" -- meaning at risk of shutting down -- and, concernedly, Sears is the anchor store in 110 of them. A Sears Holdings bankruptcy and the wave of store closings that would follow could very well jeopardize their existence. Even so, Seritage reports that its stores enjoy a 99.3% occupancy rate. Of course, that's because most of the properties are still occupied by Sears, but its experience demonstrates there is pent-up demand for the retailer's vacated stores. In fact, in 31 properties, Seritage has joint venture agreements with the mall operators themselves, so they're already realizing some of the benefits from Sears Holdings' slow death. An orderly exit would likely produce the best result for everyone involved, but if Sears Holdings' precarious financial situation finally overwhelms it, you might not find as many mall operators lamenting the outcome as expected.

Special to the Reporter-HeraldJosh and Zora Tabin, owners of Loveland-based Wild Zora Foods, talk with a panel of experts during the filming of the “Hatched” TV show. The episode featuring Wild Zora is airing in February where the show is available. An all-natural meat-and-veggie snack manufactured in downtown Loveland is getting a tryout with the Walmart system. Wild Zora Foods, which makes healthy, high-protein bars that are gluten-, milk-, soy-, nut-free and added-sugar free, was recently featured on the nationally syndicated TV show “Hatched.” The program connects entrepreneurs with mentors, investors and corporate bigwigs. As a result of their appearance on “Hatched” this month, Wild Zora owners Josh and Zora Tabin popped onto the radar of the world’s largest retailer and will get an audition to get their products on Sam’s Club shelves. The couple will give presentations at Sam’s Club stores for 20 days, and if they sell enough Wild Zora bars, “then there’s a bigger conversation,” Josh Tabin said. The mom-and-pop operation launched less than three years ago after Zora Tabin worked to create a snack for their two young children that didn’t contain grains and added sugar. The bars are made from just meat, vegetables, a little fruit and some spices, mixed and dehydrated into healthful snacks. The bars are easier to chew than jerky and don’t have added chemicals. They come in flavors such as chili beef bars with kale, apricot and cayenne pepper and curry masala turkey bars with spinach, dates and cardamom. Two new flavors have been submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval: pork taco and apple pork. Wild Zora bars are sold in more than 700 stores.

(View our Privacy Policy) We'll help to figure out what in the world is going on By Douglas L. McElhaney, special to the Tampa Bay Times DOUGLAS L. MCELHANEYTampa Bay Times Friday, February 10, 2017 11:51am Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next Editor's note: In advance of this week's fifth annual St. Petersburg Conference on World Affairs, several of the experts who will participate have written essays for today's Perspective about key areas of concern: Russia, Turkey, the European Union and the Mideast, among them. Related News/Archive 3M, others figuring out what makes millennial workers tick 5 Months Ago The atmosphere has hit a grim milestone — and scientists say we'll never go back 'within our lifetimes' 8 Months Ago We can help shape how we look, despite genetics 7 Months Ago Frustration has grown with years of political stalemate in Washington. So America elected a political outsider who brazenly calls for America First. President Donald Trump wants to bring back manufacturing jobs and make the Europeans pay for their own defense. The establishment has been dealt a severe blow, and the little guy — not just the American variant — wants results. Unsure of our nation's trajectory, we may need some answers, and fast. But tweets are not policy, and a complicated animal like our many-tentacled government needs a road map. To help understand what in the world is going on, join us this week at the fifth annual St. Petersburg Conference on World Affairs. (See box on page 4P for details.) As demonstrators protest new immigration bans, let's remember how Congress in 1925 severely restricted southern and eastern Europeans ­— because they were getting too numerous and didn't really seem "American." Jews prior to World War II had little hope of making it to New York harbor. Times are changing. Drive across Florida or go to a building site and you will see, or — actually — hear a new America in the non-English languages being spoken. Go to Walmart and note that the cheapest products are produced in low-wage countries. Some might recall hearing that "what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa." Should we punish big American multinationals who move overseas to produce goods more cheaply? Should we try to thwart the basic economics we learned in school that lower trade barriers and freer movement of labor means cheaper products for everyone? Calls to take back our country are not unique to the United States. They are heard across the Atlantic. The majority of British voters have directed their government to exit the European Union. The French people may elect Marine Le Pen as their next president. She calls for severe restrictions on immigration and breaking out of regulatory regimes written in Brussels. The left-wing populist Podemos Party in Spain and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement in Italy (co-founded by a comic-turned-politician) want something new and less complicated. Meantime, conservative Polish and Hungarian leaders bristle at accepting the more secular mores of their West European partners. All the while, refugee flows snake through the Balkans toward the wealthiest societies of Europe, where (sometimes) jobs await. Is the new normal now the globalists vs. the protectors of national sovereignty? Is Vladimir Putin really up for a reset of relations with the United States? The last administration tried and it didn't work. Perhaps we can find common ground with Russia on issues like terrorism, but Moscow does things differently, owing to its very different history. Russian government is non-representative, and when Muslims revolt within their borders, Moscow ruthlessly suppresses them. The economy is a kleptocrat's dream, operating through informal and non-transparent channels to the advantage of the ruling clique. Russian foreign policy is to crush revolt in Syria, destabilize Ukraine and take back (as they say) the Crimea. Speaking of the new normal, will our tried and true NATO alliance uphold its treaty obligation to the Baltic states and others to resist Russian aggression? Turkey, a formidable military power within NATO, is moving less toward Europe and more toward the Middle East. Will the most successful military alliance in history implode or recoil in the face of external aggression? If you trust our intelligence agencies, Russia indirectly intervened in our elections. America and China have the capacity to use their own cyber might to disrupt adversaries. It may not be a problem for authoritarian-controlled societies, but we still-free Yanks want to know what business or what government agency is scooping up our emails, online history and consumer preferences. Privacy and national security need to be carefully balanced. How we receive and evaluate information in the age of "false news" is a conundrum. No more editors, fewer newspapers and lots of Internet trolls and hackers with malevolent agendas. And the sticky issues that refuse to go away — like Iran and Afghanistan and Syria. Does America have the right or obligation to intervene in cases of gross human rights violations? Self-interest? And what's the end point? Colin Powell, the secretary of state who coined the Pottery Barn rule — "you break it, you own it" — told us to get in and get out. Overextend in the Middle East and you land smack in the middle of the conflicting interests of friends and foes alike. Since our direct interventions in the region, the agents of religious-based excess and tyrants whose only limitation is a shortage of means to eliminate opposition have savagely dispensed of the Arab Spring. And then there is the only true democracy in the region — Israel — which seems to have given up on negotiation with its unruly neighbors. So. Let's throw in the towel and move to Canada, eh? Often our northern neighbors are taken for granted, but they are a major reason we don't have to worry about our shared border. Increasingly, we ask ourselves how we can be so similar and yet be so different. On the world stage, Canada plays the conciliator and we the protector. Conversely, our neighbor Cuba could not be more radically different. How are we doing after a year of renewed relations? Just outside the NAFTA trade area is Central America, where countries still get pneumonia when America coughs. Since the convulsive wars of the 1980s, we hope against hope that the Americans retiring down there will find sunnier and more stable climes. But will they? And what do we make of phenomena like the Panamanian law firm of Mossack Fonseca, revealed by the massive leak called the Panama Papers to enable tax avoidance and evasion around the world? Is this an anomaly or accepted means of hiding assets from the taxman? Farther away, when we hear about distress and chaos in Gambia or South Sudan or Somalia, it seems as though all of Africa is going up in flames. Is there another, more modern Africa that Western news sources don't care to cover? Closer to home, at our conference we'll ask some folks new to our shores how it feels to be an immigrant. And because our own self-worth seems to be so deeply ingrained in our various identities, we'll talk about politics and different interest groups like LGTBQ, out-of-work coal miners, women and racial and ethnic minorities. There will be educators on hand to talk about how education and ideas flow more freely across national boundaries in the cyber age. Similarly, the art world, once the exclusive bailiwick of booking agents, galleries and museums, has become truly more democratic and multicultural. But is the best of it still the property of the wealthy few? We live, as the ancient (and probably apocryphal) Chinese curse put it, in interesting times. Come to our conference and serve your interest in these times.

Realtor Amy Flowers, of Royal LePage, is a long-time resident of Milton.  (Rene Johnston / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Tess KalinowskiReal Estate Reporter Fri., Feb. 10, 2017 There’s a housing supply shortage looming in the Toronto area. That’s the warning the head of the association for new home builders has been issuing every chance he gets in recent months. Even with a “making-it-happen attitude” it will take five to seven years to get the supply of new homes up to a healthy level again, said Bryan Tuckey of the Building and Land Development Association (BILD). The inventory of new homes for sale in the Toronto region has sunk to historic lows, he said. There are various reasons, including lengthy provincial approval times for water and waste water servicing that’s required before a single toilet can be flushed in a new neighbourhood.

People aren’t listing their homes because they worry about what they’ll be able to afford among the region’s soaring prices. If government and builders don’t figure something out soon, Toronto is heading down the road of cities like London and San Francisco, says Tuckey. “You have the most affluent parts of British society not being able to afford a home in London or in San Francisco where we see jobs being lost because people can’t afford to live in communities where they want to work and play and live,” he said. The census data released Wednesday reinforce his concerns, said Tuckey. It shows Toronto’s population grew 6.2 per cent between 2011 and 2016, above the national average of 5 per cent. But that growth was exceeded by several communities outside the city including Brampton, Caledon, King, Markham and Bradford. For the second consecutive census, Milton has proved to be the GTA town with the biggest boom. It registered 30 per cent population growth in the census period. “We talk a lot about Toronto, and still, about 65 to 70 per cent of the growth is going to be outside Toronto. Plus, it’s family oriented growth, so communities like Oakville, Brampton, Milton, Bradford, West Gwillimbury where growth was intended to happen,” said Tuckey. He’s not surprised that those families want what the industry calls ground-related homes — townhomes, semi-detached and detached houses. Some will happily sacrifice space for affordability. Tuckey calls townhomes the new single-family home even though they don’t usually have big yards for the kids to play. To get that ground-related property, many are moving outside the city to the booming 905-area communities. In Milton, three-storey stacked townhomes and the more traditional two-storey towns with basements are the highest demand category among home buyers, said Royal LePage agent Amy Flowers, whose business is flourishing in the town that now stands at a population of just over 110,000. Those homes run between $500,000 and $600,000 on average for about 1,200 square feet of living space. Toronto buyers in search of the holy grail of GTA housing are typically paying between about $750,000 and $800,000 for that detached house with a yard, said Flowers. “Our buyer demographic is interesting,” she said. “We’re one of the only towns in the country where our median age is actually going down.” In little more than a decade, the influx of families has transformed Milton. The old theatre has closed in favour of a multiplex near the highway. There’s a Wal-Mart. When Flowers moved into town about 15 years ago, it took about 10 minutes to drive across Milton. Now, with traffic, it is double that. When it comes to buying homes, Milton has its share of big-league competition. On Thursday there were only 68 freehold listings and eight condos listed on the TREB’s Multiple Listings Service for Milton. Of those, four of the houses and half the condos were already conditionally sold. Like Toronto, list prices have pretty much lost any bearing on the final sale amount and competitive offers are routine, said Flowers. ▶ Data from the 2016 census shows Canada is the fastest growing country in the G7. Here's a look at some of the census numbers, which show the country's population is up to 35.15 million as of last year.(The Canadian Press ) Buyers, who often experience the disappointment of three or four unsuccessful home bids, need to go in firm on the set offer date, advised Flowers. Home inspections are nice but they’re not always possible, she said. If it all sounds familiar to Toronto’s property scene, Flowers concedes one difference: “We don’t have 30 offers on a house. We’ll have more like five.” But Milton has an edge over Toronto in that buyers don’t have to pay a municipal land transfer tax. As well, the federal government’s new mortgage stress test rules make it necessary for some to stretch their dollar by moving northwest of the city. It can be a long commute for downtown workers, but lots of couples use it as a halfway point between jobs in Mississauga-Brampton and Kitchener-Waterloo, she said. There is an influx of families moving in from Mississauga and Brampton, “looking for a nice safe place to raise their children,” said Milton councillor Colin Best. The growth has brought some benefits, including a new hospital that is expected to open in the fall, he noted. But the supply of homes for newcomers is dire. Best said he’s had realtors compare it the 1990s, before the population tripled. The town approved about 6,000 homes three years ago. They’ve only built 1,000. Of 11 zoning applications, only three developments are being built. Best said a lot of that is due to delays, development charges, appeals and labour turmoil in the building industry. Transportation is emerging as a big problem though. “I have people spending three hours a day commuting from Milton to Toronto,” said Best. While GO has increased the number of Milton trains, he is dismayed that Metrolinx says it will be 2041 before his community gets the all-day, two-way service being rolled out in the coming decade across much of the rest of the Toronto region. “Sixty-three per cent of Halton Region goes outside the region to work. That’s based on a previous census. It’s probably worse now. If you come to the Milton GO train, the parking lot is full by 7:30 a.m. Twenty-five per cent of (those GO riders) are coming from the west,” said Best. Don’t even get him started on the rush hour traffic on Highway 401. The youth of the community has its challenges too, he said. There was a community dispute among older residents and younger families about whether the town should install a splash pad at Dorset Park. “It was quite the divide,” said Best. While the province is rushing to build enough schools for the booming number of students in Milton, children are being bused and moved around in the transition. There are 16 kindergarten classes among four schools and at one point, consideration was being given to the idea of having one school just for kindergarten kids, said Best. “We’ve had clients who have had their kids in six different schools and sometimes the same household will have kids going to different schools,” said Flowers. It’s another reason to buy a resale home even though she acknowledges it’s in her best interest to say so. “If you buy a resale house, that has everything all sorted and figured out. You’ll know what school you’re going to,” she said. Besides, she adds, “If you’re buying new, you’re on a waiting list for a year to two years.” It’s just one more sign of the bifurcation of housing that has been happening in Toronto is also happening in the maturing communities surrounding the city, said Cherise Burda, executive director of the Ryerson City Building Institute. She favours the region’s sweeping transit expansion. But Burda says she wonders too if some of the billions of dollars should perhaps be invested in housing closer to the city. We have a choice, she said: We can build out or we can build up. Building up is costly. Land on the periphery is cheap and municipalities make it cheaper by subsidizing infrastructure to entice the development charges new builds bring to the community. The census just shows that sprawl is continuing and opportunities are being missed, she said. “The fact that those are the economic options for developers and for home buyers shows that we’re missing the types of policies to fix that,” she said. The region needs more of what’s called “the missing middle” — housing that falls somewhere between the highrise and the sprawl option. Before the war, families lived in flats downtown. It wasn’t until after the war that the automobile spurred sprawl. In Paris and Barcelona, mid-rise apartments are the norm for family living. “We’re going to buy the options we’re given,” said Burda. “We’re not building enough infill development, we’re not building enough townhouses and mid-rises — not just in downtown Toronto but also in suburban centres,” she said. “If we look at downtown Toronto, 75 per cent of people walk, cycle or take transit,” said Burda. The region would look very different and our lives would be better if we built homes that put people within easy access of transit and jobs. “There are all these plans for building houses in the periphery,” she said. “We have enough land to keep building ground level housing for decades to come. But is that going to serve a population that doesn’t want to drive to get to work?” Read more about: Brampton, Census Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette The 1788 Pub in the new Whole Foods market that opened in Upper St. Clair last month. By Craig Giammona / Bloomberg News Whole Foods Market Inc., facing its worst sales slump in more than a decade, is taking a step that would have been unthinkable in its high-flying days: shrinking the size of the chain. Though Whole Foods plans to open six stores during the current quarter, including two relocations, the company said Wednesday that it’s shutting down nine. That kind of retrenchment hasn’t happened since the last recession was underway in 2008. The company, which about 440 U.S. stores including three in the Pittsburgh area -—in East Liberty, Wexford and Upper St. Clair — also said it was abandoning its ambitious growth target and no longer plans to reach 1,200 locations as it tries to get expenses under control. Six straight quarters of declining same-store sales -- a closely watched measure -- have forced the organic-food grocer to tighten its belt. Whole Foods also gave a forecast for the current year that offered little hope of a quick recovery. “This is a company that owned the space for a long time, but there’s way too much competition now,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They’ve done several things to try and drive sales, and it’s just not working.” The 1788 Pub in the new Whole Foods market that opened in Upper St. Clair last month. (Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette) Same-store sales dropped 2.4 percent last quarter, worse than the 1.7 percent decrease predicted by analysts. The company now expects sales on that basis to decline as much as 2.5 percent this year, compared with an earlier forecast that was closer to break-even. “People were hoping there would be some improvement,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a bit concerning there’s not a reversal happening there.” Whole Foods has struggled to ward off competition from mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, which began offering more organic fare in recent years. And a bout of food deflation has put additional pressure on the entire industry. Some on Wall Street have been pushing Whole Foods to rein in its growth plans, and the store plan was received warmly. The stock gained 2 percent percent to $29.91 at 10:02 a.m. in New York on Thursday. Prior to the drop, it was down 4.7 percent in 2017. Responsibility for the turnaround is now squarely on John Mackey, a co-founder of the company who retook sole leadership last year. He had served as co-chief executive officer with Walter Robb until November. He has an uphill fight ahead. Same-store sales declined 3.2 percent in the current quarter through Feb. 5, a sign its troubles are worsening. The Austin, Texas-based company also said it would no longer be reporting quarter-to-date figures in future reports, meaning investors will have less to go on. Whole Foods’ struggles have fueled speculation that an activist investor could take on the chain, and one of its largest shareholders is said to have to discussed agitating for sweeping changes. For years, Whole Foods offered products that were tough to find elsewhere, and the shares gave investors exposure to the fast-growing market for organic and natural food. But that advantage has eroded in recent years. With sales growth stagnating last year, Whole Foods announced $300 million in cost cuts. But the company is still ramping up spending elsewhere, including on marketing and technology, and that’s expected to offset the cutbacks. It also introduced a new store concept last year aimed at younger, budget-conscious consumers. So far, only three of the locations -- dubbed 365 by Whole Foods Market -- have opened on the West Coast. The company announced on Wednesday that it has signed leases for new 365 stores in Brooklyn, New York, and Oakland, California. The new concept, named after the company’s private-label brand, is seen as a way for Whole Foods to connect with shoppers who perceive the chain’s conventional stores as too pricey. Whole Foods considered turning some of the stores it was closing into 365 locations, but it wasn’t practical, Mackey said. In some cases the company wanted to “thin out” its presence in a particular market, with the hope that it benefits Whole Foods locations nearby. Some of the stores had leases coming up in 2017, and management decided to accelerate the process and close them now. The decision to shutter the nine stores will help boost profits and comparable sales, Mackey said on a conference call. The company is taking a more disciplined approach to growth but still has 80 stores in the pipeline, he said. “We cleaned up the stores we needed to clean up for the time being, and we’re looking forward to moving forward,” Mackey said.

We have you covered. Here are some of the month's notable stories so far, in case you missed it... Thanks for the Memories Crews began the demolition process Monday on Madison Square Mall. It won't be quick, either -- it's scheduled to take up to six months. The main part of the mall closed last year, and Sears and JC Penney vacated within the last week. The once-crowded property is expected to draw large crowds again when the MidCity Huntsville development officially opens. That could be by the end of this year. Here's a live look at the demolition as it began... Taking Action, Getting Results A Lawrence County woman wrote to us asking for help with a home remodeling project.  She hired a contractor who started the job but left her living in the middle of a construction zone.  Kimberly Clemons is legally blind and feared the contractor had walked away from the job. The first time we saw Mrs. Clemons' house, there was wiring hanging out of the walls, open holes in the floors, lumber stacked in one room, and unfinished flooring in the rest of the house.  This posed a serious hazard for Clemons, who gets around based on her memory of where everything is. The kitchen consisted of a toaster oven, hot plate and small microwave sitting on a folding table. Her kitchen appliances were in the yard. She says her central heating system quit working because of all of the construction dust. Mrs. Clemons and her husband, Robert, restored their old double wide once. It's where they lived together for more than 20 years. "He was a good man," Kimberly said.  "I never had no trouble. He gave me anything I wanted. He would turn over in his grave right now if he knew what was going on. It's so sad." "We'll see if we can get it fixed. Alright?" Al Whitaker said. "Alright," Kimberly replied. Here's what happened when Al Whitaker called the contractor in question... Please enable Javascript to watch this video The "Sock Capital" Once More? Walmart has announced plans to begin purchasing supplies from Renfro Corporation, a local company based in Fort Payne. Walmart says it will begin to source materials from American-based companies like Renfro Corporation in an effort to invest in U.S. manufacturing. Renfro Corporation meanwhile, believes the investments will create around 442 jobs in textile manufacturing, namely by providing Walmart with athletic socks. Could this be the start of something great for the former "sock capital" of the world?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Struggling retailer Sears Holdings Corp. reported a 10.3 percent drop in comparable store sales for the holiday quarter, and said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Shares of the company (SHLD), which has been struggling with years of losses and falling sales, were up 39 percent at $7.70 in premarket trading on Friday. The company - controlled by its billionaire chief executive, Edward Lampert - announced a new plan to cut costs by at least $1 billion in 2017 by reducing overhead, improving merchandise at its stores and through better inventory management. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has lost its standing as customers move to online shopping or rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. To cope with the slump, Sears has cut costs, spun off some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, raised debt from Lampert's hedge fund and put some brands on sale. The company has, however, failed to turn a profit in more than a year and said in December there was no guarantee when it would return to profitability. Sears said on Friday it sold five Sears full-line stores and two Sears Auto Centers for $72.5 million in January and engaged Eastdil Secured to raise at least $1 billion from the sale of its real estate. The retailer said last month it sold its lawn and garden equipment brand, Craftsman, to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Sears said it would use proceeds from these sales, improving profitability and working capital management to reduce its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017. The company had pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $2 billion as of Oct. 29. Sears also estimated revenue of $6.1 billion and a loss of $535-$635 million in the fourth quarter ended January. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

City Attorney Trey Smith said the suit was filed in Pope County Circuit Court by Landers Holding LLC. They are represented by attorney Stephen R. Giles, who also represented Wal-Mart when the Neighborhood Market referendum was approved by voters. Smith said the developers are asking for an injunction from setting, ordering or conducting a special election, scheduled for May 9. Not only does Landers LLC want the referendum set aside, they are also asking that the act passed in 2015 by the Arkansas General Assembly to be declared unconstitutional and invalid. The act increased the time petitioners had to gather signatures for a referendum from 30 to 60 days. According to Giles, the court should rule that the city's 1998 ordinance, which stated petitioners have 30 days to file their required number of signatures, should be upheld. In that case, Marina Road residents did not submit their signatures in time. Smith said that state law supersedes local law, and the Marina Road residents had 60 days and submitted 1,347 signatures to City Clerk Kathy Collins in time. She certified 960, two more than the 958 needed, to go on with the election. Giles filed the complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against Russellville Mayor Randy Horton, City Clerk Kathy Collins, members of the City Council in their official capacity as elected officials and the Pope County Election Commission in their official capacity, Smith said. The city has 30 days to file an answer. Giles said the developers asked for an expedited hearing. The complaint was filed in the court of Circuit Judge Dennis Sutterfield. The Election Commission previously set the deadline to register to vote for the referendum for April 10. Early voting will begin May 2 and be conducted at the Election Commission headquarters at 1509 E. Main St., Suite 7 from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and the Monday before the election on Tuesday, May 9. Hours on election day will be from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Election Commission headquarters. The ballot for the special election will ask voters to repeal Ordinance 2260 or vote against the repeal of 2260. If a majority of the voters vote for the repeal of the ordinance, that will repeal the ordinance and not allow the rezoning of the property from R-1 to PUD. If a majority votes against the repeal of the ordinance, that will affirm the ordinance and allow the rezoning and the project could continue. Ordinance 2260 rezoned property on Marina Road to planned unit development (PUD) from residential and was approved by the Planning Commission and City Council. The rezoning was requested by Landers Holding LLC, who want to build The Arbors of Russellville, a 75-bed resort-style facility on a 20-acre lot and a 16-room memory care unit and independent garden homes.

State on top, entering stretch run Salisbury girls crush North Rowan, 54-10 Police: Report of suspicious activity leads to drug, other charges By Shavonne Walker Email the author | twitter Published 10:46 am Friday, February 10, 2017 Charged Trent Earnhardt By Shavonne Walker shavonne.walker@salisburypost.com SALISBURY — Police officials say a call about suspicious people standing around vehicles in the Walmart parking lot led to a seizure of heroin, pills and other items and the arrest of a Salisbury man. Someone called 911 about seeing two vehicles in the parking lot with two white males standing in front of them smoking, said Police Capt. Shelia Lingle. A police officer checked the license plate on one of the vehicles and the name registered to it was Trent Earnhardt. The officer noted Earnhardt had been banned from the store. The officer stopped the men just before they went inside and searched them. Earnhardt, 21, of the 600 block of Playground Lane, was charged with misdemeanor carry concealed weapons, felony possession of heroin, misdemeanor possession of schedule III controlled substance (buprenorphrine hydrochloride, a drug used to treat opioid addiction), misdemeanor possession of a controlled schedule IV (alprazolam or Xanax), misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia and misdemeanor second-degree trespassing. Lingle said Earnhardt had a pill container that had pills inside, a lighter, two syringes, a metal spoon, and metallic knuckles. Police said a hard brown substance believed to be heroin was found in a plastic bag. She said Earnhardt told officials the heroin was marijuana, but officers didn’t believe him. Earnhardt has since been released from the Rowan County Detention Center after posting a $3,000 secured bond.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive A column without any politics at all Friday Feb 10, 2017 at 9:22 AM TURNABOUT: A mere year ago, it was nothing but wine and roses. Puppy dogs. The smell of freshly-baked bread. Money in the bank, and six-pack abs. Dave SimpsonFormer Pekin Times Publisher TURNABOUT: A mere year ago, it was nothing but wine and roses. Puppy dogs. The smell of freshly-baked bread. Money in the bank, and six-pack abs. Perfection. Total vindication. Proof positive of unquestioned galactic superiority. Confetti descending from the rafters. The football team I root for every year was the undisputed champion. Best in the world, the solar system, and our neck of the Milky Way. Top of the heap. That day, there was nothing in the history of mankind better than being a fan of the football team for which I root. That was then. This, sadly, is now. There is a new best and undisputed champion of the solar system, as of Sunday. The wine and roses, puppy dogs, the freshly-baked bread, and the six-pack abs now reside in New England. Some folks can't even remember last year's greatest team in the history of mankind. Our big day is discarded, forgotten, and perfection in every way is a mere memory. Enjoy your moment in the sun, Patriot fans. Because – take it from a Bronco fan - even after proving your total galactic superiority, the garbage still has to go out when the chicken wrapper starts to smell bad, old joints still ache in the morning, and tax time is almost upon us. Even for the fans of world champions. Your team winning the Super Bowl is kind of like scoring the closest-in parking space at Walmart. It's nice, maybe even worth mentioning at dinner, but it's a fleeting victory. They do this Super Bowl deal every year, and chances are the confetti will be falling on some other best team in the history of the universe in a mere 12 months. THIS IS CRAZY: I catch myself trying to score the closest-in parking space every day when I go to exercise, and I'm curiously happy when the space closest to the door is available. I pay good money to trot on a treadmill for a half hour, then ride on an exercise bike for an hour, sweating copiously in the name of fitness and good health. But, subconsciously, I can't stand the thought of walking an extra 25 yards across the parking lot. Go figure. I MISS IDOL: I don't know about you, but I miss “American Idol.” Every year at this time, a couple evenings a week, The Wife and I would sit down in front of the TV and watch “American Idol.” She was a fan from the beginning, but I was a late adopter. I couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, so I don't think it was necessarily the singing that attracted me. No, it was the incredible enthusiasm of those thousands of young people, risking probable defeat and sometimes humiliation, to make a dream come true. In a world full of young people all too often hardened by skepticism, cynicism, and even anger at perceived promises not fulfilled, it was wonderful to see youngsters so head-over-heels excited to pursue a nearly-impossible dream. Cold February nights aren't the same without “Idol.” SAY AGAIN?: A relative used the term “husband ears” recently when telling The Wife about her husband perhaps not hanging with eager anticipation upon her every word. This reminded me of the old guy at exercise who sometimes wears a t-shirt that says, “My wife says I don't pay attention to her. Or something like that...” The challenge of hanging with eager anticipation upon a spouse's every word can be difficult after, in our case, over 30 years. We've both heard each others' favorite stories hundreds of times. (My favorite: The property taxes on my land in the mountains came to $7.28 a year before I built my cabin. The punch line: “And they let me pay it in two installments!”) I love that story, but if The Wife is around, I can't tell it, because I can see her lips moving, and her eyes rolling, when I get to the punch line. What with ears that don't hear like they used to, and loved ones who sometimes mumble, and the proclivity to retell golden oldie stories, I think it's overly simplistic to chalk this phenomenon up solely to “Spouse Ears.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Western Illinois Family Magazine Online Forms Archives Submit News Weather Coupons Market Place Regional Classifieds Illinois Auctions Classifieds Place An Ad Cars Boats Magazine Schools Info Canton Schools Cuba Schools Lewistown Schools Spoon River Valley Schools Schools Info Public Notice Illinois Farmington Schools VIT Schools Astoria Schools Avon Schools Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

McDonald's just introduced a new snow crab salad sandwich at four San Francisco Bay Area locations. The new dish features crab meat mixed with celery and seasoned mayo on romaine lettuce and tomato, on a sourdough bun. On the East Coast, McDonald's offers a seasonal lobster salad sandwich.

Pizza Hut U.K. is betting on it. The company has just launched two new pizzas with craft beer-infused pizza dough. There are two flavors-- Steak Feast– topped with a three-cheese blend, shaved steak, mushrooms, caramelised onions and a spring onion garnish served on a beer BBQ sauce; and the vegetarian American Hot topped with three-cheeses, sweetcorn, mushrooms, caramelised onions, jalapenos and a spring onion garnish served on a beer BBQ sauce.

The seasonal Kisses are a creamy orange color and taste, well, like carrot cake.  Hershey says just as the taste of Valentine's Day are red velvet cake, so should carrot cake be the taste of Easter.  Not so, say purists, who reject the idea that Americans to associate Carrot Cake Kisses with spring the way pumpkin spice lattes have become associated with fall.  carrot-cake-hershey’s-kiss- Break me off a piece of that 24 karat gold Kit Kat bar.

KFC China just unveiled a duo of chicken sandwiches: a black diamond bacon spicy chicken leg burger and a rose cheese roasted chicken leg burger. We're not sure what a rose-flavored burger tastes like-- and neither are some of the confused tasters in China. The chicken chain is reportedly experimenting with new items after facing declining sales in the country.  (KFC China) kfc-china-unveils-pink-chicken-burger The Chizza from KFC Philippines Move over Napoli Crispy Pizza Chicken from KFC Hong Kong. The Chizza from KFC Philippines has taken the world by storm. This chicken-pizza mashup is meant to be eaten more like a personal pan pizza and features a large, flattened chicken breast topped with traditional pizza ingredients like cheese, pepperoni, peppers, pineapple and more.

But sadly unlike other countries such as in the U.K., Canada and Australia, the U.S. has been deprived of Pizza Hut’s hot dog stuffed crust since 2012. But all that will likely change June 18. The Impulsive Buy spotted a promotional flyer that all but confirmed a hot dog stuffed crust pizza would be arriving stateside later this month.

Now true meatlovers don't have to decide with Pizza Hut Australia's latest extreme release: the Four’N Twenty-stuffed pie crust. Four'N Twenty is a popular meat pie restaurant down under so the new pizza-pie is a true fast food collaboration. The pizza itself can be topped with any of your favorite toppings-- pepperoni, olives, mushrooms, sausage, etc. Then each slice contains a flaky meat pie stuffed with gravy and mincemeat baked into the crust with a traditional tomato sauce “squeezie," which looks like a dollop of ketchup to us.  (Pizza Hut Australia) meat-pie-stuffed-crust-pizza Lobster-Donut Roll from Kane's Some food mashups are extreme but we still imagine they taste pretty good. Lobster salad and donuts don’t really fit into that category. But for Massachusetts based bakery Kane’s Handcrafted Donuts, the combo is now available. The Lobster Dowich—traditional lobster salad served on a brioche-based donut instead of bread-- is the latest twist on a classic New England seafood roll. The Dowich is also available with braised beef or chicken—but lobster is the go-to Boston-area favorite. According to Forbes, it actually tastes pretty good.

Now you can chow down on the entire summer cookout in one beastly bite. Carl's Jr and Hardees are debuting The Most American Thickburger-- a beef patty topped with a split hot dog. The meaty duo sits on a layer of kettle cooked Lay's potato chips-- to prevent them from getting soggy-- between hamburger buns loaded with ketchup, mustard, tomato, red onion, pickles and American cheese. The burger will have 1,030 calories and 64 grams of fat.

This recipe comes from the blog Oh Bite It where bacon is wrapped using toothpicks and popped in the deep fryer. Pretty. darn. good.   oh-bite-it- Carl's Jr. Pepperoni Pizza Fries Never again will famished snackers have to decide between pizza or french fries. Carl's Jr. says why not have both? The latest mash-up to hit fast counters is a creation the chain is calling "Pepperoni Pizza Fries." And yes, they are very real. Right now they're only being tested at a dozen locations in Southern California but the recipe seems simple enough to recreate at home. French fries are topped with marinara sauce, melted mozzarella cheese and a few slices of pepperoni pizza. These souped cheesy fries retail for $2.39.  (Carl's Jr.) carl's-jr.-pepperoni-pizza-fries Is this an edible bar of gold? This 24 Carrot-- not karats, sadly-- is the work of YouTuber Instructables.

See Offers Business Posted February 9 Updated February 9 increase font size Whole Foods struggles, victim of its own success Analysis: Organic foods have become so mainstream that organic chains now face competition from conventional big-box stores. The Washington Post Share Comment Read Article Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that’s bad news for the brand that made organic a household name – namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. Whole Foods this week reported its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. Associated Press/Lynne Sladky, File Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → In Maine, a Whole Foods store is located at 2 Somerset St. in Portland. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn’t predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. “Whole Foods created this space and had it all to themselves for years,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there’s a lot of competition.” In many ways, the story of Whole Food’s decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than millennials: Consumers ages 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they’re the most likely to consider themselves “knowledgeable” about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. Wal-Mart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 – the store’s CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store’s “most successful brand launch ever.” Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering “a wider range of organic and gluten-free products.” By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco – which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Wal-Mart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmers markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food’s primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on “365 by Whole Foods,” a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for “value-conscious” consumers. It’s also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see “too big of a gap” between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods – an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity – can happen only at the expense of the movement’s early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Wal-Mart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don’t meet his organization’s strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. “If you’re a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits,” Cummins said. “But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition.” That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges – but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Police say the robbery happened around 3:07 p.m. on Feb. 1. The 83-year-old Hiram resident was shopping when an unknown woman approached her and started asking questions about grocery items. The victim felt uncomfortable with the questioning and with how close the suspect got to her, so she walked away. The woman noticed when she went to check out that her wallet was missing, so she paid in cash. When she got home, she learned that her credit card had already been used at the Walmart in Macedonia, with two other attempts to use it made a the Streetsboro Walmart. The crime is very similar to an incident at the North Olmsted Walmart in December. A 96-year-old woman said that a woman approached her and started asking questions about oranges. Surveillance video showed the suspect reaching into her purse and taking her wallet during the confrontation. No arrests have been made.

Shares of the company, which has been struggling with years of losses and falling sales, were up 39 percent at $7.70 in premarket trading on Friday. The company — controlled by its billionaire chief executive, Edward Lampert — announced a new plan to cut costs by at least $1 billion in 2017 by reducing overhead, improving merchandise at its stores and through better inventory management. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has lost its standing as customers move to online shopping or rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. To cope with the slump, Sears has cut costs, spun off some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, raised debt from Lampert's hedge fund and put some brands on sale. The company has, however, failed to turn a profit in more than a year and said in December there was no guarantee when it would return to profitability. Sears said on Friday it sold five Sears full-line stores and two Sears Auto Centers for $72.5 million in January and engaged Eastdil Secured to raise at least $1 billion from the sale of its real estate.

Sears said the proceeds from these sales would be used to reduce its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion for fiscal 2017. The company had pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $2 billion as of Oct. 29. Sears also said it expected revenue of $6.1 billion and a loss of $535 million to $635 million in the fourth quarter ended January.

The BRZ is battling the notion that there’s nowhere to park in Kensington. By: Brodie Thomas Metro Published on For Calgarians the word “Kensington” might evoke images of historic buildings, hip shops – and streets lined bumper to bumper with parked cars. It’s that last image that the area’s Business Revitalization Zone (BRZ) is working to combat. Annie MacInnis, executive director of the Kensington BRZ, said they’ve worked to creatively free up and create new parking spots all around the shopping district in recent months. “If people go to Costco or Walmart, they walk a gazillion miles across a gigantic parking lot to a giant store where they walk a million more miles,” said MacInnis. “But if they come to Kensington they want to park in front of one business and get their one thing and leave.” She said while there might not be a spot directly in front of the store a shopper wants, there are plenty of spots – 684 between on-street and parking lot stalls. Sixty-eight of the newest parking spots created last fall are heated, underground stalls in mixed-use buildings. MacInnis said in one case, the BRZ had a chance to work with the CPA to create spots in the Lido building. Jennifer Friesen / For Metro Mike Derbyshire, general manager of the Calgary Parking Authority, said it was a great way to incorporate parking into the neighbourhood. “That was the first time we ever did a joint venture with a developer, so that was a big opportunity for us,” he said. There are also 34 spots in the St. John’s building. MacInnis said they’ve explored other options to maximize parking, such as changing parallel spots to angle parking where space allowed. They worked with the city to do an audit on “no parking” spots over the summer. “We had a few spots that said “no parking” for no apparent reason,” she said. She encouraged would-be shoppers to check out the BRZ’s online map and to have a backup plan in case their first choice for parking is full.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 February 2017 by Military News Gildan: Supporting Women with Life Skills SOURCE: Gildan Activewear DESCRIPTION: Gildan’s founders began manufacturing apparel more than 30 years ago in Canada, with a fundamental belief that owning its factories was the only way to ensure that products were better quality and always manufactured in the most responsible way. They also believed that true innovation and long term success would come from believing in its people, for it would be in their excellence and commitment that great things could be found. Believing and investing in its people lies at the heart of Gildan’s programs to support its employees in different aspects of their professional, family and personal lives. These programs are driven by the Company’s belief in the potential to improve the quality of life for employees, at work and at home. Gildan first implemented the Women’s Empowerment Program two years ago in collaboration with the Walmart Foundation and World Vision® Honduras. The program supports women by helping them develop the skills they need to become more active decision-makers and leaders in their jobs and their families. Employees at Gildan’s Villanueva sewing facility undertook the advanced workshop in 2016 and the facility was awarded a special recognition from World Vision® for its successful completion of the program. The Company’s San Miguel and San Antonio sewing facilities have also implemented the program, and are working towards graduating their first participants. The Women’s Empowerment Program is unique in that it helps employees recognize their capabilities and equips them with the tools to balance their demands both at work and at home. More than 1,000 Gildan employees in Honduras, both men and women, have participated in this training to date. A graduate of the program, Tania Viera, Sewing Operator, believes that the program helped her learn the value of communications in all of her relationships. “After attending this program, I have improved my relationships with my coworkers as well as my family,” said Tania. “I learned a great lesson from each step of this process, learning to communicate better, be more assertive and more sociable. I also learned to value myself as a person, as a woman and as a mother.”   The program offers over 70 hours of training as well as the opportunity to learn about subjects such as management, finance, communications and health. At the end of the program, a group of women graduates who demonstrate strong leadership potential are selected to be trainers for the next round of candidates. The cycle then repeats itself to sustain the program in each facility. A complimentary feature of the program is that men also play a role in the basic training by learning to recognize some of the challenges women face and ways to help support them. One participant Elmer Antonio Rodriguez, Production Supervisor, believes that the program has important benefits for everyone. “Ever since our first training, my colleagues and I started meeting in groups during our breaks to discuss improvements in our respective teams,” said Elmer Antonio. “We talk about the things we like and dislike about the way the team works. We discuss all the alternatives possible for improving production, quality and maintenance. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to receive this training.” Gildan is committed to implementing the Women’s Empowerment Program within its facilities in Latin American and in doing so, supports the leadership development of its employees that can be applied in all aspects of their lives.

But after a couple of years getting hands on in that industry, she realised she needed to do something different. "It didn't feel like a good fit," says the now managing director of Kellogg Australia and New Zealand. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Managing director of Kellogg Australia and New Zealand, Belinda Tumbers, has been with the company for 19 years. Photo: Gavin Jowitt Instead, Tumbers turned to advertising, where the Kellogg's account was part of her remit in a below-the-line ad agency. She eventually left that role, but was head hunted by Kellogg a couple of years later to join its in-house marketing team. That was 1998, and she's still there, a decision she puts down in large part to her colleagues. "It's a very family-based organisation, and there are great people I've worked with over those years. [Plus] I have complementary values to the company, so it's a good fit," she says. After an initial stint in the Kellogg's marketing team, the journey to the managing director role saw Tumbers spend most of her time (15 years) in sales. She worked her way up to the role of national sales manager at Kellogg Australia, then moved to the US to work on its Wal-Mart International business. Advertisement Next, came a role in New Zealand, where Tumbers ran Kellogg's New Zealand arm for three years, before finally moving back to Australia as sales director, her last role before landing the top job. "It's given me a good basis to step into this role: I know a lot about the customer and retail landscapes; I know how the company operates; and I knew the people I was working alongside, which meant I knew at the outset who I wanted to be a part of my team and who I didn't," she says. Since Tumbers has been at the helm, she's taken swift steps to improve diversity and help the business become more transparent. The former has been achieved in part via the Women of Kellogg program, while the latter has involved an online forum called "Open for Breakfast", where members of the public can ask the company's experts anything (all answers are made public). It's just part of Tumbers' focus to reset the overall company culture. "We're trying to move from more of a conservative, hundred-year-old company to more of an entrepreneurial mindset," she says. CURRICULUM VITAE Name: Belinda Tumbers. Current position: Managing director, Kellogg Australia/New Zealand. Responsibilities: Overseeing a cereal and snacks manufacturing business that operates in Australia and New Zealand which produces, markets and sells brands such as Nutri-Grain, Special K, Sultana Bran, Pringles, Corn Flakes and Coco Pops. Education: Advanced diploma in hospitality management, Macleay College. Additional training/courses: Executive certificate in global management, Thunderbird School of Global Management; executive enterprise leadership development, Harvard Business School; Unilever INSEAD Women in Leadership Development program, Singapore. Professional associations: Board director, Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC); elected chairwoman, Trading Partner Forum; member, Australian Institute of Company Directors; member, CEO Institute. Honourable mentions: Finalist, Joe Berry Young Food Executive of the Year Award, 2004. Strength: I thrive in challenging situations and I have a very strong bias for action and delivering results. When things are challenging that's when I tend to be at my best. Weakness: I can be impatient, and in my drive for perfection I sometimes don't always get people on the same page. I need to bring people on that journey from the outset. Management style and tips: Very open, transparent and decisive. I believe if you surround yourself with the best people you will create the right culture and the results will follow. Work motto: If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you.

Start off with his trademark issue — one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton’s administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China’s economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton’s approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push “permanent normal trade relations” with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China’s human rights practices. It passed by a 237-197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it’s cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Wal-Mart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China’s huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, “regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps and disability payments.” These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, “with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated.” And “offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.” Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We’re seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time’s Joe Klein, to ask: “Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete — think of those grand old steel mills — more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?” In addressing those questions, it’s helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required — and helped — welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it’s probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I’m a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of “earned success.” It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and — critical here — working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump’s trade policies and that the answers to Joe Klein’s questions aren’t so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101.

About 700 of these men are confined to vessels in Honolulu, some making less than $1 an hour to catch premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America's most upscale restaurants and grocery stores. In this unique fishing arrangement, Hawaii's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 for each crew member sent from abroad. Because the workers don't have visas, they aren't allowed to arrive at Honolulu's airport. Instead, they're flown to foreign ports and put on fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii.

About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones) Before they start working, they need a commercial fishing license. And in order to get that, Hawaii requires that they are "lawfully admitted" to the U.S. As proof of legal admission, state officials point to landing permits issued to all fishermen by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents when the men arrive at the dock. Here's the hitch: AP has learned Customs agents stamp "refused" on all the landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being "lawfully admitted," the fishermen are actually barred by law from setting foot in the U.S. "Try taking a check to your bank that says 'void' on it and telling them, 'Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'" said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, in a written opinion, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are "lawfully admitted." Customs sees it differently. "NO. They cannot be admitted," spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email. The Hawaii Longline Association has condemned labor abuses. Its president Sean Martin would not comment for this story, but in the past the group said the crew members are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet's 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii's fleet — which catches about $110 million worth of seafood annually — relies on a federal loophole allowing foreign fishermen to fill most jobs. On some boats, the men are exposed to dangerous, unsanitary conditions. Two workers who ran away in San Francisco were granted visas as victims of human trafficking in 2010. They are now suing their boat owner. Hawaii's premium fish is sold everywhere from Costco and Sam's Club to Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods suspended buying seafood from the fleet after the AP's initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. Trump Hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam's Club, did not respond to requests for comment. The Hawaii Seafood Council recently surveyed crew members and assessed the fleet's working conditions. A draft of the findings, published online, finds some fishermen have contracts requiring them to pay for replacement workers if they break their agreements, or facing $5,000 fines for absconding — more than a year's salary for some. "There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay," the report says. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All 207 men surveyed said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. In Honolulu, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. Customs says six fishermen were deported in 2016 after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have "identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions," but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Some fishermen have good working conditions, but others lack clean drinking water or proper health care, and are fed just bait and rice, according to federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time. Many crew members are forced to use buckets as toilets. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii, said the men have spoken of physical abuse, including captains slapping them in the face. Sometimes when he visits to exchange goods for fresh fish, workers ask him to bring vegetables because of shortages on board, he said. "Very often they are in a situation where they have no choice," Kozak said. "They are here, they signed their contract and they have to work until the contract finishes." ___ This investigation is part of AP's ongoing Seafood From Slaves investigation into labor abuse in the global fishing industry. Earlier reports tracking the catch from fishermen locked in a cage on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina to U.S. markets led to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide on boats far from shore and often without oversight. ___ Follow Martha Mendoza and Margie Mason on Twitter at @mendozamartha and @MargieMasonAP In this Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, photo, a catch of fish is unloaded from a commercial fishing boat at Pier 38 in Honolulu.

About 700 of these foreign fisherman are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, The Associated Press has found.

About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones) Under state law, these workers — who make up most of the crew in a fleet catching $110 million worth of seafood annually — may not be allowed to fish at all, the AP found. A recent industry-sponsored assessment of crew members' treatment and living conditions found no human trafficking, but raised concerns that workers could be vulnerable to exploitation and said they have little recourse about paying fees or incurring debt in order to hold their jobs. "There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay," according to the report. In this unique fishing arrangement facilitated by both federal and state officials, Hawaii's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 to bring each crew member from impoverished Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. The men aren't allowed to arrive at Honolulu's airport because they lack visas, so they are instead flown to other countries and put on U.S.-owned fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. Before the men start working, they need a state commercial fishing license. In order to get it, Hawaii requires that they must be "lawfully admitted" to the U.S. Here's the hitch: When they arrive, they are met at the dock by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who ban them from entering the country by stamping "refused" on their landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being "lawfully admitted," they are now barred by law from setting foot on U.S. soil. "Try taking a check to your bank that says 'void' on it and telling them, 'Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'" said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, a written opinion by Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are "lawfully admitted." U.S. Customs sees it differently. "NO. They cannot be admitted," spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email, adding that the stamp means they can't even enter the U.S. temporarily. In rare cases, including medical emergencies, Customs can parole the men to go ashore. Foreign crews on boats and aircraft, including cruise ship workers and flight attendants, fill out landing permits when they arrive in the U.S. Customs takes those applications and decides whether to allow each individual to temporarily enter the country. When landing permits are stamped refused, that serves as proof that authorities have been alerted that foreigners without visas are on arriving vessels or planes, and triggers an order for captains to detain them on board. Chin's office did not respond to AP's queries about the refusal stamp. However, Land and Natural Resources department spokesman Dan Dennison said in an email that the attorney general advised his agency to continue issuing fishing licenses to the foreign workers despite the fact that Customs says the men are not "lawfully admitted." The Hawaii Longline Association, which represents boat owners, says the men are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet's 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii's fleet relies on a federal loophole allowing the foreign fishermen to work. In a hearing prompted by the AP report, Land and Natural Resources department administrator Bruce Anderson was asked why he issues commercial fishing licenses to foreign workers who can't enter the state. He said the crewman's landing permit "says in essence that the individual has the right to fish in U.S. waters but cannot step ashore." He did not mention that all the permits were stamped "refused." Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chairman of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, has queried Chin and other state officials at length about why the men cannot leave their boats. Ing said state officials failed to disclose the refusal stamp to him when he asked to see the landing permits. "It always seemed paradoxical that the proof of lawful entry was a landing form, but the crew members weren't allowed to land or leave the boat," he said, after the AP told him about the stamp. "We just didn't have the smoking gun evidence to point to why, and now we do." Critics say the fishing licenses could be just one of several ways the state is breaking its own laws: —The lowest-paid fishermen have contracts promising $300 a month, well below the state's wage minimums. The Labor Department says it doesn't intervene because the workers fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. But department head Linda Chu Takayama also said she's awaiting further legal guidance. — Chin, the attorney general, said in his written opinion that employers in Hawaii typically cannot withhold wages, but some fishermen told the AP they are paid only after returning home when their one- or two-year contracts end. — Chin said telling consumers "that fish had been caught by local fishermen" may violate the state's deceptive practice laws if misinformation likely affects their shopping choices. The Hawaii Seafood Council claims the catch is "produced by Hawaii's hard-working fishermen." Council Program Manager John Kaneko did not respond to the AP. Federal law also is in question: U.S. Customs requires captains to detain the men on board and hold their passports because they are banned from entering the country. That potentially goes against U.S. human-trafficking laws saying bosses who possess workers' identification documents can face up to five years in prison. The foreign fishermen's catch is sold everywhere from Costco to Sam's Club and upscale restaurants across the U.S., including Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods announced it would suspend buying seafood from the fleet after the AP's initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. The Trump hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam's Club, did not provide an immediate response. The story also exposed dangerous, unsanitary conditions and at least two instances of human trafficking. It prompted new commitments from boat owners to protect the crew members' welfare. After a follow-up briefing on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress expressed "grave concerns" about working conditions in a letter to the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Hawaii Seafood Council's survey of 207 fishermen identified a series of potential problems, particularly involving recruiting and payment of the foreign crew. Some fishermen had contracts requiring that part of their salaries or identification papers be withheld until they returned home. Others had signed agreements that said they had to pay for replacement workers if they broke their contracts, or faced $5,000 fines for absconding — equivalent to a year's salary for some. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. No one complained about access to food, but the report described one labor agent as saying that she had men on a boat who had not been paid for two months and that she bought groceries for fishermen at times when their boats ran out. The industry has implemented a new universal crew contract that requires owners to pay all recruiting fees and gives the fishermen their salaries within four days of landing. A draft Code of Conduct seeks to safeguard workers' rights. But there are no wage minimums as initially promised by Hawaii Longline Association president Sean Martin. The Honolulu Fish Auction now does business only with boats whose workers have signed those agreements. Martin declined to be interviewed, but he and other industry leaders have condemned labor abuses. They have said the workers are happy to have the jobs and typically do not complain, with many renewing their contracts and even recruiting relatives. Still, little has changed, with foreign crews typically spending three weeks a month at sea, working up to 20 hours a day, usually for far less than American fishermen nationwide, who average $2,500 a month. Their situation has been widely accepted as legal. The AP investigation is part of an ongoing global look at labor abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America's own waters. In 2015, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. In Hawaii, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. And, although technically not allowed, they do venture onto the piers briefly to socialize and use restrooms. Last year, Customs said six fishermen were deported after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. In 2010, two Indonesian fishermen who fled their boat in San Francisco alleging abuse were granted visas as victims of human trafficking and are now suing their former boat owner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have "identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions," but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time at sea, said some fishermen have good working conditions while others are sometimes mistreated, not given proper health care, provided unclean drinking water and fed bait and rice. Many are forced to use buckets as toilets on board. Others in the community also have concerns. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii who has long exchanged home-cooked meals for fresh fish, said the workers sometimes ask for vegetables because of shortages on board. He said some captains have banned men from speaking their native language on boats. There's "a lot of verbal abuse, even physical abuse, being slapped in the face," Kozak said. "I have come across cases where people said, 'If I had ever known that it would be as bad as this, I would have never taken that job.'" ___ Follow Martha Mendoza and Margie Mason on Twitter at @mendozamartha and @MargieMasonAP In this Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, photo, a man stands on a commercial fishing boat docked at Pier 38 in Honolulu.

Get the latest news from The Morning Call on the Amazon Echo ALERT Breaking News Legendary retailer Albert Boscov dies at 87 LV Business Cycle Retail Analysis: Why Whole Foods is now struggling Why Whole Foods is now struggling On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) Caitlin DeweyOf The Washington Post Analysis: Why Whole Foods is now struggling Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name — namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. In September, the company opened the Lehigh Valley's first Whole Foods supermarket at the Hamilton Crossings shopping center in Lower Macungie Township. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. PHOTO GALLERY: After a short ceremony, the doors swooshed open and the crowds pushed forward into the Valley’s newest supermarket. (Harry Fisher) "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. WATCH: Whole Foods opens in Lower Macungie Morning Call reporter Jen Sheehan takes a tour of Whole Food's newest store, which opened to the public in Lower Macungie Township. Morning Call reporter Jen Sheehan takes a tour of Whole Food's newest store, which opened to the public in Lower Macungie Township. See more videos Walmart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 —the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco —which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods - an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity - can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Walmart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges — but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

Amid all the hurly-burly of President Donald Trump's first weeks in office, let's try to put the changes he's making and the feathers he's ruffling in a longer, 20-year perspective. Start off with his trademark issue -- one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton's administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China's economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton's approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push "permanent normal trade relations" with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China's human rights practices. It passed by a 237-197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it's cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Wal-Mart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China's huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, "regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps and disability payments." These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, "with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated." And "offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize." Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We're seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time's Joe Klein, to ask: "Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete -- think of those grand old steel mills -- more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?" In addressing those questions, it's helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required -- and helped -- welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it's probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I'm a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of "earned success." It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and -- critical here -- working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump's trade policies and that the answers to Joe Klein's questions aren't so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101.

The unattributed (but also unchallenged) quote above suggests that White House officials, if not the president himself, feel these titans of industry,  including the heads of Disney, Wal-Mart, General Motors and IBM, should be thankful to pass through the high gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue — as if they were about to curry favors from the godfather. For Kalanick, the cost of this VIP access to the Strategic and Policy Forum was too high. Following Trump’s executive order on “extreme vetting” of Syrian refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Kalanick’s company was hit with a public relations crisis. The problem began Jan. 28 after Uber drivers ignored calls from local taxi drivers to stop picking up passengers from New York City’s JFK airport as part of a daylong nationwide demonstration. Anger against Uber quickly spread across social media with calls to ditch the popular ride-hailing service, a boycott that overwhelmed Uber’s computer systems with a flood of demands from customers to cancel their accounts. “Consumers know that they have the power to influence companies and their bottom lines and have become more [active] over the recent years,” said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist for the New York-based PR firm Weber Shandwick. “Corporate reputations are at more risk than ever before because there is more scrutiny and a greater demand for transparency.” The anti-Uber protesters pivoted to focusing on Kalanick’s participation the policy forum, which led him to step down for damage-control purposes. Uber later joined 126 other companies (largely drawn from the tech industry) that have signed a friend of the court brief in support of the state of Washington’s legal challenge to Trump’s immigration order. On Thursday the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals maintained an injunction barring the president from enforcing his executive order while a Seattle federal judge continues to examine the legality of the order. “Travis was in a really difficult spot,” Steven Schwarzman, chairman, CEO and co-founder of private equity firm Blackstone who heads the president’s policy forum, told CNBC following the group’s first meeting with the president at the White House on Feb. 3. “His business was being adversely affected.” Such are the risks when CEOs decide to so publicly hobnob with national leaders, especially one like the current president, according to Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communications at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business. “Getting involved with a president that is supremely controversial and somewhat mercurial in nature strikes me as a little more dangerous,” Argenti told Salon. “You have the proximity to him but you also have the proximity to him. You get the ability to whisper into his ear, but you also have the taint of being close to this guy.” Kalanick has certainly learned a lesson about being tainted by Trump, but what about the other members of the policy forum, which include Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. as well as Disney boss Bob Iger and the head of Wal-Mart, Doug McMillan?    “We are very focused on what this means to our employees and our company,” General Motors spokesman Patrick Morrissey said in an emailed statement to Salon when asked if policy forum member and GM CEO Mary Barra had come out in opposition to the executive order. “We feel quite strongly about valuing all people.” Six other of the companies and organizations represented in the policy forum have made similar statements, either publicly or through internal communications provided to media outlets, but have stopped short of challenging the president. GM, Cleveland Clinic, JPMorgan Chase, Disney, IBM, EY and BlackRock have made some or all of these three points — that they want to help their employees affected by the immigration ban, that they value inclusivity and that the order could adversely affect their businesses. (Notably silent has been Wal-Mart and five privately held firms.) What these companies didn’t do is publicly oppose Trump’s executive order in no uncertain terms. It’s not clear, for example, if any of these executives would be willing to walk away from the forum in protest if Trump harms their business and employees, not to mention undermine a core American principle about “huddled masses yearning to breathe free” with his blanket indefinite ban on Syrian war refugees. Only one member of the policy forum has joined Kalanick in taking an active stance in opposing Trump’s executive order: Tesla and SpaceX co-founder and CEO Elon Musk, who, like Kalanick, faced a barrage of criticism about his involvement in the policy forum. But instead of stepping down from the forum, Musk chose to remain a member while also joining Kalanick in supporting the friend of the court brief (through his companies SpaceX and Tesla) challenging the president’s ban. “Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer,” Musk wrote on his official Twitter feed on Sunday in response to calls on social media for him stop participating in the policy forum. “How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?” Argenti, who has written about and lectured on corporate-reputation issues, said that despite Musk’s decision to join the forum in the first place, he’s doing the right thing by doubling down and saying on the forum. “If you’re going to make a decision then stick by it, that’s my advice to companies,” he said. “If you really want to dive in and dive in whole hog and realize that the reputation of the CEO rubs off on the company and the reputation of the company.” More Angelo Young.

Year after year the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) told Congress and store patrons that commissary shoppers saved an average of at least 30 percent on brand name groceries over prices in commercial stores and supermarkets. The claim lost some credibility over time with the rise of big box discounters and retail supercenters. Also, DeCA’s price-tracking methodology lost support in Congress and at the Pentagon amid a push to transform commissaries into more business-like operations, using commercial tools such as variable pricing and private label brands to try to reduce DeCA’s $1.3 billion annual appropriation. DeCA officials now concede the 30-percent savings figure didn’t include price comparisons at Walmart Supercenters. Nor did it consider the popularity of private label goods that outside grocers find so profitable. Nor did DeCA adjust its own estimates to give greater weight to products in highest demand with lower savings. On Monday, in response to a congressional mandate, DeCA released new set of “baseline” estimates of commissary savings that reflect these factors and more. Without reducing the value of the shopping benefit, DeCA says, it has redefined how it measures savings. Global savings across all 238 commissaries, are calculated now at 23.7 percent and savings stateside at 20.2 percent. At 61 overseas commissaries, average savings are 44.2 percent against local food prices. To be able to shift to variable pricing, DeCA also is publishing average savings by seven U.S. commissary regions. The 36 commissaries operating on New England bases, for instance, provide average savings of 21.4 percent. Across 30 commissaries in the South Atlantic states, savings average 19.9 percent. The combined region of Alaska/Hawaii, with nine commissaries, offers the highest savings for patrons at 32.6 percent. Twenty commissaries in the Rocky Mountain region, which runs south from the Canadian border through Arizona and New Mexico, had the lowest savings of 17.6 percent compared to prices off base. The Pacific coastline states, with 31 commissaries, provide average savings of 20.9 percent while 18 military grocery stores in North Central states save shoppers an average of 20.2 percent. “This enhanced way of calculating savings doesn’t change the actual dollars that patrons save, but it will give patrons a better understanding of price comparisons in their local area,” said DeCA Director Joseph H. Jeu in a press release unveiling revised savings estimates. A day later Jeu announced that, effective June 3, he will retire after 6½ years at DeCA’s helm and more than 38 years’ total federal service. “The transformation is well on its way and the right people are in place to see it through,” Jeu’s statement said. Military exchange executives, said industry sources, were surprised and upset by DeCA’s announcement on the new baseline savings. Exchange directors have argued for years that their own store traffic and sales performance are linked to the popularity of commissaries, and commissary sales are falling. Since last October, start of fiscal 2017, DeCA sales are down 7.6 percent and by more than 10.5 percent in January compared to January last year. “It’s just really bleak,” said one representatives for manufacturers serving the military resale system. “If your sales are down, the last thing you want to do is send out a press release saying that people are saving 10 percent less than they thought they were. That’s just going to drive sales way down.” Some might challenge Jeu’s timing but he was on the clock. Congress first ordered DeCA to produce more realistic baseline savings, including across regions, in 2015. The due date to report was March 2016 so DeCA was 11 months late. Brooke Goldberg, director of family policy and spouse programs for Military Officers Association of America, said senior defense officials have given assurances if the revised savings rate “drops even 1 percent, DeCA will begin evaluating a corrective measure.” The hope is that a more glandular approach to tracking savings will “be good for patrons as it provides a more definitive benchmark on a regional basis rather than national scale,” Goldberg said. Some advocates for military families fear that the mere perception of lower savings could put commissaries at greater risk, despite DeCA’s vow that it only has clarified current savings in order to preserve them through the changes ahead. “I do think it means less certainty for families moving forward,” said Eileen Huck, government relations deputy director for National Military Family Association. “Families have always been told they could expect a certain level of savings when shopping at the commissary, regardless of where they happened to be stationed. “Now the rules of the game have changed somewhat. Although DeCA has stated its commitment to preserving this new level of savings, there are many more factors in play” including variable pricing of products and introduction of DeCA branded products later this year. So, said Huck, “it is fair for families to question what this will mean for the value of the commissary benefit in the long run.” For years DeCA measured shopper savings by comparing a 26-week average of brand name prices, always set at cost, against average market prices across the country. It used Nielsen price data and filled in any gaps — for Alaska, Hawaii and overseas — with limited manual price comparisons in those locales. That method of calculating savings for 38,000 branded items at the national level has been replaced by a new method more suited to the transformation. “We are adding more geographic specificity, since cost of living varies by region,” said a DeCA official. “Adding a regional savings level will provide a better sense for how much our patrons save by shopping at their local commissary, compared to retailers in their particular region.” DeCA has also updated the products it uses for our price comparisons, emphasizing “the most common patron purchases” within sales categories like produce or meat. The new savings benchmark also take into consideration patron purchases at local commercial grocers, as manually gathered in every region. Critics have raised concerns about how DeCA is relying more heavily now on “clipboard” pricing methods rather than Nielsen data to benchmark local savings across regions. But the greater worry is how patrons will react to the results. “It certainly has the potential to adversely affect patronage,” said Tom Gordy, president of the Armed Forces Marketing Council. “But what I think people have to fully understand is the prices have not changed. It’s just the way the savings are calculated has changed.” Another industry analyst was more skeptical, suggesting new baseline savings leave headroom for Defense officials or Congress to slash DeCA’s $1.3 budget while still claiming to preserve customer savings. He also pointed to a new Government Accountability Office report on DoD construction projects that showed DeCA surcharge dollars used to fund only one construction project in fiscal 2015. “Construction is the best manifestation of the health of the resale system,” he said. “This report indicates that the system might already be faltering.” To comment, email milupdate@aol.com Most Read Police: Attack by woman near Arlington was fueled by meth ARLINGTON — An Arlington woman is under investigation for assault and unlawful… Feb 10th, 2017 by Scott North Olivia Newton-John show to promote new album in Everett Olivia Newton-John — the movie star (“Grease”) and singer (“I Honestly Love… Feb 10th, 2017 by Gale Fiege Monroe man allegedly schemed to have wife, daughter murdered MONROE — A Monroe man is accused of trying to hire a… Feb 9th, 2017 by Rikki King Fugitive watch Herald staff EVERETT — The state Department of Corrections’ Everett office has… Feb 10th, 2017 by Herald Staff Julie Muhlstein Everett dog owners hope for the best at Westminster show Meet Zoom.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 07:58 10 Feb 2017 Accendo Markets , Fri FTSE 100 Index called to open +30pts at 7260, extending yesterday’s gains to test 1-month intersecting resistance overnight. This maintains Wednesday’s bounce from 7150 and keeps alive the chance of the index regaining January’s 7365 all-time highs. Bulls need to see 7270 to be convinced of another breakout. Bears want to see 7250 give way to open the door for a retrace to yesterday’s 7230 at the very least. Watch levels: Bullish 7270, Bearish 7250. Calls for a positive open come after a strong day on Wall Street inspired by US tax cut hopes that spilled over to Asia overnight and received a second wind from surprisingly strong Chinese trade data that showed a rebound in Exports and acceleration in Imports that bolsters belief in transition to more consumption oriented economy. Japan’s Nikkei is outperforming thanks to a stronger USD and thus weaker Yen as well as energy stocks rebounding in tandem with oil prices. The same is true down under with Australia’s ASX, despite AUD strength at odds with poor home loan data and lower central bank growth forecasts, gaining as higher metals prices assist the all-important Miners. Wall Street soared yesterday as news of Donald Trump’s impending tax reforms saw investors flood into US equities, shying away from safe haven assets. Financials regained their title as foremost contributors on the Dow Jones, with Goldman Sachs leading the index 0.6% higher to a fresh record intraday and closing high, while retailers Nike and Wal-Mart were the biggest risers. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices also reached fresh all-time highs, both finishing the session 0.6% stronger. Both Brent Crude and US Crude have held above key levels despite the resurgent US dollar, having pared losses made on Tuesday this week. Both crude oil benchmarks will now have to overcome intersecting resistance levels, with Brent needing $56 to give way while the latter needs to hurdle the $53.20 mark. This evening’s Baker Hughes Rig count could provide direction for crude markets heading into next week, as the OPEC vs US shale gladiatorial match continues. The rally in equities both in the US and Asia overnight has had a subsequent impact on Gold, as investors shy away from the non-yielding safe haven asset. The precious metal has fallen back to $1223 having failed at $1243 resistance yesterday, breaking down from February rising lows support and throwing the validity of its bullish flag pattern into question. Further equity strength today could see gold come under further pressure today, In focus today will be the UK Trade Balance which is expected to see the deficit improve ever so slightly in December. Industrial Production is forecast to have slowed since November but accelerated on an annual basis to its fastest in over 5 years. Manufacturing Production is also expected to have slowed in Dec but rally to its best year-on-year since late 2014. Interestingly, UK Construction Output is seen doing the reverse, accelerating for the month but its yearly rate of advance falling negative for the first time since mid-2013. Keep an eye on FTSE housebuilders and construction names for any reaction. In the afternoon, with Inflation so key for the Fed’s outlook on hiking rates, US Import Price growth is seen largely unchanged at 0.4% in January but heating up to >3% annually, well above the Fed’s 2% stability target. Speakers include the ECB’s Mersch (9.50am) and Governing Council Member/Bundesbank Head Jens Weidmann (10am), both in Hamburg but at separate events, the former giving a presentation and the latter a leadership handover speech at the local Bundesbank office. Don’t forget US President Trump meets Japanese PM Abe today, offering potential for diplomatic faux pas aplenty.

Comment (1) aAFont Size Whole Foods Market Inc., facing its worst sales slump in more than a decade, is taking a step that would have been unthinkable in its highflying days: shrinking the size of the chain. Though Whole Foods plans to open six stores during the current quarter, including two relocations, the company said Wednesday that it's shutting down nine. That kind of retrenchment hasn't happened since the last recession was underway in 2008. The company said the stores targeted for closure include two each in California and Colorado and stores in Chicago, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Georgia. The company, which has about 440 U.S. stores, also said it was abandoning its ambitious growth target and no longer plans to reach 1,200 locations as it tries to get expenses under control. Six straight quarters of declining same-store sales -- a closely watched measure -- have forced the organic-food grocer to tighten its belt. Whole Foods also gave a forecast for the current year that offered little hope of a quick recovery. "This is a company that owned the space for a long time, but there's way too much competition now," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "They've done several things to try and drive sales, and it's just not working." Same-store sales dropped 2.4 percent last quarter, worse than the 1.7 percent decrease predicted by analysts. The company now expects sales on that basis to decline as much as 2.5 percent this year, compared with an earlier forecast that was closer to breaking even. "People were hoping there would be some improvement," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "It's a bit concerning there's not a reversal happening there." Whole Foods has struggled to ward off competition from mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, which began offering more organic fare in recent years. And a bout of food deflation has put additional pressure on the entire industry. Some on Wall Street have been pushing Whole Foods to rein in its growth plans, and the store plan was received warmly. The stock rose $1.05, or 3.6 percent to close Thursday at $30.35. Responsibility for the turnaround is now squarely on John Mackey, a co-founder of the company who retook sole leadership last year. He had served as co-chief executive officer with Walter Robb until November. He has an uphill fight ahead. Same-store sales declined 3.2 percent in the current quarter through Feb. 5, a sign its troubles are worsening. The Austin, Texas-based company also said it would no longer be reporting quarter-to-date figures in future reports, meaning investors will have less to go on. Whole Foods' struggles have fueled speculation that an activist investor could take on the chain, and one of its largest shareholders is said to have to discussed agitating for sweeping changes. For years, Whole Foods offered products that were tough to find elsewhere, and the shares gave investors exposure to the fast-growing market for organic and natural food. But that advantage has eroded in recent years. With sales growth stagnating last year, Whole Foods announced $300 million in cost cuts. But the company is still ramping up spending elsewhere, including on marketing and technology, and that's expected to offset the cutbacks. It also introduced a new store concept last year aimed at younger, budget-conscious consumers. So far, only three of the locations -- dubbed 365 by Whole Foods Market -- have opened on the West Coast. The company announced on Wednesday that it has signed leases for new 365 stores in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Oakland, Calif. The new concept, named after the company's private-label brand, is seen as a way for Whole Foods to connect with shoppers who perceive the chain's conventional stores as too pricey. Whole Foods considered turning some of the stores it was closing into 365 locations, but it wasn't practical, Mackey said. In some cases the company wanted to thin out its presence in a particular market, with the hope that it benefits Whole Foods locations nearby. Some of the stores had lease renewals coming up in 2017, and management decided to accelerate the process and close them now. The decision to close the nine stores will help improve profits and comparable sales, Mackey said during a conference call. The company is taking a more disciplined approach to growth but still has 80 stores in the pipeline, he said. "We cleaned up the stores we needed to clean up for the time being, and we're looking forward to moving forward," Mackey said.

(Reuters photo: Eduardo Munoz) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Michael Barone February 10, 2017 12:00 AM @michaelbarone Cheaper goods don’t provide satisfaction like meaningful work does. Amid all the hurly-burly of President Donald Trump’s first weeks in office, let’s try to put the changes he’s making and the feathers he’s ruffling in a longer, 20-year perspective. Start off with his trademark issue — one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton’s administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China’s economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton’s approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push “permanent normal trade relations” with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China’s human-rights practices. It passed by a 237–197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it’s cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Walmart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China’s huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of the Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, “regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps, and disability payments.” These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, “with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated.” And “offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.” Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We’re seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time’s Joe Klein, to ask: “Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete — think of those grand old steel mills — more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?” In addressing those questions, it’s helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required — and helped — welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it’s probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I’m a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of “earned success.” It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and — critical here — working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump’s trade policies and that the answers to Joe Klein’s questions aren’t so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101. —Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics. © 2017 Creators.com Load More Photo Essay Defending America About Institute Advertise Contact NR Facebook Twitter Google+ Privacy

Enquirer , KHOU 7:30 PM. CST February 09, 2017 Kellogg's cereals, including Special K, are seen at a store in Arlington, Virginia, December 1, 2016. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images (Photo: SAUL LOEB, This content is subject to copyright.) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST BATTLE CREEK, Mich. — Kellogg (K) could lay off more than 1,100 employees because of its decision to use grocers' warehouses rather than directly deliver many of its foods to store shelves. The company said Wednesday it plans to begin exiting its direct store delivery network in favor of retailers' warehouses in the second quarter of this year. As a result, the company will close 39 of its distribution centers. Those sites average about 30 full-time workers, Kellogg spokeswoman Kris Charles said. That's the equivalent of about 1,170 jobs. Closures are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. The change comes as the grocery industry itself is changing: Online sales of staples are increasing and national retailers such as Walmart and Target have focused more on food sales. "While this is the right move for the company to achieve our long-term objectives, it was a difficult decision because of its impact on some sales and distribution employees," Charles said in an email statement. Kellogg — which makes Eggo frozen waffles, Kashi products, Keebler cookies and crackers, MorningStar Farms meatless foods, Pop-Tarts and Pringles in addition to its cereals — already uses the warehouse system for some of its products, including Pringles and its frozen foods. But its cereals, cookies, crackers and crisps most often are delivered through direct sales teams, according to the company's 2015 annual report. The closures "will not have a sizable impact on any one community," including Battle Creek where Kellogg has its headquarters, Charles said. The company did not immediately provide a list of communities affected but about half are identifiable because of an online presence: • In Cicero, N.Y., the company will close a distribution center with 30 workers, The (Syracuse, N.Y.) Post Standard reported. • In Hagerstown, Md., its distribution center, also on the shutdown list, employs 85 people, The (Hagerstown, Md.) Herald-Mail reported. • In Warren, Ohio, a Kellogg distribution center will close by the end of the year, The (Youngstown, Ohio) Vindicator reported. Online job boards show that Kellogg was advertising openings at distribution centers in Elmhurst, Ill.; Hartford, Conn.; Loudon, Tenn.; Oklahoma City; Orlando; and San Antonio. Additional distribution centers are in Atlanta; Augusta, Ga.; Auburn, Maine; Breinigsville, Pa.; Fontana, Calif.; Franklin, Mass.; Jackson, Tenn.; Menomonee Falls, Wis.; Muncy, Pa.; Omaha, Neb.; Phoenix; San Jose, Calif.; and Sharonville, Ohio. Detroit is the company's only distribution center in Michigan, Charles said. ► Related: Breitbart launches #DumpKelloggs campaign after brand pulls ads The move reiterates "how serious we are at creating a more competitive and a faster-growing snack business," said President Paul Norman of Kellogg North America on the company's investor call Thursday. The decision frees up money for other areas such as brand building, Norman said. "(It's) a very difficult decision," he said. "We firmly believe this is the right move for our business as we look forward to changing consumer and shopper trends." Kellogg's core cereal sales have been under strain as consumers find themselves rushed to get out of the house in the morning and store brands that families turned to during the recession eat into market share for the big brands: Kellogg, Post and General Mills. Kellogg's cost-cutting program, dubbed Project K and first introduced in 2013, will be extended into 2019, said Ron Dissinger, outgoing Kellogg chief financial officer. Project K, designed to promote efficiency and reshape the business, has resulted in a number of layoffs, including last month's decision to cut 250 North American jobs. It had been scheduled to end this year. On Thursday, the company reported a loss of $53 million in the fourth quarter although profits were up 28% to $1.4 billion for the year. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were 92 cents a share, $3.74 for all of 2016, surpassing Wall Street expectations. It's stock price was up about 4% to $76.47 a share in Thursday afternoon trading.

(Photo: Joel Angel Juarez/ZUMA Press/Splash News/Newscom) New Deal-era legislation is causing major headaches for Wisconsin’s consumers and businesses. A law that has been on the books in Wisconsin since 1939 forces consumers to pay an extra 9 percent on fuel, in the name of fairness. A report by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute examined the law and its impact on consumers and business owners in the Badger State. The Unfair Sales Act was enacted to stop a “flood of small-business bankruptcies during the Great Depression,” according to the institute’s report, which was released last year. The law initially applied to all merchandise and required retailers not to sell anything for less than 8 percent more than what they paid for it at cost.    To avoid “predatory pricing,” the law was designed to stop retailers from lowering prices so much that competitors would go out of business, after which the original retailer could raise prices again. Several legislative changes over the years updated the law, but rules are still in place for alcohol, tobacco, and motor vehicle fuel. According to the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute’s report, alcohol and tobacco products may not be sold below cost. The definition of “cost” includes a presumptive 3 percent markup by wholesalers and 6 percent markup by retailers. Motor fuel must be marked up 9.18 percent above the “average posted terminal price,” determined by an independent oil-price-survey company every day. The Unfair Sales Act also states that general merchandise may not be sold below cost by wholesalers or retailers. Exceptions to these rules are made for matching a competitor’s price (which turns out to be the crux of many disputes over the law), or for clearance or liquidation sales, as well as the sale of perishables or damaged goods. The law does not apply to services. Rick Lemke, who owns a gas station and car repair garage in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, said he thinks the state should repeal the law, but that the regulation of gas prices serves a purpose. There’s an exception to the unfair competition law that says a retailer is allowed to sell their product for below the minimum markup rate to meet a competitor’s price. This most often plays out with gasoline because, as Lemke pointed out, it’s the only product that has to have a price posted along the roadside for consumers to see. If his competitor sells gas for less than what the law requires, he can do the same, as long as he fills out a “Notice of Meeting Competition” form and sends it to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. Lemke said every day he must drive around town, observe his competitors’ prices on gas, report who is selling for less than markup, and file paperwork so that he won’t get in trouble for selling his gas at the same or lower price. “I would like to see the law repealed because it creates paperwork on my part every day,” he said. “You’re automatically assumed in violation of the law if you don’t have the paperwork.” While the law causes him extra work, Lemke said he’s glad the law keeps big companies, like Meijer or Wal-Mart, from selling gas at a loss while making money elsewhere in the store. Such practices could put small shops out of business, he said. A Wal-Mart gas station in Florida. (Photo: St Petersburg Times/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom) Wisconsin is not the only state with minimum markup or unfair competition laws. According to a 2006 article by the Foundation for Economic Education, many states—including Michigan, Maryland, and New York—have similar laws, “however, none are as extreme as the one in Wisconsin, where fuel taxes are also among the highest in the nation.” Michael LaFaive, director of the Morey Fiscal Policy Initiative at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Michigan, said the law is outdated and a burden on consumers. “It’s a suffocating economic mandate that has been around too long for its own good. It’s an anachronism,” he said. LaFaive has done extensive research on Michigan’s liquor control laws, which are similar to Wisconsin’s minimum markup laws, and lead to high prices on alcohol. But, he said Wisconsin’s law is much more pervasive and suffocating than Michigan’s. “This is protectionist legislation that was born of a different era,” he said. “Protectionist sentiments are universal. I see them everywhere.” Salim Furth, a research fellow in macroeconomics at The Heritage Foundation, called these laws a price gouge. “There is, generally speaking, no justification for a law of this type,” he said. “The defenders will cite the idea of monopoly protection, but a monopoly wouldn’t be stopped by this law: large markups are exactly what a monopolist would do. Low markups are a hallmark of competition, not monopoly.” Several of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute report’s authors interviewed consumers around the state and found that many of them say they think the free market should determine gas prices, not a law. One woman quoted in the report sums it up this way: “We purchase gas wherever we can get the best deal.” The minimum markup law hurts consumers, LaFaive said. “No consumer ever got killed in a price war,” he said. “If they’re defending this law based on a [potential] price war, they’re admitting that consumers come second.” He called the laws “economically harmful and unfair.” While proponents of the law say it keeps small businesses in competition with big stores, LaFaive said big stores can’t be blamed for succeeding in a free market. Several consumers in the report stated that they will shop wherever they can get the best price, whether it be a big box store or a mom-and-pop shop. Another shopper said she thinks long-established, small stores would survive if the markup law was repealed because of a dedicated clientele, even if their prices are slightly higher. In 2009, the minimum markup law nearly died after a federal judge ruled on a suit involving gas station chain Flying J. The judge said the minimum markup law violated the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, according to the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute’s report. Both the attorney general and governor of Wisconsin at the time (one a Republican and one a Democrat) decided not to appeal the decision. However, a trade association supporting the gas and convenience store industry in Wisconsin was granted an appeal, which overturned the federal judge’s decision. So, opponents of the law have turned to the state Legislature to try to repeal it.   The most interesting part of his research, report contributor Dave Daley said, was discovering that the state government has the equivalent of two employees responsible for enforcing minimum markup laws, and that they do not actively look for offenders. The employees receive complaint forms from businesses claiming that another company is not following minimum markup rules. The two employees can then issue warning letters to the supposed offenders and, if necessary, can refer a case to a local prosecutor, though no cases have been referred for more than 10 years, according to the report. “The research seems to show that the state is doing the minimum it has to to make offenders aware of law,” Daley said. “It has more of an impact on some of these businesses being forced to jump through hoops, especially gas stations. No matter what you want to charge, you have to deal with the minimum markup law.” The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

Lawrence "Larry" Johnson, 69, was considered a missing and endangered person by police, who said he was last seen on foot early Thursday, Jan. 26, behind a Crystal Lake Walmart at 1205 S. Route 31. On Monday, a construction worker found a body in the mud in a construction area near the 8000 block of South Route 31 south of Rakow Road -- about a half-mile from the Walmart. An autopsy conducted Thursday determined hypothermia played a role in Johnson's death. No other evidence of trauma or suspicious circumstances were found, coroner's officials said. Toxicology results are pending.

Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement President Donald Trump convened with the heads of some of America's largest corporations on Friday at the White House for a meeting intended to make good on the administration's pledge to reduce regulation, promote women in the workplace, and cut taxes. Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, told CNBC it had been a "fabulous meeting" and said the president "engaged forcefully" on every topic. Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity firm Blackstone and chairman of the council that arranged Friday's meeting, said the session had been "spirited intellectually" and that the members had had a "balanced discussion" about "taxes, trade, infrastructure, women's issues, education, and how to bring home jobs in terms of training people in technology." Other attendees at Friday's business huddle included members of Trump's economic advisory council, such as JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney's Bob Iger, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, and Mary Barra of General Motors. The meeting also included First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president; as well as Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. One notable absentee was Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned from his spot on the president's council Thursday amid fierce backlash from customers furious at Kalanick's seeming connection to Trump's controversial immigration ban that limits travel to America from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Kalanick said Thursday that his participation on Trump's council was not meant to be construed as any endorsement of Trump's policies. However, billionaire inventor and environmentalist Elon Musk, also heavily criticized for his position on the board due to seemingly contradictory stances with Trump, has not shied away from his role. In contrast to Kalanick, Musk tweeted a message on Thursday explaining that he was remaining on the board in order to "serve the greater good." Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017 Corporate America is struggling to please an increasing divide: Customers and investors who oppose Trump's hard-line policies, and those who applaud his strong-arm techniques. And many business leaders on the president's council are stuck between a rock and a hard place as they seek to advise — or at least appease — the president while remaining firm on their own values and satisfying those of their client base. Related: Many CEOs 'Scared Out of Their Minds', Won't Speak Out Against Trump Trump has already called out several major companies via Twitter, including General Motors, L.L. Bean, and Ford. In December, he tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Following his tweet, Boeing stocks slid by more than 1 percent in premarket trade.

(WAVY) — A local veteran is giving back to the community by replacing old and worn American flags with new ones. Ryan Thorpe served in the Marine Corps and is currently a sheriff’s deputy. He first got the idea behind his nonprofit organization, Operation Restore Glory, in 2012. “Driving down 58, I saw what was an old grain silo. It’s kind of fallen down now. There was a flag and it was all torn up,” he said. Thorpe says he went to Wal-Mart, bought a new flag and returned to the home, where an older man lived. “He said [the flag] was for his son, who passed away because he was killed in Iraq. I asked if I could replace the flag. He said, ‘Sure.’ I did that and now I kind of have a calling to continue to do that,” Thorpe said. Now, Thorpe travels to other homes in the Hampton Roads area for his organization. He says replacing worn flags shows respect that’s missing within younger generations — especially those who stomp on flags. “Everybody thinks the flag represents the government. The flag doesn’t represent the government,” he said. “The flag reflects the people and the people are the government. The flag should be respected.” When Thorpe receives old flags, he takes them to local Boy Scout troops to retire them. “It’s also going to teach the younger generations coming through the Boy Scouts to respect the flag and they’ll teach their friends. It will go from there,” Thorpe said. Thorpe hopes that by starting this organization, others will also come to appreciate something he says symbolizes all of America. “Yes, there are some negatives through our history as a country, but we have way more positives and it’s because of that flag,” he said. Thorpe and his wife are raising money to cover costs for flags, which he says costs about $18 each.

Bean's founder and donated $60,000 to a PAC Donation exceeded the PAC's individual donor limit of $5,000, officials said  By Dailymail.com Reporter and Associated Press Published: 18:33 EST, 9 February 2017 | Updated: 21:32 EST, 9 February 2017 e-mail 41 shares 45 View comments LL Bean is in the process of cutting costs by freezing pensions and offering voluntary early retirements, but company officials insist the plans were in place long before the founder's granddaughter, Linda Bean, spoke out on behalf of President Donald Trump. The Freeport-based outdoors retailer will freeze its defined-benefit pension plan and boost its 401(k) savings contributions to all 5,000 workers, including 1,000 out-of-state store employees who were not previously eligible for the full pension, company officials said. The changes, which go into effect next year, were in the works before Steve Smith's arrival as CEO last year and unwanted publicity surrounding board member Linda Bean's campaign donations, officials said.  Last month, #GrabYourWallet called for a boycott of LL Bean and 38 other stores including Walmart, Macy's and Bloomingdales, because Bean contributed $60,000 to a political action committee supporting then president-elect Trump. L.L Bean is in the works of cutting costs by freezing pensions and offering voluntary early retirements, but company officials insist the plans were in place long before the founder's granddaughter, Linda Bean, spoke out on behalf of President Donald Trump  The changes were in the works before the unwanted publicity surrounding board member Linda Bean's (left) campaign donations to Trump. Last month, #GrabYourWallet called for a boycott of LL Bean because Bean contributed $60,000 to a PAC supporting Trump The Federal Election Commission said the donation exceeded the PAC's individual donor limit of $5,000. Bean spoke out about the boycott to the FOX Business Network, calling it 'bullying'. 'They want to control how we spend our money, what we buy, where we buy it. That's wrong, it's un-American.' Trump later tweeted support of Bean's statements with a thank you. He also urged customers to buy LL Bean. 'Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine,' he wrote on Twitter.  In response to the boycott at the time, company chairman Shawn Gorman, who is the great-grandson of founder LL Bean, released a statement on Facebook. 'We were disappointed to learn that Grab Your Wallet is advocating a boycott against L.L.Bean solely because Linda Bean, who is only one of 50+ family members involved with the business, personally supported Donald Trump for President.  'We are deeply troubled by the portrayal of L.L.Bean as a supporter of any political agenda. Bean (pictured) spoke out about the boycott, calling it 'bullying'. 'They want to control how we spend our money, what we buy, where we buy it. That's wrong, it's un-American' In response to the boycott at the time, chairman Shawn Gorman, who is the great-grandson of founder LL Bean, released a statement on Facebook that said the company was 'disappointed to learn that Grab Your Wallet is advocating a boycott' because Bean supported Trump  'L.L.Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. 'Simply put, we stay out of politics. To be included in this boycott campaign is simply misguided, and we respectfully request that Grab Your Wallet reverse its position,' the statement read.  But recently the company said the changes are a part of a broader look at all aspects of the business, which could lead to changes that affect shoppers. L.L. Bean currently offers free shipping on everything, and its 'satisfaction' guarantee is so liberal that it's led to abuse of the return policy.  Company officials said they will have more to say later this year about shipping and efforts to combat fraudulent returns.

Share this article Share The privately held company expects to reduce its workforce by about 500 workers — about 10 per cent — through early retirement incentives, said Smith. Other employment changes include more flexible time off, paid parental leave and paid eldercare support, benefits employees have been seeking, he said. The employment changes were announced by Smith in a memo and in meetings with workers Thursday. Gorman said such decisions 'weigh heavily' on the family-owned business. But he said they're necessary for the company to remain competitive. 'Without a healthy core business, it's really hard to satisfy any of the stakeholders,' he told The Associated Press.  Recently the company said the changes in personnel are a part of a broader look at all aspects of the business, which could lead to changes that affect shoppers. The privately held company expects to reduce its workforce by about 500 workers through early retirement incentives 'So the move is designed to get us to a more competitive and modern benefits package that allowed us to be sustainable for the foreseeable future.' The pension move is no big surprise in a challenging retail environment. L.L. Bean's sales were flat in 2015, and growth for the five years before that was slow. Nationwide, the private sector has been eliminating pensions.  In 2015, about one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies offered a traditional or hybrid defined benefit plan to new hires, down from 60 per cent in 1998, according to business consulting firm Willis Towers Watson . Smith said the goal is to return L.L. Bean to the strong growth levels the company experienced in the 1980s and 1990s. 'As long as your expenses are growing faster than your sales, then you're not able to invest in growth,' Smith said. 'What we're focused on is getting to where we're back in growth mode.'

"I think it's a combination of investors feeling more confident that some tax package will get worked on. But I think that we also have lower interest rates recently and solid earnings," Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, told CNBC. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, added: "Those comments about taxes, the markets have been looking forward to that for a while, and that helps. At least we're not talking about Ivanka [Trump]'s dress line over at Nordstrom's."

Here are more details on the bundles from a post on the official PlayStation blog. All of the consoles come with an updated DualShock 4 controller and 500GB hard drive, so while you could argue they're not directly competing, they're going to look pretty darn competitive on store shelves next to Nintendo's new piece of kit. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered's 1.08 patch added something insidious alongside numerous fixes. From Sunday, February 12 through Saturday, February 25, you'll be able to pick up the 500GB Uncharted 4: A Thief's End bundle, 500GB Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare bundle, or 500GB Glacier White Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare bundle for $249.99, which is $50 off the slimmer PS4's regular price. With games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Persona 5, and NieR Automata coming to the PS4 soon, there couldn't be a better time to scoop one up. Let us know down below in the comments.

KelleyLauderdale County Detention Center  Preston Kelley, 23, of Florence, sent his grandmother a photo that made it look like he was being held captive in the woods in Tennessee, Lauderdale County sheriff's investigator Lt. Brad Potts said. Kelley told the grandmother if she didn't go to Wal-Mart and send him $1,000 through a money gram, he would be killed, Potts said. "He never got any money," Potts said. "The grandmother came straight to us." Investigators began probing the case as a possible kidnapping Monday. Later that day, Kelley was taken into custody on a first-degree extortion charge. "We take all instances like that serious," Potts said. "But, eventually we determined it was all a hoax and he was trying to extort her for money." Potts said the local drug task force is familiar with Potts, who has crossed its path in the past. "Family is the ones people tend to prey on, particularly elderly relatives," Potts said. Kelley remained jailed at the Lauderdale County Detention Center Thursday with bail set at $1,000. If convicted of the Class B felony, Kelley faces up to 20 years imprisonment.

The multi-rotor creates a map as it flies, and when a student clicks on a previously visited part of the map, it’s able to fly back to that spot without human intervention and without GPS. (MAGICC Lab) Robots may be the stuff of science fiction novels and movies for some. But to BYU electrical and computer engineering Professor Randy Beard, they’re an exciting reality. “(Robots have) so many, many useful applications,” Beard said. “We work on really fun and innovative problems, and we get to do things that you can see work.” Beard is a director of BYU’s Multiple Agent Intelligent Coordination and Control Lab, also known as the MAGICC Lab. Established in 1999, its primary goal is developing a robot that directs itself. “What we’re trying to do is … make robotics systems more intelligent and more autonomous and more usable,” Beard said. “We’re writing computer algorithms that … fly robots.” Those flying robots are unmanned aerial vehicles, more commonly known as drones, and the main research focus of the MAGICC Lab. The lab focuses on small aircrafts with a wide variety of uses. All flight tests are approved through BYU Risk Management. “We work in the area where we’re looking at small vehicles, things that can be hand launched … but have autonomy,” Beard said. “You have civil applications like law enforcement and border control … things like wildfire surveillance … pipelines and power-line surveillance. All of that can be automated with unmanned air vehicles.” In addition to the MAGICC Lab, Beard works with the Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, a coalition of five universities and 23 companies that develop drones, according to center’s operations manager Rose Allen. The center and MAGICC Lab sometimes work together, but they’re also distinct organizations with separate projects. Tim McLain is another director of the MAGICC Lab and the director of the Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. McLain, a mechanical engineer and BYU professor, worked on underwater vehicles while completing his doctorate degree, which influenced his understanding of drones. “Interestingly, some of the fundamental dynamics or governing behaviors … that govern how these vehicles work (have) similarities between underwater vehicles and aircraft, and ground vehicles too,” he said. McLain said drones have historically been fixed wing aircraft developed by the military, but now some companies are looking at them for commercial and communication applications. “Parcel delivery is something that’s being looked at very intently by Amazon, Wal-Mart, DHL and other people,” McLain said. “Facebook is looking at having high altitude (drones) that would be solar powered and stay up for long periods of time, and they would be used to pipe high-speed internet to parts of the world that don’t have the infrastructure … for internet.” Drones have the potential to change the aircraft industry in the long term, but not before other technologies develop, according to McLain. “I think the way that will evolve is we’ll see self-driving cars come along first,” McLain said. “Once we’re convinced of the safety of that … then I think you’ll see large unmanned aircraft used for parcel delivery … and then finally passenger aircraft.” McLain said although he doesn’t consider drones safer than planes flown by people, quite a bit of passenger flight is already automated, with the pilot simply overseeing processes like takeoff, landing and navigation. “(The pilot) is just watching to make sure nothing bad happens,” McLain said. “(But) even under challenging conditions, the automated landing systems can do a better job than the pilots can, so in that sense, the automation that we have currently is better and safer than what a pilot can do.” Both Beard and McLain said no one should be afraid of drones invading their privacy. “You’re probably much more likely to have an invasion of privacy from someone putting a webcam on your fence than trying to fly a drone around,” Beard said. “Drones are very loud and they don’t fly a long time, so I think that privacy concerns are overblown.” McLain said he agrees new legislation is not necessarily needed because existing laws already protect people. “I think unmanned aircraft are a technology just like … the internet,” McLain said. “We would all be pretty sad if the internet were taken away because it was viewed as a potential harm. … There will be a lot of good stuff that comes from unmanned aircraft.” Some of that “good stuff” is already being developed by doctorate electrical engineering student David Wheeler, who has worked four years in the MAGICC Lab. His research involves teaching multi-rotors to fly when GPS is unavailable. Past MAGICC Lab projects include a “Tailsitter” that lands vertically and an airplane that’s able to calculate the locations of targets on the ground while flying. A team of undergraduate students is currently preparing to compete in the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems-Student Unmanned Aerial Systems competition. To Wheeler, the future is drones. “I think over … the next thirty, fifty years … they’ll be interacting with us regularly to help us and shape the way we live our lives,” Wheeler said. McLain shared Wheeler’s optimism. “(It’s great) to work with young people that are so capable,” McLain said. “The best part is just seeing something new work for the first time, coming up with an idea that has the potential to provide a useful capability to an end user, something that’s marketable and valuable to people. I think the capabilities that will develop will enhance people’s lives and ultimately save lives too.” Tags: BYU, drones, kaitlyn bancroft, magicc lab, Robots, tim mclain, uavs, unmanned aerial vehicles Kaitlyn Bancroft 0 0 0 0 0 Related News New app aims to increase bike safety Snowbird offers summer activities for all ages Elizabeth Smart to publish self-empowerment book in 2017 Archives Archives Select Month February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 February 2011 January 2011 September 2010 June 2010 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 July 2004 June 2004 May 2004 April 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2004 December 2003 November 2003 October 2003 September 2003 August 2003 July 2003 June 2003 May 2003 April 2003 March 2003 February 2003 January 2003 December 2002 November 2002 October 2002 September 2002 August 2002 July 2002 June 2002 May 2002 April 2002 March 2002 February 2002 January 2002 December 2001 November 2001 October 2001 September 2001 August 2001 July 2001 June 2001 May 2001 April 2001 March 2001 February 2001 January 2001 December 2000 November 2000 October 2000 September 2000 August 2000 July 2000 June 2000 May 2000 April 2000 March 2000 February 2000 January 2000 December 1999 November 1999 October 1999 September 1999 August 1999 July 1999 June 1999 May 1999 April 1999 March 1999 February 1999 January 1999 December 1998 November 1998 October 1998 September 1998 August 1998 July 1998 June 1998 May 1998 April 1998 March 1998 February 1998 January 1998 December 1997 November 1997 October 1997 September 1997 August 1997 July 1997 June 1997 May 1997 April 1997 March 1997 February 1997 January 1997 December 1996 November 1996 October 1996 September 1996 August 1996 July 1996 June 1996 May 1996 April 1996 March 1996 February 1996 January 1996 October 1994 ABOUT US ADVERTISING BRIMHALL WEBCAM CONTACT US COPYRIGHT / PRIVACY SUBMIT NEWS TIPS UNIVERSE ARCHIVES (PDF) UNIVERSE JOBS Site Login © 2016 The Daily Universe - Brigham Young University

Leach was hired in early December of 2011, leaving him two months to reshape the class. How'd WSU do? On paper, things looked good back on Signing Day 2012, but multiple players washed out. However, there were a handful of guys who will be remembered forever in Cougar history. Here's the breakdown. This class could best be described as up and down. The attrition is there, but the remarkable things some were able to accomplish is more than noteworthy.  For WSU's 2012 class, it featured 13 3-star prospects, one 4-star recruit and plenty of 2-star guys. The class includes the most prolific receiver in the history of not only WSU, but the Pac-12 as well. But the class was also highlighted by a large number whose stay in Pullman was all too brief, or never made it to campus at all. Here's the full breakdown" • Receiver Gabe Marks: Ok, we'll go ahead and chalk this one up as a major win for Leach. Marks was at one point an SMU commit, but flipped his verbal to the Cougars. Things worked out pretty well for him at Wazzu. Marks became the Pac-12's all-time leader in receptions this fall with 316 grabs. Not bad at all. • DL Destiny Vaeao: He didn't truly make his presence known until his senior season but when he did, it was something to see. Cougar fans won't forget the way he played down the stretch of his final year. He didn't get drafted, but signed with the Eagles as a free agent and not only made the team, he got in there on Sundays and made plenty of big plays in the NFL his rookie season. • Defensive tackle Robert Barber: Barber's senior year was dominated by headlines away from the field. He was involved in an off-campus fight over the summer and was eventually suspended by WSU mid-season. However, he won in the courts, WSU reinstated him and most importantly, he graduated in December. Despite the off-field issues, Barber was a stud nose tackle for the Cougs from this chair. He's hoping to join Vaeao in the NFL next season. • Linebacker Jeremiah Allison: Was there a player WSU fans loved more than Allison while he was in Pullman? The outgoing linebacker was a steady presence on the field, but won hearts over with his love for Cougar nation off of it. The hard-hitting 'backer was a leader for the defense while out on the Palouse, helping WSU to a huge turnaround in scoring defense his senior year in 2015. https://twitter.com/JeremiahMA8/status/712802452488265730 Here's the breakdown of the rest of the class. • Cornerback Ray Ford: Ford was a highly touted prospect and arrived to WSU with plenty of promise. However, his stay in Pullman was a short one. He left barely after fall camp started because he wasn't cleared by the NCAA. He never returned, going the JC route before winding up at Boise State for his final two seasons. In 2016, he played in all 13 games with one start, and broke up a pair of passes and made two tackles against WSU. • Quarterback Austin Apodaca: Apodaca was known in high school for having a rocket for an arm. He was Connor Halliday's back-up QB early on, but he wasn't long for Pullman. He transferred out of the program and ended up at New Mexico.  • Defensive end Austin Brown: Brown was a late addition to the class. However, his WSU career was a short one. He was kicked off the team following an alleged charge of third-degree theft at the Pullman Walmart. • Linebacker Justin Sagote: Sagote was a JUCO product out of the College of San Mateo. He finished his career in strong fashion at WSU, including a career-high 12 tackles in a late-season upset win at Arizona. • Offensive lineman Sam Jones: Jones was also a JC recruit who signed with WSU. However, he never made his way to campus.  • Safety Taylor Taliulu: Taliulu caught heat from fans on the message boards and he struggled at times at WSU. But he was still the best option available -- he never started less than 10 games each of his final three seasons and he came into his own during his senior campaign, logging 49 tackles in 2015, fifth on the team, along with six pass break-ups. • Offensive lineman Niu Sale: Sale battled weight issues from the moment he set foot on the Pullman campus. He didn't last long at WSU, eventually transferring out.  • Defensive tackle Ioane Gauta: Also a JC recruit, Gauta spent two years in Pullman, with his final season being the one fans will remember him for. The 6-3, 285-pounder was a factor at times in the trenches.  • Wide receiver Robert Lewis: Lewis grayshirted and arrived to WSU in January of 2013. He was also an SMU flip, like Marks. Lewis just wrapped up his junior year, hauling in 33 balls for 294 yards and three touchdowns. Has anyone forgotten about his block in the Utah game two years ago, which freed up Vince Mayle for a long touchdown? • Linebacker Kache Palacio: Palacio was a beast for WSU. He recorded 57 tackles as a junior and 33 as a senior. He had six sacks his final year in Pullman. He landed with the Seattle Seahawks' practice squad last season. • Wide receiver Brett Bartolone: Bartolone blew up his freshman season, earning All Pac-12 Honorable Mention honors. However, his promise was left unfulfilled as injuries led to an early retirement from the game. • Running back/defensive back Teondray Caldwell: Caldwell got his start at WSU as a running back, however, he got moved to defensive back his junior year. Caldwell quit the team midway through that season. • Punter Mike Bowlin: Bowlin was nothing short of a disappointment for the Cougars early on in his career. The JUCO product bounced back, though, and averaged 40.6 yards per punt to end his career. He made 23 starts. • Linebacker Khalil Pettway: After a strong freshman season on the scout team, Pettway had to hang up his cleats due to medical retirement. • Cornerback Alex Jackson: Jackson was recruited by WSU as a receiver, but made his way to the defensive side of the ball. However, he was suspended indefinitely by Leach as a second-year freshman and ended up leaving the program. • Linebacker Feddie Davey: Davey saw plenty of action on special teams as a second-year freshman, but left the program shortly before the 2013 bowl game vs. New Mexico. • Defensive end Keith Ewing: Ewing had high hopes of making a difference for the WSU program, but left the program in 2013. • Running back Theron West: West never truly was able to break through as a key contributor for the Cougars, but he did have a breakout game against Colorado State in the 2013 New Mexico Bowl. WSU lost that one in a heartbreaker, though. • Linebacker Jacob Tuivaiave: The in-state 'backer signed with WSU, but was unable to qualify academically. He never made his way to the Palouse. • Offensive lineman Pierson Villarrubia: Villarubia landed in Pullman all the way from Louisiana. However, his stay in the Northwest was short lived as he transferred to be closer to home. • Offensive lineman Eduardo Middleton: One Middleton found his footing, he wasn't going to be displaced.  Middleton became on of the most productive members on the o-line in the Leach era, posting 38 straight starts to cap his Washington State career. • Offensive lineman Denzell Dotson: Dotson spent one year in Pullman before leaving the program. • Offensive lineman Sam Flor: The O'Dea product logged four career starts at WSU and was the No. 2 center behind Riley Sorenson in 2014 and 2015 but chose to hang up his cleats and start his post-football life with one year of eligibility still remaining before the 2016 season. • Offensive lineman B.J. Salmonson: The pride and joy of Nooksack Valley High is entering his senior year at WSU. Salmonson hasn't been a consistent starter, but is no stranger to PT for the Cougs. In an interview with CF.C this week, offensive line coach Clay McGuire said Salmonson is expected to compete for the starting job at right guard. • Defensive back David Bucannon: The younger brother of CouGreat safety Deone Bucannon, now with the Arizona Cardinals, David transferred out of the WSU program in 2015.

Reuben Gregg Brewer (TMFReubenGBrewer) Feb 9, 2017 at 3:23PM Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) has an impressive dividend record, particularly when you take into consideration that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas services industry. The problem for investors, though, is that a dividend decision a few years ago obscures the income story here. This is one stock where the trend isn't what it seems, and a little more analysis is needed to understand Helmerich & Payne's true dividend potential. 44 years and counting Helmerich & Payne has increased its dividend each and every year for 44 consecutive years. That's nothing short of impressive, putting it up there with companies like Consolidated Edison, Kimberly-Clark Corp, and Wal-Mart. That's rarified air for sure, and it shows a deep commitment to returning value to shareholders. Add in the current yield of roughly 4%, and income investors are sure to be interested. Image source: Helmerich & Payne, Inc. But you can't just stop there. You have to look deeper. For example, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak looks even more impressive when you consider that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas drilling services business. To give you an idea of just how volatile that business is, at the end of fiscal 2016, only 25% of the company's drill rigs were being used by customers. At the end of fiscal 2014, just as oil prices were getting set to tumble, that number was nearly 90%. You have to ask yourself how a company with such variability in demand can keep upping the dividend year-in and year-out? The answer is that it doesn't. Helmerich & Payne has historically increased dividends in the middle of a calendar year, which means it can hold the dividend steady for up to 10 quarters and still maintain its annual streak based on nothing more than timing. In fact, it did just that for eight quarters, when oil prices were tumbling in mid-2014. It only started upping the disbursement again in August of 2016. That doesn't mean you shouldn't own Helmerich & Payne stock; it just means you have to take the dividend history with a grain of salt. Some other reasons it was able to protect the dividend are a conservative culture that favors a low debt load (long-term debt is just 10% of the capital structure) and impressive cash flow. Cash flow, the lifeblood of a company, is worth a deeper look. HP Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Helmerich & Payne builds expensive drill rigs. It then depreciates those costs over the useful lives of the rigs, a non-cash charge that hits earnings. When demand for rigs is high, the expense of building new rigs offsets the depreciation add back on the cash flow statement. In a downturn, though, the company stops building rigs, and the depreciation add back flows right into the company's bank account -- leaving it with plenty of cash to keep paying the dividend. So, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak isn't as clean as it looks, but it is built on a solid foundation. The stock really is worth a closer look for income-focused investors. It's not that big That said, there's one other metric that needs to be considered, here. Over the past three years, Helmerich & Payne's annualized dividend growth rate is 28%. Over the past five years it's 60%. And over the past decade, the dividend grew at an annualized rate of 32%. If that doesn't knock your dividend socks off, nothing will!   HP Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. But somehow, those numbers don't make much sense, particularly when you consider that the dividend was static for eight quarters in a row between 2014 and 2016. Here's what's going on: In calendar year 2012, the company more than doubled the quarterly dividend from $0.07 a share to $0.15. And then in 2013, it increased it again, this time going from $0.15 a share per quarter to a $0.50. Those were huge increases that are unlikely to be repeated. Prior to that span, the dividend was usually increased just a few pennies a year. And since 2014, the dividend has basically been increased just a few pennies a year.   So, the trailing dividend data has to be taken with a grain of salt, too. In fact, the increase over the trailing year was less than 1%. And that low single-digit number is far closer to what you should expect over time than 30% or more. A great company despite the dividend confusion None of this is meant to suggest that Helmerich & Payne is a bad company. When it comes to oil and gas drilling services, it's a top-notch name. And despite the oddities, the 44-year dividend streak is truly impressive for a company in such a cyclical industry. However, as a dividend investor, you need to dig a little deeper, here, to figure out what you are buying. On that score, the future likely holds a continuation of the annual streak based on small dividend increases that may or may not happen on an annual basis. That sounds worse than it really is, but it's the truth you need to understand if you are digging into Helmerich & Payne. Reuben Brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Citizens for a New Hospital Now will host speeches, offer information and provide hot chocolate and cookies at the site of the proposed new $44.5 million hospital, across from Walmart in the Apple Blossom Center, just off Highway 97A. The campaign needs 60 percent approval from voters for a $20 million bond request in a special election on April 25. The rest of the money to build the hospital will come from donations and a loan. On Saturday, those gathered will attempt to outline the footprint of the proposed building with a human chain, and get aerial photos using a drone. More information about the hospital proposal is available at newhospitalnow.com. Reach K.C. Mehaffey at 509-997-2512 or (javascript required to see email).

The group, which includes former Secretary of State James Baker, former Secretary of State George Shultz and former secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, says that $194 billion in revenues would be generated in year one — a figure that it expects to increase to $250 billion a decade later. That money would then be returned to the American people in the form of a “dividend,” although separate versions of the idea have suggested it go toward funding newer technologies to reduce emissions. “If you look at the priorities of President Trump, our plan ticks every one of his boxes,” said Ted Halstead, founder and president of the council, in a press conference in Washington, D.C., in a story by Scientific American. “It is pro-growth. It is pro-jobs. It is pro-competitiveness. It would balance trade. And last but hardly least, it would be good for working-class Americans.” Who else had input? Gregory Mankiw and Martin Feldstein, former chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Rob Walton, the former chairman of Wal-Mart, says the New York Times. The council says that it would help the US fulfill its obligations under the Paris climate accord. The New York Times then noted that Secretary Baker is scheduled to meet with members of the Trump administration. Getting the meeting, though, is the easy part: Convincing the Republican-led House and Senate is the hard part, especially under the leadership of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY, who represents a coal state that does not want any further constraints on the product it mines and sells. That’s not to say that lawmakers eventually be couldn’t be convinced, especially because some of the oil giants have come out in favor of putting a price on carbon: ExxonMobil, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, as reported by Environmental Leader. “It’s really important that we Republicans have a seat at the table when people start talking about climate change,” Secretary Baker said, in the Times piece. “I don’t accept the idea that it’s all man made,” he said, “but I do accept that the risks are sufficiently great that we need to have an insurance policy.” In an earlier phone interview, the former EPA chief under George W. Bush and the former Governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, told this reporter that many national conservatives are deferential to those scientists who say that global warming is largely a function of man-made emissions, notably from burning fossil fuels. But she admits that such thinkers are generally “moderate” and, by nature, are not as vocal as some of the more extreme members of the party. Such challenges and obstacles, however, are no reason to give up — that the scientists are saying that the worst effects of climate change are yet to come. She adds that the money spent repairing the most recent natural disasters is a glimpse into the future. As a governor, Whitman said that she devoted countless hours and public funds to cleaning New Jersey’s shoreline — investments accompanied by handsome returns in terms tourism dollars. To this end, she says that the United States should take a similar approach and that public investments in newer and cleaner technologies will likewise bear fruit. The former EPA chief says that she is sympathetic to those states whose economies have relied on coal and whose coal miners will be adversely affected. But Whitman says that responsible leadership is about making difficult choices. “One thing you learn when you are in a position to make decisions is that you have to do what is in the best interest of the greatest number,” Whitman says. “The decision will have the same impact on everyone but you have to mitigate the negative impact. I’d rather see us bring the new energy technologies to those states most affected. You cannot walk away from what will have the biggest benefit because there will be people who don’t get as good of a deal. At some point, you have to have leadership.” The nation’s cities, she adds, are at the forefront of adopting sustainability standards — choosing to improve the quality of life and to attract people and jobs — to their regions. Whitman points to major companies that are actively improving their communities by pledging to reduce their carbon footprints, as well as that of their suppliers: Texas Instruments Inc., United Technologies Corp. and WalMart. As Whitman says, the climate may be challenging but the cause has never been more important.

Johnson Controls is the world’s largest automotive battery manufacturer. It supplies 146 million batteries a year to auto makers and to replacement-battery sellers Interstate Batteries and retailers such as Costco, Walmart and AutoZone. Under the deal, Johnson Controls will acquire just under 5 percent of Aqua Metals outstanding shares. The company told the Wall Street Journal that its stake in Aqua Metals is worth about $11 million. “It’s a technology that really aligns well with our growth strategy and the way we want to produce batteries in an environmentally friendly way,” said Joe Walicki, president of Johnson Controls Power Solutions. The agreement also makes Johnson Controls the first licensee for Aqua Metal’s technology, which will enable it to extract lead from used car batteries. It will supply Aqua Metals with batteries to recycle, as part of the Johnson Controls closed-loop network, and purchase metals produced from the recycler’s facilities. In a statement, Dr. Stephen Clarke, chairman and CEO of Aqua Metals, said the partnership will “enable clean and efficient battery recycling around the world.” Johnson Controls told the Wall Street Journal that the US replacement battery market grew 8 percent over the past year. It expects to spend $50 million this year to increase production capacity for conventional batteries by 10 million units annually at eight US plants. Instead of smelting, the most common way to recycle lead, Aqua Metal uses an electrochemical process. The room temperature, water-based recycling method produces ingots of ultrapure lead. Because it uses a water-based process, it eliminates virtually all of the toxic waste issues generated by smelting and is safe for the environment, the company says. Last year Aqua Metals signed an agreement with Interstate Batteries under which the automotive battery distributor sends more than 1 million automotive and other lead-acid batteries to be recycled at Aqua Metals’ AquaRefineries. Interstate Batteries also invested about $10 million into Aqua Metals.   Categories Manufacturing, WasteTags Aqua Metals, Batteries, closed loop, Johnson Controls, rwrr Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Wind surpassed hydropower dams to become the largest source of renewable electric capacity in the U.S., and the fourth largest overall.  Business leaders from General Motors and the U.S. wind energy industry met Thursday morning to mark this historic milestone and release AWEA’s Fourth Quarter 2016 U.S. Wind Industry Market Report at General Motor’s Arlington Assembly Plant, which will soon be 100 percent wind-powered. “American wind power is now the #1 source of renewable capacity, thanks to more than 100,000 wind workers across all 50 states,” said Tom Kiernan, AWEA CEO. “Growing this made-in-the-USA clean energy resource helps rural communities pay for new roads, bridges, and schools, while bringing back manufacturing jobs to the Rust Belt. With our two-thirds cost reduction over the last seven years, household brands like General Motors, Walmart, and more are buying low-cost wind energy to cut costs and power their businesses. American wind power is on track to double our output over the next five years, and supply 10 percent of U.S. electricity by 2020.” “With more wind energy production and more wind workers than any other state, if you want to know how wind works for America, just ask a Texan,” added Kiernan. At the close of 2016, the American wind fleet totaled 82,183 MW, enough to power 24 million average American homes. And with the addition of North Carolina’s first utility-scale wind farm announced earlier today, there are now more than 52,000 individual wind turbines in 41 states plus Guam and Puerto Rico. GM’s Arlington Assembly Plant produces over 1,000 SUVs a day and is 50 percent powered by wind energy today. Starting in 2018, Arlington Assembly will be GM’s first plant to have all of its electricity needs met with wind energy. The company purchases energy from two Texas wind farms, RES’s Cactus Flats in Concho County and EDPR’s Los Mirasoles Wind Farm in Edinburg. Non-utility purchasers, like GM, Microsoft, and the Department of Defense, represent 39 percent of wind purchased through long-term contracts in 2016, totaling 1,574 megawatts (MW). More than half of that capacity is located in Texas. “At GM, we’re committed to efforts in our facilities that create business value and strengthen communities where we live and work,” said Rob Threlkeld, GM global manager of renewable energy. “Using wind power delivers on this by securing more stable energy costs while reducing our impact on the environment.” While buying low-cost wind energy helps make other industries more competitive, building wind turbines is also big business in the U.S. The wind industry employs 25,000 Americans at over 500 factories in 43 states. This includes 40 wind manufacturing facilities across Texas. In 2016, at least seven companies across the U.S. expanded existing manufacturing facilities to meet growing orders, and GRI Renewable Industries opened a new tower facility in Amarillo, Texas. Over 100,000 American workers now manufacture, construct, and maintain the U.S. wind turbine fleet according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In total, wind supports more American jobs than nuclear, natural gas, coal, or hydroelectric power plants. New growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, announced for the first time today, includes 6,478 MW, the second strongest quarter for U.S. wind power installations on record. For the year, wind developers added 8,203 MW of wind power capacity representing more than $13.8 billion in new investment. With 99 percent of wind projects located in rural areas, much of this investment is flowing to communities that need it most. Rural and Rust Belt America are among the greatest beneficiaries of wind power development. Wind projects in these areas often become the largest contributors to the property tax base, helping to improve schools, roads and other public services. Of the $13.8 billion invested by the U.S. wind industry last year, $10.5 billion was invested in low-income counties. Wind is a new drought-resistant cash crop for farmers and ranchers who host wind turbines on their land. Nationwide, wind projects provide private landowners with more than $245 million in land lease payments annually. Texas landowners receive more than $60 million of that, in many cases helping to keep farms and ranches in their families. Wind power is in high demand from utilities and other buyers because it often provides the least expensive energy available. Wind power can bring costs down further and create American jobs thanks to policy stability that passed in 2015 with bipartisan support in Congress. “Wind power isn’t a red or blue industry, it’s red, white and blue,” said Kiernan. “Low-cost, homegrown wind energy is something we can all agree on. States like Texas and Iowa are leading the way in terms of wind turbines and wind jobs.” Texas is the undisputed leader in wind energy, with approximately three times more wind generating capacity than any other state and nearly a quarter of American wind jobs. The state continues to expand wind power, becoming the first state to pass 20,000 MW of wind capacity last year, which is roughly one-fourth of national capacity. More wind is on the way in Texas. Even with the 1,790 MW installed in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is still 5,401 MW under construction and another 1,288 MW in advanced development. The Texas model for energy development stems from genuine commitment to an “all of the above” energy mix.  Free markets allowed wind to prosper in Texas, creating a low-cost, balanced energy portfolio for the state. Texas has captured $38 billion in wind investment to date and supports up to 25,000 wind jobs today. The state has also benefited from investment by corporate energy buyers who want to site data centers and factories close to the wind farms that power their facilities. A key part of the success story in Texas has been a strong backbone of transmission infrastructure – the power lines that deliver all forms of energy to homes and businesses. Texas’s CREZ (Competitive Renewable Energy Zone) transmission lines and the state’s long-standing recognition that a strong grid is essential for a free market in electricity have become the national model for transmission investments that more than pay for themselves. Looking ahead, transmission projects like Pattern Development’s proposed Southern Cross Transmission Project will allow Texas to benefit by exporting its abundant wind energy to customers in the Southeast. Wind power growth is now spreading up from Texas into the Plains states and across the Midwest. In fact, 89 percent of newly completed capacity in 2016 is found in these states. The U.S. offshore wind industry also launched in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the commissioning of the 30 MW Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island. Gulf Island Fabrication in Louisiana manufactured the foundations for the Block Island project, reflecting a broader opportunity for oil and gas suppliers to earn additional business in offshore wind.  As a result of the generating capacity of wind turbines in the U.S. standing at over 82,000 MW, greater than the 80,000 MW of hydropower generating capacity, wind power is now the fourth largest source of generating capacity, behind gas, coal, and nuclear.  For a library of up-to-date library images of wind energy, please use this link: http://www.awea.org/MediaCenter/content.aspx?ItemNumber=7244 ### AWEA is the national trade association of the U.S. wind energy industry. We represent 1,000 member companies and over 100,000 jobs in the U.S. economy, serving as a powerful voice for how wind works for America.
