After about a year with not many choices for grocery shopping, residents of Decatur are excited to have a place to go in town for groceries. “I think after Walmart left, Decatur was really heartbroken and everyone really had to pick up the pieces," Heaven Butler said. "So I think Dollar General doing this is really a nice thing to do.” The new plans for the store include adding more products like meat, produce and will even offer gasoline. The store expects to employ 15 people depending on the needs of the store. Butler has lived in Decatur all of her life and when the Walmart Express left, she said her family chose to go to Gravette for their grocery needs. Others like Jessica Cheney and her family choose to go to the Walmart in Siloam Springs. “My mom doesn’t have a job currently so it’s easier for us to be able to shop here in town cause it doesn’t take up near as much gas just driving around here but driving all the way to Siloam is just a huge hassle," Cheney said. She said she thinks being able to drive just a few minuets in town will be a huge benefit to everyone in Decatur. Butler said she was excited to be able to get gas and a gallon of milk all in one place instead of going from one location to another. The store plans to open the new location by summer.

By Lindsey Rupp, Richard Clough and Matt Townsend Bloomberg News  February 03, 2017 General Electric and Boeing are girding for a showdown with corporate giants including Walmart over a proposed US tax on imports, setting up a battle across industries that could be one of the most fractious in recent corporate history. GE and Boeing are among about two dozen companies that have formed the ‘‘American Made Coalition,’’ a group representing makers of domestic goods that will promote efforts to overhaul the US tax code. They say the so-called border-adjusted tax would help US manufacturers compete with products made overseas, giving a boost to President Trump’s goal of increasing factory jobs. Advertisement The battle is opening up a fault line in corporate America, with net importers mostly on one side and exporters on the other. Billions of dollars are at stake: The proposed overhaul of the corporate tax code, supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Democrat, would reward companies that sell products outside the United States while punishing ones that rely on low-cost overseas suppliers. ‘‘I respect Walmart, but we’re going to have a different perspective on tax reform as Walmart,’’ Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s chief executive officer, said in an interview this week in Boston. ‘‘I think all of our voices need to be heard.’’ Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Sign up for more newsletters here Opponents of the border-adjusted tax say it would force companies to pass the increases to customers — boosting prices for everything from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts — without sparking a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. On Wednesday, more than 120 trade groups representing the auto industry and retailers such as Walmart backed a campaign, called ‘‘Americans for Affordable Products,’’ which focuses on the effect of a border tax on consumers. ‘‘This ultimately comes down to a decision of whether or not policy makers are willing to heap a tax onto consumers so that some corporations can never pay taxes again,’’ said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is overseeing the effort to derail the proposal. Part of the opponents’ message is that export-focused companies may get their federal taxes drastically cut, maybe even to zero. Behind the scenes, their campaign will rely in part on lobbying by industry executives. Advertisement Republicans in the House of Representatives backing an overhaul have to win support from the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House to succeed. The border-adjusted tariff is key to the Republicans’ proposal because it would help pay for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate. Trump is warming to the idea after previously criticizing it, a senior administration official told Bloomberg News last week. In addition to GE and Boeing, the group in favor of the tax includes Dow Chemical Co., Eli Lilly, and Pfizer. Immelt said the proposed tax changes would help domestic manufacturers and contribute to Trump’s goal of boosting jobs in the United States. GE, he noted, exports more than $20 billion of products a year from the United States, while importing just a quarter of that. Still, he acknowledged that there will be ‘‘different camps’’ in the business community. Several Senate Republicans have raised doubts about a border-adjusted tax, including Georgia’s David Perdue and Utah’s Mike Lee, who said in an editorial in the Federalist magazine that it ‘‘could ravage huge swaths of our economy.’’ Democrats on the Senate finance committee have blasted the proposal, saying in a December memo that it was ‘‘risky, untested, and especially vulnerable to unforeseen consequences’’ like soaring consumer prices.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Petition filed by Apple Valley, Wal-Mart denied by Court of Appeal Thursday Feb 2, 2017 at 3:38 PM Feb 2, 2017 at 4:13 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe RIVERSIDE — An appellate court on Tuesday denied a petition filed by attorneys for the town and Wal-Mart asking for a review of the court’s ruling that a ballot measure passed to bring a Supercenter to Apple Valley was illegal. The denial order filed in the 4th District Court of Appeal came 11 days after Apple Valley and Wal-Mart attorneys filed a rehearing petition, and the language of the denial was brief. “Appellants petition for rehearing is denied,” the document read, according to a 4th District staffer who spoke with the Daily Press on Wednesday. The town has remained relatively tight-lipped since the appellate court’s Jan. 5 ruling that upheld a 2015 trial-court decision that the Town Council violated the Brown Act by approving an un-agendized memorandum of understanding with Wal-Mart that would have funded the special election for the town's Measure D — the "Walmart Initiative Measure" — which voters passed in November 2013.  The ruling nullified Measure D, effectively ending the chances for a Supercenter in the town in the near future. On Wednesday, the town and Wal-Mart issued a joint statement that continued their penchant for brevity on the matter. “The Town of Apple Valley and Walmart are disappointed that the Court of Appeal did not take the opportunity to correct a factual error in its decision," the statement read. “The Town and Walmart will be considering the next steps, if any.” The “factual error” mentioned therein relates to what Town Manager Frank Robinson has called “incorrect facts” that he said were the premise of the Brown Act violation decision. "The trial court actually did not find that the decision to send the initiatives to the voters violated the Brown Act," Robinson previously said. In a statement concerning their petition to the appellate court, the town and Wal-Mart said, “the trial court found that the Town did not violate the Brown Act in approving the Resolutions (of Necessity) setting the Special Election, and we believe it is important for the Court of Appeal to understand that fact correctly in making its decision.” In court documents, however, the three-justice panel focused on the un-agendized MOU, stating, “In none of the (town) documents was the 'item of business' that Town council was going to accept a gift from Walmart in order to pay for a special election to pass the Initiative.” It was that aspect of the previous ruling that the appellate court upheld concerning the violation. And court documents show that “since the decision to place the Initiative on the ballot by the Town Council is null and void based on the Brown Act violation, the Initiative is null and void.” A petition for review in the California Supreme Court is available to both sides but, according to court documents, the town could also restart the process and bring another initiative to voters in a future election. Whether that will be the next step, however, remains to be seen. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Every Monday through Saturday, 8 to 9 a.m., he can be found at the McDonalds in the Walmart Supercenter on U.S. 19 N. There he meets with friends and residents, helping to solve problems and answer questions about the city. PINELLAS PARK  Most days of the week, Bill Mischlers day starts the same way. Mondays through Saturdays, unless he has a Pinellas Park/Gateway Chamber of Commerce breakfast or a Vincent House board meeting, he leaves his Mainlands home to sit in the McDonalds of the Walmart Supercenter at 8001 U.S. 19 N. from 8 to 9 a.m. Hes joined sometimes by as many as 20 old friends and city residents. Some have questions about city codes or new businesses coming to town. Others have problems that he tries to help them solve. Most still call him mayor. I dont even try to correct them anymore, he said. These are his office hours. Hes kept them since 2001, a few years after becoming mayor of Pinellas Park, a role he held for 14 years until retiring in 2012. Hes been joined at this McDonalds by sheriffs and state representatives. Though he had a nice office at city hall, for Mischler, 75, when everyone is sitting at the same Formica table at that fast-food joint, theyre on the same level. I dont care if youre the governor, he said. Ill ask you to meet me here. When Mischler stepped down as mayor, he had spent 41 years in public service with the city. Nine of those years were on the planning and zoning board  five as chair  and 32 on the City Council. He fully intended to travel, and spend time with his wife and family. They did travel a bit, he said. I love cruises, he said. But his wife has faced some medical issues in recent years. So they travel less. I cant be down in the Caribbean and she has a pancreatic attack and Im stuck in Belize or something, Mischler said. Even without the title of mayor, he felt the pull to do what hed always done: help the people. You can take Mischler out of the City Council, but you cant take the City Council out of Mischler. I love doing things for people, he said. Im a people person. I cant change me. In recent years, he served as healthcare surrogate and power of attorney for two elderly women, neighbors of his who have since died. With one, he spent nearly two hours every day making sure she was safe and comfortable in her nursing home. The other he visited every Sunday with a bag of popcorn, driving with it on his dashboard to keep it warm. They had no family, their spouses had died, he said. I liked to think about how I would feel in their positions. Then there are nonprofit groups he works with. In addition to the Vincent House board, he also sits on the board for Northside Hospital and works with the organization Clothes for Kids. While working in city government, Mischler quickly earned a reputation as an advocate for the people. He remembers the first planning and zoning board public hearing he attended. It was 1970 and hed read about it in the local newspaper. So he figured he would check it out. Pinellas Park was a different place at the time, he said. Cars sat on cement blocks in driveways. The city still had numerous dirt roads. And many homes were in disarray. It was trash, he said. It was redneck. But its changed. The city had a bad reputation, he added. For many years, it was bad, if you were a minority you better be passing through, he said. I dont care what race you are, creed, whatever, youre always welcome in this city. But that was the old good ol boy attitude years ago. Thankfully its changed. So when Mischler attended that first planning and development meeting, he was interested in learning more about the community and its issues. But when I went there and they opened the public hearing, they all looked at me, because I was the only one in the audience, he said. I thought, these people are passing things and nobody cares. This is when he was first moved to get involved with the city. If there had been two or three more people in the audience, I wouldnt have gotten started, he said. I was an introvert. I was a total introvert. I was shy, really backwards. As he attended more meetings, he was invited to join the board. He started as an alternate member and served as its chair for his last five years on it. Then, in 1980 he decided to take the next step and run for City Council, which is where he stayed until 2014. He said he had a successful run on council, but doesnt take the credit. It was the employees that made me successful, he said. Any leader, youre only as good as the people working beneath you. They made me and we had the best employees in the city. People often encouraged him to run for higher office, but he quickly would shut down those suggestions. He prides himself on not being part of any political party or organization. I like to help people. Im here for the people. Im not a politician, Mischler said. I could have run for higher office. But I have to live with myself and I cant do that. Article published on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017 Copyright © Tampa Bay Newspapers: All rights reserved.

They say the so-called  border-adjusted tax would help U.S. manufacturers compete with products made overseas. More About: Trump and Manufacturing Advertisement General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are girding for a showdown with corporate giants including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. over a proposed U.S. tax on imports, setting up a battle across industries that could be one of the most fractious in recent corporate history. GE and Boeing are among about two dozen companies that have formed the “ American Made Coalition,” a group representing makers of domestic goods that will promote efforts to overhaul the U.S. tax code. They say the so-called  border-adjusted tax would help U.S. manufacturers compete with products made overseas, giving a boost to President Donald Trump’s goal of increasing factory jobs. The battle is opening up a fault line in corporate America, with net importers mostly on one side and exporters on the other. Billions of dollars are at stake: The  proposed overhaul of the corporate tax code, supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan, would reward companies that sell products outside the U.S. while punishing ones that rely on low-cost overseas suppliers. “I respect Wal-Mart, but we’re going to have a different perspective on tax reform as Wal-Mart,”  Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s chief executive officer, said in an interview this week in Boston. “I think all of our voices need to be heard.” Popular Now The Ups and Downs of Made in the USA Addressing Privacy and Security Issues in the Connected Car Sewing Digital Transformation into the Fabric of the Textiles Industry Higher Prices Opponents of the border-adjusted tax say it would force companies to pass the increases to customers -- boosting prices for everything from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts -- without sparking a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. On Feburary 1, more than 120 trade groups representing the auto industry and retailers such as Wal-Mart backed a campaign, called “ Americans for Affordable Products,” which focuses on the impact of a border tax on consumers. “This ultimately comes down to a decision of whether or not policy makers are willing to heap a tax onto consumers so that some corporations can never pay taxes again,” said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is overseeing the effort to derail the proposal. Part of the opponents’ message is that export-focused companies may get their federal taxes drastically cut, maybe even to zero. Behind the scenes, their campaign will rely in part on lobbying by industry executives. Republicans in the House of Representatives backing an overhaul have to win support from the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House to succeed. The border-adjusted tariff is key to the Republicans’ proposal because it would help pay for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate. Trump is warming to the idea after previously criticizing it, a senior administration official told Bloomberg News last week. Besides GE and Boeing, the group in favor of the tax includes Dow Chemical Co., Eli Lilly & Co. and Pfizer Inc. Immelt said the proposed tax changes would help domestic manufacturers and contribute to Trump’s goal of boosting jobs in the U.S. GE, he noted, exports more than $20 billion of products a year from the U.S., while importing just a quarter of that. Still, he acknowledged that there will be “different camps” in the business community. Several Republicans in the Senate have raised doubts about a border-adjusted tax, including Georgia’s David Perdue and Utah’s Mike Lee, who said in an editorial in the Federalist magazine that it “could ravage huge swaths of our economy.” Democrats on the Senate finance committee have blasted the proposal, saying in a December memo that it was “risky, untested and especially vulnerable to unforeseen consequences” like soaring consumer prices.

Many strange and unsettling things have been happening over the past month and, well, where does one begin? How about with Wal-Mart, and the Sonoma County District Attorney? Got a press release earlier today from Joseph Langenbahm, the spokesman, who announced that D.A. Jill Ravitch and 22 other district attorneys around the state had settled with the mega-corporation over a lawsuit that teed off on plastic products sold in California "that were misleadingly labeled as 'biodegradable' or 'compostable' in violation of California law." Whoops. Wal-Mart's now on the hook for $940,000 in penalties and pay-outs. Here's some backdrop provided by the DA's office: Back in 2004 the state passed a bunch of laws under the Public Resources Code, which limited the sale of plastics marked as biodegradable on the reasoning that degradability is a relative term subject to the whims of the environment within which the plastic is deposited. For example, landfills don't have a whole lot of oxygen in them, "which can significantly hamper the ability to biodegrade," according to the D.A.'s office. Without proper labeling to indicate as much, the claims are "inherently misleading to consumers purchasing plastic products based on an assumption that the products will quickly biodegrade after disposal." Now Wal-Mart is forbidden, as in verboten, to offer labeling on plastic products that claim the product is biodegradable, degradable or decompostable, according to Langenbahm's missive (the ruling also applies to an outfit called Jet.com, a WalMart subsidiary). The penalty is split three ways: $875,000 in civil penalties for Wal-Mart; a $50,000 payout to CalRecyle "to fund testing of plastic products marketed to consumers as compostable or degradable," and another $15,000 in civil penalties from Jet.com. The county's windfall in the suit is not insignificant, as the Sonoma County's Consumer Fraud fund "will receive $89,000 as a result of the resolution." Speaking of frauds, and in other news—the end is near? China, whose many and inexpensive plastic products find their way to Wal-Mart, not to mention Trump-run gift shops, is ratcheting its nuclear profile and pointing big bombs at California as Steve Bannon declares that there's definitely gonna be a war in the South China Sea, stay tuned. I've always said that America would never sanction a war against China, given our national fixation on Chinese takeout. I am not so sure Gen. Tso would agree, the chickenhawks are unloosed and it's getting downright freaky out there.

GE, Boeing and Pfizer Inc. are among about two dozen companies that have formed the “ American Made Coalition,” a group representing makers of domestic goods that will promote efforts to overhaul the U.S. tax code. They say the so-called  border-adjusted tax would help U.S. manufacturers compete with products made overseas, giving a boost to President Donald Trump’s goal of increasing factory jobs. The battle is opening up a fault line in corporate America, with net importers mostly on one side and exporters on the other. Billions of dollars are at stake: The proposed overhaul of the corporate tax code, supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan, would reward companies that sell products outside the U.S. while punishing ones that rely on low-cost overseas suppliers. “I respect Wal-Mart, but we’re going to have a different perspective on tax reform as Wal-Mart,” Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s chief executive officer, said in an interview this week in Boston. “I think all of our voices need to be heard.” Higher Prices Opponents of the border-adjusted tax say it would force companies to pass the increases to customers -- boosting prices for everything from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts -- without sparking a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. On Wednesday, more than 120 trade groups representing the auto industry and retailers such as Wal-Mart backed a campaign, called “ Americans for Affordable Products,” which focuses on the impact of a border tax on consumers.  “This ultimately comes down to a decision of whether or not policy makers are willing to heap a tax onto consumers so that some corporations can never pay taxes again,” said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is overseeing the effort to derail the proposal.  Part of the opponents’ message is that export-focused companies may get their federal taxes drastically cut, maybe even to zero. Behind the scenes, their campaign will rely in part on lobbying by industry executives. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Republicans in the House of Representatives backing an overhaul have to win support from the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House to succeed. The border-adjusted tariff is key to the Republicans’ proposal because it would help pay for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate. Trump is warming to the idea after previously criticizing it, a senior administration official told Bloomberg News last week.  $20 Billion Besides GE, Boeing and Pfizer, the group in favor of the tax includes Dow Chemical Co. and Eli Lilly & Co. Immelt said the proposed tax changes would help domestic manufacturers and contribute to Trump’s goal of boosting jobs in the U.S. GE, he noted, exports more than $20 billion of products a year from the U.S., while importing just a quarter of that. Still, he acknowledged that there will be “different camps” in the business community. Several Republicans in the Senate have raised doubts about a border-adjusted tax, including Georgia’s David Perdue and Utah’s Mike Lee, who said in an editorial in the Federalist magazine that it “could ravage huge swaths of our economy.” Democrats on the Senate finance committee have blasted the proposal, saying in a December memo that it was “risky, untested and especially vulnerable to unforeseen consequences” like soaring consumer prices.

Neal: Dems take stand on taxes    19 Hours Ago | 03:10 There's risk that Washington's plan to give Corporate America a big tax break could backfire and create a fat tax on consumers. That's because the key way the House Republicans would pay for the cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent depends on a controversial border-adjusted tax, which in turn relies on a sharply rising dollar. The proposal would tax all imports into the U.S. at the corporate tax rate of 20 percent, and would exempt exports from any taxes at all. Critics say it could create a jump in prices for everything from gasoline to TVs and blue jeans. Supporters say it could create jobs in America, and companies like exporters Dow Chemical have been talking positively about the tax. The problem is that the plan relies on the dollar rising sharply — 25 percent — so that the cost of imported goods doesn't noticeably rise. But that significant jump in the greenback required to neutralize the impact, seems to be at odds with the Trump administration, whose officials have talked down the U.S. dollar, saying it's too strong. The dollar has lost about 1.8 percent since Inauguration Day, in part due to those comments from Trump officials and President Donald Trump himself. Whether the dollar would rise, as expected by the plan's proponents, is an unknown, according to a number of strategists. And it's a point of disagreement on Wall Street. "We won't know the answer to that until we do it," said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. He also said it's unclear whether the proposal, floated by the House Ways and Means Committee, would be applied to all industries or if would be exemptions. The border-adjusted tax, as currently proposed by House Republicans, is expected to generate more than $1 trillion over ten years to partially offset the tax cut. The destination-based tax would mean that companies would not deduct the costs of imported goods, and would not include export revenue in their tax base. Wall Street has dissected and speculated about the tax but sees a relatively low chance of it passing. Big exporters like Boeing see it positively, but it's being opposed by retailers, like Target and Best Buy, who see a direct hit on their bottom line. Companies aligned on both sides have organized themselves. show chapters Kudlow: Cut taxes now    Friday, 27 Jan 2017 | 4:17 PM ET | 05:20 The American Made Coalition says it represents 25 companies in manufacturing, energy, agriculture, technology and other industries that favor a border-adjusted tax. Wal-Mart, Target, Saks and other retailers have their own group - Americans for Affordable Products. Goldman Sachs economists Thursday echoed what others have also worried about — the dollar may not appreciate completely, and there could be "short-run adjustment" frictions. "In the U.S., these frictions include higher inflation that would disproportionately hurt low-income households; lower margins for importers in industries such as apparel and higher margins for exporters in industries such as aerospace; changes in trade flows, and a hit to net foreign assets," they wrote in a note. The Goldman economists said the border adjustment could boost inflation by 0.8 percent in the first year but there could be effects in the range of 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent. "The key assumption behind our estimate is that importers facing a higher tax bill would pass on some share of their cost increase to consumers, but import-competing domestic producers would not raise their prices as quickly, realizing that the prices of imports should eventually come back down. If the transition became very protracted, the domestic price level could rise more broadly," they wrote. There could also be a ripple effect in the emerging world, where dollar-denominated debt could become much more expensive, and the stronger dollar could curb appetite for U.S. exports, the Goldman economists said. Credit Suisse strategists also wrote recently that if the dollar were to appreciate by 25 percent, as expected by tax writers, there would be a half percent hit to Asian GDP. The Asian economies most hurt would be Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia because they export durable goods and demand is more sensitive to changes in import prices. But the border tax is not without its merits. Strategists say it would level the playing field for the U.S. because many countries around the world use a Value Added Tax. David Woo, head of global rates and currencies at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said with modifications, it could be an elegant solution to pay for tax reform, if it is phased in gradually. "They're going to try to move in line with international taxation systems, like VAT. The U.S. will be doing what everybody else would be doing, and then the border adjusted tax is going to raise $1 trillion. It's not something you could basically just throw away. It's a lynch pin of the entire corporate tax reform," said Woo. But he said there are some aspects that have not gotten much attention and could have consequences. "Most of Wal-Mart's contracts, whatever they import. the contracts are negotiated in U.S. dollars," as are the contracts of other importers, he said. "So from the point of view the dollar really goes up, they negotiated in dollars…the irony is we import more from China than anywhere else. The RMB would have to go down against the U.S. dollar. That is what Trump doesn't want." Trump has said China unfairly undervalues its currency, though it has been actively supporting the yuan since late last year. "It's a difficult contradiction to reconcile. I'm optimistic the border adjustment tax will go through but not in this current state," said Woo. There are questions being raised in Washington, where if it is perceived as a 'Wal-mart tax,' or tax on Wal-mart shoppers, it may lose some appeal. Sen. Orrin Hatch, head of the Senate Finance Committee, said Wednesday there are questions about whether the tax would burden consumers and businesses or be acceptable under international trade rules. He did not reject the idea of the tax but his comments suggested it may have difficulty passing the Senate. House Speaker Paul Ryan, however, says it's an important part of tax reform, and on Thursday he said serious talks on tax reform won't begin until the spring. The stock market has risen, in part on hopes that tax reform will be a windfall for corporate earnings. The average S&P 500 company pays about a 25 percent corporate tax rate, and without the border tax there is no revenue to bring down that tax rate to the 20 percent level. Strategas has said without the border tax, the rate would get to about 25 percent. "Hatch is now indicating that the Senate may pursue a separate tax reform bill from the House version, with the assumption being that a border adjustment tax cannot pass the Senate. That of course could change if Trump puts his weight behind the House bill, but we won't know that for a couple of weeks," wrote Strategas Dan Clifton in a note. Clifton, head of policy research, points out that the dollar is not reflecting the idea of a border tax, but some stocks are. Besides retail, there would be a definite impact on the energy industry, if it is applied broadly. The border tax could drive up the cost of U.S. domestic crude, versus overseas oil, and even Canadian crude, half of all U.S. imports. It would also push up the price of gasoline at the pump, according to Citigroup, and there are some estimates it could be about $0.30 per gallon, as average retail prices jump 15 percent year over year. Refiners would have a mixed impact, with east coast refiners, seeing a negative impact because of their dependence on foreign oil. "There are very clear winners and losers that come out of it as well," said Eric Lee, energy analyst at Citigroup. "The thing with oil, specifically, is it's all U.S. dollar denominated, so there isn't that dollar impact. It doesn't play the same way for oil or crude or gasoline. All in all, it raises domestic crude prices. WTI could be more expensive than Brent." The U.S., as of November, was producing about 8.9 million barrels a day and was importing about 8.1 million barrels a day. North America has a tightly linked, complex maze of energy interconnections, and U.S. refineries buy oil by grade, not necessarily by geographical location of the source. The balance between imports and exports would shift, and U.S. oil production could pick up even more, said Lee. "Domestic crude producers can raise their prices until it matches the import price, or at least there's a balance," he said. There would be varied impacts by region. "Gulf coast, you probably have good access to domestic crude and probably exporting gasoline and diesel. You might see higher crude exports," he said. "It really artificially would raise exports out of the U.S. and would tend to put downward pressure on global prices and upward pressure on U.S. oil." In a note, Citi analysts said: "With an assumed 20 percent corporate tax rate, it would imply a combined price shift of (about) $12 at $55 spot oil to close arbitrages. The lack of specificity in the current proposals makes pinpointing exact effects tricky, but it would undoubtedly be negative for the US oil consumer [individual and corporate], a positive for US oil production and would likely create a spectrum of winners and losers in the refinery landscape." show chapters Trump meets with CEOs and pledges to cut taxes 'massively'    Monday, 23 Jan 2017 | 9:27 AM ET | 03:13 Patti DommCNBC Markets Editor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change BA --- USD INDEX --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Angelo Nieves talks to the media at the scene after an officer fired shots at a suspect following an altercation at the Walmart Neighborhood Market on Chickasaw Road, in Orlando, Tuesday January 31, 2017. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Orange County sheriff's office Public Information Officer Capt. Angelo Nieves talks to the media at the scene after an officer fired shots at a suspect following an altercation at the Walmart Neighborhood Market on Chickasaw Road, in Orlando, Tuesday January 31, 2017. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Gal Tziperman LotanContact Reporter Privacy Policy At least three women accused Abrahan Canaan of harassment or stalking before he was shot by two Orange County deputies and arrested outside a Wal-Mart on Tuesday afternoon, court records show. Canaan, 50, is at Florida Hospital East in critical but stable condition, sheriff’s spokeswoman Jane Watrel said Wednesday. He faces two counts of attempted murder of a law-enforcement officer and one count of resisting an officer with violence. According to deputies, Canaan, with a 9-inch buck knife, was at the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market on Chickasaw Trail stalking another woman, a store employee, when he was confronted by deputies.  He was shot after he disobeyed their orders.  But the woman there was not the only one in his sights, records show: On Jan. 20, two roommates living off North Chickasaw Trail filed requests for civil injunctions, also known as restraining orders, accusing him of watching them through windows, leaving unwanted gifts on their doorstep, and cursing them when they rejected the presents in a way that made them feel unsafe, according to court records. Deputies shot a man near the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market on Chickasaw Trail in east Orange County. Court records show Canaan also had a history of stalking and erratic behavior with a former wife, who filed an injunction of her own in 2013. In her request, his wife said Canaan was upset about their divorce. She said he wanted to give her a car and threatened her when she declined his offer. She wrote that she was worried about his mental state, as he had used drugs in the past and was not taking medication prescribed to him for bipolar disorder. “[Canaan] told my mother I had a ‘devil’ inside me and he need to ‘take the devil out of me,’” she wrote. He allegedly violated that injunction in September 2014, sending dozens of text messages at a time to her and her family members, records show. One morning, she counted 100 messages between 5 and 8:30 a.m., she told police. His former wife went to authorities. She said he was not violent, but she worried that he was following her. He was arrested, pleaded no contest to a charge of disorderly conduct and was sentenced to 15 days in jail, which he had already served. In early January, two roommates in his apartment complex, The Woodlands Apartment Homes, started finding gifts on their doorstep: gas station coffee cups,  Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme chocolate bars, a sandwich, water bottles. There were no notes attached, and the two women did not know who the gifts were coming from, court records show. They suspected they might be from Canaan, who lived in the complex and had been watching them through their windows, but had no proof. They took them off their doorstep and threw them away. On Jan. 17, more gifts appeared: some chocolate, three small cigars and a pack of Marlboro cigarettes. One of the roommates decided to leave the gifts where she found them and add a note: “I don’t know if you think a friend lives here (but even leaving things on our doorstep without knocking is creepy), but we don’t know you. Please stop leaving things.” Orange County deputies shoot Wal-Mart stalking suspect David Harris and Gal Tziperman Lotan A 50-year-old man shot by two Orange County sheriff’s deputies on Tuesday outside at a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in east Orange County is in critical but stable condition Wednesday, authorities said.

Abrahan Canaan is accused of stalking an employee at the store Tuesday morning, then returning... (David Harris and Gal Tziperman Lotan) She left for class in mid-afternoon, and her roommate started getting ready for her own class. She heard dogs barking, looked out the window and saw Canaan walking to her apartment, she wrote. “I ran to my door just to see if it was him and there he was, leaning and picking up the items,” she wrote. “I could see him reading the note we had left and to my surprise he began yelling and shouting obscenities and swearing loudly.” The woman said she felt “unsafe and scared,” records show. She called 911. Deputies spoke with Canaan, who yelled and cursed at them as well, records show. One of the deputies suggested that the woman file an injunction.  On Tuesday, deputies saw Canaan outside the store. He allegedly disobeyed their orders, so they shot him, Capt. Angelo Nieves said. Canaan got into his car and tried to run the deputies over as he fled, Nieves said. Deputies cornered his car outside the parking lot and arrested him. They found an ax in his Toyota Corolla. A hearing for a judge to finalize the injunctions was set for Tuesday at 1 p.m. By then, Canaan was in Florida Hospital East being treated for his injuries. The injunctions were finalized without him, records show. glotan@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5774 Caption Report: bachelorette party that included cocaine-filled rubber ducky leads to firings at State Attorney's Office Employees of the State Attorney's Office in Orlando went to a bachelorette party in New Orleans where someone bought a rubber ducky that contained cocaine.   Employees of the State Attorney's Office in Orlando went to a bachelorette party in New Orleans where someone bought a rubber ducky that contained cocaine.   Caption Report: bachelorette party that included cocaine-filled rubber ducky leads to firings at State Attorney's Office Employees of the State Attorney's Office in Orlando went to a bachelorette party in New Orleans where someone bought a rubber ducky that contained cocaine.   Employees of the State Attorney's Office in Orlando went to a bachelorette party in New Orleans where someone bought a rubber ducky that contained cocaine.   Caption Woman stabs man who tried to rape her in Lake County A violent attack near the Four Corners area in Lake County early Thursday ended with a woman stabbing a man who allegedly tried to rape her.

Furner, who succeeded Rosalind Brewer, is not a stranger around Walmart. He’s logged nearly 24 years at the retail giant, starting at the bottom while taking a part-time job at the Bentonville Supercenter in 1993. Furner said he was attending the University of Arkansas and when his band broke up, he had some free time and decided to look up Wal-Mart for a job. Furner’s dad worked at Wal-Mart for 17 years and he had no plans to follow in those footsteps. But then he said the way Sam and Bud Walton took care of his family when his mom fell ill left a deep impression on him. “It was in that moment I knew how tremendously important people were to Walmart,” Furner noted in his blog. “I also knew I wanted to work for and with the organization that had provided so much support to my family. As I transition into this new role, I’m going to do a lot of listening, especially to the associates closest to our members. Like Sam said, ‘listen to everyone in your company.’” Furner described his career at Wal-Mart as “an amazing ride” from his first hourly job to assistant store manager, assistant buyer, store manager, district manager and buyer, all by the age of 31. In 2006, Furner became a vice president and has since held various leadership roles in operations, merchandising and sourcing. He oversaw merchandising at Walmart China before joining Sam’s Club in 2015. Humbly, Furner says he’s learned the business from “the bottom up.” He worked with Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran in China when Foran oversaw Walmart’s business in China. Furner credits Foran with strong leadership and keen focus on merchandise assortment, pricing and store operations. Sam’s Club CEO John Furner Furner said he will be focused on simplifying the business and thinking differently. He sees lots of hard work and new opportunities ahead, noting that each employee will play a role in getting it done. Furner already announced his new leadership team and structure, which now includes his own e-commerce team devoted to SamsClub.com. Furner outlined three areas where his focus will be from day 1: People — Focus on engagement among all levels within the company enforcing common goals Product — Make the products the hero. Digital — Commitment to accelerating digital transformation. Continue to move with speed in this space and use member data and insights to quickly adapt and meet the needs of the increasingly digital consumer. Analysts are eager to see Furner make his mark on Sam’s Club, a solid business that has experienced lackluster sales growth over the past couple of years, despite positive membership growth. Furner is seen as an operator and merchant at heart and his early comments indicate an eagerness to make improvements across the board.

But that wasn’t necessarily the case at some California Walmart stores, where the big box retailer has agreed to pay $1 million to resolve claims that it sold misleadingly labeled items.  The Alameda County District Attorney’s Office announced the settlement Wednesday, putting an end to allegations from 23 district attorneys that Walmart — and its e-commerce arm Jet.com — sold plastic products in stores and online that were misleadingly labeled “biodegradable” or “compostable” in violation of California law. Under California law, companies are prohibited from selling plastics labeled as biodegradable, or with similar language unless it includes clear disclaimers on how quickly the product will biodegrade in a landfill or other area where it may be disposed. Additionally, the sale of products labeled “compostable” is prohibited unless it meets certain standards that ensure plastic will break down in municipal compost. “Unfortunately, Californians concerned with reducing plastic waste in landfills are commonly misled to purchase plastic bags and other plastic products based on marketers’ unsubstantiated claims of biodegradability,” Alameda District Attorney Nancy O’Malley said in a statement. “But almost nothing breaks down in a landfill.” Customers looking for compostable products that will break down as expected are urged to look for items with the certification “ASTM D6400.” As part of the settlement, for which the two companies did not admit liability, Walmart will pay $875,000 in civil penalties and an additional payment of $50,000 to CalRecycle to fund testing of plastic products marketed to consumers as compostable or degradable. Jet.com will pay an additional $15,000 in civil penalties. Additionally, the companies are prohibited from selling plastic products labeled as biodegradable or other terms that imply the product will bread down in a landfill, and prohibited from labeling products as compostable if they don’t include scientific certification to support the claim.

The Goodlettsville, Tenn.,-based Dollar General already operates a store in Decatur and will be relocating that business to the larger former Walmart site at 154 N. Main St. by this summer, according to an announcement Wednesday (Feb. 1). “Dollar General is excited to add this location to our existing store base. We look forward to the opportunity to better serve our customers in these communities by continuing to provide the convenience and value they expect from Dollar General,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General CEO. The new location is larger by roughly 3,000 square feet and will feature fuel and fresh meat and produce which were not possible at its smaller Decatur location. This store is in addition to the 41 sites Dollar General purchased from Walmart in July 2016. At that time Dollar General acquired the Express stores in Coal Hill and Mulberry. Dollar General said the larger store will employ about 15 and also feature a new layout which will provide a more customer-friendly format and faster checkout. Walmart’s Express formats were aimed directly at competing against Dollar General in smaller towns. These formats were also equipped with pharmacy and fuel pumps. But the small store experiment was scrapped by Walmart in January 2016 and 102 locations were shuttered. The small store experiment failed to yield the returns of larger Neighborhood Markets and Walmart Supercenter formats. The Walmart Express experiment began in 2011 with stores in Gravette and Prairie Grove. It was expanded in 2012 by then-Walmart U.S. President and CEO Bill Simon, whose plan was to tether these stores to supercenter for fulfillment. While the idea looked good in theory it was much harder to execute given the smallest formats had virtually no backroom space for inventory. Frequent out-of-stocks in fresh meats, dairy and products left shelves nearly bare until the next truck ran. After expanding the formats to 102, it became apparent to Greg Foran, who replaced Simon as Walmart U.S. CEO in July 2014, that these formats were more of a distraction than opportunity, given the retailer’s cash cow remains its supercenters. Foran said shortly after taking over the U.S. business, “The supercenter, well managed and well run, is a great growth driver.” When Walmart made the decision to close the Express formats, Harps Foods of Springdale was also waiting in the wings. Harps acquired nine of the shuttered former Walmart Express formats in June. Seven of those locations are in Arkansas, three of those in Northwest Arkansas – Gravette, Gentry and Prairie Grove. J. Max Van Hoose, vice president of store planning for Harps, said the Decatur store was not in the block of stores that Harps bid on. He said Harps bid on the entire block which included three locations in southwest Missouri. Harps also bought Express locations in Cedarville, Mansfield and Charleston.

(WTNH/ABC) — Walmart this week rolled out new shipping policies to compete with internet giant Amazon. It’s a sign of the times as more and more retailers are being forced to lower their prices and fees to compete. Now you may be wondering what’s better for your wallet. News 8 is helping you stretch your dollar with a look at who’s offering what. Retailers are on notice as more and more drop prices to compete with each other for the better shipping policy.  That’s nothing but good news for you and now we’re taking a closer look at where you’ll get the most bang for your buck! Attention online shoppers, Walmart is changing the game. Now offering free two-day shipping to everyone. The only catch, you have to spend a minimum of $35. Here’s a closer look at the money: A giant tide laundry detergent was listed at $8.97 on Walmart’s site  and $19.45 on Amazon Prime. Keurig coffee pods were $37.95 at Walmart, compared to $31.21 with Amazon Prime, but on Amazon you’ll have to pay $99 a year if you want two day shipping Money.com also compared retailers with free shipping and no minimum but don’t get to you very fast. It picked Target as its favorite because when you use your store card you get 5% back on purchases and free shipping on most orders. L.L. Bean, Nordstrom and Kate Spade have free shipping on all orders, no minimum, but it is usually standard shipping which takes longer. Either way the competition is heating up. Experts say many household items will be cheaper on Walmart, but amazon has other perks outside of shopping. Streaming entertainment for example. Many people have cancelled their Hulu and Netflix accounts because they’re getting everything they need with the prime membership.   Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge NEW YORK — Wal-Mart is replacing a program that offered free shipping but had an annual fee with one that has a lower free-shipping threshold and faster delivery as it hopes to answer Amazon’s powerful Prime membership success. The retailer says it will reduce shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular essentials like diapers, pet food, and cleaning supplies. Wal-Mart’s average shipping time has been three to five days. On Tuesday, it reduced the spending amount necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. Wal-Mart’s ShippingPass had allowed members to buy more than 1 million items for free shipping at Wal-mart.com. Last year, it trimmed its shipping time frame to two days from three, and it cut the annual fee by a dollar to $49. Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said the service worked well, but it concluded shoppers shouldn’t have to pay a membership fee for free shipping. The strategy shift is one of the first big moves by Walmart.com’s CEO Mark Lore, who joined the company when Wal-Mart bought online retailer Jet.com last year. And it’s an illustration of how Wal-Mart is trying to figure out a way to compete with Amazon and its dominant Prime plan. Amazon’s membership program costs $99 a year, but includes services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members buy more frequently and spend more money. Amazon doesn’t disclose a Prime subscriber total, but it’s estimated to be about 65 million. Wal-Mart wouldn’t say how many ShippingPass subscribers it had, but all will receive a refund of their membership fee. Mr. Lore declined to comment on Amazon, but said lower prices, a wider assortment of eligible goods and faster shipping alone can build loyalty. Mr. Lore promised more moves would be coming. “Two-day, free shipping is table stakes,” he said in a conference call this week. “We’ve upped the ante.” Related Items Amazon.com Inc , Wal-Mart Stores Inc , shipping Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

Stocks and bonds denominated in foreign currencies might lose as much as 15 percent of their value when their U.S. holders convert them into dollars -- one of the effects of a so-called border-adjusted tax, according to Paul Christopher, an economist at Wells Fargo & Co. That’s because economists expect that the dollar would strengthen under the tax proposal, which would replace the U.S. corporate income tax with a levy on U.S. companies’ domestic sales and imports, while exempting their exports from taxable income. Retailers have railed against the proposal saying they’d suffer under the tax because they rely heavily on imported materials. Other industries that import goods, including automakers, oil refiners and restaurants, have also said the tax could lead to higher prices for consumers. The tax proposal’s supporters, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, argue that macroeconomic factors would lead to a stronger dollar -- reducing the cost of imports -- and even out any effects on consumers over time. Trump’s aides last week signaled that the president is leaning toward the border-adjustment plan --  which Press Secretary Sean Spicer mentioned as a way to help pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Mexico is the U.S.’s largest source of agricultural imports, including Haas avocados. A senior White House official described the border-adjusted tax, which would apply to imports from all foreign countries, as the “most nationalist” way for the U.S. to tax its companies. This week, a broad coalition of lobbyists for retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., energy companies and the auto industry launched a lobbying counter-offensive against the proposal. Less attention has been paid to how the border tax would affect Americans who held $9.4 trillion of foreign assets as of Dec. 31, 2015, according to estimates by the U.S. Treasury Department. Revenue Generator “It’s not really on people’s radar yet,” said Christopher, head global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the bank’s registered investment adviser, said in an interview. If border adjustment is included in a tax overhaul, “the international portion of a portfolio could come to lose 10 to 15 percent,” he said. “Investors may be in for a rude shock," said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former senior economist and associate director at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. Border adjustability is key to Ryan’s plan for the most ambitious overhaul of the U.S. tax code in three decades because it’s estimated to generate about $1.1 trillion in revenue over a decade, according to an independent analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation, a Washington policy group. That increase would help to offset corporate and income tax cuts. Keeping tax reform deficit neutral is a prerequisite for passing a tax bill through the Senate without Democratic votes. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, didn’t respond to an e-mailed request for comment about how border adjustments would affect U.S. investors who hold foreign assets. Proponents of the border-adjustment measure say the dollar would strengthen because taxing imports would reduce domestic demand for them, which means fewer dollars would end up overseas. That relative scarcity would push the dollar’s value up compared to other currencies. At the same time, exempting companies’ exports from taxation would allow U.S. producers to lower their prices overseas. Lower prices would attract more foreign buyers, who’d need more U.S. dollars to make purchases. Their increased demand for the dollar would also push its value up. Euro Dividends So even though importers would pay higher taxes, their after-tax income -- and consumer prices -- wouldn’t be affected, because a stronger dollar would lower the cost of their imported materials, said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, who supports the border-adjustment plan. He expects the stronger dollar would largely even out the cost of the import tax, he said -- meaning there’d ultimately be no real cost increase for businesses to pass along to consumers. Auerbach said he expects the dollar to rise in value by 25 percent if the border tax is implemented, and he acknowledged there would be consequences for U.S. investors who hold foreign assets. For example, if a foreign stock pays dividends in euros, and an investor wants to convert those euros to dollars, the investor would get fewer dollars as the U.S. currency strengthens. Foreigners Gain "I’ve been getting calls from guys all over Wall Street asking how it would work,” Auerbach said. He declined to quantify the portfolio losses investors could face on the conversions, but said some foreign assets wouldn’t be affected since they’re denominated in U.S. dollars already. Critics say the expectation that the dollar will rise exactly in line with the cost of higher prices for imported goods doesn’t account for other factors that can influence currency exchange rates, including interest rates and political shifts. Currency fluctuations are “a jigsaw puzzle” that can’t be easily modeled, said Henrietta Treyz, a macroeconomic policy analyst at Height Securities LLC. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

Sign Up A stronger dollar might prompt emerging-market countries to raise their interest rates, making it more expensive still for U.S. investors to swap foreign-denominated assets into dollars, said Ben Emons, the chief economist at wealth management firm Intellectus Partners and a former portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. Some markets might already be anticipating those higher costs, he said. Export-heavy companies would benefit from a border-adjusted tax -- but so might another group: foreigners who hold U.S. assets. For them, the stronger dollar would yield more of their own nation’s currency when they convert income from their U.S. assets, economists say. People in foreign countries held $17.1 trillion of U.S. assets as of June 30, 2015, according to Treasury data. Border adjustments would produce a wealth transfer to them -- courtesy of American holders of foreign assets, said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Viard had supported the proposal, but now says he’s on the fence. "It’s almost like a foreign aid program, a giveaway of wealth to foreigners," said Viard.

Dollar General said Wednesday that it will move its existing store in Decatur to the larger location with a grand opening scheduled for the summer. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The new location has about 12,000 square feet, while traditional Dollar General formats are around 9,100 square feet. Dollar General will offer fresh meat and produce in the new location, items unavailable in the current store. Wal-Mart closed 269 stores worldwide in January 2016, including 154 in the U.S., as part of its efforts to streamline and reorganize operations. Most of the U.S. closures were of smaller-format Wal-Mart Express stores, including 11 in Arkansas. In July, Dollar General announced it had purchased 41 former Wal-Mart Express locations across 11 states. The acquisitions included two Arkansas stores, in Coal Hill and Mulberry. Big River Steel notes 63,000-ton month The $1.3 billion Big River Steel mill in Osceola produced more than 63,000 tons of hot-rolled steel in January, its first full month of operation. The mill, located on 1,300 acres in Mississippi County, focuses on producing steel for advanced automotive and electrical needs. Big River Steel plans to recycle 2 million tons of scrap metal to produce 1.6 million tons of finished steel products annually. That’s an average of about 133,000 tons of steel a month. Eventually, the plant will have 525 employees making an average of $75,000, including bonuses. Construction on the plant began in 2014. There were about 2,000 workers at the peak of construction at the plant. Facebook’s 4Q results surpass forecasts MENLO PARK, Calif. — Facebook surpassed Wall Street’s expectations with its quarterly earnings report, despite some concerns that its “ad load,” or the number of advertisements it can show users without clogging up the feeds, has reached its limit. Facebook on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.56 billion, up from $1.56 billion in the same period a year earlier. On a per-share basis, the Menlo Park, Calif., company said it had net income of $1.21, up from 54 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.41 per share in the latest quarter. The average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.34 per share. The social media company posted revenue of $8.81 billion in the period, which also beat Wall Street forecasts. Eleven analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $8.47 billion. That’s up 51 percent from revenue of $5.84 billion a year ago. Shares rose 2.3 percent in after-hours trading. As of Wednesday’s close, Facebook Inc. shares had increased 16 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has increased almost 2 percent. In the final minutes of trading Wednesday, shares hit $133.23, a rise of 16 percent in the past 12 months. Firm trades in stock symbol for ‘WEED’ Canopy Growth Corp. switched to a new four-letter stock-ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday amid what it says is a growing acceptance of Canada’s medical-marijuana industry. “We’re thrilled to be marketing WEED on Bay Street,” Chief Executive Officer Bruce Linton said in a statement. Bay Street is Toronto’s version of New York’s Wall Street. Smiths Falls, Ontario-based Canopy became Canada’s first $1 billion marijuana company last year. It currently has a valuation of $1.2 billion. The company has yet to post a net profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The value of marijuana stocks in Canada has swelled as shareholders bet on the legalization of recreational use. The government has promised to introduce the necessary legislation in 2017, which would make it the first among the Group of Seven Nations to do so. If legalization occurs along expected timelines, there could be 3.8 million recreational users and the potential for $4.6 billion in sales, Canaccord Genuity analysts said in a November note. Tesla filing drops ‘Motors’ from name Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors Inc. said in a regulatory filing Wednesday that its new name is Tesla Inc. The decision to drop the word “Motors” was made to reflect the fact that Tesla, which merged with SolarCity Corp., another Musk company, is now in the solar business as well. Tesla completed its $2 billion acquisition of SolarCity, an installer of solar panels, in November. Musk’s vision is to make the Tesla brand a one-stop shop for consumers interested in clean, renewable energy. Combining the two companies, which were both at least 20 percent owned by Musk before the deal, was done to give struggling SolarCity better access to capital. — Bloomberg News Mississippi port chief touts jobs added GULFPORT, Miss. — The director of Mississippi’s port authority said the port of Gulfport has created 425 of the 1,300 new jobs required in exchange for $570 million in federal assistance granted after Hurricane Katrina. Jonathan Daniels discussed the progress Tuesday at a Gulfport Chamber of Commerce meeting. The Sun Herald reported that the federal money has been used since 2008 to restore and expand the port’s West Pier. The project, previously scheduled to be finished in the first quarter of 2017, is one year behind schedule. Daniels, who came aboard as director three years ago, after the project was well underway, told the Sun Herald that construction delays are to be expected at the centuryold port. The port’s mainstay tenants, he said, have been accommodating about continuing operations during construction. — The Associated Press Business on 02/02/2017 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Stocks tread water amid unease Business news in brief News in brief Amazon picks Kentucky airport as site for air...

Dudley, together with 22 other California District Attorneys, announced today the resolution of a consumer protection action against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Wal-Mart.com USA, LLC, and Walmart subsidiary, Jet.com, Inc. (collectively, Walmart and Jet.com). The action was filed in Napa County Superior Court. The complaint alleges that Walmart and Jet.com advertised and sold plastic products in California that were misleadingly labeled as “biodegradable” or “compostable” in violation of California law. Beginning in 2004, the California Legislature enacted statutes under the Public Resources Code (“PRC”) to limit the sale of plastics marketed as biodegradable, based in part on its recognition that the ability of plastic to biodegrade depends greatly on the environment in which it is placed. The lack of oxygen in landfills, for example, can significantly hamper the ability to biodegrade. Without thorough disclaimers, which are nearly impossible to include on consumer products, biodegradability claims are inherently misleading to consumers purchasing plastic products based on an assumption that the products will quickly biodegrade after disposal. Accordingly, the PRC prohibits selling any plastic product labeled as “biodegradable,” “degradable,” or with language that otherwise implies that the product will break down in a landfill or other environment. The PRC also prohibits selling a plastic product labeled as “compostable” unless the product has met an established scientific standard designed to ensure the product will break down in municipal compost. In accordance with the PRC and false advertising laws, the stipulated judgment prohibits Walmart and Jet.com from selling or offering for sale plastic products labeled as “biodegradable,” “degradable,” or “decomposable.” Walmart and Jet.com are further prohibited from selling or offering for sale plastic products labeled as “compostable” without appropriate scientific certification that the products can be composted. Under the terms of the judgment, Walmart agreed to pay $875,000 in civil penalties and make an additional payment of $50,000 to ​CalRecycle to fund testing of plastic products marketed to consumers as compostable or degradable. Jet.com agreed to pay $15,000 in civil penalties. These civil penalties will be divided among the 22 California counties that filed suit, which included Santa Barbara County. “Consumers are often willing to pay a premium for products that claim to have environmental benefits. This judgment will help ensure that consumers are not misled into paying for environmental benefits they are not receiving,” Dudley said. Walmart, Jet.com, and their respective counsel worked cooperatively with the District Attorney’s Offices to implement significant changes to their websites and to Walmart’s stores to comply with California law, without admitting liability.

Walmart has agreed to pay $1 million to settle suit brought by 23 California district attorneys over misleading labels claiming certain plastic products are biodegradable. Photo: FREDERIC J. BROWN, AFP/Getty Images Walmart to pay $1M in suit over misleading labels on products 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Walmart will pay about a $1 million to settle a lawsuit alleging it illegally sold plastic products in stores and online that were misleadingly labeled “biodegradable” or “compostable,” prosecutors said Wednesday. The selling of items with disingenuous labeling is in violation of California law. The action was filed in Napa County by Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley and 22 of her counterparts throughout the state. The retail giant agreed to fork over $875,000 in civil penalties and an additional $50,000 to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to fund testing of plastic products. Jet.com, a subsidiary of Walmart, will pay an additional $15,000 in civil penalties. The judgment bans Walmart from selling plastic products labeled biodegradable or compostable, unless such claims are backed by scientific certification. “Unfortunately, Californians concerned with reducing plastic waste in landfills are commonly misled to purchase plastic bags and other plastic products based on marketers’ unsubstantiated claims of biodegradability, but almost nothing breaks down in a landfill,” O’Malley said in a statement. “That’s why the sale of plastic products labeled ‘biodegradable’ is illegal in California and why (Wednesday’s) settlement is a win for both consumers and the environment.” Plastic waste can take a thousand years to to decompose, O’Malley added. Walmart and Jet.com did not admit liability in the lawsuit. “We are pleased to resolve this matter with the California District Attorneys and are appreciative of them as they have worked with us on this issue. Sustainability is a priority for us, and we have been recognized as a retail leader in this space,” Walmart officials said in a statement to The Chronicle. “We’re proud of the enhancements we have made to help ensure that the products we sell to California customers are in line with the State’s guidance on biodegradable labeling.” There are currently no Walmart stores in San Francisco, however there are different locations in San Leandro, Richmond, Martinez, Mountain View and elsewhere in the Bay Area.

It's the enhanced experience. Walmart today announced a new free two-day shipping model that doesn't require a membership. Shoppers need only spend more than $35 to benefit from the new deal, which is no doubt powered in some form by Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com last year. Walmart's new plan will likely be attractive to shoppers who enjoy Amazon's vast inventory, but don't want to pony up for 2-day shipping. In that sense, this new model is sure to bolster Walmart's eCommerce endeavors, and set it apart from other retailers — Amazon included — that require subscriptions to enjoy fast shipping. However, Amazon Prime subscribers gain much more than faster shipping through their Prime subscription.  Amazon Prime's value isn't in its retail quality-of-life service, it's in the way the company has deeply integrated Prime membership across its ecosystem. Everything users do under the Amazon umbrella is enhanced with a Prime membership. Members gain access to Amazon's Netflix parallel, its music streaming service, deals during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon's own Prime Day, as well as rolling all of this into the massively popular Alexa virtual assistant. Of course, Walmart too has a streaming service (it bought Vudu in 2010, and offers free ad-supported streaming of older films), and its stores have always been a prime target during the Black Friday shopping rush. Yet this hasn't been enough to close the gap between the two businesses in terms of offering valuable subscription services. True, the goal of Walmart's free 2-day shipping plan isn't to compete with Amazon Prime per se, but it nonetheless continues the trend of Walmart, and other traditionally physical retailers, iterating on their ecommerce offerings to better align with evolving shopping habits; habits that have been greatly influenced by the Amazon Prime experience.  Amazon continues to reign as the great retail power of the day, despite Walmart's dominance of brick-and-mortar; a dominance that counts for less as the retail giant struggles to compete with Amazon's staggering growth. Walmart may even lose its grip on physical retail, as both Amazon and Google have announced brick-and-mortar stores, with Amazon's in particular sure to bring about a new way of shopping. It's perhaps in the case of Amazon Go that the differences between the two companies is the most clear, or at least ultimately indicative of why Walmart's new shipping model may be too little too late. Amazon Go's most notable feature is its abandonment of checkout lines. Shoppers instead have their Prime accounts charged after they leave the store. This is the kind of pure innovation Walmart has as yet failed to duplicate. Walmart has been behind the curve throughout the rise of digital commerce, and despite two-day shipping, its media streaming and overall shopping experience simply pale in comparison to the holistic digital experience customers receive through Amazon; an experience which Prime only enhances. That a $100 a year Prime subscription also buys free 2-day shipping is a perk, not the sell. *This blog has been updated for clarity Loading links....

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Wal-Mart declined to comment. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette previously reported that about 1,000 layoffs would occur nationwide before Jan. 31, but the company would not confirm the exact number affecting Arkansas. McCaslin said that Michael Lindsey, Wal-Mart's director of public affairs and government relations, called to inform him off the layoffs about 8 a.m. on Jan. 20, the day the layoffs began. Because of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, a company with more than 100 employees is required to notify the local government authority of a "mass layoff" that affects a certain number of full-time workers at an employment site during any 30-day period. A Jan. 24 notification-act filing in California confirmed that Wal-Mart's e-commerce division laid off 174 employees across departments in two California locations. -- Emma N. Hurt Ex-CEO's severance noted in SEC filing Former USA Truck Chief Executive Officer Randy Rogers will receive severance pay of one year's salary, $425,000, plus a lump sum payment of $120,000 and $30,000 in moving expenses, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. James Reed, USA Truck's former chief financial officer, is now president and CEO. His annual pay was raised $100,000 to $400,000. USA Truck announced the leadership changes Monday. Jim Craig now is executive vice president and chief commercial officer in addition to his previous role as president of the brokerage division. He also received a raise from $300,000 to $350,000, plus a $150,000 bonus, some of which requires him to remain at the company until July 2018. -- Emma N.

The settlement, announced Thursday in a press release from Solano County District Attorney Krishna Abrams, came after prosecutors from 23 counties filed a lawsuit against the companies claiming the labeling amounted to false advertising and violated other state laws on the books since 2008. The lawsuit was filed in Napa County Superior Court. Under the terms of the settlement Wal-Mart and its subsidiary, without admitting any liability, will pay $890,000 in civil penalties and pay $50,000 to CalRecycle to fund testing of plastic products marketed to consumers as compostable or degradable.

That saves on rental fees, as well as the work of lugging gear from home. (File photo by Zumapress.com) Consider buying your snorkeling equipment after you reach Hawaii, then sell it as you leave. That saves on rental fees, as well as the work of lugging gear from home. (File photo by Zumapress.com) By MARLA JO FISHER / STAFF COLUMNIST Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Hawaii has stunning landscapes, but you can also be stunned by something else – the cost of everything. Think about how far food and consumer goods must travel to get there, and you can understand why – but that doesn’t lessen the pain. Here are some money-saving tips, thanks to my lovely readers on Facebook. Getting around We always get our cars from Discount Hawaii Car Rental. We have always gotten the best deals through them (even vs. Costco, etc.). We have used them several times on the Big Island, but they are also on Maui, Honolulu, Kauai and Hilo. – Nicole Andrews Rent a car in the city, not at the airport. If you’re on Oahu, avoid the Polynesian Cultural Center. It’s a theme park with virtually nothing cultural to it. They call it a museum, but it’s more Disneyland than authentic. It’s about $50, but the prices aren’t even posted until you pay. Try not to forget anything on the mainland. Anything you buy on the islands will cost more, because everything has to be shipped there. – Jay Berman Use the city bus system, if you’re in Waikiki/Honolulu; save the rental car for a specific set of days you want to venture to North Shore or Windward coast. We used the city buses a lot to get to destinations around the city and saved. Use Yelp to find hole-in-the-wall eateries that don’t charge a tourist premium. – Samantha Gowen (Register business editor) Rent (a car) from a small local place that rents beater cars (they work fine and have AC, just older cars). We used kimosrentacar.com and got a car for $10/day that took us all over. – Shanin Ziemer Rent a car. I thought I was not going to need it but I saved a lot. I was able to drive around the whole island on my own time, eat wherever I wanted to. Also book your trips through Costco, very cheap. I actually booked mine through Expedia and also got a great offer. (Costco was sold out on the days I wanted to go but the offers on any other day were great). – Diana Salazar Shopping Shop at Costco, and get souvenirs at Wal-Mart or at the swap meet at Aloha Stadium, weekends and Wednesdays. Also has a farmers market. – Ann McCabe Parrack Buy your snorkeling gear at Wal-Mart. We sold our Wally gear to other tourists at half price as we left the beach the last time. No baggage fees coming and going, beat two-week rental fees by about $60 for the two of us. Avoid resorts. Don’t rent in Kona or on the north coast of the Big Island, for example. You can easily drive there from truly authentic villages. This probably applies to other islands, too. – Robert Mercer I got some great gifts to bring back at ABC Stores, and shopped their website for Christmas gifts, too! – Pam Ellison Cisneros I asked where the “real” people live and found a swap meet and normal stores where prices were great. – Isabelle Kaminsky We go at least once a year and have several tips; if you’re going to be there awhile, it is cheaper to buy beach chairs than to rent them for a week; get a cheap cooler and make sandwiches to take to the beach or when out sightseeing ... get the free booklets at the airport and use the coupons. – Cheryl Gilbert Accommodations If you’re staying in a hotel, use the business rooms vs. the vacationer rooms ... much cheaper. Difference is they usually don’t have that big window view ... we were fine with that as we don’t stay in the hotel that much unless we’re sleeping. I usually call the hotel direct to ask if they have a business section. – Toni Selman We didn’t do a standard hotel room, we did a timeshare type of room on Maui, and did a Costco shopping run before checking in, so that we had breakfast, lunch and snack food. We only ate out for breakfast a couple of times in the seven days. What was nice is that those resorts have barbecues also so you can grill up some burgers or steaks and still have a nice dinner. – Monika Hopson Hall Stay out of Honolulu and Waikiki. Spend your money locally where everything is cheaper and better prepared. Airbnb a place toward the middle of the island, away from the big city. Rent a car. – Kaitlin Agee This is something my wife and I did about 18 years ago, so some details might have changed. But we camped the night at Polihale State Park on Kauai, sleeping under the stars in Army green sleeping bags we rented from a surplus store in Lihue. I recall that we were able to do that – because Cristine’s dad was retired military (it’s on the site of the Pacific Missile Range facility, but thankfully no target practice went on). But this site says you can reserve space in advance with a background check and $25. to-hawaii.com – Landon Hall Rent a condo or Airbnb with a kitchen. – Lee Neil Things to do We planned excursions with Boss Frog, cheaper than booking tours through the hotel. ... We bought entertainment books for places we have visited and used them for 2-for-1 dinners and meals. – Ingrid Eck Pullen Eating We bought fruit and veggies from a stand across from the Westin resort where we stayed in Kaanapali on Maui and ate that for breakfast instead of eating breakfast at the hotel. Also, we had rooms facing inland instead of the ocean; the hundreds of dollars we saved not getting an ocean view was worth it, we saw enough ocean when we were out and about every day. We alternated going out to dinner and eating dinner in the condo. And we didn’t go crazy on souvenirs; I think the kids got one each. Stock up on poke from Foodland (grocery store)! – Laylan Connelly Perino (Register beach reporter) For Oahu: Look for the “shrimp trucks” on the North Shore. Best meal in town for $12. Go to Aloha Stadium swap meet (even during the week) for cheap souvenirs. Ask hotel staff for best places for locals to eat. – Lucy Jo More tips Go during the offseason. I went for one week from Sept. 25-Oct. 1 and got a great offer to stay at the Disney Aulani. – Diana Salazar I second going in the offseason and noticed the rental car drop-off on Maui had a bin for used beach accessories (chairs, toys, etc.) that I think they then offered to other customers. Might be worth a call ahead to see how it works. – Kristen Hinman My friends in Maui who own two businesses suggest checking out Maui Revealed and Maui Craigslist. – Gerrie Schipske Got a good travel tip for me? Or a suggestion? Email me at mfisher@scng.com. I love to hear from readers. Related Links 5 Don't-Miss Hawaii surf spots Cheapo Travel: Save on Hawaii Hungry in Hawaii?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 February 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM Credit card thieves move online as chips cut in-store fraud by olga kharifandlindsey rupp Pros and cons: A customer using a Visa Inc chip credit card at a Wal-Mart in Burbank, California. While the chip technology has cut down on incidents of in-store fraud, the use of stolen card data to pay for merchandise on websites, in mobile apps and by dialling call centres surged 40% last year, according to a report. — Bloomberg The adoption of credit-card chip technology by US retailers is having an unintended consequence: Criminals are moving from brick-and-mortar stores to the Internet.  The use of stolen card data to pay for merchandise on websites, in mobile apps and by dialling call centres surged 40% last year, according to a report from Javelin Strategy & Research released Feb 1. That’s forcing merchants to spend billions on online fraud protection in an effort to detect when a crook is using someone else’s card number.  “We are seeing more sophisticated type of fraud moving into the online environment,” said Erika Dietrich, global director of payments risk management at fraud fighter ACI Worldwide.  By the end of last year, almost 1.81 million US merchants had switched to accepting European-style chip cards, more than double the number the year before, according to Visa Inc. Issued by banks, cards containing the so-called EMV technology are much harder to counterfeit, which cuts down on in-person fraud at stores.  With worldwide e-commerce surging and more stolen data available on the black market, retailers are ramping up spending on online security. E-commerce merchants and financial institutions will spend US$9.2bil (RM40.77bil) annually in fraud-detection solutions by 2020, up 30% from current levels, according to Juniper Research.  As recently as October, the fraud-protection company Radial Inc. used to get one to two inquiries from new large customers a month. That number has since climbed to more than 12 a month, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer. Radial’s more than 100 clients include Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, StubHub and Ralph Lauren Corp.  Fueling the surge in interest are an increasing number of data breaches at companies ranging from Target Corp to Wendy’s Co, which potentially exposed private financial information from millions of customers to identity thieves. US government agencies and companies suffered a record 1,093 data breaches last year, up 40% from 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Centre in San Diego.  Javelin, which began tracking fraud in 2003, said the number of US identity-theft victims rose to a record 15.4 million last year from 13.1 million in 2015. Fraud losses, however, have remained fairly stable over the past three years, totalling US$16bil (RM70.83bil) last year. That’s down from US$22bil (RM97.39bil) in 2012, the researcher said.  “There’s a great deal of investment not only from StubHub peers, but also from the vendors,” said Joseph Asaro, head of operations for North America at StubHub, a unit of EBay Inc. “The vendors would not be investing so heavily if there’s not great profit in it.”  Defence spending  To bolster its arsenal, Visa acquired CardinalCommerce in December to help merchants and banks authenticate e-commerce transactions. New vendors are also entering the fray: This year, Tender Armor LLC, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based startup, will offer its fraud-fighting technology to debit-card customers of InComm Holdings Inc., which issues prepaid cards. Tender Armor texts or e-mails customers a daily code that replaces the one on the back of their cards for purchases.  “Because the code is dynamic and only known to the consumer, the fraudsters can’t use it,” Madeline Aufseeser, Tender Armor’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. “This simple solution deputizes the consumers and puts the control back in their hands.”  Meanwhile, payment processor Cayan, which serves mid- to small-sized businesses, plans to integrate security software from Kount. That company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help merchants pinpoint fraudulent sales. For each transaction, Kount’s engine analyses hundreds of relevant variables and activity across the globe in real time to predict risk of fraud.  Detective work  Existing fraud-fighting companies’ business is blooming. Easy Solutions Inc. says sales of its product that helps banks and retailers monitor transactions grew 128% last year, up from a 75% gain in 2015. Radial, which promises to shoulder its clients’ fraud costs, saw its sales rise 15% last year.  Radial’s software can use about 800 rules to determine if a transaction is fraudulent. Suspicious transactions are flagged and sent to several dozen human analysts around the world who can verify addresses, or even call the customers to weed out fraud.  “They do detective work at some point,” said Weitz. “We guarantee to our customers that they pay zero fraud.”  Bot crimes  Online sales worldwide are projected to rise to US$27.7tril (RM122.64tril) in 2020, up from US$22tril (RM97.50tril) last year, according to researcher eMarketer. North America, the second-largest e-commerce market in the world behind Asia, is expected to see double-digit growth through 2020, eMarketer said. Expansion into new categories such as grocery, and increasing sales through mobile devices are helping to boost sales, the company said.  More shopping online means more opportunities for crooks, who are now using sophisticated attack tools such as bots. The software programs can run through online checkout pages and place orders using stolen data automatically – without a human being needing to be involved.  “Right now the environment is more challenging than it’s ever been,” said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at Javelin, a consulting firm focused on the financial industry. “And things will get worse before they get better.” — Bloomberg  You May Be Interested Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Olympics: Tokyo 2020 asks public to donate old phones for medals Amazon profit jumps while revenue misses mark Irish calculation similar to EU on Apple tax estimate: minister Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in US$3bil IPO pitch Others Also Read ‘Paradise’ Pulau Mengalum popular with tourists from China Romanian president says economy good, investors not threatened For a tossing good celebration advertisement Latest News Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Snap signed five-year, US$2bil deal to use Google’s Cloud Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough Most Viewed in Tech Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

The father, who KXAN is not identifying to protect the identity of the victim, is charged with assaulting his daughter on Jan. 31. The incident began when police gave the girl a citation for shoplifting and released her to her parents. Moments later, a witness flagged down officers to say a man was attacking a girl next to the store. Police found the girl with a bump on her head, which was not there prior to her leaving the Walmart. Her mother said the father and daughter were arguing about her shoplifting when the situation escalated, and her father grabbed her by the throat. Wrapping his hands around her neck, the father “violently” pushed her against the wall, according to the mother. As the girl lost consciousness and her knees began to buckle, the father punched her in the face and she fell to the ground. While she was down, the father continued to punch her, according to the affidavit. EMS said the girl could not remember anything after she passed out. However, a nearby patrol car captured the entire incident on camera. The father was arrested and booked into the Williamson County Jail.

The National Retail Federation, along with the American International Automobile Dealers Association, the National Grocers Association and others are joining forces to form Americans for Affordable Products, which will run a campaign to educate consumers and show lawmakers that the so-called Border Adjusted Tax plan would lead to higher prices of as much as 20 percent on everyday items including clothing, food and even gas. The diversified group, which also includes such companies as Nike, Best Buy, luxury conglomerate LVMH and Dollar General, is trying to make their opposition heard even while Congress and the president try to sort out exactly what adjustments to put forth. Congressional Republicans want to eliminate tax incentives that encourage U.S. companies to move overseas, sharply cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and encourage more factory output at home. But opponents say the plan would have a harmful rippling effect, causing companies to even lay off workers. The proposal -- spearheaded by House GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House tax-writing committee -- would constitute the most sweeping reforms to corporate taxes in at least three decades. Trump has dismissed the cornerstone of the House GOP plan as "too complicated" and has been touting a 35 percent levy on imports. Yet his spokesman appeared to put the tax back in play last week by proposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico and "other countries we have a trade deficit with" to pay for a border wall. "There's a rush to get this done in Congress. We want to make sure our voices are heard," said David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which has been dispatching members to meet with different levels of the new administration as well as lawmakers. Details of the consumer campaign are still being worked out, according to a spokeswoman at the retail trade group. A lot is at stake. Nearly all such items that U.S. shoppers buy are either wholly or partly produced overseas as companies have sought the cheapest way to make goods. And with online competition and shoppers trained to find the best deals, U.S. retailers haven't had the power to raise prices on many goods for several years. "I'm losing sleep. I am scared out of my mind," said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, which has signed on to the coalition. It is a family-owned company based in Vernon Hills, Illinois that makes educational toys and employs 150 people in the U.S. He estimates that under the GOP plan his federal tax rate would soar to 165 percent from 39.6 percent, he would have to raise prices by 10 percent to 15 percent to stay viable, and would have to lay off employees. Retail industry leaders "describe it as an existential threat," said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, another member of the coalition. "When they crunch the numbers, it really affects things like solvency and profits." Lamar said companies would likely have to pass along higher prices to shoppers, who wouldn't tolerate it. Companies say they also would have to try to squeeze suppliers for more savings and fear they might even have to lay off workers or close stores. George Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, estimates that he would have to raise prices on his clothing anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent if the border tax went into effect. Shirts currently range in price from $14.99 to $49.99. "People who are thinking about it don't know the consequences," Feldenkreis said. He added that the company would also have to lay off workers. "It's not just a retail implication," said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. "We know it's going to impact Main Street in many ways. It could be autos, manufacturing." The proposal would essentially tax corporations based on where their products and services are consumed, rather than on their incomes. In that way, it is similar to a sales tax. House GOP supporters such as Ryan and Brady say that would eliminate the incentives for corporations to use complex schemes to shift their incomes to lower-tax jurisdictions. To ensure the tax is focused on U.S. sales only, it would exclude a company's export sales. But the cost of imported goods would be taxed. The tax could raise as much as $1.2 trillion in revenue over the next decade, which would help pay for the steep tax cuts included in the House GOP plan. Proponents say if the plan is enacted, the dollar will increase in value by as much as 25 percent, resulting in cheaper imports and offsetting the impact. But many economists and industry executives worry the dollar wouldn't adjust, or certainly not fast enough. And Lamar said a shirt label saying "Made in China," doesn't tell the whole story. Seventy percent of the value of the garment supports U.S jobs in areas like design and logistics, he said. Other groups also oppose the border-adjusted tax, including Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, who typically donate generously to Republican campaigns. The tax would likely encourage companies to produce more in the U.S., or buy more of their parts and components in the U.S. Some companies say they could make those changes in order to avoid raising prices too much. Robert Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said on a recent conference call that the company could purchase more natural gas from the United States, rather than Mexico, which it uses to make glass for the Corona and Modelo beer it imports. "It's those kinds of things that we are looking at, planning on, if this comes to pass," Sands said. "We don't expect consumer demand for our product to be affected." Woldenberg, though, whose company makes 98 percent of its products overseas, says shifting his manufacturing to the U.S. isn't an option. In the last three years, he said he tried twice to find some U.S. molders interested in making its products here, but it wasn't financially feasible. He also doesn't believe that changes in foreign exchange rates will offset the costs of the plan for retailers. And even if it did, he says relief wouldn't come right away. "I am not going to play the currency markets to run this business," he said. "I want to make toys. I am not a forex trader." -By Anne D'Innocenzio and Christopher Rugaber View Comments Tags Retail Food Industry Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Retailers, Manufacturers On Opposite Sides Of Border Adjustment Proposal By Marcy Kreiter @marcykreiter On 02/02/17 AT 6:45 PM Close The nation’s retailers and manufacturers are finding themselves on opposing sides of a proposed 20 percent tax on U.S. imports from Mexico and other countries with the anti-import tax side warning of higher prices for everyday goods and the pro-tax side saying it would level the playing field with foreign manufacturers. More than 100 businesses and trade associations have formed Americans for Affordable Product to oppose the proposed tax, which members say will “increase prices paid by consumers” without triggering a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. On the other side, 25 U.S. businesses and industries have formed the American Made Coalition to support revamping the tax code to include an import tax and eliminate the export tax. White House spokesman Sean Spicer last week said the administration was considering a 20 percent tax on all imports from Mexico and other countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit. The money generated would help pay for Trump’s wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and also could be used to cut the corporate tax rate, a key promise of the Trump campaign. The proposal could pit the likes of Wal-Mart against General Electric, Boeing and Pfizer. “I respect Wal-Mart, but we’re going to have a different perspective on tax reform,” GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt told Bloomberg. “I think all of our voices need to be heard.” William Dudley, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the tax may not work as envisioned. “That type of adjustment proposal in the House, it’s a pretty dramatic change,” Dudley said earlier this month at the National Retail Federation’s Retail’s Big Show. “I think that it will probably lead to a lot of changes in the value of the dollar, the prices of imported goods in the U.S. I’m not sure that that would all happen very smoothly and I also think there could be lots of unintended consequences.” Americans for Affordable Products Wednesday called the proposed Border Adjustment Tax a bad idea that will mean higher costs for everything from food to gas to clothing and cars. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said the proposed tax would make consumers the real losers. “There are plenty of taxes already on hard working Americans and the retailers that serve them, and higher prices just add to that burden,” Shay said. “As a business owner who works every day to add value to my customers and serve the needs of families, I am deeply concerned about the Border Adjustment Tax,” said Rick Woldenberg, chairman of Learning Resources Inc. “Without question, it will increase prices paid by consumers and threaten the existence of companies like ours. We need members of Congress to listen to the urgent objections of small business job creators and stop this giveaway to big corporations at the expense of middle income and working class families.” The NRF estimates the border tax would cost American families $1,700 annually. Related Stories Trump Corporate Tax Reforms May Do Little For Job Creation How Americans Could Pay For The Border Wall, Measured In Fruit The American Made Coalition, however, argued Wednesday current tax law penalizes U.S.-made goods and said it backs tax reform proposals supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady “that would lower tax rates, encourage domestic investment, spur job creation and modernize the overall tax system for a 21st century economy.” “By ending the ‘Made in America tax,’ we can create a more favorable business environment for American manufacturing and level the playing field so American workers can compete with foreign competitors,” the coalition said, estimating the House tax proposals will create 1.7 million new jobs, boost gross domestic product by 1.9 percent and increase wages 7.7 percent. “This ultimately comes down to a decision of whether or not policy makers are willing to heap a tax onto consumers so that some corporations can never pay taxes again,” Brian Dodge, a spokesman for Retail Industry Leaders Association, told Bloomberg. Senate Republicans David Perdue of Georgia and Mike Lee of Utah warned in Federalist magazine the import tax “could ravage huge swaths of our economy.” Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

She looked good considering all the health problems she has had. I hear Billy Joe likes his Verizon wireless phone. Sure makes a lot of difference in the phone bill. John and Connie Siler’s granddaughters, Adalyn and Amaris, stayed with them while their parents, Brad and Patty Siler, went to see her grandad in the hospital. I never got to be with my grandparents. They had all passed away except my grandma, Vina (Halcomb) Morrison. Her maiden name was Pruett. She passed away when I was 15. Patty’s grandpa passed away. Brad, Patty and John attended the funeral. Connie kept Amaris. They visited and did some things for Connie’s parents. The funeral for Patty’s grandpa was Monday. James and I went to Springfield with Rex and Shirley Halcomb Monday. She said her old home place where she was raised, the house had burned. It sure makes a lot of difference after the parents are gone. Kids and grandkids always gather together usually on weekends. Huba Rozell sat by me at Carrol Mitchell’s funeral. Huba had a large crowd at her home on Sunday. She said she enjoyed it. It made her think of her parents, Bill and Matle Morrison, who always had lots of family on Sundays and other days of the week. After the folks are gone, usually most of the kids have their own families and everyone does their own thing. Rev. John and Dorothy (Nelson) Shines’ son, J.T., passed away. The family lives and was well known in our community. Bro. Shine did a lot of work on the Mt. Olive Church (Highlonesome) when it was getting built. He later built a church in Springfield. Our yo-yo weather has flower bushes trying to bud. Easter is late this year, maybe an early spring. At Garrison Church Sunday Zelda Jones gave a birthday offering. The offerings go to the children’s home. Her and great granddaughter, Molly, took up the 11 0’clock offering and her grandson, Bub Payne, prayed the prayer. Melany Stevens sang. She has a great voice and she picked out good songs. 42 were present. The pastor preached about our nation turning back to God. Bob and Lou Rains have been going to see their friend, Jim Hale, in the hospital. We send get-well wishes to Don Gullett. James and I stayed with my brother, Junior Halcomb, Friday for Betty’s outpatient surgery and they didn’t have success on it, so she has to go back Tuesday. My sympathy sent to Patty Siler’s family and Chancey Paul’s family. She passed away. And also the Shine family. John and Connie Siler attended a birthday party for granddaughter, Kaylee Evans, Saturday night. Happy Birthday to her and Uncle David Halcomb. My items sometimes don’t make it on time. The road was closed on T. Hwy. one day and all the holiday events have me running behind as well. Now fishing is coming up. My last two trips had me bringing home zippo! James caught some nice bass. They are not in full swing yet. Get-well wishes sent to Jerry Huff. Have a great weekend and remember God loves you.

And yet there she was in the bargain bin at Walmart. In a new nine-minute interview with iHeart Radio’s Colton Bradford, Lambert talks about recently shopping with her boyfriend Anderson East. First at Costco, then at Walmart. And that’s when she found her Crazy Ex-Girlfriend CD in the bargain bin. “He was like, ‘Well, hey, at least you’re on sale,” Lambert recalled East saying. A day off like that one is rare now that Lambert is back on the road, sharing her new music off her The Weight of These Wings double album. And she says she is just starting to get the kinks worked out. “It’s like riding a bicycle,” she said. “Your muscle memory kicks back in, and you’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, this is what it’s like to be on the stage.’ It’s a good adjustment. It’s something different.” Adding new songs to her set list for the first time in a few years has been another kind of adjustment, and she says it’s pushed her out of her comfort zone in a good way. “Honestly, it’s been an adjustment to do try to these new songs,” she said. “I don’t know that I was emotionally prepared to be singing them live. It’s still really fresh. Doing the songs live is a whole different ball game. “But I feel like that’s my job. That’s what my fans expect from me – honesty — and I did it on this one even more than ever. I’m proud that I went there,” she said. Lambert’s next tour stop is Thursday night (Feb. 2) in Providence, Rhode Island. Alison Bonaguro Alison makes her living loving country music. She's based in Chicago, but she's always leaving her heart in Nashville.

Your GameStop Said New Copies Of That Game You Want Are Out Of Stock… Are They? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Your GameStop Said New Copies Of That Game You Want Are Out Of Stock… Are They? Image courtesy of Mike Mozart February 2, 2017 3:42 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc high pressure gamestop video games circle of life used games As Wells Fargo rather spectacularly demonstrated in recent months, putting too much pressure on employees to notch up a certain kind of sale can lead to a perverse incentive: Employees who need to keep their jobs may try increasingly underhanded things just to meet an impossible metric. This week, a report suggests that the latest set of employees who might be lying through their face to you just to keep their jobs are the ones selling video games. That’s what’s happening now at GameStop, a report from Kotaku claims. The program, dubbed “Circle of Life,” was rolled out in the last few months. It gives each store four quotas they have to meet: one for game pre-orders, one for reward card subscriptions, one for used game sales, and one for game trade-ins. It’s not new for GameStop to encourage employees to make high numbers on all of those; they’ve been GameStop’s bread and butter for well over a decade. Game publishers set a minimum retail price, usually $60, on new products, and GameStop can’t deviate from that any more than Target, Amazon, or Walmart can — at least, not if they want to be able to keep stocking that publisher’s games in the future. But that $60 doesn’t leave very much margin for GameStop, or any other retailer; the price a publisher is charging stores to be able to stock those big-budget games is fairly high. That means companies that sell blockbuster video games make the bulk of their money elsewhere. For Amazon, Target, or Walmart, the options are legion; for GameStop, they’re mostly used games. So GameStop employees have always been encouraged to push used titles where they can, and to talk shoppers into trading in and selling used games at every moment. But what is new is that all of those metrics are now balanced against each other in strict percentage-based quotas. As Kotaku explains, say a store’s quota for used games is 30%. If that store sells $1000 in merchandise, then $300 worth of that merchandise needs to be pre-owned games. All of the percentages are balanced into a quota for both the store and the individual employee. So if you walked into a GameStop in January to buy, say, Resident Evil 7, but didn’t buy any used games, trade in any games, sign up for a reward card, or pre-order another game, that sale would significantly harm the numbers of the employee who sold it to you, and the store where she worked. In short, Kotaku reports, the program is basically an incentive not to sell new games or hardware, and it’s such a strong one that some employees are outright lying to customers about what’s in stock. “We are telling people we don’t have new systems in stock so we won’t take a $300 or $400 dollar hit on our pre-owned numbers,” one GameStop employee told Kotaku. “We also tell customers we don’t have copies of new games in stock when they are on sale—for example, Watch Dogs 2 is currently $29.99 new and $54.99 pre-owned. We just tell them we don’t have the new one in stock and shuffle them out the door.” Another employee outright lamented selling several copies of three new games on a recent Tuesday (the day nearly all blockbuster, wide-release video games launch). “Now I’m f**cked for the week,” that employee posted to Reddit. “Now I have to sell way more pre-owned this week.” Following Kotaku’s report, GameStop sent out a company-wide memo to all employees — which Kotaku again acquired — defending its aggressive sales quotas, and downplaying Kotaku’s initial report. “In the article, there were behaviors described that indicated our Circle of Life program placed pressure on store associates to mislead customers on the value of certain products,” company COO Tony Bartel writes. “Let me be clear on this, nothing could be further from the truth,” Bartel continues. “We want every customer to get the product and deal that is right for them – whether that be a new or pre-owned video game product, digital game or collectible.” Bartel adds that “I know [the behaviors in the article] don’t represent the vast majority of our associates and how they treat our customers.” However, what Bartel’s memo also makes clear is how strongly the sales pressure GameStop puts its employees under benefits the corporation. “The Circle of Life generates great value for the customer,” Bartel writes. “Consider these facts: GameStop issued approximately $1 Billion of trade credits to our customers last year. 70% of the time, those trade dollars were immediately spent on new gaming products.” If consumers are constantly re-spending their money in your store, that’s great for the store, regardless of whether it’s good for the consumer… and since it’s working so well for the retailer, it’s questionable whether it’ll ease up the pressure on its front-line employees anytime soon.

Garcia is the second suspect in a stolen-van crash that killed a 14-year-old girl and her mother. (Jim Thompson/Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... Officers escort Paul Garcia, 24, to the prisoner transport Thursday afternoon. Garcia is charged with felony murder and other charges in the stolen-van crash that killed a 14-year-old girl and her mother. (Jim Thompson/ Journal ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — When police caught up with one of New Mexico’s most wanted fugitives Thursday, he was sitting in an Edgewood McDonald’s with his face in his hands. Santa Fe County deputies and Edgewood police officers had been called to the McDonald’s inside the Wal-Mart and immediately recognized 24-year-old Paul Garcia, who had been on the run for two weeks after allegedly crashing a stolen van into a family, killing a 14-year-old girl and her mother. “They were walking toward the subject to confront him, and the subject stood up and faced them,” said Juan Ríos, the spokesman for the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office. Advertisement Continue reading Garcia apparently knew his time on the run was over. “He put his hands behind his back, and that’s when he was taken into custody,” Ríos said. Elexus Groves Police say Garcia and Elexus Groves, 21, were in a stolen van that crashed into a car on Jan. 18, killing 14-year-old Shaylee Boling and her mother, Shaunna Arredondo-Boling, 39. Arredondo-Boling’s 3-year-old son, who was also in the car, suffered a broken leg. Groves was arrested in Albuquerque two days after the crash, but Garcia had remained at large, eluding police despite a reward that had grown to $8,000. Both suspects are charged with two counts of murder and numerous other charges, said officer Fred Duran, a spokesman for the Albuquerque Police Department. Shaunna Arredondo-Boling, 39, and her daughter Shaylee Boling, 14, were in a fatal crash two weeks ago. Shaylee died at the scene, her mother died Tuesday afternoon. (Courtesy Diane Boling) Diane Boling, Arredondo-Boling’s mother, said she was thankful to hear that both suspects are now behind bars. The arrest came just two days after her daughter died of her injuries. “It doesn’t change anything; it won’t bring my girls back,” Boling said. “But I want to see justice done.” Ríos said that around noon Thursday, a woman called 911 to report she saw the “guy from the news” in the Wal-Mart just north of Interstate 40. Edgewood police officers and Santa Fe County deputies responded to the call and recognized Garcia, who was wearing a baseball cap and trying to hide his face. Advertisement Continue reading Albuquerque police had announced Garcia was a suspect a week and a half ago, and Crime Stoppers offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Mayor Richard Berry offered a $5,000 reward, and the U.S. Marshals Service offered $2,000. Marshals Service officials released a statement saying they believe the tipster’s information led to the arrest, and they are reviewing the details to determine whether she will receive the money. Duran didn’t respond when asked whether the woman was going to receive the other rewards as well. Ríos said Garcia refused to answer deputies’ questions except to say that he had arrived at the Wal-Mart on foot. The deputies handed him over to APD. Garcia also didn’t answer questions from reporters as he was escorted to the Prisoner Transport Center in Downtown Albuquerque. He was booked into the county jail Thursday night. Duran said detectives aren’t sure yet whether he was staying with someone in or near Edgewood or how he got to the town about 30 miles east of Albuquerque. “We don’t have proof that he was harbored,” Duran said. “He just wasn’t where we were looking for him.” Boling said she and her family are still reeling from the death of her daughter and granddaughter, and are now planning a second funeral. She said she hopes Garcia and Groves get the maximum penalty possible. “I hope that every day of their life – for the rest of their lives – they have a tremendous amount of guilt for what they did to my family,” Boling said.

From one exhausted mom to another. By Alessia Santoro It can't be easy struggling with a personality disorder, anxiety, and depression, but Cierra Lyn Fortner is working through all three as she parents her two children. When a cashier at Walmart who noticed Fortner in the store often complimented her on her kids' consistently cute outfits and good behavior and commented that she "seems to have it all together," Fortner thanked her and giggled. What she wishes she said, though, she decided to write in a brutally honest post to Facebook. "I want her to know I battle a personality disorder everyday with anxiety and depression mixed, and I'm a two-time suicide survivor," she wrote, beginning a list of things she really wanted the cashier to know about her. I want her to know that I can't always get myself up off the couch to feed them anything more than frozen pizza and cereal. I want her to know that my son is late for school three out of four days because I regularly forget what day and time it is, despite the toddler-size calendar in my kitchen. I want her to know I have those 'I'm losing my sh*t' moments when I have to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I want her to know I wasn't always the most active mom because I use to work 80 hours a week and go to school full time, so Jayce spent many days and nights with his grandparents. I want her to know that I hadn't washed my hair in three days and my kids hadn't had a bath in two. I want her to know that I was trying to hurry out of there because I had forgot the diaper bag at home and Brenton was hungry. I want her to know that once we got to the parking lot the 'well behaved' child decided to stand up in the cart and I wasn't paying attention and barely caught him as he almost hit the concrete. But most importantly, I want her to know I don't have it together and may never have it all together. I don't know a mother out there that has it all together but everything we do is done with love for our children and that right there makes you the perfect mom and in our children's eyes we most definitely have it all together. Her honest post has already gotten nearly 85,000 shares, proving that her challenges are relatable whether you struggle with anxiety and depression or not, but more importantly, for those who do face those struggles, that they're not alone. She ends her raw note by addressing every fellow exhausted mom — so basically every mom, ever. "From one exhausted mom to another: you're doing great, have that melt down, let your kids eat the crap out of that cereal, and take care of yourself always."   11 Cartoons That Show The REAL Side Of Parenting Nobody Talks About Click to view (11 images) Photo: Katie Kirby Christine SchoenwaldEditor Buzz Read Later   This article was originally published at PopSugar Moms.

Brothers Otis Smith Jr. and Anthony Holloway, along with Erin Mongar, are charged in the Jan. 27 drug-related shooting that left two Flint men dead inside an SUV in the Caledonia Township shopping center parking lot. However, for two of the suspects, this isn't the first time they could face felony convictions.  Third person charged in drug-related Walmart double homicide Smith, 31, was sentenced to a year of probation by an Ottawa County Judge in June 2016 after pleading to failure to pay child support, according to state records. Failure to pay child support is a four-year felony. He was on probation at the time of the shooting, according to Michigan Department of Corrections records. His probation is scheduled to expire on July 5.  Mongar, 34, who is accused of being the getaway driver following the shooting, also was previously convicted of a felony.  State records show she was discharged from probation on May 11 after pleading to attempted larceny in a building in Kent County in 2015. Attempted larceny in a building is punishable by up to two years in prison.  She was discharged from probation after a violation, according to MDOC records. Smith, Holloway and Mongar all have been arrested on suspicion of the same six felony charges related to the killings, which include: two counts of felony murder two counts of armed robbery one count of conspiracy to commit arm robbery one count of felony firearm. Brothers arraigned in drug-related slayings outside Walmart All three suspects in the case face the potential of life in prison without parole. Police say the victims -- Joseph Michael Carson, 31, and Anthony Lee Hammond, 39, both of Flint -- set up a transaction through Craigslist to sell an undisclosed amount of marijuana when they were robbed and shot to death.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

A day after Frost & Sullivan analyst Dan Rayburn criticized Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ)’s Go90 video platform as “pretty much dead,” T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) CEO John Legere tweeted confirmation. Is anybody really shocked by this?! Go90 was dead from the start! (..Told you so) #pathetic https://t.co/RtgfBm6mfq — John Legere (@JohnLegere) February 2, 2017 But a Go90 representative defended the venture and told Benzinga its numbers have been rising. “December was our best month in terms of organic growth on Go90, and January just eclipsed that,” spokesperson Jerry Rizzo said Thursday. “Does that sound like ‘pretty much dead’ to you? Mr. Rayburn is simply misinformed and can meet with us any day to learn about how alive we are.” During Verizon’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call, chief financial officer Fran Shammo reported more than 2 million downloads of the Go90 app. Still, representatives said they didn’t expect Go90 to turn a profit until about two years into the venture. Verizon launched the platform in summer 2015.

February 2, 2017 1:02 PM Jae C. Hong/Associated Press Retailers such as Walmart, above, and Target and trade groups have formed a coalition to fight a Republican tax proposal that would lead to higher prices of as much as 20 percent on everyday items including clothing, food and gas. By Anne D'Innocenzio and Christopher S. Rugaber / Associated Press NEW YORK — More than 100 retailers including Wal-Mart and Target as well as key trade associations are launching a coalition aimed at fighting a Republican proposal on how imports get taxed, a measure they believe would harm their businesses. The National Retail Federation, along with the American International Automobile Dealers Association, the National Grocers Association and others are joining forces to form Americans for Affordable Products, which will run a campaign to educate consumers and show lawmakers that the so-called Border Adjusted Tax plan would lead to higher prices of as much as 20 percent on everyday items including clothing, food and even gas. The diversified group, which also includes such companies as Nike, Best Buy, luxury conglomerate LVMH and Dollar General, is trying to make their opposition heard even while Congress and the president try to sort out exactly what adjustments to put forth. Findlay-based Dick’s Sporting Goods and Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Cumberland County, are among the retailers who joined the group. Congressional Republicans want to eliminate tax incentives that encourage U.S. companies to move overseas, sharply cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and encourage more factory output at home. But opponents say the plan would have a harmful rippling effect, causing companies to even lay off workers. The proposal — spearheaded by House GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House tax-writing committee — would constitute the most sweeping reforms to corporate taxes in at least three decades. Mr. Trump has dismissed the cornerstone of the House GOP plan as “too complicated” and has been touting a 35 percent levy on imports. Yet his spokesman appeared to put the tax back in play last week by proposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico and “other countries we have a trade deficit with” to pay for a border wall. “There’s a rush to get this done in Congress. We want to make sure our voices are heard,” said David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which has been dispatching members to meet with different levels of the new administration as well as lawmakers. Details of the consumer campaign are still being worked out, according to a spokeswoman at the retail trade group. A lot is at stake. Nearly all such items that U.S. shoppers buy are either wholly or partly produced overseas as companies have sought the cheapest way to make goods. And with online competition and shoppers trained to find the best deals, U.S. retailers haven’t had the power to raise prices on many goods for several years. “I’m losing sleep. I am scared out of my mind,” said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, which has signed on to the coalition. It is a family-owned company based in Vernon Hills, Illinois that makes educational toys and employs 150 people in the U.S. He estimates that under the GOP plan his federal tax rate would soar to 165 percent from 39.6 percent, he would have to raise prices by 10 percent to 15 percent to stay viable, and would have to lay off employees. Retail industry leaders “describe it as an existential threat,” said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, another member of the coalition. “When they crunch the numbers, it really affects things like solvency and profits.” Mr. Lamar said companies would likely have to pass along higher prices to shoppers, who wouldn’t tolerate it. Companies say they also would have to try to squeeze suppliers for more savings and fear they might even have to lay off workers or close stores. George Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, estimates that he would have to raise prices on his clothing anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent if the border tax went into effect. Shirts currently range in price from $14.99 to $49.99. “People who are thinking about it don’t know the consequences,” Mr. Feldenkreis said. He added that the company would also have to lay off workers. “It’s not just a retail implication,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. “We know it’s going to impact Main Street in many ways. It could be autos, manufacturing.” The proposal would essentially tax corporations based on where their products and services are consumed, rather than on their incomes. In that way, it is similar to a sales tax. House GOP supporters such as Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady say that would eliminate the incentives for corporations to use complex schemes to shift their incomes to lower-tax jurisdictions. To ensure the tax is focused on U.S. sales only, it would exclude a company’s export sales. But the cost of imported goods would be taxed. The tax could raise as much as $1.2 trillion in revenue over the next decade, which would help pay for the steep tax cuts included in the House GOP plan. Proponents say if the plan is enacted, the dollar will increase in value by as much as 25 percent, resulting in cheaper imports and offsetting the impact. But many economists and industry executives worry the dollar wouldn’t adjust, or certainly not fast enough. And Mr. Lamar said a shirt label saying “Made in China,” doesn’t tell the whole story. Seventy percent of the value of the garment supports U.S jobs in areas like design and logistics, he said. Other groups also oppose the border-adjusted tax, including Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, who typically donate generously to Republican campaigns. The tax would likely encourage companies to produce more in the U.S., or buy more of their parts and components in the U.S. Some companies say they could make those changes in order to avoid raising prices too much. Robert Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said on a recent conference call that the company could purchase more natural gas from the United States, rather than Mexico, which it uses to make glass for the Corona and Modelo beer it imports. “It’s those kinds of things that we are looking at, planning on, if this comes to pass,” Mr. Sands said. “We don’t expect consumer demand for our product to be affected.” Mr. Woldenberg, though, whose company makes 98 percent of its products overseas, says shifting his manufacturing to the U.S. isn’t an option. In the last three years, he said he tried twice to find some U.S. molders interested in making its products here, but it wasn’t financially feasible. He also doesn’t believe that changes in foreign exchange rates will offset the costs of the plan for retailers. And even if it did, he says relief wouldn’t come right away. “I am not going to play the currency markets to run this business,” he said. “I want to make toys. I am not a forex trader.” Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

Belvedere | @Matt_Belvedere 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Here's why Amazon is Bill Miller's top retail play    20 Hours Ago | 03:28 The value of Amazon's business "should double" in the next three years, value investor Bill Miller told CNBC on Thursday, ahead of the scheduled after-the-bell earnings release in the afternoon. "Amazon is going to grow 25 percent a year for the next three years," predicted the founder of Baltimore-based LMM. "That's a big position and has been for a long time," he said, referring to his Amazon holding. Miller said he's betting on both Amazon Web Services cloud computing and e-commerce. "Their addressable market in AWS alone is in the trillions of dollars," he said. "Facebook and [Alphabet's] Google, both of which are great companies ... are addressing global ad markets about $500 billion to $600 billion," by comparison. Meanwhile, he added, "U.S. retail alone is $5 trillion." Read More from Miller: Here's the 'perfect Trump stock' Apple's best days are behind it, but I still like the stock Two factors that could derail the8-year market run Acknowledging Amazon's push into the "capital intensive" logistics business, Miller said it's all about making online retail customers happy by delivering orders faster. Amazon plans to invest about $1.5 billion in an air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, state officials said Tuesday, The company said it would aim to employ 2,000 people and eventually house 40 Amazon Prime Air planes there. "Amazon would rather ship through FedEx or the post office, but they don't have the capacity, especially in the fourth quarter, to handle that surge," said Miller, pointing to Tuesday's earnings, revenue and outlook miss at UPS. Margins at UPS were squeezed because home deliveries result in fewer packages dropped per stop than businesses. Miller said he spoke to Amazon chief Jeff Bezos about a year ago, and asked him about the cash to set up logistics operations. Miller said Bezos responded by saying he's "highly confident he could earn well above his cost of capital." The LMM chief said he's taking Bezos at his word because of the many past successes Amazon has had in expanding its reach. On e-commerce, Miller said, "Amazon's gross margins are now higher than Wal-Mart's, considerably higher than Wal-Mart's." "Wal-Mart is a good competitor. They're not going away," he said, but argued Wal-Mart is going to have a hard time catching up online while running the legacy brick-and-mortar stores, which have been diminishing in profitability. Miller also said Wal-Mart overpaid for e-commerce start-up Jet.com. The $3 billion deal that closed in September saw Jet founder Marc Lore join Wal-Mart as CEO of the retail giant's U.S. online shopping business. Before Jet, Lore helped start Quidsi, behind the e-commerce websites Diapers.com, Soap.com, Wag.com and more. Quidsi sold to Amazon in 2011 for $550 million. Miller's LMM, a partially owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, has $2 billion in assets under management. Miller is also portfolio manager of the top-performing Legg Mason Opportunity Trust fund. — Reuters contributed to this report.

The father, who KXAN is not identifying to protect the identity of the victim, is facing charges for assaulting his daughter on Jan. 31 around 6:17 p.m. The incident began when police gave the girl a citation and released her to her parents. Moments later a witness flagged down officers to say a man was attacking a girl next to the store. Police found the girl with a bump on her head, which was not there prior to her leaving the Walmart. The mother said the father and their daughter were arguing about her shoplifting when the situation escalated as the father grabbed her by the throat. Wrapping his hands around her neck, the father “violently” pushed her against the wall, according to the mother. As the girl lost consciousness and her knees began to buckle, the father punched her across the face causing her to be thrown to the ground. While she was down, the father continued to punch her, states the affidavit. EMS says the girl could not remember anything after she passed out. However, a nearby patrol car captured the entire incident on camera. The father was arrested and booked into the Williamson County Jail.

Benedict said, “January sales reinforce our view that COST can deliver improved top-line trends in CY17 as compares ease, deflation moderates, and steep declines in tobacco are cycled.” The analyst reiterated an Outperform rating on the company, with a price target of $180. Strong January Comps Costco Wholesale reported comps of 7 percent for January, beating the estimate and the consensus, driven by stronger core trends. “Looking ahead, prospects for continued underlying improvement appear good as deflation appears to be moderating and tobacco headwinds should start to fade this spring,” Benedict mentioned, while pointing to the company’s “emerging credit-card related P&L benefits and potential out-of-model catalysts.” Core comps accelerated to 5 percent in January, from 3 percent in December, while the core comps in the United States saw continued momentum, against a backdrop of easing compares and slightly favorable weather year-on-year. International Trends Outside the United States, Costco Wholesale saw Canada local currency comps slowing from the December levels. Other international comps improved. In addition, global traffic improved to more than 3 percent, with the U.S. trends being especially strong. Core average ticket was also positive for the second successive month, with deflationary headwinds beginning to moderate. In terms of regional trends, Benedict noted, “Strongest U.S. regions were Northeast, Texas, and Midwest. Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan posted the strongest comps internationally.” At last check, shares of Costco were up 3.62 percent at $167.72.

Wal-Mart shoppers aren’t the only ones who could suffer under a tax plan that President Donald Trump is warming up to -- U.S. investors who trade on the London Stock Exchange, the Deutsche Boerse and Euronext might also take a hit. Stocks and bonds denominated in foreign currencies might lose as much as 15 percent of their value when their U.S. holders convert them into dollars -- one of the effects of a so-called border-adjusted tax, according to Paul Christopher, an economist at Wells Fargo & Co. That’s because economists expect that the dollar would strengthen under the tax proposal, which would replace the U.S. corporate income tax with a levy on U.S. companies’ domestic sales and imports, while exempting their exports from taxable income. Retailers have railed against the proposal saying they’d suffer under the tax because they rely heavily on imported materials. Other industries that import goods, including automakers, oil refiners and restaurants, have also said the tax could lead to higher prices for consumers. The tax proposal’s supporters, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, argue that macroeconomic factors would lead to a stronger dollar -- reducing the cost of imports -- and even out any effects on consumers over time. Trump’s aides last week signaled that the president is leaning toward the border-adjustment plan --  which Press Secretary Sean Spicer mentioned as a way to help pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Mexico is the U.S.’s largest source of agricultural imports, including Haas avocados. A senior White House official described the border-adjusted tax, which would apply to imports from all foreign countries, as the “most nationalist” way for the U.S. to tax its companies. This week, a broad coalition of lobbyists for retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., energy companies and the auto industry launched a lobbying counter-offensive against the proposal. Less attention has been paid to how the border tax would affect Americans who held $9.4 trillion of foreign assets as of Dec. 31, 2015, according to estimates by the U.S. Treasury Department. Revenue Generator “It’s not really on people’s radar yet,” said Christopher, head global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the bank’s registered investment adviser, said in an interview. If border adjustment is included in a tax overhaul, “the international portion of a portfolio could come to lose 10 to 15 percent,” he said.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

The American Made Coalition, consisting of over 25 companies backing the House GOP plan to exempt exports from taxes while keeping companies from deducting the cost of imports, made their presence officially known just this morning. Story Continued Below The group didn’t release its full roster, but it wasn’t shy about giving a full endorsement to border adjustability, saying it believes that it’s high time to get rid of an “obsolete and biased tax system subsidizing imports of foreign goods.” (Its name is also a pretty good reference to the “Made in America” tax that House GOP leaders talk about ending.) Dow, Eli Lilly, General Electric, Honeywell, Oracle and Pfizer are among the companies already reported to be in the coalition. The new coalition comes on the heels of an existing group, the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, endorsing the House plan a week ago. ACT has ties to GE, too. The group’s co-chairman, John Samuels, now a senior managing director at private equity giant Blackstone, was GE’s senior tax counsel for almost three decades. On the flip side, more than 100 companies and trade associations — including basically a who’s who of malls and strip malls, like Nike, Rite Aid, The Gap, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Target, Wal-Mart, Petco, Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue — make up Americans for Affordable Products. That group’s message, as our Brian Faler reports, is pretty simple: “Don’t make hard-working families pay more on essential products.” The Associated Press also took a look at the new group, in the process underscoring one of the challenges proponents of border adjustability face — explaining what can be a complicated system that relies on currency adjustments to even out the bottom line for importers. "I am not going to play the currency markets to run this business. I want to make toys. I am not a forex trader,” said Rick Woldenberg, the chief executive of Learning Resources — a toy maker and member of the new importers coalition that makes 98 percent of its goods abroad. SOMETHING ELSE TO CONSIDER: Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee were more than happy to hear that an exporter coalition was about to give them cover. “Good news!” said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the chairman of the Ways and Means Tax Policy Subcommittee. But given the populist energy in the country right now, is a coalition with some companies that already pay a low effective tax rate — and might never pay taxes again under border adjustability — the best messenger? Roskam brushed aside that notion, saying “the ripple effect of border adjustment” would eventually draw others into the debate. “I think you’re going to see suppliers and employees and all kinds of people active,” he said. THE END OF THE WEEK IS IN SIGHT. It’s also 38 years since Sid Vicious, the bassist for the Sex Pistols, died of a heroin overdose — less than four months after he was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen.

HEADING DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE: President Donald Trump is scheduled to host the four top tax writers — Reps. Kevin Brady and Richard Neal, and Sens. Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden — at the Oval Office this morning. The meeting is expected to focus on trade, according to people familiar with it, but you can also see both taxes and health care coming up. If tax does come up, it looks like Republicans still have some work to do on finding consensus on both tax reform and the taxes from the Affordable Care Act. Hatch said at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday that there are a handful of senators who still have some serious questions about the House’s destination-based cash flow tax, as Pro Financial Services’ Colin Wilhelm reported, but that he wasn’t ready to either back or oppose border adjustments. Hatch also said the Senate would come up with its own tax reform plan. Brady, responding to Hatch’s comments, said in a statement that the House, Senate and White House all agreed that the current system had to go, and suggested he was confident that at least the spirit of border adjustability would get enacted. “I’m optimistic we can find a common path that taxes all products equally in America and ends the ‘Made in America’ export tax so our companies can compete and win anywhere in the world,” Brady said. WHERE THE SENATE IS, CONT’D: Among Senate Republicans, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) continues to be one of the more willing to publicly question the House plan, as Brian writes. A day after calling for hearings, Cornyn said the Senate wouldn’t “rubber stamp” a House border adjustment plan and discussed some issues particular to his state, which has a significant number of oil refiners and relationships with factories across the border in Mexico. Other Senate Republicans took a Hatch-like approach to the idea on Wednesday — saying they still have questions and not sounding terribly excited by border adjustability, but adding they still have more to learn. “I’ve found that unless I have a good grasp on what I’m talking about, I say stuff that I wish I hadn’t,” said Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), who also said he hadn’t heard much yet from his state’s export-heavy agriculture sector. “Our family’s in the ag business. So I have no doubt that I will have lengthy discussions with them before I take a position on this.” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), also from a big agriculture state, told Morning Tax that he wants to hear more about how a border adjustment framework could affect the economy at-large. “I don’t think it’s ready for primetime yet,” he said. “Ag products, we’d like to export them. That’s healthy for our economy,” Rounds added, before noting that “we understand that there’s folks here that manufacture, and they think they’ve been treated unfairly.” Per Kaustuv Basu and Laura Davison of Bloomberg BNA, Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) said that he’s definitely hearing from Wal-Mart about the House plan, and that he still has questions about the currency aspect of the proposal. Meanwhile, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a Finance member, would only say: “I do understand the need to be more competitive but I want to be sure that we do so in a way that does not cause dislocation in the economy.” ** A message from Intuit Tax & Financial Center: Tax season opened on January 23, and more than 150 million Americans are expected to submit a return by April 18. Taxpayers should be aware of important developments this year, including the continuation of the IRS Free File program, tax credit processing delays and new efforts to reduce fraud: http://bit.ly/2kBBqUL ** NOT JUST TAX REFORM: Hatch also insisted Wednesday that Republicans have to repeal Obamacare’s taxes, even as other GOP officials want to keep some for the party’s own eventual ACA replacement. The Utah Republican also continued to press for immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but The Hill’s Peter Sullivan notes that some big-name Republicans are starting to use a different “r” word — repair. SEND THEM ON THEIR WAY: It was a busy Wednesday morning for Hatch. The Finance chairman and other Republicans on the panel temporarily suspended committee rules to push forward Steven Mnuchin’s nomination to be Treasury secretary and Rep. Tom Price’s nod to head HHS, Pro’s Zach Warmbrodt and Adam Cancryn report. Those rules ordinarily require at least one member of the minority party to take part in a confirmation vote, but Democrats boycotted for the second day over what they said were misleading answers from the two nominees. ABOUT THOSE TAX RETURNS: Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a senior Democrat on Ways and Means, has a new ploy to get a peek at Trump’s tax returns — asking Brady to use the committee’s authority to request the returns and then examine them in a closed session, which Pascrell said could be a first step toward their eventual public release. “President Trump is now governing while also owning a business with international investments,” Pascrell wrote to Brady. “The Constitution faces unprecedented threats due to this arrangement.” Hard to believe that Brady might go for the idea, but what about if Democrats take back the House in 2018? PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT: House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) was pretty cool to the idea of impeaching IRS Commissioner John Koskinen — but he’s all about Trump firing him, as POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm and Kyle Cheney write. (To be fair, impeachment is a bit of a higher bar.) Goodlatte joined a Republican Study Committee letter sent this week asking Trump to fire Koskinen, and said Wednesday that he has advised the president to “make that change sooner rather than later.” He added that Koskinen still being in office suggested that the IRS’s treatment of tea party groups was still not receiving enough attention. TRUMP STAFFS UP: Shahira Knight of Fidelity Investments is heading over to the White House to advise Gary Cohn, the chairman of the National Economic Council, on tax policy, Colin also reports. (The Wall Street Journal had it first.) Knight was once a top aide to former House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.). INTERNATIONAL NEWS — MODI GETS TO CUTTING: India, still looking for a little stability after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pulled a lot of currency out of the market, is cutting taxes for low earners, Bloomberg reports. People will see their tax rates fall to 5 percent on income between a quarter-million and a half-million rupees (around $3,700-$7,400). Those making more money — at least 5 million rupees — will face a surtax, as India tries to get a little more money into consumers’ hands and more taxpayers out of the dark. (The Indian government got information on less than 54 million residents’ income last year, out of about 1.2 billion in the country.) LOOKING AT YOU, TECH: Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner with the tax portfolio, wants to make sure that tech firms are paying up — and that could make life a bit more difficult for Ireland, POLITICO Europe’s Bjarke Smith-Meyer reports. Ireland’s the European home for Google, Amazon, and Airbnb, at a time when officials on the continent are considering more measures for battling tax avoidance. “We should make sure that tax doesn’t kill this innovation at birth … [but] if it’s not taxed, the market base will erode and business models will suffer,” Moscovici said. STATE UPDATE — HARD TO TAKE THEM OFF THE BOOKS: GOP lawmakers in Colorado are pushing to end a business personal property tax, for what The Denver Post called “the umpteenth time in the past 25 years.” Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, opposes the tax as well, and Democratic lawmakers aren’t exactly fans either. The issue: Those Democratic lawmakers think the state needs the money. By the second year of repeal, local governments and schools would be out almost $72 million in funding. QUICK LINKS — WSJ: Trump voters want action on taxes, be it lower taxes for small business or higher taxes on imports. — Four of the obstacles Republicans face on tax reform. — H&R Block’s newest employee: IBM supercomputer Watson. DID YOU KNOW? Donald Watson, an English woodworker, coined the term “vegan” and founded the Vegan Society in 1944. ** A message from Intuit Tax & Financial Center: The federal tax-filing season opened on January 23, and more than 150 million Americans are expected to submit a return by this year’s April 18 deadline. Although the tax code remains complicated, the annual review of income and expense reporting should be business as usual for most Americans. Still, taxpayers, their representatives and advisors should be aware of some important developments this year, including the continuation of the IRS Free File program, tax credit processing delays and new efforts in place to reduce fraud.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

The National Retail Federation, along with the American International Automobile Dealers Association, the National Grocers Association and others are joining forces to form Americans for Affordable Products, which will run a campaign to educate consumers and show law­makers that the so-called Border Adjusted Tax plan would lead to higher prices of as much as 20 percent on everyday items including clothing, food and even gas. The diversified group, which also includes such companies as Nike, Best Buy, luxury conglomerate LVMH and Dollar General, is trying to make their opposition heard even while Congress and the president try to sort out exactly what adjustments to put forth. Congressional Republicans want to eliminate tax incentives that encourage U.S. companies to move overseas, sharply cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and encourage more factory output at home. But opponents say the plan would have a harmful rippling effect, causing companies to even lay off workers. The proposal — spearheaded by House GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House tax-writing committee — would constitute the most sweeping reforms to corporate taxes in at least three decades. Trump has dismissed the cornerstone of the House GOP plan as “too complicated” and has been touting a 35 percent levy on imports. Yet his spokesman appeared to put the tax back in play last week by proposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico and “other countries we have a trade deficit with” to pay for a border wall. “There’s a rush to get this done in Congress. We want to make sure our voices are heard,” said David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which has been dispatching members to meet with different levels of the new administration as well as lawmakers. Details of the consumer campaign are still being worked out, according to a spokeswoman at the retail trade group. A lot is at stake. Nearly all such items that U.S. shoppers buy are either wholly or partly produced overseas as companies have sought the cheapest way to make goods. And with online competition and shoppers trained to find the best deals, U.S. retailers haven’t had the power to raise prices on many goods for several years. “I’m losing sleep. I am scared out of my mind,” said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, which has signed on to the coalition. It is a family-owned company based in Vernon Hills, Ill., that makes educational toys and employs 150 people in the United States. He estimates that under the GOP plan his federal tax rate would soar to 165 percent from 39.6 percent, he would have to raise prices by 10 percent to 15 percent to stay viable, and would have to lay off employees. Retail industry leaders “describe it as an existential threat,” said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, another member of the coalition. “When they crunch the numbers, it really affects things like solvency and profits.” Lamar said companies would likely have to pass along higher prices to shoppers, who wouldn’t tolerate it. Companies say they also would have to try to squeeze suppliers for more savings and fear they might even have to lay off workers or close stores. George Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, estimates that he would have to raise prices on his clothing anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent if the border tax went into effect. Shirts currently range in price from $14.99 to $49.99. “People who are thinking about it don’t know the consequences,” Feldenkreis said. He added that the company would also have to lay off workers. “It’s not just a retail implication,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. “We know it’s going to impact Main Street in many ways. It could be autos, manufacturing.” The proposal would essentially tax corporations based on where their products and services are consumed, rather than on their incomes. In that way, it is similar to a sales tax. House GOP supporters such as Ryan and Brady say that would eliminate the incentives for corporations to use complex schemes to shift their incomes to lower-tax jurisdictions. To ensure the tax is focused on U.S. sales only, it would exclude a company’s export sales. But the cost of imported goods would be taxed. The tax could raise as much as $1.2 trillion in revenue over the next decade, which would help pay for the steep tax cuts included in the House GOP plan. Proponents say if the plan is enacted, the dollar will increase in value by as much as 25 percent, resulting in cheaper imports and offsetting the impact. But many economists and industry executives worry the dollar wouldn’t adjust, or certainly not fast enough. And Lamar said a shirt label saying “Made in China,” doesn’t tell the whole story. Seventy percent of the value of the garment supports U.S jobs in areas like design and logistics, he said. Other groups also oppose the border-adjusted tax, including Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, who typically donate generously to Republican campaigns. The tax would likely encourage companies to produce more in the U.S., or buy more of their parts and components in the U.S. Some companies say they could make those changes in order to avoid raising prices too much. Robert Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said on a recent conference call that the company could purchase more natural gas from the United States, rather than Mexico, which it uses to make glass for the Corona and Modelo beer it imports. “It’s those kinds of things that we are looking at, planning on, if this comes to pass,” Sands said. “We don’t expect consumer demand for our product to be affected.” Woldenberg, though, whose company makes 98 percent of its products overseas, says shifting his manufacturing to the U.S. isn’t an option. In the last three years, he said he tried twice to find some U.S. molders interested in making its products here, but it wasn’t financially feasible. He also doesn’t believe that changes in foreign exchange rates will offset the costs of the plan for retailers. And even if it did, he says relief wouldn’t come right away. “I am not going to play the currency markets to run this business,” he said. “I want to make toys. I am not a forex trader.” More Business articles »     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Business stories Banking Summit Bank of Eugene reports increased annual profit, upcoming stock sale Business Super Bowl advertisers go big to vie for attention Business Amazon increasingly wants to be its own delivery service Business Snap, maker of the teen social app Snapchat, files for IPO Business Uber chief quits Trump council amid boycott calls Business Mexico exports no longer just avocados, tequila Business Business Highlights     Sports Oregon Men's Basketball Dillon Brooks’ late spree leads Oregon Ducks to victory over Arizona State With less than 48 hours to prepare for fifth-ranked Arizona, Dana Altman knew he would be up late Thursday night watching film.

By Laura Janks Program Coordinator Community Connections My morning started off with a trip to Walmart. As I was waiting my turn at the customer service desk, I couldn’t help but notice the person in front of me. The young woman in front of me had brought in her paycheck to be cashed. As I watched the customer service associate count out the money, the woman’s eyes grew wide and she opened up her wallet. Her bi-weekly check of $500 and some odd dollars was in her wallet, and she was off with her grocery cart. After completing my errands at customer service, I began my grocery shopping. I paused a second by the pasta sauces to decide if I really needed brandname spaghetti sauce or if Great Value brand could suffice. I repeated the same practice in front of the noodles, and cheese too. My husband and I can afford the brand names, but saving a penny or two here and there adds up, no matter what income bracket you fall in. Those pennies can eventually add up to be gas in my car or a meal on our table. Going through the aisles, I ran into people with carts loaded with name brand, processed and delicious looking foods. Many of their carts held little nutritional value because this is what society tells us we should be eating. This is what the commercials on TV are all about. They have us thinking that every happy family is dying to have nacho-flavored taco shells served at their dinner table. As a society, why do we waste money on junk when healthy food like fruits, vegetables, protein and whole grains also taste good. Maybe it’s because healthy food can be intimidating. Why waste money on food when you have to prepare it and it may or may not be good? Society and TV commercials show us that ready-made foods are always good right out of the package. Never mind the cost of these foods, just buy them. In reality, many people find eating healthy, saving for the future and budgeting money very difficult. Many people struggle to make ends meet. Where are people taught how to manage money? Most of us are left to figure it out on our own. Could you successfully raise a herd of cattle if you didn’t grow up around a farm? Could you be a heart surgeon having never gone to medical school? Could you be a lawyer having never taken a class on government or law? Could you save for the future, budget your money and plan your meals for the week, if you were never shown how to? Budgeting and shopping is a learned practice, not something we come by naturally. Community Connections is partnering with Chemical Bank in Harbor Beach to provide a free budgeting class. Class begins Wednesday March 8, 2017 from 5:30-6:30 p.m. at the Harbor Beach Library, over a course of three weeks. Learn or refresh your memory on balancing your checkbook, making a budget, starting a savings account and more. For questions or to register for class, please call Community Connections at 989-479-0346. Keep a look out for our upcoming class “Stretching Your Food Dollars” this spring.

Shaun Koch was arraigned on charges of armed robbery and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and scheduled for a pretrial hearing at 9 a.m. Feb. 16 and a preliminary examination at 9 a.m. Feb. 17 in district court. According to the Bad Axe Police, Koch used a handgun to force a store associate to hand over an undisclosed amount of money at the Bad Axe Walmart early Monday morning. He entered the store at approximately 6:50 a.m. and attempted to return merchandise. When his request was refused, Koch produced the gun and demanded money. He then left the building. Working with store employees, officers from the Bad Axe Police Department was able to identify a suspect. Bad Axe officers and deputies from the Huron County Sheriff’s Office then located the suspect’s vehicle at a local apartment complex. After watching the vehicle and apartment for approximately an hour, officers observed the suspect leave the apartment and begin driving his vehicle. Officers were then able to pull the vehicle over and arrest Koch. Huron County Prosecutor Timothy J. Rutkowski said no bond was set because Koch had been released from jail Saturday. He was arrested Thursday, Jan. 26, after appearing for a pretrial hearing for a previous charge of drunk and disorderly contact with a blood-alcohol content exceeding 0.10, which was a violation of his bond. Koch entered a plea of guilty to a charge of attempted drunk and disorderly conduct, per an agreement with the Bad Axe city attorney, Rutkowski said. Koch also has several warrants issued for his arrest from various police departments in the Detroit area, according to the Bad Axe Police Department.

(Associated Press files) By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO and CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER, Associated Press Published: February 1, 2017, 5:23 PM A   A NEW YORK — More than 100 retailers including Wal-Mart and Target as well as key trade associations are launching a new coalition aimed at fighting a Republican proposal on how imports get taxed, a measure they believe would harm their businesses. The National Retail Federation, along with the American International Automobile Dealers Association, the National Grocers Association and others are joining forces to form Americans for Affordable Products, which will run a campaign to educate consumers and show lawmakers that the so-called Border Adjusted Tax plan would lead to higher prices of as much as 20 percent on everyday items including clothing, food and even gas. The diversified group, which also includes such companies as Nike, Best Buy, luxury conglomerate LVMH and Dollar General, is trying to make their opposition heard even while Congress and the president try to sort out exactly what adjustments to put forth. Congressional Republicans want to eliminate tax incentives that encourage U.S. companies to move overseas, sharply cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and encourage more factory output at home. But opponents said the plan would have a harmful rippling effect, causing companies to even lay off workers. The proposal — spearheaded by House GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Rep. Kevin Brady — would constitute the most sweeping reforms to corporate taxes in at least three decades. Trump has dismissed the cornerstone of the House GOP plan as “too complicated” and has been touting a 35 percent levy on imports. Yet his spokesman appeared to put the tax back in play last week by proposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico and “other countries we have a trade deficit with” to pay for a border wall. “There’s a rush to get this done in Congress. We want to make sure our voices are heard,” said David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which has been dispatching members to meet with different levels of the new administration as well as lawmakers. Details of the consumer campaign are still being worked out, according to a spokeswoman at the retail trade group. A lot is at stake. Nearly all such items that U.S. shoppers buy are either wholly or partly produced overseas as companies have sought the cheapest way to make goods. And with online competition and shoppers trained to find the best deals, U.S. retailers haven’t had the power to raise prices on many goods for several years. “I’m losing sleep. I am scared out of my mind,” said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, which has signed on to the coalition. It is a family-owned company based in Vernon Hills, Ill., that makes educational toys and employs 150 people in the U.S. He estimates that under the GOP plan his federal tax rate would soar to 165 percent from 39.6 percent, he would have to raise prices by 10 percent to 15 percent to stay viable, and would have to lay off employees. Retail industry leaders “describe it as an existential threat,” said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, another member of the coalition. “When they crunch the numbers, it really affects things like solvency and profits.” Lamar said companies would likely have to pass along higher prices to shoppers, who wouldn’t tolerate it. Companies said they also would have to try to squeeze suppliers for savings and fear they might have to lay off workers or close stores. George Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, estimates that he would have to raise prices on his clothing anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent if the border tax went into effect. Shirts currently range in price from $14.99 to $49.99. “People who are thinking about it don’t know the consequences,” Feldenkreis said. He added that the company would also have to lay off workers. “It’s not just a retail implication,” said Jack Kleinhenz, economist at the National Retail Federation. “We know it’s going to impact Main Street in many ways. It could be autos, manufacturing.” The proposal would essentially tax corporations based on where their products and services are consumed. In that way, it is similar to a sales tax.

But opponents say the plan would have a harmful rippling effect, causing companies to even lay off workers. GOP plans The proposal — spearheaded by House GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House tax-writing committee — would constitute the most sweeping reforms to corporate taxes in at least three decades. Trump has dismissed the cornerstone of the House GOP plan as “too complicated” and has been touting a 35 percent levy on imports. Yet his spokesman appeared to put the tax back in play last week by proposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico and “other countries we have a trade deficit with” to pay for a border wall. “There’s a rush to get this done in Congress.

Details of the consumer campaign are still being worked out, according to a spokeswoman at the retail trade group. Cost and effect Nearly all such items that U.S. shoppers buy are either wholly or partly produced overseas as companies have sought the cheapest way to make goods. And with online competition and shoppers trained to find the best deals, U.S. retailers haven’t had the power to raise prices on many goods for several years. “I’m losing sleep.

He added that the company would also have to lay off workers. “It’s not just a retail implication,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. “We know it’s going to impact Main Street in many ways. It could be autos, manufacturing.” Tax goals The proposal would essentially tax corporations based on where their products and services are consumed, rather than on their incomes. In that way, it is similar to a sales tax. House GOP supporters such as Ryan and Brady say that would eliminate the incentives for corporations to use complex schemes to shift their incomes to lower-tax jurisdictions. To ensure the tax is focused on U.S. sales only, it would exclude a company’s export sales. But the cost of imported goods would be taxed. The tax could raise as much as $1.2 trillion in revenue over the next decade, which would help pay for the steep tax cuts included in the House GOP plan. Proponents say if the plan is enacted, the dollar will increase in value by as much as 25 percent, resulting in cheaper imports and offsetting the impact. But many economists and industry executives worry the dollar wouldn’t adjust, or certainly not fast enough. And Lamar said a shirt label saying “Made in China,” doesn’t tell the whole story. Seventy percent of the value of the garment supports U.S jobs in areas like design and logistics, he said. Other groups also oppose the border-adjusted tax, including Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, who typically donate generously to Republican campaigns. The tax would likely encourage companies to produce more in the U.S., or buy more of their parts and components in the U.S. Some companies say they could make those changes in order to avoid raising prices too much. Robert Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said on a recent conference call that the company could purchase more natural gas from the United States, rather than Mexico, which it uses to make glass for the Corona and Modelo beer it imports. “It’s those kinds of things that we are looking at, planning on, if this comes to pass,” Sands said. “We don’t expect consumer demand for our product to be affected.” Woldenberg, though, whose company makes 98 percent of its products overseas, says shifting his manufacturing to the U.S. isn’t an option. In the last three years, he said he tried twice to find some U.S. molders interested in making its products here, but it wasn’t financially feasible. He also doesn’t believe that changes in foreign exchange rates will offset the costs of the plan for retailers. And even if it did, he says relief wouldn’t come right away. “I am not going to play the currency markets to run this business,” he said. “I want to make toys. I am not a forex trader.” Email this: Retailers unite against GOP tax proposal | Eau Claire Leader-Telegram Your Name: Your e-mail: Recipient(s) Name: Recipient(s) e-mail: *Separate multiple addresses with a comma Comments: (optional) Send Clear Recommended Wisconsin-based Great Wolf Resorts buys Minnesota water park Xcel profit rises Xtras e-Edition Manage My Account New Subscriptions Magazines Delivery Coupon Bonanza Churches Submissions Most Read Man released in sex exploitation case Trial set in hit and run of pedestrian Tiny homes get Chippewa Falls committee’s OK Building fire put out east of Eau Claire Nestle plans Eau Claire factory expansion More...

Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp, CFP (TMFAlison) Feb 1, 2017 at 6:30PM In this episode of Motley Fool Answers, the team shares some of their best tips for automating your financial life. They cover everything from insurance to retirement accounts and bills to budgeting. To help you get started, two special guests also share their favorite apps that can help you set aside savings or reduce the fees in your retirement account, possibly saving you thousands of dollars. A full transcript follows the video. This viceo was recorded on Jan. 3, 2017 Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. He is also the advisor on Motley Fool's Rule Your Retirement newsletter. Robert Brokamp: Happy New Year, Alison. Southwick: Happy New Year! Brokamp: Yay! Southwick: It's 2017 and we're going to take on this year like a champ. Every week we're going to discuss small ways to be wealthier, happier, healthier, and more productive in the coming year, and today we are tackling wealthier with a step-by-step guide to simplifying your finances through the mini-miracle of automation. We'll also answer your question about which stocks belong in a Roth versus a traditional IRA and review a few money-related apps. All that and more on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers. __ Southwick: All right, it's time for Answers, Answers and today's question comes from Brian. Before I get into the question I should probably point out that we have a special guest in the studio today. Brokamp: One of our favorite special guests. Southwick: One of our favorite special guests is Megan Brinsfield. She is, of course, a planner with Motley Fool Wealth Management (a sister company of The Motley Fool). Megan Brinsfield: Thanks for having me. Southwick: Oh, of course. All right, so, here we go. Like I said, the question comes from Brian. Brian writes: "My question is this. Which stocks are best suited for a Roth IRA and why? I currently have a Roth IRA that I started this year and I have a traditional investment account that I have used for about seven years now. I wish I had started on the Roth earlier knowing what I know now. Anyway, I'm in the process of building out both accounts but want to know what I should put into each. Thank you and stay Foolish!" Brokamp: Brian, that's a great question. In your question you said that you have a traditional investment account. I'm not sure if that's a traditional IRA or just a regular brokerage account, so I'm going to answer it from both angles. Southwick: Ooh! Brokamp: So first of all, if you have a regular taxable brokerage account and some sort of a retirement account (it could be a Roth, it could be a 401(k), it could be traditional) what you want to do is essentially rank your investments in terms of how much they are taxed and put the ones that are taxed the most in the retirement account. So that could be, for example, if you do a lot of short-term trading. Not something that we generally recommend... Southwick: Yeah... Brokamp: ...but if you have short-term capital gains, that will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate which is higher than long-term capital gains. Maybe you have investments that pay significant dividends. You'll have to pay taxes on that, especially if they're not qualified dividends like the dividends that come from real estate investment trusts. Those are better investments to have in your retirement accounts, as opposed to a stock that doesn't pay a dividend and you just hold on for many years. That's pretty tax efficient. Now, what if the question is between you having a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA? The big difference, there, is how they'll be taxed when you take the money out. Traditional, you'll pay taxes. The Roth is tax-free. That makes the Roth better, so that's the one you want to grow the most. So roughly speaking, you want to put the investments that you expect to have the highest returns in the Roth. If you own cash, bonds, and stocks, then it's sort of easy to say that you probably want to keep the stocks in the Roth. What if you just own stocks? That's a little tougher because you don't really know which stocks will be performing the best. If you did, you'd make a lot of money... Southwick: Yeah, call us with the stock. Brokamp: ...and you could take over our show. So if you are an experienced investor, you could look at the stocks that you own and say, "OK, I expect these ones to perform better, so you put those in the Roth," or you could rely on history. History says things like small stocks outperform large stocks, although that's over the long term. Depending on what kind of stocks you own, it could be a high-growth-oriented type of stock. You'd put that in the Roth. Something like that. Brinsfield: I also like to think about time horizon as well, just because Roth accounts don't have that required minimum distribution when you turn 70 1/2 the same way traditional IRAs do. So really the Roth should be the last resort money that you have. And so you touched on it a little bit, but you should be willing to hang on to stocks that have more volatility in that Roth account so you can weather the storms of up and down and really hold for the long term in that account. Brokamp: The studies that have looked at order of withdrawals in retirement, if you had several accounts, generally indicate you should deplete your taxable accounts first, then your traditional tax-deferred, and then your Roth. So that gets to what Megan was saying in terms of you really want to put the stuff in the Roth that you're not going to touch for a long time. __ Southwick: Like I said, we have a special guest to kick off the first episode of the year. It's Megan Brinsfield! Brinsfield: Hurray! Happy 2017. Southwick: Happy 2017! So you are a financial planner, and you have tons of designations. What are some of your designations that you stick after your name? Brinsfield: I'm a certified public accountant, which is really popular at cocktail parties. Southwick: Yep. Brokamp: Is it really? Like surely people must come up to you with their questions. Southwick: They must have questions. Brinsfield: People have a lot of preconceived notions about what a CPA does. Everything from like auditing, or banking, to taxes and various financial matters. But yes, a lot of people confuse the designation CFA and CFP. CFA is like a three-year test and requires a lot of like karate and a little kung fu... Brokamp: Yes, bond convexity and things like that. Brinsfield: I did not do that. I did the CFP exam, which is certified financial planner and that is a broad-based exam that includes a number of fields like retirement planning, and taxes, investments and... Brokamp: Estate planning... Brinsfield: ...estate planning. Brokamp: ...cases. Brinsfield: And Bro and I get together and occasionally just bask in our CFP credential. Southwick: So you, two, at least have each other to talk to at cocktail parties. Brokamp: We do. We do. Brinsfield: Exactly. Brokamp: I don't know about the year you took the CFP exam, but I only 50% passed it when I took it, so it's not exactly easy. Brinsfield: Right. It's not a cakewalk. Southwick: Well, we asked you on the show because not only are you smart with the money, you are also a pro at automating your finances, so that's why you're here. You're here to share what you do and why you do it because it turns out automating is awesome. Brinsfield: It is, and it's alliterative. Southwick: We'll put that on a sticker. Automating is awesome! So talk a little bit about why automating is so great. I've heard different reasons like it helps get your behavioral finance issues off the table so you don't defeat yourself, like we are prone to do. Brinsfield: Yeah. Southwick: Like what do you see as the best benefits of automating? Brinsfield: That's definitely part of it. I remember a news story. You hear about Steve Jobs or Barack Obama wearing the same thing all the time... Southwick: Right! Brinsfield: ...and that concept of decision equity. That I only have capacity to make so many decisions in a day. I want to reduce the decisions I have to make on meaningless things, and although your money is very meaningful, it should be a place where you can make one important decision and automate those decisions over time. And that's what I found to be probably the most compelling factor for why I automate my financial life. But there are also other benefits, like having greater predictability in recurring transactions month to month. And then finally, if something gets me out of my normal routine, I know that my money is taken care of. That I never have to worry about my mortgage being paid. Southwick: If you're on vacation, or whatever. Brinsfield: Right. One of my parents got sick earlier this year, so [when I'm] running to the doctor I don't have to check my online bill pay or anything. I know it's done. Southwick: All right, let's follow the money, here, because we're going to provide a step-by-step guide for where you can automate your money along the way. So first, even before your paycheck gets into your grubby, little hands, what can you automate? Brinsfield: The most popular thing that you can automate through your employer is retirement plan contributions. Most employers have a retirement plan like a 401(k) or a 403(b) that you can contribute to, and you never see that money, which makes it very easy to let go of. And especially when your employer has a matching program where you can really get $1.30 or $1.50 for every dollar that you contribute, that's a pretty easy decision to make. Southwick: Also, insurance? Some insurances you can have come out of your paycheck? Brinsfield: Absolutely. A lot of workplaces also offer full-time employees, and some part-time employees, actually, health insurance benefits. That money comes out of your paycheck before taxes, and so it's cost saving as well as convenient. I know here at The Motley Fool we have a partnership with an insurance provider. I have my auto insurance, and homeowners, and umbrella insurance (all those fun, exciting things) come out of my paycheck when we get paid and I don't have to worry about it. And that's something that a lot of people actually can get caught up on, because insurance usually you pay twice a year... Southwick: Easy to miss. Brinsfield: Yeah, it's easy to miss. It always seems to come at the worst time. Oh, I got my tax refund and now I get to pay my insurance for the year. Brokamp: And particularly life insurance. If you went through some sort of a process to get approved for it and then you let that lapse because you forgot to pay the policy, you've got to go through that process all over again. You're going to be older, so it's going to cost more, and you might have gotten some new health problems along the way. That's actually something that's happened to me in the past. I did not automate the payment of my life insurance policy. I missed it and I had to get a whole new policy. Southwick: So then is the best step to take your HR director out for a cup of coffee and talk to them? I imagine every employer is different with what you can automate before it ends up in your paycheck. Brinsfield: Absolutely. I know when you first start at an employer, that's where you usually make all the decisions. They hand you a thick stack of paperwork and that's where you make your elections for the year. It's easy to breeze through that and just take whatever the first option is or the default, but the HR folks are really there to help you in making those decisions, or at least explain the decisions that you have in front of you. So I always tell people to take the time to actually read through that, even if it takes an additional week. Usually you have a week or 10 days before you have to turn that paperwork in -- as long as you get it in before your first paycheck -- so taking the time to review that. If you have a spouse, compare and contrast. Who has the better benefits? Make sure that you're optimizing that. Southwick: But for anyone who is not taking on a new job in the next couple of weeks, is a lot of this tangled up with open enrollment season? Or is it something that you can just go and change and make sure you've optimized it at any time? Brokamp: It varies. I mean things like healthcare and flexible spending are often open enrollment type issues. Some workplaces will facilitate that you contribute to a 529 college savings plan, and that's something you can opt into at any point. Southwick: Rick would have been interested in that. Rick Engdahl: I got that covered. Brokamp: That's right. Southwick: I know, but you could have had it covered a lot sooner. Man, if only we knew someone who helped put together our benefits packages and stuff. Brokamp: Hypothetically speaking. Southwick: (Whispers) It's Bro! Brokamp: It's kind of an ad hoc basis. It's not an official basis. Southwick: All right, let's move on. Now that the money has been pulled out (everything that you want to automate before you get your paycheck), your money heads into your bank account, and here's where you start automating your budgeting, correct? Brokamp: Right. What a lot of people do, when it comes to budgeting, is they look at how much they are spending and then see how much they have left over and save that. And what I've tried to do is reverse it, and that is figuring out how much I need to save to accomplish my goals, which for us are mostly related to retirement and saving for college for our kids. And then when we were saving for a new car, saving for that, as well. Get that money out of our checking account first and then you can spend what's left over. And so those are big goals, but you can actually break it down even to smaller goals. For example, we all just got through the holidays, somehow. We probably all spent more money than we expected, and maybe to some certain degree more than we had, so one thing you can do is take a look at how much you spent over the holidays, break that up by the number of paychecks that you have (like at The Motley Fool we have 24) and you can sock that money away separately, a little bit each paycheck, so that once the holidays come around next year, you'll have the money. It could be for your emergency fund. I quote an article a few years ago from a financial planner who wanted a new bike. It was a very fancy bike, so she set up this whole separate account so that a little bit of money from every paycheck was going into that one account just for the bike. Southwick: So basically you go to your bank and say, "I would like to open up 10 separate bank accounts, and I want $10 to go here every paycheck, and $13 here?" Is that how it works? Brinsfield: Yes, that's what I personally did. But having the online bank accounts, it's easy to duplicate savings accounts and have each one with its own distinct purpose. There was actually a study at one point that said if you can log into your account and see a photo of what you're saving for next to your account, you're more likely to save the money for that. So you log into your college savings account and you see your smiling children. Or maybe an empty house depending on where the dollars are there. Southwick: It's a new craft room! Sorry, junior. Brinsfield: Yeah, you're more likely to save in that event. I personally have each savings account labeled as what I'm saving for. Southwick: All right, Megan. What's your weirdest account that you have set up that you're saving for? Brinsfield: I have a recurring deposit into an account to pay for my future wedding. Southwick: Oh! That's smart! Brinsfield: It's fully funded, so don't tell my boyfriend. Southwick: He's going to be so happy. Brinsfield: He's so excited, right? No, he'll run away and I don't want that. Southwick: He'll be lucky to lock you down. Engdahl: Are you dating somebody who doesn't listen to this show? Brokamp: I think that's a deal breaker. Southwick: It's funny how it kind of sounds like a digital version of the good, old-fashioned envelope method. Brokamp: That's exactly what it is. And most people operate out of their checking account, and if you get that money out into these other accounts that you don't look at on a regular basis, you feel like you don't have that money, so you're less inclined to spend it. Southwick: So generally speaking, we're talking about budgeting into accounts like emergency, travel funds, investing, buying a new bicycle. Basically anything. Brokamp: Saving for a new car, whatever. Southwick: Anything you want to save for. Brokamp: Yup. Southwick: All right, now let's see where the money goes. So once we've automated our budgeting, the money needs to go out to pay some bills. Womp womp. Do you guys also automate your bill pay? Brokamp: Yes, definitely for the big bills. The regular payments like the cellphone. Things like that. Credit card payments. And in some ways we do it where it is automatically billed to the credit card, and then we use our bank account to pay the credit card off, so that way we get the credit card points. Southwick: Hey, who doesn't want some points? Brokamp: That's right. And for every opportunity I can, I get some sort of notification that the bill is coming due and it's been paid. So I'll get a text from T-Mobile, my cell service saying the bill has been paid every time it gets paid off. Brinsfield: I do the same thing with my cellphone. My mortgage. Just those regular, recurring bills knowing roughly exactly -- roughly exactly -- how much they are. It's pretty predictable every month, and so it's easy to automate those things. And for my credit card I don't automate the whole payment. I make sure I'm meeting the minimum payment each month so I don't get a ding on my credit report, but I do like the opportunity to go in and review the credit card statement before I actually put that money down. And it's so variable every month. After the holidays it could be a lot more than my normal spending. Southwick: I think that's a thing that scares people about automating their bills, is that suddenly T-Mobile is going to bill them a bajillion dollars and they're going to miss it... Brokamp: Right. Southwick: ...and they're going to start losing all of this money to reckless billing, I guess. Brokamp: Well, that's part of it. I recently had the experience of going to Florida to see my relatives over Thanksgiving and then about a week or so later, someone in Florida was charging things to our credit card. And because we have so much set up on automation, I actually didn't catch it immediately. It was American Express that caught it and called me, and it might have taken me longer. So I think that is something to consider, and depending on how much automation you do, you can sign up for things like gym memberships and things like that you totally forget about because it's constantly being billed, so you still have to take a look at it. Southwick: Now that we've paid off all of our bills, let's talk a little bit more about monitoring and automating our monitoring. And here's where Rick gets to come in, because Rick, somehow we decided you were the pro at monitoring your bills. Engdahl: I don't know why. It's the last thing I like to do. Southwick: Well, that's just it! Brokamp: That's it! Southwick: The point is that you don't like doing it, so you automated it. Engdahl: That is very true. I just set it up so that I get emails whenever anything happens and usually I just glance at the email and say, "Yup, that looks normal," and I delete it. And that's all there is to it. Southwick: So you don't even have to go and say, "Yes, approve pay." It's just like, "Hey, you're paying this." Engdahl: For the most part. If I see something that looks weird, then I'll go check it out and say, "Hey, well that looks weird." Southwick: So did you use like Mint? At what end of the process do you set up the alerts? Engdahl: I do it through my credit union account. It does the same thing that Mint does. I use to use Mint. That works fine, as well. I found that Mint sent me a lot more emails about things I didn't care about just because it tries to help you in ways that you may or may not want to be helped. With a bank account, it was much more just whenever a bill comes in, or a bill gets paid, or an account hits a certain dollar limit, or whatever you set up, you get that email. And every bank is going to be different, of course. Brokamp: That last one is important with the whole goal-based investing. Like you've decided, let's say, you're going to kick off 2017 by saving more in your 401(k), and saving for next year's holidays, and saving for the vacation now. You're getting all this money taken out of your checking account, so chances are if you don't then look at your checking account, you might get close to overspending, because now you have to get used to this new amount in your checking account. So you have to set up some sort of alert that says to you, "You're pretty close to whatever set amount." Southwick: Running out of money. Brokamp: Exactly. And that says to me that whatever you're doing, you need to slow down a little bit and wait until the next paycheck. Brinsfield: And the first time you put your automating through your paycheck, you have to allow a little bit of buffer for errors so that your checking account doesn't go low or negative. Brokamp: Right. Southwick: Yeah. Brokamp: But the good thing about the goals-based budgeting is the reason that money has left your checking account is because you are funding your goals. So then it's OK to spend what you have left over, because you've taken care of the important stuff. You just have to have some sort of alert to let you know that you're getting too close to a balance that's uncomfortable or inappropriate for your situation. Engdahl: Could I just throw in, here, that you guys or money expert types are making maybe this sound complicated. Like this is a really sophisticated way to do your money. The real benefit of this whole automation thing is that if you hate dealing with money, it just all happens. If you set it up once and forget about it, it's really easy. And for people who don't like to think about money all the time, this is the one for you. Southwick: Right. The one thing that's going to make your life in 2017 a lot easier. Engdahl: Or if your kid's graduating from college, or something, you help them set this up so that they don't have to have a headache about money all the time. It just happens. Southwick: And then you're good for the year, to some extent. Brokamp: Right. And probably for at least a year, and every year you should evaluate it. If you're saving for college or saving for retirement, you want to make sure that you're saving enough and all that stuff. But if you do set it up, that is the benefit for the most part. You're on cruise control for a good year or so. Southwick: Just crank up the radio. Listen to your tunes. Drive down the highway. You're crushing it in 2017. Brokamp: That's right. Southwick: Everything you accomplished in the first week of January. Boom! Well, then let's talk about where automating maybe doesn't work out so well. Brinsfield: Yeah, there could be a few instances where there's a pain point here or there. Not everything is set up for autopilot. There are certain companies, or online platforms, that only let you schedule a certain number of automatic payments. It requires you to check in every six or 12 months to reset that automatic payment, so you're not getting 100% cooperation from all the other parties that you need to pay or save for. Bro mentioned checking in once a year, but if your circumstances change by quite a bit (maybe you have a compensation adjustment), it sounds really nice, but it can lead you to actually spending more because you haven't targeted that additional money to go into a savings account of some kind. Another downside is that some things that can be automated come with a cost premium. I had mentioned paying my auto insurance, for example, through my paycheck, which is really convenient. It equates to maybe $100 more that I'm actually paying for the premium every year, but it's worth it to me to know that it's taken care of and I don't have to worry about it, rather than saving that $100 and being more stressed about it. So there is a balance, there. And then finally, if you think about all of this, (the systems working perfectly in unison), it really makes it hard to switch a bank account, or switch your primary credit card to something else, because you really don't know all the ways that automation is affecting that account until you... Southwick: Like the whole machine just falls apart. Brokamp: Yeah. Brinsfield: Right. Southwick: So I guess make sure that whichever bank you go with to set up your accounts -- make sure it's one that you are really, really happy with. Brinsfield: Right. This isn't something that you would set up for the purpose of getting a $100 bonus deposit and then have to redo it at another bank a few months later. Southwick: This is your forever-bank. Aw! Brinsfield: And the bank will be happy to know that, as well. Southwick: Right, yeah. Maybe mention that to them and then maybe you'll get, I don't know, a free mug. Brokamp: A toaster. Do they give out toasters at banks anymore? I don't think so. Brinsfield: Pens. Pens and lollipops. Southwick: I'll take a pen. Engdahl: You're not supposed to keep the pens. Brinsfield: They've got so many of them. Engdahl: It was not a gift. Brokamp: And this chair. I'm taking this chair, too. Southwick: To be fair, I paid for that pen. I have paid dearly for that pen. I deserve a pen. Well, I think that covers it. Hopefully we've convinced some people to take the plunge and automate their finances as much as possible. Do you think we did it? Brinsfield: I hope so. Engdahl: New Year's resolution checked off the list for a lot of people, I bet. Brokamp: That's true. Southwick: I hope so. Well, it's going to make their lives a whole lot easier in 2017. One less thing to worry about if you just take some time and set this all up. Like maybe you can take an afternoon or day to get this set up? Brokamp: Probably. Especially if you are incorporating all your finances, I think that's a great idea. To just take a whole day to take care of it all. It may not sound very fun, but you'll feel a heck of a lot better when you're done. Southwick: Yeah, future self will thank you. Brokamp: That's right. Engdahl: And about a year ago we learned that after you take a day to do something like this, you get to treat yourself. Southwick: Treat yourself! Engdahl: Go out to dinner. Do something nice. Brokamp: That's true. Southwick: We did talk about that. So, all right. Go automate some stuff and then take your favorite self out to dinner. Megan, thank you for joining us. It's always nice to have you in the studio. Brinsfield: It's a pleasure. I'm glad I get to kick off 2017 with you guys. My favorite people. Southwick: Thank you. __ Southwick: This month I've enlisted the help of a few guinea pigs. Do you mind me calling you guinea pigs? Rathner: It's on my email. Southwick: OK, great. To try out a few apps to help you manage your life in a series we're calling There's an App for That. Not terribly creative. Brokamp: Very clever. Southwick: Whatever, all right. So today we're going to talk about some apps to help you manage your money. Joining me is Naima Barnes. She's a financial planner with Motley Fool Wealth Management (a sister company of The Motley Fool) and Sara Rathner, a friend of the show, a Fool, and a money savant. Rathner: Sure. Brokamp: Totally agree with that. Rathner: Oh, well, if Bro says it, it must be true. Brokamp: It's true. We've worked together. I know. Southwick: So staying on the topic of automation, Naima, you're going to go first. You looked at an app called Digit. Barnes: Yes, I did. Southwick: What does Digit promise to do for you? Barnes: So Digit promises to save mindlessly for you, so they move over money a little bit, either every day, a few days, depending on what your spending looks like. So it could be anywhere from like twenty cents up to fifty dollars. So far I've saved about $480 with them... Southwick: Wait. What? When did you set it up? How long have you been doing it? Barnes: I've had it for the second go-round at least since I moved here, so about a year. Southwick: Wow! Barnes: And just mindlessly moving over money every few days. Brokamp: Basically it analyzes your spending habits and your income habits, right? Barnes: Yes. Brokamp: And says, "OK, we think we could safely move this amount over to this other account." Barnes: Yeah. And the really cool thing is that they send you a text message every day of what your balance is, and then you can reply back with some keywords like "how much have I saved already? Can I add more?" And they'll do that for you. Southwick: It's smart enough to protect you. Barnes: Yeah. Southwick: So you hook it up to your savings account? Your checking? What accounts do you hook it up to? Barnes: You hook it up to a bank account -- a checking account -- and then it will move money into their own little savings account, which is FDIC insured, which is really cool. And from there it will move money over, periodically. You can withdraw it at any time, and they will also cover overdrafts, which is also nice. Southwick: Is it a free app? Barnes: Yes, it is free on Android and iPhones, and you can sign up either on their website to use through the text message or through the app. Brokamp: You can transfer money just by texting them, right? It's pretty easy to move money from the Digit account. Barnes: Yes, very easy. Brokamp: And they don't pay interest, but they pay like a bonus every three months. Barnes: Yeah. So if you have at least $100 with them, for every $100 you have with them for three months they'll give you five cents. Which is pretty cool. Southwick: I'll bet. So bottom line -- do you like it? Barnes: I love it. Southwick: Oh! Not to the like. A love! Awesome. All right, so that's Digit. And it's Digit or Digits plural? Barnes: It's Digit. Digit.co is the website. Southwick: All right, cool. So Sara, you looked at PersonalCapital. Now PersonalCapital I think of as being a robo advisor, but the app does a lot of things, right? Rathner: Yeah. I would describe it as a combination of -- like if you've used Mint.com or Mint -- budgeting plus eventual financial advisement/investment management. It works at most levels, so it can be what you want it to be and what you're willing to pay for. So the app is free. Signing up for the site, and creating an account, and attaching various accounts to your account is all free, but then I think what happens is once you hit a certain net worth minimum (and I'm not sure what that number is), the sales calls begin. Southwick: Oh! Brokamp: I think it's $25,000. I think you have to have at least $25,000 for them to manage your money. Rathner: Right. And so I did get a sales call and they wanted to set me up with a 20-minute phone call with a financial planner, and I had to be very nice. And then I had to get slightly less nice because they were pretty insistent and I was just like "I have financial planners in my life," because I work at The Motley Fool and we have those resources, here, and I can just walk down the hall and ask Bro a question or ask Naima a question or something like that. And so I didn't personally want to take advantage of that. I'm sure plenty of people would love the opportunity to work with a company that has this really great interface that can give you advice about how you should allocate your money but also manage your money if you would like to pay a fee. I'm just more of a DIYer, so that wasn't something I wanted to take advantage of. Southwick: But you did take advantage of one aspect, and if I recall you were very pleased. Rathner: Yes. So the app is pretty cool. I would say if you want the whole enchilada, you should just go to the actual website and log in, there, because you'll see all of their features. One of the ones I really liked was the 401(k) fee analyzer because it looks at all of your retirement account holdings -- so not just your 401(k), but it will also look at your IRAs, too -- to give you some numerical data, because I feel like some of your listeners would want actual numbers to go with this. Assuming I max out my 401(k), which I do, and I get a 7.5% return by the time I'm 67 (which is in 35 years and I receive a $4,800-ish match from The Motley Fool every year), before my Roth IRA and my 401(k) combined, I would have lost 10% of my earnings to fees by the time I retired at 67, which is over $0.5 million... Barnes: Whoa! Rathner: Yeah. The thing is you see that 10% and it doesn't seem like much, and then you put a number behind it. Southwick: Number and time. Rathner: Time. Southwick: Time times fees can be quite sobering. Brokamp: Right. Rathner: Right. And then they give you this thing like this number equals X number of years of your retirement that you could have funded with this money, but instead you paid fees on your investments. So then I redid my 401(k) allocations, because I have skills, and there were a couple of allocations that I had, had from a couple of years ago that I was able to pick options that were similar but had lower expense ratios. (If you want help with this consult a financial planner), but I just did it myself. And so I was able to bring the fees down on my 401(k). And here's where the numbers get really tiny, but have a big impact. I think I was paying like 0.22% in fees on average, and I brought it down to 0.20%, which does not seem like a lot. However, I said before I was going to lose 10% of my earnings to fees in 35 years, and now I will lose 7% of my earnings to fees, which is just under $400,000. It ended up being a difference of $156,000 in fees, so that could probably fund my retirement for like three years. Southwick: Right. So because of the PersonalCapital app, you were able to rejigger your 401(k) and basically have $150,000 more dollars for your retirement. Rathner: Yup. And I did not pay a dime. Southwick: The CliffsNotes. Brokamp: The word on the street is the difference between Mint and PersonalCapital, Sara (and you let me know if you agree with this), is that Mint is better for people who are really looking to get control of their spending. It's more budgeting oriented. PersonalCapital is better if you are more interested in sizing your portfolio and retirement planning. Rathner: Yeah, you could attach your credit card accounts to your PersonalCapital account and it will analyze your spending categories for you. I chose not to do that, because I didn't want to use it as a budgeting tool. I found for me it was more helpful as a snapshot of where I am in time and also as a way to see what small changes I could make to make a big impact on my earnings in the future. It really just took me like 15 minutes. Southwick: Cool! So bottom line, PersonalCapital is cool to find you money. Maybe not so cool with the sales calls that follow up. Rathner: I'm not a huge fan of sales calls. Southwick: Not that anyone is. Rathner: Not to knock PersonalCapital. Like you have to make money, somehow, so I get it. And if people need help, then they're doing a good thing. But I personally did not want that feature, so I did not take advantage of it. Southwick: And you don't have to, because the 401(k) analyzer was free, right? Rathner: Mm-hmm. Southwick: All right, yay! Well, that's it. That's it for There's an App for That. Brokamp: Thanks, guys. Southwick: Thank you so much for joining us. All right, well that's the show. I want to thank Sara, and Naima, and Megan for coming in and helping us kick off 2017. And I don't know. How would you describe the way they helped us do it, Bro? Brokamp: Fantastic style. Southwick: All right. Our email remains Answers@Fool.com. Join us next week as we tackle another way for you to take control of 2017 and make it fantastic. What? What did you say? Brokamp: Fantastic style! Southwick: Oh, it doesn't make any sense. I don't know why I'm laughing. All right, whatever. The show is edited with fantastic style by Rick Engdahl. Uh, stay Foolish everybody and have a great 2017!

She wrote: 'Today I was at Walmart doing my weekly shopping when the cashier says to me, "I see you in here all the time, your kids are always dressed cute, behaving and you just seem to have it all together".

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump " specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration " has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Continued below.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Uber CEO Travis Kalanick speaks to students during an interaction at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Mumbai, India, January 19, 2016. (Reuters Photo) The chief executive of Uber has backed out of a business advisory council set up by Donald Trump, a week after the new U.S. president issued an immigration order that raised concerns for the ride-hailing company and its employees. Travis Kalanick spoke briefly with Trump on Thursday about the order "and its issues for our community," and told the president he "would not be able to participate" in the council, he said in an email sent to employees. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick wrote. His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday.

White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is “designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner,” according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation.

Hiring freeze result of Trump team's review of federal agencies Cautious investors focused on earnings reports from U.S. companies including Facebook and Merck. Ryder System, a truck leasing company, fell 8 percent after earnings fell short of expectations. Ralph Lauren plunged 12 percent after announcing its CEO of two years was leaving. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.03 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 19,884.91. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 1.30 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,280.85 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.45 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,636.20. Advertisement Some investors worry President Donald Trump’s actions including last week’s immigration ban, comments on trade and tough talk toward Mexico, Australia and Iran might hurt business confidence and the economy. After a post-election rally that pushed stocks to all-time highs and the Dow above the 20,000-point mark, investors have stepped back this week. Investors looked ahead to government data on hiring for January. Some of that uncertainty could come today with the government’s jobs report for January. For this report, the first that will be at least partially under the tenure of President Trump, economists estimate employers created 175,000 jobs in January, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent, according to FactSet. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose but remains below $54 per barrel. The dollar gained against the yen and was little changed against the euro. ECONOMY-THE DAY AHEAD Major business and economic events scheduled for today WASHINGTON (AP) — The first U.S. jobs report to be released since Donald Trump became president will reveal whether growing confidence among businesses fueled an accelerated pace of hiring in January. The Labor Department will release last month’s employment data this morning. Also today, the Commerce Department will report on U.S. factory orders for December. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers will issue its index of non-manufacturing activity for January as well today. SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS-US PLANT South Korea’s Samsung mulls building US appliance factory SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s Samsung Electronics says it’s considering building a factory to make household appliances in the United States as various industries brace for potential protectionist trade policies under the administration of President Donald Trump. A spokeswoman for Samsung said the plans were “purely in the evaluation stage” and no decisions have been made. She didn’t want to be named, citing office rules. Samsung also said in an emailed statement on Friday that it continues to assess “new investment needs in the United States. The news drew the attention of Trump, who tweeted “Thank you, @Samsung! We would love to have you!” Most Samsung televisions, refrigerators and other household appliances sold in the United States are made in Mexico. The spokeswoman refused to say whether Samsung was worried about the possibility of the United States moving to impose tariffs on products imported from Mexico. A spokesman from LG Electronics, another South Korean technology company, said it is also considering building a manufacturing plant in the United States and will decide on the matter within the first half of the year. He also didn’t want to be named, saying that the matter was sensitive. TRUMP BUSINESS COUNCIL Uber chief quits Trump business council amid boycott calls WASHINGTON (AP) — Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump’s council of business leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.

JAPAN-EARNS-HONDA Honda profit jumps on cost cuts, absence of recall expenses TOKYO (AP) — Honda says profit jumped 36 percent October-December on year, shrugging off damage from a strong yen, and the Japanese automaker raised its annual forecast. Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co. reported Friday cost cuts lifted fiscal third quarter profit to 168.8 billion yen ($1.5 billion), up from 124.1 billion yen the previous year. Quarterly sales edged down 3 percent to 3.5 trillion yen ($31 billion) from 3.6 trillion yen. Honda, which makes the Odyssey minivan, Asimo child-like robot and Super Cub motorcycle, raised its full fiscal year profit forecast to 545 billion yen ($4.8 billion). That was up 58 percent from 344.5 billion yen a year ago, when Honda was hit by expenses for recalls over Takata air bags. Honda had earlier expected a 415 billion yen ($3.6 billion) annual profit. CHARTER-UNIVISION Univision networks back on for Charter customers, for now NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of Charter cable customers can watch Univision again, although it may just be a temporary fix. The country’s most popular Spanish-language network and other networks owned by Univision had gone black overnight Tuesday for Charter customers in New York, Los Angeles and other markets because of a payment dispute. Univision said Thursday that a judge temporarily assigned to its court fight with Charter planned to order that the networks come back on for seven days. Another judge returns then. The companies say the networks are already coming back on. Cable companies are trying to stem rising costs for the channels they beam out, which trickle down to customer bills. Fights with the owners of the networks can lead to channels being cut off. BLUE BELL-PLANT INSPECTIONS Agency traces listeria in Blue Bell product to Iowa supplier BRENHAM, Texas (AP) — Federal inspectors have confirmed listeria found in a brand of Blue Bell ice cream that prompted another recall of its products originated with a third-party supplier. The Houston Chronicle reports that the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter last month to Iowa-based Aspen Hills detailing the company’s failures in preventing contamination. The contamination that forced the Blue Bell recall in October was traced to Aspen Hills’ chocolate chip cookie dough. Blue Bell credited its testing program with identifying the presence of listeria in the dough. At the time, Blue Bell was regaining some of its market share following a debilitating recall the year before resulting from 10 listeria cases in four states, including three deaths in Kansas. Aspen Hills ceased production at the end of December. PIMENTO SPREAD-RECALL Listeria prompts recall of Ruth’s Salads pimento spread CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Ruth’s Salads has announced a recall of its Original Pimento Spread in 7-ounce plastic containers after determining it could be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. A statement from the Charlotte-based company on Thursday said the contamination was discovered during random testing by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Consumers should check the label: Any spread from Lot #16, with a sell-by date of April 30, 2017, are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. So far, no illnesses have been reported. The recalled spread was distributed in grocery stores in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and parts of Virginia and Tennessee. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. SNAP-IPO Snap files for IPO, seeks to raise $3 billion NEW YORK (AP) — Snap Inc., owner of the popular disappearing-messages service Snapchat, seeks to raise up to $3 billion in an initial public offering. That number may change based on investor demand. The highly anticipated IPO is expected to be the one of the largest since Alibaba Group went public in 2014. But Snap is better known than the e-commerce company, drawing comparisons instead to the IPOs of Facebook and Twitter. According to IPO documents filed on Thursday, Snap has lost nearly $1 billion in the past two years. Los Angeles-based Snap had revenue of $404.5 million in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. Its net loss was $514.6 million last year, and $372.9 million the year before. The company says 158 million people use Snapchat daily. AIRLINES-GULF COMPETITORS US airlines renew campaign to rein in Gulf carriers DALLAS (AP) — Leaders of the three biggest U.S. airlines are seeking to meet with new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to revive their stalled complaint that rivals from the Middle East are getting unfair government subsidies. The issue took on new urgency last month when one of the fast-growing Middle Eastern carriers, Emirates, announced plans to begin a new route between Athens, Greece, and Newark, New Jersey, just outside New York City. Such flights would entirely bypass Emirates’ home nation, the United Arab Emirates. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said Thursday that Emirates’ announcement — coming as the Obama administration was leaving and before the Trump administration was at full speed — “certainly looks like a shot across the bow.” NORDSTROM-IVANKA TRUMP Nordstrom to drop Ivanka Trump’s clothing, accessories line SEATTLE (AP) — Nordstrom says it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories. The Seattle Times reports the Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance of the first daughter’s brand. A Nordstrom spokesperson didn’t say whether the decision to stop buying the brand was permanent, only that they make buying decisions each season. The move comes amid a weekslong campaign known as “Grab Your Wallet,” which has been calling for a boycott of retailers that carry Ivanka Trump or Donald Trump merchandise. In November, Nordstrom posted a response on Twitter to a shopper’s letter calling for the company to stop selling the brand, saying, “We hope that offering a vendor’s products isn’t misunderstood as us taking a political position; we’re not.” Topics: Business News Health News Lifestyle News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Business News » Update on the latest… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1848: Treaty extends US borders to Pacific Ocean Photos of the amazing, moving, important and amusing things happening in the federal community.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co.

City Manager Greg Garrett announced that Public Works Director Jon Curry is leaving to take a job as the new general manager of the Stallion Springs Community Services District. Garrett made the announcement at the Greater Tehachapi Economic Development Council meeting on Feb. 1. “Jon has worked with us for about 10 years,” Garrett said. “In that time, he's learned a lot about the different workings of roads, water and more. He will be a great addition to Stallion Springs, but he will be missed.” Garrett also reported that Walmart should be pulling permits in the coming weeks to build a store in Tehachapi. He said the projected completion is the end of 2018. Also, Stray Leaf has closed escrow on the old bank building on Green Street to open a new wine tasting room. Other news from the GTEDC meeting included: General Manager Tom Neisler of the Tehachapi-Cummings County Water District said the area saw seven inches of rain in January, and it should receive a water allotment of 60 percent from the state water board. Also, the snow pack to the north is at 200 percent above average and there's 20-feet-plus of snow in Mammoth. “All this precipitation was not predicted, but has been above historic levels," Neisler said. "We've been blessed. It's an interesting time to be a water manager.” Michelle Vance, economic development coordinator for the city, reported that registration is now open for Gran Fondo, and that on the Grand Fondo website, the Tehachapi race was listed among the top 15 events. Ryan Rush, field representative for Supervisor Zack Scrivner's office, said the RENWEBIZ grants have been awarded and the Old Town area of Tehachapi received 12 for a total of $112,000. These grants are for unincorporated areas of Kern County and can be used to upgrade businesses. The money comes from a percentage of property tax collected from wind projects. Ida Perkins, president of the Greater Tehachapi Chamber of Commerce, reported several new businesses are opening. She said there would be five ribbon-cuttings in the next few weeks. Pat Doody of the Tourism Commission said the group is looking to update its website so it can make changes as needed to reflect upcoming events. She also said some 1,200 people stopped at the new Visitors Center since its opening last July. jbnelson Follow jbnelson Close Get email notifications on jbnelson daily!

Admit it, you're intrigued. Everyone has their own wants and desires in the bedroom. Sometimes your needs are pure and innocent — just the gentle touch of a loving man. But other times, your inner wild child comes out and you just want to be punished — or do the punishing.  Here's the thing about cuckolding, there's no real physical pain or abuse going on. It's nothing like BDSM, 50 Shades of Grey, or anything like that. You're just taking part in intercourse with someone other than your husband ... while he watches. Giphy Cuckolding has actually become a really common fetish amongst married couples and single people alike. No surprise it's popular for married people as they can often get bored in their marriages and want to spice things up a bit. But I guess single people take pleasure in getting with someone's wife, too.  I say, to each their own. Fetishes are normal and everyone has their own unique tastes. If you want to be spanked repeatedly while having intercourse or watch your wife get groped by another man, who are we to judge? You're not alone in these cravings, there are others out there who appreciate what turns you on, too.  Take a look at these 7 excerpts from erotic cuckolding sex stories we collected just for you! Cuckolding ... With Her Boss Photo: WeHeartIt “I will tell you what to wear each day and if you need to buy clothes I will give you the money.” Generous. “I may ask you to take some clothes off during the day, such as now for example, I might suggest you go to the ladies room and take your bra off. And by the way, Chris, your wife is soaking wet between her legs.” His upward groping had reached their purpose and I had noticed Karen move her legs apart to provide him with access. He continued rubbing her. “Always wear stockings. Now go and take your bra off and meet us over there by the lift, we are going to my room and Chris can watch while I fuck you.” Karen leaned towards Jack and kissed him on his lips, her red lipstick leaving its mark. Not long after, Karen walked towards us from the ladies. Her leather jacket was gaping open to disclose her pert boobs to anyone looking. I was. Jack was. Another couple were who had joined us just as the lift arrived. Jack put his arm around Karen’s waist and pulled her jacket more open leaving her utterly and hopelessly exposed. The couple with us in the lift certainly noticed Karen’s naked boobs through the sheer silkiness of her blouse and her stiff nipples couldn’t be hidden. Out of the lift Jack removed Karen’s jacket and passed it to me and we attracted stares from maids and guests as we progressed down corridors. “But I felt so alive and so sexual,” Karen said later. “I loved being so vulnerable; I so wanted it badly.” READ THE FULL EROTIC STORY HERE: My Boss, Jack (Not To Mention My Wife) Older Couple Has Sexy Fun In The City Photo: WeHeartIt Margaret leaned into Gary and said something to him and then got up off the chair and headed down the bar past me and towards the bathroom still without making any suggestion that we knew each other. She returned a few minutes later and as she passed behind me I felt her reach over and slide her hand into the outside pocket of my jacket. She quickly removed her hand and walked back down the row of chairs to sit beside Gary again. As soon as she sat down Gary reached over to caress her leg again and was getting bolder by the minute. As I watched the two of them work themselves into a controlled lather, I reached into my jacket to see why Margaret had put her hand in there. I had trouble keeping my jaw from falling open when I discovered her soaking wet thong bunched up in my pocket. Obviously Margaret had gone to the bathroom to remove it so she could give it to me and let me know that Gary now had open access to her dripping snatch. READ THE FULL EROTIC STORY HERE: Older Couple Has Sexy Fun In The City My Wife And The Car Salesman Photo: WeHeartIt She is a receptionist in a doctor’s office, and they close down the office every day between 11:30 and 1:00. About once a week, he would pick her up in a small RUV when she got off for lunch and they would drive to a Wal Mart close to her office. He would park the van in a remote corner of the lot and they would close all the curtains in the van. They would then get completely naked and he would fuck my wife for about an hour in broad daylight, until she had to return to work. A few months before this, we had started a relationship in which she was free to have sex with anyone she wanted, and we were to be honest about it. She didn’t mind telling me about her adventures, even took a lot of joy in it. So we were both excited about her new “toy.” She said he had a very nice package, and his cock was so big that she liked to suck it before they had sex, to get it lubed up with her saliva so it was easier to get it in her pussy, even though her pussy gets pretty wet on its own. After she had been fucking him for a few weeks, she told him about our relationship, and that I knew she was doing him and I didn’t mind. So, on a few of their “excursions” she would ring me up on her cell and lay the phone in the floor of the van while they fucked. Needless to say, this was very hot for me, sitting at work and listening to all the stuff they were saying, and her moans and whimpering. One of these times, I actually came in my pants when I could tell she was having an orgasm. I had to hurry to the men’s room and wipe the cum out of my shorts quickly before it leaked through to my pants. Another time, he picked up the phone and told me, “You must be crazy, mister, but I’ll tell you, your wife has got some great pussy, and she can fuck like a Trojan.” I thanked him and told him I was glad he enjoyed her. I told him to work her over real good, and he said that it was she who was working him over. READ THE FULL EROTIC STORY HERE: My Wife And The Car Salesman  My Cuckoldress Wife Fantasy Photo: WeHeartIt Then it rang, I answered it as fast as I could. “I hope you can hear me?” she said. I replied “yes.” Then I seen her next to the sliding door. She was standing naked in just her shoes and holding her phone in her hand by her side. A man walked towards her and I seen her kneel down in front of him and I could see her whole back and her head bobbing back and forth, then up and down on his cock. I heard the noises of her gagging and slurping on his cock through the phone. Then a text came in, it was a photo of her from the side of what I was watching. As I looked back up, I seen another man walk up to her. She had one hand on one guy’s cock and began sucking the other guy’s cock. She stood up and they all walked off into the room. I could no longer see them, but I could hear as the men were telling her to suck harder and faster. The man’s voice said “get on the bed, SLUT!” her reply was, “fill me with black cocks so my husband can hear me scream.” It wasn’t long and she was screaming. She was yelling out “fuck me” over and over. I glanced at the family downstairs, seeing them all getting their coats on and then coming out and leaving in a minivan. I rolled my car window down and I could hear her screaming outside. I now knew why they were leaving; they weren’t being discreet at all. Then the male voice told her to “get up and go out on the balcony.” I watched her walk out naked onto the balcony so the world could see. He bent her over the railing and was fucking her from behind, she stared right at me as she moaned loudly into the wide open parking lot. Her tits were swinging back and forth over the outside of the balcony in the rhythm that her pussy was being pounded. The other guy made his way out and sat down in a chair and watched. His cock was hard and available for anyone to see also. Then she was directed towards the sitting guy. She began sucking the man sitting down while being fucked from behind. I watched him stop for a second and then thrust into her hard. She began stroking and sucking the other guy until I seen her gag and some cum drip out from her mouth. The guy pulled out of her pussy and slapped her ass as the cum dripped from between her legs and off of his cock. He yelled out “Thanks Bitch.” The other guy pointed towards the ground and she immediately got down on all fours and licked the balcony floor. I’m assuming to clean up what she didn’t swallow.

Peter grabs her hips, thrusting in deeply, pumping his young hard cock into her, fucking her hard, deep and fast. Susan reaches down and touches her clit as she feels her own orgasm building, rubbing it hard as he fucks her hard. He pulls her nightie off and grabs her soft tits, squeezing them as Susan rides him harder. She lets herself go, feeling her juices squirting out over his cock, wetting his bed just as he spurts his cum deep into her. Susan creeps back to our room, sliding slowly into our bed, trying not to wake me, not even having put her nightie back on. She rolls over, putting her back to me and snuggles against me. I have been laying there thinking about what she has been doing, my cock very hard and I slip straight into her as she presses against me. I grab her hips and pump my hard cock into her, fucking her hard and deep, sliding into her cum filled hole. “Mmmmm, your cunt is soo wet, honey! You feel so good!” I whisper into her ear as I fuck her deep. “I’m not going to last long, you feel so hot and wet!” “That’s ok Adrian, I don’t mind. You just enjoy it; I know I have!” READ THE FULL EROTIC STORY HERE: Young Visitor Wife Excited About Date With Two Guys Photo: WeHeartIt We all turned to watch the show as we sat on the dark patio in the cool evening air with crickets chirping peacefully all around us, watching a veritable sex show in my warmly lit living room. We were gazing through the sliding glass door, invisible to the occupants within. Sure enough, the other fellow, Jeffrey, was pushing his fingers in and out of my wife’s pussy and we could tell it was exciting her because we saw her increase her pace as she jerked on Roger’s prick. “Isn’t this making you jealous, Sam?” asked Ed. “I don’t know, Ed,” I admitted as my cock grew stiff at the sight of my wife making out with one guy, jerking him off while getting fingered by another. “I mean yes, and no. On the one hand, we’ve been together too long for me to even consider breaking it off. And I’m sure Anne would never leave me for some arrogant young prick she just met. But on the other hand, it feels weird watching her do these intimate things with other men. She had reserved her intimacy for me alone all these years and it feels crazy to watch her getting naked and having her genitals violated. But somehow, you know the earth doesn’t explode or anything. She’s breaking the rules and really it doesn’t matter.” READ THE FULL EROTIC STORY HERE: Wife Excited About Date With Two Guys Wife Spanked In Front Of Husband Photo: WeHeartIt “Yeah, uh, sorry about this Bob,” said Jim with chagrin. “But she was really questioning my manhood there.” He kept rubbing the soft, tender skin of Susie’s inner thighs as he talked. Then he moved his hand up and stroked her outer labia for a moment. He could feel moisture there, so he thrust an exploratory tip of his finger between her vaginal lips. Susie’s vagina was slick and wet inside and Jim’s probing elicited a moan of pleasure from her. Bob gripped his throbbing, stiff erection unconsciously as he watched. “Hey! Am I supposed to just sit here watching while you prove to my wife what a real man you are?” he asked helplessly. “I don’t know what you should do,” admitted Jim as he started working a finger in and out of Susie’s hot, tight, vagina. Meanwhile, Susie reached up and gripped the bulge in Jim’s pants. “My god, you are hard as a rock,” she moaned breathily.

It wasnt a traditional State of the City address, she told the council before the presentation. Instead, she created a Powerpoint presentation displaying photographs of commercial, residential and municipal developments throughout the city. Literally showing you, not just telling you, how Seminole has been booming since 2014, Waters said. The biggest project in the city is the redevelopment of Seminole Mall into Seminole City Center, an outdoor retail hub. In the past year, numerous businesses have opened up in the development, from the new Bealls to Earth Fare. The new Studio Movie Grill, an upscale movie theater, is currently under construction, and theres something new happening at the center every day. Another major redevelopment over the past two years has been the Bay Pines development which includes a Walmart  one of the largest in the state, Waters said  a Village Inn, a small strip of retail stores and two residential projects, one a gated community of townhomes, the other luxury apartments. There are other retail developments the city has enjoyed over the past three years. Waters added. This includes the opening of two Starbucks  bringing the total to three in the city  as well as the All Care Medical Facility, Wawa gas station and Culvers on Park Boulevard. The Twin Oaks Plaza on the corner of Seminole Avenue and Park Boulevard has been redeveloped. Its currently home to Lifestyle Family Fitness and DaVita, a kidney care company. The former Roadhouse Grill location in the plaza is being redeveloped into a Sea Hags Bar and Grill. As far as municipal projects, the city built a new community center at Seminole City Park, which also includes space for a Seminole Historical Society Museum, and is nearing completion of Fire Station 32. A ribbon cutting will be held in early March, Waters said. We are booming, she said. We have home developments going up and shops and restaurants and were very pleased with that. She added that Seminole is more than bricks and mortar. At its heart is a hard-working and passionate of generous hearts and souls that contribute to our city in different ways. She listed numerous civic organizations, as well as the Seminole Chamber of Commerce, churches, Interfaith Food Pantry and other groups. In action items at the meeting, the council unanimously approved the establishment of a temporary moratorium on the sale of medical marijuana and on zoning approval for the location of medical cannabis dispensing companies within the city. The moratorium will expire July 3 of this year unless extended by the council. The council also gave initial approval to the redevelopment of property at 8680 Park Blvd. The building, which was built in 1977, previously housed a number of businesses, including a spa and series of nightclubs. Most recently, it was used as the former Manhattan Hairstyling Academy. Developers plan to redevelop the site as a NASCAR car wash. A second public hearing will be held at a future council meeting. Councilor Roger Edelman expressed concerns about how the project will affect traffic in the area but said he hopes those issues have been addressed by the developers. The council also provided initial approval to the development of a vacant lot at 9075 82nd Ave. The residential development will be comprised of 24 single-family homes on 4.88 acres on the north side of 82nd Avenue and west of Starkey Road. The council also authorized City Manager Ann Toney-Deal to enter into an agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for a Florida Recreational Development Assistance Program grant. The $100,000, which will be matched by a grant from the city, will be used for the Phase I development of Waterfront Park, which is located on Park Boulevard next to Home Depot.

Among the high-profile business gurus who will join Schwarzman and Trump at the White House are JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon, Mary Barra, who runs General Motors, Elon Musk of Space X and Tesla, Bob Iger of Walt Disney Co., Doug McMillon of Walmart, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, Ginni Rometty of IBM and Larry Fink of BlackRock. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was supposed to be the 16th member of the advisory team. But he dropped out of the meeting ahead of an #UberRidesWithHate protest organized by a taxi drivers group. Steve Schwarzman, a member of Trump's business advisory panel, will join the President at a meeting with 15 CEOs to discuss job creation Friday. (Todd Korol/AP) Protesters were upset by Kalanick’s ties to Trump. And they criticized Uber for undermining a cabbie work stoppage at Kennedy Airport over the President’s temporary ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. N.Y. plant workers hope Trump honors promise to create jobs Schwarzman, co-founder, chairman and CEO of massive hedge fund group Blackstone, is chairing the conference. JPMorgan Chase honcho Jamie Dimon will be among the bigwigs at Friday's meeting in the White House. (MOLLY RILEY/AFP/Getty Images) The event Friday is closed to the press, the White House said. Trump and Schwarzman called the meeting to begin discussions on how to stimulate the economy and create more jobs, the White House said.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment.

Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend. He said he and others on the council "will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy." __ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington, Bernard Condon in New York and Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.

Uber chief quits Trump business council amid boycott calls World by Julie Bykowicz, The Associated Press Posted Feb 2, 2017 8:54 pm MST Last Updated Feb 2, 2017 at 9:40 pm MST FILE - In this Dec. 13, 2016, file photo, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, poses during the launch of its bike-sharing product, uberMOTO, in Hyderabad, India. Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Feb. 2, 2017, to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." (AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A., File) WASHINGTON – Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump’s council of business leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Kalanick wrote to his employees that he’d spoken with Trump on Thursday to “let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.” His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won’t attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO’s schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is “designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner,” according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country’s refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. “This is not a ‘seat at the table’ moment. This is a flip-the-table moment,” said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign “Grab Your Wallet.” Other forum members said they’d keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. “He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity,” said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he’d attend. He said he and others on the council “will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy.” __ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington, Bernard Condon in New York and Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.

Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News One Adventist Health is among the new branding statements emphasizing all 20 hospitals are under one umbrella. New hospital should be ready this summer; employees excited BY JILL BARNES NELSON jbnelson@tehachapinews.com jbnelson Feb 2, 2017 Updated 4 hrs ago Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News Zoila Schrader, left, and Ashley Neudauer, hospital employees and ambassadors for the new branding campaign, can't wait for the new hospital to open. Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News One Adventist Health is among the new branding statements emphasizing all 20 hospitals are under one umbrella. Local residents can hardly wait for the new hospital in Tehachapi to open. They have been waiting a long time — close to two decades. The waiting could be over by early summer. “All the construction should be completed by March and we'll be handed the keys,” said Jimmy Phillips, executive director of marketing/communications for Adventist Health. “After that, we'll start stocking the building.” Phillips spoke about the new hospital facility at the unveiling of new branding for Adventist Health. The new name locally is Adventist Health Tehachapi Valley. It is also the newest partner for the company, which operates 20 hospitals in four states. David Eastman, interim president of AHTV, said building a hospital isn't like building a Walmart. “A commercial building doesn't have as many requirements as a hospital does,” he said. “But we've made good progress because of the dedication of our employees and the community.” Phillips said once construction is complete, staff at the current hospital will begin training. However, the new location can't open until all regulatory permits are approved. “Everyone is so excited,” he said. “We'll also have a grand, Grand Opening and tours before the official opening.” Ashley Neudauer and Zoila Schrader, current employees of the district and now Brand Ambassadors, both said they can't wait for the doors to open. “With all the new equipment and more resources, we can bring a better level of care to our patients,” said Neudauer, a registered nurse at the hospital. “By doing this rebranding, we're bringing everyone together. It's a good fit for the community. We're all so excited.” Schrader said the new facilities and ties with the other hospitals bring the future to Tehachapi. “This partnership and hospital is not just for today, but it's a stepping stone to the future,” said Schrader, who works in the long-term/swing bed department. “We will be giving all these people a better quality of life.” Both said there is a positive energy surrounding the Adventist Health mission statement that includes “health, wholeness and hope,” along with caring for the spiritual well-being of patients as well as their physical needs. “Being innovative and faith-based is important to a lot of people,” Schrader said. “It allows us to also use prayer to comfort our patients.” Neudauer agreed. “It's good to be able to provide spiritual care and be comfortable doing it,” she said.

That's just one of the goals of Adventist Health's new branding. jbnelson Follow jbnelson Close Get email notifications on jbnelson daily! Your notification has been saved.

His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump -- specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration -- has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend. He said he and others on the council "will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy."

Among the high-profile business gurus who will join Schwarzman and Trump at the White House are JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon, Mary Barra, who runs General Motors, Elon Musk of Space X and Tesla, Bob Iger of Walt Disney Co., Doug McMillon of Walmart, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, Ginni Rometty of IBM and Larry Fink of BlackRock. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was supposed to be the 16th member of the advisory team. But he dropped out of the meeting ahead of an #UberRidesWithHate protest organized by a taxi drivers group. Steve Schwarzman, a member of Trump's business advisory panel, will join the President at a meeting with 15 CEOs to discuss job creation Friday. (Todd Korol/AP) Protesters were upset by Kalanick’s ties to Trump. And they criticized Uber for undermining a cabbie work stoppage at Kennedy Airport over the President’s temporary ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

The single is featured on her debut album, Crooked Lines, which drops on Feb. 17. Todd was a former street musician, and solo touring artist, who would make her living by driving through the night, then sleeping in her car in WalMart parking lots, to playing on a street corner with her guitar, hoping to make enough gas money, to get her to the next city. That "hustling" defines what Todd's new single is about.  Todd explains in an exclusive statement to AXS that "Hustle was filmed in Wilmington and Raleigh, NC and includes several street performers from both cities.  These performers are very interesting characters as some of them, specifically the saxophone player that we see, Glen McRae, are staples in the downtown Wilmington busking scene. The performers have their set spots that they go to on a daily basis to entertain locals and tourists as they drift through the shops and restaurants. She goes on further to state that the she and the production crew, "were also thrilled to feature local Raleigh legend, the No Hand King, Rodney Hines who is incredibly driven and currently holds the world record for popping a wheelie with no hands for a total of six hours without letting his front tire touch the ground.  Locals to the Raleigh area know of Rodney Hines as a man who never quits and often see him riding downtown, practicing for his next world record.  Check out "Hustle's" premiere video in this article! Special Appearances in "Hustle" by: No Hands King  Glen McRae  Poppa Soul  Carson Jewell Craig Thompson Willie Davis (3 Dimensional Fitness) For the production, Todd states that "we had found a contact number for our street saxophone player, Glen McRae one morning and were very excited to meet him downtown.  To our surprise, when we got downtown, there was a multitude of people performing every few blocks and all of them were willing to be in our video especially when we describe the purpose."

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule.

According to CNN, Donald Trump pinatas have flooded the Mexican markets and are selling like hot cakes. Papier mache dolls with his trademark shock of yellow hair and business suits have appeared alongside Batman and Disney princesses at stalls. The only problem is they sell out fast! "As soon as we get them, they're gone," said shop owner Genoveva de la Cruz, as she displayed the last Trump piñata left at her stall. Meanwhile, campaigns have been launched on social media, urging Mexicans to boycott McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO) and Walmart (WMT) after Trump signed an executive order for the construction of the wall. The hashtags #AdiosStarbucks and #AdiosProductosGringos quickly started trending. However, Starbucks defended itself, saying that its local division is a Mexico-owned franchise which provides jobs to around 7,000 Mexicans and features Mexican-grown coffees. Tensions between the two countries rose after Trump insisted that Mexico pay for the wall and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto cancelled a meeting with Trump over the standoff. The Trump's administration then floated the idea of charging a 20% import tax on goods coming from Mexico. And on the other hand, six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico. Taxing Mexican imports affects many U.S. companies that send parts south of the border to be assembled. Analysts say Peña Nieto has a few cards up his sleeve. For instance, Mexico could stop cooperating on issues like security and drug trafficking. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Uber chief quits Trump business council amid boycott calls by: JULIE BYKOWICZ, Associated Press Updated: Feb 2, 2017 - 8:07 PM Twtter WASHINGTON (AP) - Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump - specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration - has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend. He said he and others on the council "will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy." __ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington, Bernard Condon in New York and Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.

Associated Press Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017 | 6:11 p.m. WASHINGTON — Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi.

Tesla Inc. didn't immediately respond when asked whether CEO Elon Musk planned to remain on Trump's business and manufacturing councils. Earlier this week, Musk asked his Twitter followers to read the immigration order and send him specific amendments he could present to the president. Musk has said that the refugee order "is not the best way to address the country's challenges." 0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

By Mark B. Solomon Comment Amazon.com Inc. said late today that its fourth-quarter global shipping costs soared to $5.6 billion, as the Seattle-based e-tailing giant grappled with increases in fulfillment demand brought on by another peak-season quarter of double-digit sales growth. At the same time, fourth-quarter global shipping revenue came in at slightly more than $3 billion, continuing Seattle-based Amazon's multi-year pattern of shipping costs exceeding revenue. For the year, Amazon spent about $16 billion on shipping services and took in about $9 billion in revenue. Revenue in the quarter rose 22 percent year over year to $43.7 billion, which was about $1 billion below analysts' estimates. For the first quarter, Amazon expects revenue of between $33 and $35 billion. "Fulfillment by Amazon" (FBA), which offers fulfillment and delivery services to sellers of all types, delivered more than two billion units worldwide in 2016, while the number of FBA users grew by more than 70 percent, Amazon said. In what may be a new measure of FBA's traction, the service accounted for more than 55 percent of all units sold in the fourth quarter by third-party merchants on Amazon's site, the company said. Amazon has taken several steps in recent years to build out a transportation and logistics network to improve service to customers buying on its site, to gain better control of its supply chain costs, and to position itself as the logistics provider of choice to merchants that can use any number of transport and logistics vendors. The latest move came Tuesday when Amazon said it would break ground later this year on a $1.5 billion air hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky airport to support a fleet of up to 40 freighter aircraft making two-day deliveries to "Amazon Prime" members. Of the 40 planes to enter Amazon's fleet, 16 are in operation. The aircraft are operated under lease agreements with Wilmington, Ohio-based Air Transport Services Group Inc. and Purchase, N.Y.-based Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. Under Amazon Prime, Amazon charges $99 a year, or alternatively $10 a month, for unlimited two-day deliveries. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the brick-and-mortar retail titan that is looking to catch up with Amazon in the digital world, said it would begin offering free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items with no need for a membership fee. Its annual fee has been $49. Marc Lore, the new head of e-commerce for Wal-Mart.com, was quoted in reports as saying that free shipping, at least for two-day deliveries is here to stay. "In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes," Lore said. "It no longer makes sense to charge for it." #Logistics #Transportation #3PL/Outsourcing #Air About the Author Mark B.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment.

Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil.

She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend.

According to CNN, Donald Trump pinatas have flooded the Mexican markets and are selling like hot cakes. Papier mache dolls with his trademark shock of yellow hair and business suits have appeared alongside Batman and Disney princesses at stalls. The only problem is they sell out fast! "As soon as we get them, they're gone," said shop owner Genoveva de la Cruz, as she displayed the last Trump piñata left at her stall. Meanwhile, campaigns have been launched on social media, urging Mexicans to boycott McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO) and Walmart (WMT) after Trump signed an executive order for the construction of the wall. The hashtags #AdiosStarbucks and #AdiosProductosGringos quickly started trending. However, Starbucks defended itself, saying that its local division is a Mexico-owned franchise which provides jobs to around 7,000 Mexicans and features Mexican-grown coffees. Tensions between the two countries rose after Trump insisted that Mexico pay for the wall and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto cancelled a meeting with Trump over the standoff. The Trump's administration then floated the idea of charging a 20% import tax on goods coming from Mexico. And on the other hand, six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico. Taxing Mexican imports affects many U.S. companies that send parts south of the border to be assembled. Analysts say Peña Nieto has a few cards up his sleeve. For instance, Mexico could stop cooperating on issues like security and drug trafficking.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Feb. 2, 2017, to “let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.” (AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A., File) AA WASHINGTON (AP) — Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order on refugees. Kalanick subsequently condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the meeting on Friday, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. didn't immediately respond when asked whether CEO Elon Musk planned to remain on Trump's business and manufacturing councils. Earlier this week, Musk asked his Twitter followers to read the immigration order and send him specific amendments he could present to the president. Musk has said that the refugee order "is not the best way to address the country's challenges." __ Associated Press writers Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report. close News In Pictures Rattlesnake crawls out of toilet in snake-infested house Perp Patrol: Wanted gallery EXCLUSIVE: CBS6 Preview of Rivers Casino before it opens Happy Birthday!

John Bel Edwards names new chief of staff Posted on February 2, 2017 at 6:54 PM Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards during a meeting at The Times-Picayune | NOLA.com in New Orleans on Tuesday, January 10, 2017. (Photo by Chris Granger, Nola.com | The Times-Picayune) By The Associated Press Gov. John Bel Edwards' leadership team experiences a shake-up later this month, with the Democratic governor's chief of staff exiting after a year in the job and a former Jindal-era Cabinet official named to fill the position. Edwards announced Thursday (Feb. 2) that Ben Nevers, a close friend of the governor and a former state senator, is resigning as his top adviser and administrator at the end of February. Nevers is leaving shortly after a deficit-closing special legislative session. "Following my election as governor, I asked Ben to join this administration when he intended to retire to spend more time with this family. He accepted without hesitation and has done a tremendous job leading this team in our first year," the governor said in a statement. Taking over as Edwards' chief of staff will be Mark Cooper, the one-time homeland security secretary for Republican former Gov. Bobby Jindal who has worked in several emergency management roles. Cooper will start the position in the spring, with the exact date remaining to be settled. Edwards said Mark "brings a wealth of knowledge about our state to this role, and I know he'll be an invaluable asset to our state." "Mark's managerial experience will be useful as we continue to lead Louisiana to a path to prosperity." Until Cooper assumes the role, Edwards' top lawyer, Matthew Block, will work double-duty as the governor's interim chief of staff. Nevers, from Bogalusa, has been a friend of Edwards from when the two men were state lawmakers. He ran a pro-Edwards PAC during the 2015 governor's race when he was in the Senate. "Over the last year and during my time in the Legislature, I turned to Ben for guidance, support and prayers, and he has delivered on each," Edwards said. Cooper, a Bossier City native, resigned as head of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in July 2011, to take a job leading emergency-management efforts for Wal-Mart at its stores around the world. He's been based at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. headquarters in Arkansas for the nearly six years since then. Cooper was the GOHSEP director for more than three years, shepherding state response efforts through hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, the Gulf Coast oil spill in 2010, Mississippi River flooding in 2011 and several tornadoes in Louisiana. "I have always had a sincere interest in the well-being of the state and have called Louisiana home," Cooper said in the statement released by Edwards' office. "I look forward to this next opportunity and supporting the governor and his team." Before joining the Jindal administration at its start in 2008, Cooper had been deputy fire chief with the Los Angeles County fire department and worked in several other Los Angeles government roles. ___ About Us About NOLA.com About NOLA Media Group Community Rules Content Partners Advertise with us Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Connect with the Newsroom Blog for Us Careers Submit a Correction The Times-Picayune Subscribe TP electronic edition eNewsletters Breaking news text alerts Report a wet or missing paper Make a payment, manage your account RSS Times-Picayune Store Legal notices NOLA.com Sections News Sports Entertainment Opinions Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages New Orleans St. Bernard East Jefferson West Bank Northshore/St. Tammany Plaquemines River Parishes Baton Rouge Mobile Mobile Apps | Mobile FAQ More on NOLA.com Videos Weather Webcams/Live!

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F.

Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump — specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration — has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment.

Gov. John Bel Edwards' leadership team experiences a shake-up later this month, with the Democratic governor's chief of staff exiting after a year in the job and a former Jindal-era Cabinet official named to fill the position. Edwards announced Thursday that Ben Nevers, a close friend of the governor and a former state senator, is resigning as his top adviser and administrator at the end of February. Nevers is leaving shortly after a deficit-closing special legislative session. "Following my election as governor, I asked Ben to join this administration when he intended to retire to spend more time with this family. He accepted without hesitation and has done a tremendous job leading this team in our first year," the governor said in a statement. Taking over as Edwards' chief of staff will be Mark Cooper, the one-time homeland security secretary for Republican former Gov. Bobby Jindal who has worked in several emergency management roles. Cooper will start the position in the spring, with the exact date remaining to be settled. Edwards said Mark "brings a wealth of knowledge about our state to this role, and I know he'll be an invaluable asset to our state." "Mark's managerial experience will be useful as we continue to lead Louisiana to a path to prosperity." Until Cooper assumes the role, Edwards' top lawyer, Matthew Block, will work double-duty as the governor's interim chief of staff. Nevers, from Bogalusa, has been a friend of Edwards from when the two men were state lawmakers. He ran a pro-Edwards PAC during the 2015 governor's race when he was in the Senate. "Over the last year and during my time in the Legislature, I turned to Ben for guidance, support and prayers, and he has delivered on each," Edwards said. Cooper, a Bossier City native, resigned as head of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in July 2011, to take a job leading emergency-management efforts for Wal-Mart at its stores around the world. He's been based at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. headquarters in Arkansas for the nearly six years since then. Cooper was the GOHSEP director for more than three years, shepherding state response efforts through hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, the Gulf Coast oil spill in 2010, Mississippi River flooding in 2011 and several tornadoes in Louisiana. "I have always had a sincere interest in the well-being of the state and have called Louisiana home," Cooper said in the statement released by Edwards' office. "I look forward to this next opportunity and supporting the governor and his team." Before joining the Jindal administration at its start in 2008, Cooper had been deputy fire chief with the Los Angeles County fire department and worked in several other Los Angeles government roles.

(AP) — Gov. John Bel Edwards' leadership team experiences a shake-up later this month, with the Democratic governor's chief of staff exiting after a year in the job and a former Jindal-era Cabinet official named to fill the position. Edwards announced Thursday that Ben Nevers, a close friend of the governor and a former state senator, is resigning as his top adviser and administrator at the end of February. Nevers is leaving shortly after a deficit-closing special legislative session. "Following my election as governor, I asked Ben to join this administration when he intended to retire to spend more time with this family. He accepted without hesitation and has done a tremendous job leading this team in our first year," the governor said in a statement. Taking over as Edwards' chief of staff will be Mark Cooper, the one-time homeland security secretary for Republican former Gov. Bobby Jindal who has worked in several emergency management roles. Cooper will start the position in the spring, with the exact date remaining to be settled. Edwards said Mark "brings a wealth of knowledge about our state to this role, and I know he'll be an invaluable asset to our state." "Mark's managerial experience will be useful as we continue to lead Louisiana to a path to prosperity." Until Cooper assumes the role, Edwards' top lawyer, Matthew Block, will work double-duty as the governor's interim chief of staff. Nevers, from Bogalusa, has been a friend of Edwards from when the two men were state lawmakers. He ran a pro-Edwards PAC during the 2015 governor's race when he was in the Senate. "Over the last year and during my time in the Legislature, I turned to Ben for guidance, support and prayers, and he has delivered on each," Edwards said. Cooper, a Bossier City native, resigned as head of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in July 2011, to take a job leading emergency-management efforts for Wal-Mart at its stores around the world. He's been based at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. headquarters in Arkansas for the nearly six years since then. Cooper was the GOHSEP director for more than three years, shepherding state response efforts through hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, the Gulf Coast oil spill in 2010, Mississippi River flooding in 2011 and several tornadoes in Louisiana. "I have always had a sincere interest in the well-being of the state and have called Louisiana home," Cooper said in the statement released by Edwards' office. "I look forward to this next opportunity and supporting the governor and his team." Before joining the Jindal administration at its start in 2008, Cooper had been deputy fire chief with the Los Angeles County fire department and worked in several other Los Angeles government roles. ___ Follow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte Tags General News National Security Military And Defense Government And Politics Emergency Management State Governments Political Resignations Cabinets State Legislature Legislature Locations Louisiana United States North America Popular Missing Enterprise teens found safe Service dog killed; EPD seeking suspects No Toadlick in 2017 Falcons' star Julio Jones wears bracelet in memory of Dothan's Savoy Jones Troy could land one of top classes in school history Fridays a treat for Sweet Crumbs bakery owner Two teens reported missing in Enterprise located and safe The Thirsty Pig brings beer growler refills to Dothan Dothan Police: Sexting becoming a local epidemic More Wiregrass teens facing sex crime charges for not knowing the law Videos Featured Businesses Bondy's Ford Lincoln 3615 Ross Clark Cir, Dothan, AL 36303 334-792-5171 Vehicles Stokes Floor Covering 4064 Ross Clark Cir , Dothan, AL 36330 334-635-0874 KT's Tavern 168 S Foster St, Dothan, AL 36301 Bryant's Outdoor Equipment 2200 S Brannon Stand Rd, Dothan, AL 36305 334-794-4419 Miracle-Ear of Dothan - Southern Hearing 4440 W Main St, Ste 3, Dothan, AL 36305 334-377-4065 The Slice Pizza and More 1574 S Eufaula Ave, Eufaula, AL 36027 334-687-8007 Center for Vein Restoration 3280 Ross Clark Cir, Dothan, AL 36303 334-678-9494 US Mobile Homes of Alabama 5214 Montgomery Hwy, Dothan, AL 36303 334-983-5658 Jim Skinner Honda 3823 Ross Clark Cir, Dothan, AL 36303 334-671-8100 Ronnie’s Men’s and Boys’ Wear Inc 33 S Broad St, Ste 1, Cowarts, AL 36321 334-677-1530 The Dothan Eagle 227 N Oates St, Dothan, AL 36303 334-792-3141 Coupons Hearing Associates Of Dothan 1891 Honeysuckle Rd, Dothan, AL 36305 334-702-4327 Conestoga Steak House 3549 Montgomery Hwy, Dothan, AL 36303 334-794-4445 House of Flowers 1728 W Main St, Ste 2, Dothan, AL 36301 334-699-1800 Billy Lawrence Buick GMC 525 Kirkland St, Abbeville, AL 36310 334-585-3551 Alabama Eye Physicians & Surgeons 5937 W Main St, Dothan , AL 36305 334-446-0872 Beltone 2115 Denton Rd, Ste 2, Dothan, AL 36303 334-712-6778 Capps & Associates PC 170 S Oates St, Dothan, AL 36301 334-678-7994 McLeod's Publick House 5540 W Main St, Dothan, AL 36305 334-648-1912 Highland Oaks Golf Course 904 Royal Pkwy, Dothan, AL 36305 334-792-4235 Bama Rv 5386 Montgomery Hwy, Dothan, AL 36303 334-678-9510 Bondy's Nissan 3693 W Main St, Dothan, AL 36305 334-794-6736 All Metal Building Systems 409 S Broad St, Cowarts, AL 36321 800-440-1307 Derrel's Sewing and Vacuum Center 2507 Montgomery Highway, Dothan, AL 36303 334-794-0824 Miles of Flowers 4143 W Main St, Ste 5, Dothan, AL 36305 334-699-5773 Subscriber Services Dothan Eagle Subscriber Services e-Edition online Subscriber log-in Demo ePaper Print edition Subscribe for delivery Manage subscription Sections News Sports Lifestyles Obituaries Photos Weather Services Contact Us Subscription Rates Submission Forms Newspapers Enterprise Ledger Jackson Co.

She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co.

The claim lost some credibility over time with the rise of big box discounters and retail supercenters. Also, DeCA’s price-tracking methodology lost support in Congress and at the Pentagon amid a push to transform commissaries into more business-like operations, using commercial tools such as variable pricing and private-label brands to try to reduce DeCA’s $1.3 billion annual appropriation. DeCA officials now concede the 30-percent savings figure didn’t include price comparisons at Walmart Supercenters. Nor did it consider the popularity of private label goods that outside grocers find so profitable. Nor did DeCA adjust its own estimates to give greater weight to products in highest demand with lower savings. On Monday, in response to a congressional mandate, DeCA released new set of “baseline” estimates of commissary savings that reflect these factors and more. Without reducing the value of the shopping benefit, DeCA says, it has redefined how it measures savings. Global savings across all 238 commissaries, are calculated now at 23.7 percent and savings stateside at 20.2 percent. At 61 overseas commissaries, average savings are 44.2 percent against local food prices. To be able to shift to variable pricing, DeCA also is publishing average savings by seven U.S. commissary regions. The 36 commissaries operating on New England bases, for instance, provide average savings of 21.4 percent. Across 30 commissaries in the South Atlantic states, savings average 19.9 percent. The combined region of Alaska/Hawaii, with nine commissaries, offers the highest savings for patrons at 32.6 percent. Twenty commissaries in the Rocky Mountain region, which runs south from the Canadian border through Arizona and New Mexico, had the lowest savings of 17.6 percent compared to prices off base. The Pacific coastline states, with 31 commissaries, provide average savings of 20.9 percent while 18 military grocery stores in North Central states save shoppers an average of 20.2 percent. “This enhanced way of calculating savings doesn’t change the actual dollars that patrons save, but it will give patrons a better understanding of price comparisons in their local area,” said DeCA Director Joseph H. Jeu in a press released Monday unveiling revised savings estimates. A day later Jeu announced that, effective June 3, he will retire after six-and-a-half years at DeCA’s helm and more than 38 years’ total federal service. “The transformation is well on its way and the right people are in place to see it through,” said Jeu’s statement on Tuesday said. Military exchange executives, said industry sources, were surprised and upset by DeCA’s announcement on the new baseline savings. Exchange directors have argued for years that their own store traffic and sales performance are linked to the popularity of commissaries, and commissary sales are falling. Since last October, start of fiscal year 2017, DeCA sales are down 7.6 percent and by more than 10.5 percent in January compared to January last year. “It’s just really bleak,” said one representatives for manufacturers serving the military resale system. “If your sales are down, the last thing you want to do is send out a press release saying that people are saving 10 percent less than they thought they were. That’s just going to drive sales way down.” Some might challenge Jeu’s timing but he was on the clock. Congress first ordered DeCA to produce more realistic baseline savings, including across regions, in 2015. The due date to report was March 2016 so DeCA was 11 months late. Brooke Goldberg, director of family policy and spouse programs for Military Officers Association of America, said senior defense officials have given assurances if the revised savings rate “drops even 1 percent, DeCA will begin evaluating a corrective measure.” The hope is that a more granular approach to tracking savings will “be good for patrons as it provides a more definitive benchmark on a regional basis rather than national scale,” Goldberg said. Some advocates for military families fear that the mere perception of lower savings could put commissaries at greater risk, despite DeCA’s vow that it only has clarified current savings in order to preserve them through the changes ahead. “I do think it means less certainty for families moving forward,” said Eileen Huck, government relations deputy director for National Military Family Association. “Families have always been told they could expect a certain level of savings when shopping at the commissary, regardless of where they happened to be stationed. “Now the rules of the game have changed somewhat. Although DeCA has stated its commitment to preserving this new level of savings, there are many more factors in play” including variable pricing of products and introduction of DeCA-branded products later this year. So, said Huck, “it is fair for families to question what this will mean for the value of the commissary benefit in the long run.” For years, DeCA measured shopper savings by comparing a 26-week average of brand name prices, always set at cost, against average market prices across the country. It used Nielsen price data and filled in any gaps – for Alaska, Hawaii and overseas – with limited manual price comparisons in those locales. That method of calculating savings for 38,000 branded items at the national level has been replaced by a new method more suited to the transformation. “We are adding more geographic specificity, since cost of living varies by region,” said a DeCA official. “Adding a regional savings level will provide a better sense for how much our patrons save by shopping at their local commissary, compared to retailers in their particular region.” DeCA has also updated the products it uses for our price comparisons, emphasizing “the most common patron purchases” within sales categories like produce or meat. The new savings benchmark also takes into consideration patron purchases at local commercial grocers, as manually gathered in every region. Critics have raised concerns about how DeCA is relying more heavily now on “clipboard” pricing methods rather than Nielsen data to benchmark local savings across regions. But the greater worry is how patrons will react to the results. “It certainly has the potential to adversely affect patronage,” said Tom Gordy, president of the Armed Forces Marketing Council. “But what I think people have to fully understand is the prices have not changed. It’s just the way the savings are calculated has changed.” Another industry analyst was more skeptical, suggesting new baseline savings leave headroom for Defense officials or Congress to slash DeCA’s $1.3 budget while still claiming to preserve customer savings. He also pointed to a new Government Accountability Office report on DoD construction projects that showed DeCA surcharge dollars used to fund only one construction project in fiscal 2015. “Construction is the best manifestation of the health of the resale system,” he said. “This report indicates that the system might already be faltering.” To comment, write Military Update, P.O.

JimboFebruary 02, 2017 - 4:21 pm Every time I go on base looking to 'save' I leave empty handed and find better and less expensive all around, even at mom and pop shops. (I avoid Sprawlmart) And groceries, even Nugget in VV is cheaper on many items and they are a high end store.Reply | Report abusive comment Old truckFebruary 02, 2017 - 5:17 pm Back in the early 70's, it was a given that if you shopped at the commissary or exchange, you saved money. That was the only place the wife and I shopped. I don't know what happened to the system. Every time I go to the Travis Exchange, they're moving things around and remodeling. I price their big appliances and I can't imagine anyone buying a refrigerator or washer there. The commissary is a little better. The prices are ok but then you get nicked by a surcharge. I see a lot of inefficiency at the commissary. They have a self checkout with 6 stations, but usually 2 of them are not working. And this is overseen by 2 employees. The local Walmart has 8 stations at their self checkout and it's overseen by one employee. I'll bet if you polled military people, most of them will say they shop at Walmart. I think the commissary/exchange system has become one of those sacred cows, like the postal system. Something that is broke, but no one has the guts to fix it.Reply | Report abusive comment VetalsoFebruary 02, 2017 - 7:25 pm The Commissary store has become an example of what is wrong with most government undertakings. Overstaffed, with people who have tenure but no real experience in the industry. The produce department is terrible. The Exchange is worse, also overstaffed with people who don't know merchandising. Constant rearrangement and escalating prices. The clothing is slick, hip, cool, and very overpriced. The rest of the stuff is also overpriced or lacking in real quality. Both are benefits we earned which are now lost.

Tweets by @Newsday “RIP McHebes,” Twitter user @meaghann_carr wrote on Dec. 8, 2016, with the hashtag #bringthemallback and the names of several other area bars that have closed. “Will this be the year McHebes comes back” @MagicKitty_316 tweeted on Jan. 1. The bar’s memory was also celebrated in September during the first presidential debate at Hofstra after a man held up a “Bring Back McHebes” sign during a broadcast of “The O’Reilly Factor” on Fox News. When asked why the McHebes sign has sparked so much interest, Silva said he believes it’s a “rallying cry” for Long Island millennials. “It all comes back to how much that place meant to Long Islanders,” he wrote.

Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend. He said he and others on the council "will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy." __ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington, Bernard Condon in New York and Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump - specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration - has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend. He said he and others on the council "will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy." __ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington, Bernard Condon in New York and Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.
