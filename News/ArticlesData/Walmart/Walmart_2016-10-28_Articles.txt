BUTLER – After spending several years in the 1960’s and 1970’s perfecting the art of German wine-making, Ken Starr opened Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery in 2005. (Provided photo) Based in Curwensville, Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery now has stores located inside four Wal-Mart locations, making it one of the first wineries to be located inside the largest retailer in the United States. Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery approached Wal-Mart several years ago, and in 2012, they were approved by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to open a maximum of five retail stores. In addition to the Butler store, other Wal-Mart locations include Altoona, Clearfield and DuBois. “This is a great opportunity to showcase our wines in a huge marketplace and to a large number of new customers,” said Starr. “Thousands of people go through the Butler store each month, and I couldn’t be more excited to introduce our wines and give customers such a unique shopping experience.” Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery will be hosting a ribbon cutting event with the Butler County Chamber of Commerce at the new store inside the local Butler Wal-Mart on Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 4 p.m. About Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery In 1994, Starr purchased property in Curwensville and planted 12 vines. By 1998, there were more than 3,000 vines and in 2005, Starr decided to start making his wine commercially. Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery located on 13 acres in Clearfield County produces more than 40 varieties of delicious, award-winning wines. Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery is located at 861 Bailey Rd., in Curwensville and is sold at four Wal-Mart locations in Pennsylvania. Starr Hill Vineyard is a member of Butler County Tourism & Convention Bureau. For more information, visit StarrHillWinery.com or call 814-236-0910 or VisitButlerCounty.com.

The incident occurred at the West Kelowna Walmart store and the alleged suspects were caught walking away with the wheelchair by the store's security cameras. The camera video shows shows the first suspect male entering the east entrance of the Walmart in a wheelchair. The male suspect leaves his wheelchair at the east entrance and climbs onto a motorized shopping cart accompanied by a second male suspect. Sometime later both suspects are then observed at the west entrance/exit of the store when the second suspect retrieves the victims wheelchair, assists the first suspect into the victims wheelchair and then pushes the first suspect out of the store's east exit. "In reviewing the video surveillance footage, it appears as though the suspect knowingly left the store in someone else's mobility aid device, while leaving his own behind," said Cpl. Jesse O'Donaghey in a press release. "Of course, there is a possibility that the suspect was confused and mistook the victim's mobility aid device for his own." The investigation is ongoing and police are interested in speaking with the unknown woman, seen wearing the black and white checkered sweater, who awaited the use of the motorized shopping cart left behind by the suspects. Suspect 1 is described as: •    Male, possibly First Nations; •    long dark brown or black hair; •    wearing a plaid jacket, black toque, blue jeans and brown footwear; Suspect 2 is described as: •    Male, possibly First Nations; •    long dark brown or black hair; •    full goatee; •    wearing a tan/beige coloured coat with a hood, a black shirt, light blue jeans and white shoes; Anyone with any information is asked to contact the West Kelowna RCMP at 250-768-2880.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 29, 2016 at 1:34PM Any politician praising any company (and its founder) other than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) would quickly be filed away as a non-story. But because it's Hillary Clinton heaping praise on this company, it's become big news. Hillary Clinton's words may come back to haunt her. Her campaign flagged her speeches lauding Wal-Mart and its founder, Sam Walton, as controversial. Image source: Flickr user Aaron Vowels. Do as I say, not as I do Following one of WikiLeaks' data dumps lifted from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, an 80-page document from her own campaign emerged, flagging comments Clinton made praising Wal-Mart in speeches the public did not previously know about. The campaign thought it might look bad if those speeches became public. The four-page section that caught their eye and caused consternation dealt with the high regard she had for the company and the esteem she held for its founder, Sam Walton. Because Clinton was both a director and a shareholder in the retailer for six years, her relationship with the country's largest employer has always been fraught with controversy. As a separate WikiLeaks email has since highlighted, Clinton has discussed the need for public and private positions in politics, suggesting why her comments about the retailer might not sit well with potential supporters. Here are the five most important things about Clinton's relationship with Wal-Mart. 1. She was the first woman director at the retailer. Clinton detailed how she came to serve on Wal-Mart's board in the 1980s during a speech to research and investment firm Sanford Bernstein. She warmly recounted how she and Walton had previously worked together on education reform and that Walton approached her, saying, ""[M]y wife and daughter think we need a woman on the board and we can't think of anybody else besides you. I said, well, you have a way with words, Sam. That's really flattering. But, sure, I'll be on the board of Walmart."  She also served on Wal-Mart's board between 1986 and 1992, which was also a period of tremendous growth for the retailer. WMT data by YCharts. 2. She called Sam Walton a "great patriot." In remarks to Sanford Bernstein in May 2013, Clinton extolled Walton's virtues, saying, "Sam Walton was a cheerleader for Wal-Mart but also a great patriot, because he knew that he was able to build this company in this country, and it might not, if ever, have been possible anywhere else." But for some people, Walton's ethics were lacking: he kept wages low; offered few benefits; and was one of the first retailers to heavily import cheap goods from Asia. It could be argued that as Clinton served on the board of directors she supported these initiatives, or at least didn't actively oppose them. For example, activist Ralph Nadar's push for her to support increased wages for women did not elicit a response from the former Senator. 3. She praised Walton for embracing technology early. While many think of Wal-Mart as a stodgy retailer, it's actually a forward-thinking, technologically savvy company that was one of the first large companies to invest heavily in systems we take for granted today. The company was an early adopter of RFID tag technology, universal barcodes as a labeling system, and electronic data interchange -- the transfer of documents electronically -- between the company and its suppliers instead of using paper or fax. In a speech at London Drug Toronto, Clinton said, "They were always thinking about what came next. Yes, they may have started out in small towns and rural areas like Arkansas, but they were always improving their technology." Although many progressives love to hate Wal-Mart, Hillary Clinton considered Sam Walton a visionary and a man who brought positive change to America. Image source: Flickr user Janice Waltzer. But many worry about how those technology advances displace workers. For example, Wal-Mart began experimenting this summer with drones to replace quality control employees while also applying for patents for self-driving shopping carts that can collect themselves, do inventory management, and more. There are 7,000 back-office jobs the retailer announced it also wants to eliminate in favor of "cash recycling" machines and the like. 4. She supported Wal-Mart's burgeoning environmental consciousness. Wal-Mart wields tremendous influence today in the area of sustainability. It diverts from landfills more than 81% of the materials that flow through its stores, clubs, and distribution centers, while the figure runs as high as 90% in Japan and the U.K. It has reduced plastic bag usage by 10 billion bags annually (though mandating paying for plastic bags, as the U.K. did, will have that effect), offers an electronics recycling program, and assists suppliers with sourcing goods responsibly. Clinton credits her efforts at pushing Wal-Mart to consider the environment as a corporate imperative, telling a gathering at the International Leaders Series in Montreal in 2014 that "I think people are starting to get concerned about the environment. And I think we should do a better job in this company in trying to figure out how to have more energy efficient stores, how to deliver goods more efficiently with less use of fossil fuels as possible, and so I chaired the first little environment subcommittee." 5. She praised Wal-Mart for providing jobs, low-cost goods, and expanding the availability of food. To that same London Drug Toronto group, she said people can complain all they want about Wal-Mart, but it's been a good and valuable service for the community. "Those stores -- you know, you don't have to agree with everything Wal-Mart does, I don't -- but those stores served a real purpose, not only for employment and low cost goods, but they did become a way for people who wanted to see what else was available to them could go and look, products that never were readily available in a lot of those places before." Image source: Flickr user Portal Abras. Her base might disagree on the retailer's ability to support community, believing instead that it disrupts it. According the The Intercept, the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates "Wal-Mart-based trade deficit with China alone eliminated or displaced over 400,000 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013." The ties that bind Clinton continues to have close ties with Wal-Mart and the Walton family, and late last year, billionaire heiress Alice Walton contributed more than $353,000 to one of her campaign funds. Her tenure on the board showed her exercising her fiduciary responsibility to Wal-Mart's shareholders, not by being a "change agent," which is not necessarily a role for a director, but by prodding and accommodating the management of a major corporate citizen just emerging on the global stage. That might rankle the voters she is trying to court, but she's not necessarily wrong about the benefits Wal-Mart has bestowed.  Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

In order to get shoppers prepared, they have been releasing a variety of toy lists, toy books, and holiday shopping catalogs. While those catalogs give Americans an idea of what they can expect for this year’s holiday shopping season, everyone really wants to see this year’s Black Friday ads. A few minor retailers have already released their 2016 Black Friday ad scans, but the excitement has been lukewarm. The good news is that Black Friday is on November 25 this year, which is two days earlier than last year, so everything is going to be pushed forward by a few days. While nothing is official, Best Black Friday has predicted the key dates for when you can expect ads to leak from Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Kohl’s, Amazon, and numerous other popular retailers. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Walmart Predicted Ad Leak Date — November 10, 2016 Easily the most popular store on Black Friday, Walmart’s ad release is an event in itself. Walmart had actually kept their ad from leaking in recent years, but a third-party source posted it early on November 11 of last year. Walmart’s security should be a bit better this year, but it should still come out a day earlier on November 10. If you do not already have it, consider downloading Walmart’s shopping app. Like other retailers, they may offer an early sneak peak of their Black Friday deals for app users. As Reuters reports, Walmart is sticking to their minimum order size of $50 in order to qualify for free shipping this holiday season. Wal-Mart focuses on online order pickup in stores, lower prices https://t.co/IYuK4Mqwte — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) October 27, 2016 Target Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 8, 2016 While Target is not quite as popular as Walmart, their Black Friday sale is actually one of the best. Per a report from WalletHub last year, Target offered an average discount of 37.3 percent on Black Friday last year, which was a higher percentage than Walmart, Best Buy, and Amazon. Last year’s ad leaked on November 8. In 2014, their ad leaked on November 10. Even though Black Friday is two days earlier this year, Target is likely to stick with the November 8 date. Best Buy Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 9, 2016 Never one for patience, Best Buy’s ad always seems to come out a day before Walmart’s. While this is most likely planned by Walmart, Best Buy could hold out a few days longer in order for Walmart to show their hand first. That is unlikely to happen for 2016, and Best Buy’s ad should leak around November 9. Last year’s ad leaked on November 9, and the 2014 version leaked on November 10. Kohl’s Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 7, 2016 Historically a surprise store on Black Friday, Kohl’s has established itself as a major retailer over the past few years. Their selection of electronics rivals what Walmart and Target offer, and their opportunity to earn “Kohl’s Cash” allows for even bigger net discounts. Out of the major retailers, Kohl’s ad usually comes out first. Their 2015 ad leaked on November 6, which is a Sunday this year. Since major ads usually do not leak on a Sunday, expect their 2016 ad to come out on Monday, November 7. Amazon Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 16, 2016 While Walmart waits until Best Buy releases their ad, Amazon waits until every other store shows their cards. They actually do not release an official Black Friday ad scan, but they do have an annual press release to introduce some of their top items and doorbusters. After this press release comes out, pre-Black Friday deals usually start on their website, and it happens about a week before Thanksgiving. While there are always some solid offers in their early sales, it is in your best interest to wait until Thanksgiving for the real doorbusters. .@Target holiday toy book is available at stores.

Although many progressives love to hate Wal-Mart, Hillary Clinton considered Sam Walton a visionary and a man who brought positive change to America. Image source: Flickr user Janice Waltzer. But many worry about how those technology advances displace workers. For example, Wal-Mart began experimenting this summer with drones to replace quality control employees while also applying for patents for self-driving shopping carts that can collect themselves, do inventory management, and more. There are 7,000 back-office jobs the retailer announced it also wants to eliminate in favor of "cash recycling" machines and the like. 4. She supported Wal-Mart's burgeoning environmental consciousness. Wal-Mart wields tremendous influence today in the area of sustainability. It diverts from landfills more than 81% of the materials that flow through its stores, clubs, and distribution centers, while the figure runs as high as 90% in Japan and the U.K. It has reduced plastic bag usage by 10 billion bags annually (though mandating paying for plastic bags, as the U.K. did, will have that effect), offers an electronics recycling program, and assists suppliers with sourcing goods responsibly. Clinton credits her efforts at pushing Wal-Mart to consider the environment as a corporate imperative, telling a gathering at the International Leaders Series in Montreal in 2014 that "I think people are starting to get concerned about the environment. And I think we should do a better job in this company in trying to figure out how to have more energy efficient stores, how to deliver goods more efficiently with less use of fossil fuels as possible, and so I chaired the first little environment subcommittee." 5. She praised Wal-Mart for providing jobs, low-cost goods, and expanding the availability of food. To that same London Drug Toronto group, she said people can complain all they want about Wal-Mart, but it's been a good and valuable service for the community. "Those stores -- you know, you don't have to agree with everything Wal-Mart does, I don't -- but those stores served a real purpose, not only for employment and low cost goods, but they did become a way for people who wanted to see what else was available to them could go and look, products that never were readily available in a lot of those places before." Image source: Flickr user Portal Abras. Her base might disagree on the retailer's ability to support community, believing instead that it disrupts it. According the The Intercept, the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates "Wal-Mart-based trade deficit with China alone eliminated or displaced over 400,000 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013." The ties that bind Clinton continues to have close ties with Wal-Mart and the Walton family, and late last year, billionaire heiress Alice Walton contributed more than $353,000 to one of her campaign funds. Her tenure on the board showed her exercising her fiduciary responsibility to Wal-Mart's shareholders, not by being a "change agent," which is not necessarily a role for a director, but by prodding and accommodating the management of a major corporate citizen just emerging on the global stage. That might rankle the voters she is trying to court, but she's not necessarily wrong about the benefits Wal-Mart has bestowed.  Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Why an undamaged mummy uncovered in Luxor will stay in Egypt Why some Jewish groups won't denounce Steve Bannon appointment Walmart is aiming to be the best on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the rest of the holidays this year.  By Rebecca Lehmann, Brad's Deals October 29, 2016 Save for later Saved Walmart workers organise products for Christmas season at a Walmart store in Teterboro, New Jersey Eduardo Munoz/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Black Friday favorite Walmart outlined some of its holiday plans this morning, and one thing is clear – they're playing to win. “I can’t remember another year when I’ve been this excited about the merchandise we are offering customers,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. “It’s not just about one category or one item. Our whole store is going to be stocked with new, exciting items from hot toys to new electronics available at the best prices. We will win the season on price, from the first weekend in November to Black Friday and Cyber Monday and through those final weeks in December.” This "win the season" talk should surprise no one since Walmart has used almost exactly that same phrasing for the last few years. They're also probably the only retailer that can credibly make such an audacious claim. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. That's not to say that other major players like Target and Best Buy won't be competitive, but let's face it – just about everyone is following Walmart's lead. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 So what are their plans exactly? Digging into  this morning's announcement, we found it light on actual details. Here's what we know: You can get a 32-inch Roku HDTV for $125 throughout November and December. That also happens to be its Black Friday price from last year. We're going to speculate it might be marked down even further for Black Friday 2016. They cited "thousands of new rollbacks" but didn't call out anything specific other than the Roku TV. Walmart is expanding in-store pickup to include more items. They'll also have staff dedicated to managing in-store pickup throughout the holiday season. They're hiring Holiday Helpers – employees in yellow vests and elf hats – who can do things like point you to the shortest line or run and grab something you forgot while you stay in line. They might also give you a candy cane. They also called out a Walmart-exclusive  24V Disney Princess Carriage Ride-On, but with a price tag of $398 it's hard to call it a deal unless it gets the Black Friday rollback treatment. And that's about it. There's a cheap TV, vague pronouncements about more rollbacks, you'll have better luck with in-store pickup, and an elf might give you a candy cane. We expect to see more details from Walmart in November, and we expect to see the  Walmart Black Friday ad closer to November 10-11.

Russell Makowski was with 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division out of Fort Hood, Texas.  He was killed in Taji, Iraq, on Sept. 14, 2006, by an improvised explosive device while on patrol. He was 23. Pam Makowski spent time on Sunday at the grave with her husband, Mark Makowski, and her other son, Matt Makowski. The family tries to come visit the grave as a group several times a year. Photo By David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com ”And all around me, a voice was sounding This land was made for you and me.” — Woody Guthrie Mark Makowski was raised in Florissant. He graduated from North County Tech in 1976 and quickly got a job as an auto mechanic. Friends introduced him to Pam Williams, also a Florissant native. They were married in 1979. They bought a home in St. Charles County. Their first child, Russell, was born in 1983. Their second child, Matt, was born in 1990. By that time, Makowski was working on the assembly line at the Chrysler plant in Fenton, a job he had gotten through a brother-in-law. In 1999, the family moved to Union. Russell went to Union High School. He did fine, but he wasn’t really interested in academics. He took technical classes. He was most interested in carpentry. He graduated in 2002 and got a job at a Walmart. Pam was also working there. So the family represented the two sides of blue-collar America — the United Automobile Workers and Walmart. Russell left Walmart to take a job with an aviation company in St. Louis County. He was hoping to use his carpentry skills to refurbish the interiors of private jets, but that never materialized. He mostly did cleanup work. +1  Russell Makowski He joined the Army in November 2004, and left for basic training the day before Thanksgiving. He did his basic training at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, the only active Army installation built on the Southern Plains during the Indian wars. He then did artillery training at Fort Sill. In December 2005, he was sent to Iraq. He came home for a two-week leave in August and went back to Iraq. He was killed on Sept. 14, 2006, when an improvised bomb went off while he was on foot patrol in Taji just north of Baghdad. Back in Union, the doorbell rang and the world changed. But the world did not, does not, stop. In 2009, the Chrysler plant shut down. Mark Makowski was 52. That is a tough age to be looking for work. Also, in a time when unions are under attack, there might have been some animosity toward UAW workers. They had it too good, some employers might have thought. And they did have it pretty good. One of the nice things was this — if you were over 50, you could take retirement. Mark did. About a year later, Pam quit her job at Walmart. They were both too young for Social Security, and the UAW retirement wasn’t a whole lot, but their expenses were low. So, according to Makowski, it was the desire to do something rather than a desperate need for money that led him to look for work. He found a part-time job in 2010 as custodian at Union High School, the school from which both his sons had graduated. He became a full-time worker in 2013. He worked from 3 in the afternoon until about 11:30. His area of responsibility included four classrooms, a greenhouse, the library, a hallway and two bathrooms. He was fired last month. In a legal sense, the reason for the firing seems clear. Makowski took a week off beginning Sept. 12. School district policy requires an employee to obtain permission before taking time off. An employee is required to make the request at least two days prior to the proposed time off. Makowski made his request in time — the Wednesday before the Monday of the week he was taking off — but he did not hear back. In other words, he did not get approval. He told me didn’t always get approval in the past. He described a situation in which no denial meant tacit approval. It all seemed rather odd. Would an employer fire a good employee over something that sounded like a misunderstanding? Makowski showed me the letter of termination he received Sept. 22. It cites several board policies. Most had to do with vacations and prior approval. But there was also mention of maintaining courteous relationships with other employees and transmitting constructive criticism to the appropriate administrator. I asked Makowski if he had an attitude problem. He said he asked a lot of questions, often to the district superintendent whose office is in the high school. Questions about working conditions and pay. For instance, sometimes a day that was supposed to be a holiday was turned into a school day because it was used to cancel out a snow day. As hourly rather than salaried workers, shouldn’t the custodians be entitled to double-time? After all, they were working on a paid day off. A good question, I’d say, but one that a union steward might ask. The custodians do not have a union. I called the district superintendent, Steve Weinhold. He said he couldn’t discuss specifics of personnel matters. “I can say that when people break policies people are sometimes removed of their duties whether they are teachers, custodians or superintendents.” Certainly. Truth is, though, Makowski does not regret what he did. He was going to take that week off no matter what. That Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of Russell’s death.

Rob Davis has some timely tips for trick or treaters. Then, he answers readers traffic questions in this week's Ask a Trooper column. He got a little help from Russ Henckel, Wyoming public works traffic engineer, about a tricky traffic situation near the Walmart store on 54th Street SW. Have a traffic question? Email Davis and the troopers at the Lakeview and Rockford posts at AskTpr@michigan.gov. Here's Lt. Rob Davis: We've had a number of serious car vs. pedestrian accidents in the Grand Rapids area in recent weeks. With Halloween fast approaching, I thought it a good chance to go over some basic safety tips and explain why we as parents we need to be especially vigilant. According to AAA, Halloween is the deadliest night of the year for pedestrians. On average, children are more than twice as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than any other day of the year! (Safe Kids Worldwide). Lt. Rob DavisMichigan State Police  For motorists who are out and about during the trick-or-treating hours, please slow down, watch for children darting between parked cars, yards and driveways, and exit driveways with extra caution. If you're driving your children between neighborhood and developments, make sure they exit on the non-street side and use available sidewalks. Below are some safety tips for our trick-or-treaters and their parents. For our older kids who have phones, don't text while walking, you may inadvertently walk in front of car. And always remember just because you see the car doesn't mean they see you! Trick-or-treat safety tips: • Children of any age should be accompanied by an adult. • Walk! Never run. • Use sidewalks when possible. • Cross the street only at corners or crosswalks and obey traffic signals. • Look left, right, and left again before crossing streets. • Do not cross the street between parked cars. • Carry a flashlight. • Wear light-colored or reflective-type clothing so you are more visible. • Accept treats at the door and never go into a stranger's house. • Stay in familiar neighborhoods. Plan your route and share it with your family. • Stay in a group. • Only visit homes that have the porch light on. • Stay in populated and well-lit areas. Do not cut through back alleys or fields. • Make sure all costumes are flame retardant. Avoid walking too close to open fires, candles and jack-o-lanterns. • Make sure an adult inspects all candy before eating it. Do not eat candy that is already opened. • Be sure to follow community curfew rules. Halloween is a fun and exciting time for our kids and keeping them safe with some basic precautions will ensure an enjoyable and memorable experience. Thanks and stay safe. Jim: There's a Walmart on 54th St in Wyoming, MI, whose exit drive has me perplexed. When exiting from the far west exit of the parking lot, there is a traffic light immediately west of the drive. The westbound traffic on 54th street has a stop line before the exit drive. Can traffic exiting the parking lot go through the red light (making a right-on-red) or do they need to stop for the light? To complicate this, there's a second stop line almost underneath the actual light! (I'm not sure if that stop line is for the subsequent railroad tracks or not.) Thanks for offering a great way for all of us to be educated about safe driving!! This is the stretch of 54th Street SW referenced by reader.Google Maps  Russ Henckel, Wyoming public works traffic engineer, answered this question at Rob's request. Russ: Thanks for reaching out regarding this "unique" traffic situation along 54th St in front of Walmart. The area is a busy corridor with several signals impacting the flow of traffic. The westerly Walmart exit right-turn-only drive is not ideal but functions. The Walmart drive outlets at the signal that is the pre-signal for the RR immediately west of Walmart. The pre-signal is required because the Clay Avenue signal further west (by about 500 feet) would have traffic stacking through the RR tracks several times a day due to the amount of 54th St traffic if the pre-signal did not exist. So to prevent people from stacking at the Clay Ave signal through the RR tracks, the pre-signal will stop traffic slightly before the Clay Avenue signal cycles to red. Once the pre-signal cycles to red traffic on 54th Street is supposed to stop at the stop bar just prior to the RR track. In order to assist a small number of vehicles exiting Walmart, another stop bar was added just prior to the exit drive opening. Then when the pre-signal cycles to red a couple of vehicles could pull out of Walmart and should stop at the stop bar prior to the RR track. But, as long as a train is not approaching, vehicles could cross the track and go up to the Clay Ave signal and stop there. The pre-signal is only there to prevent vehicles from stacking to a point where cars end up stopping on the RR track. I believe legally the vehicles should stop at the stop bar prior to crossing the track but Police would be the official answer to that. Either way the intent of the pre-signal is met as long as cars don't park on the RR track. I hope that helps understand how the signals function in the area. Here's another view of 54th Street SW in Wyoming.Google Maps  William: I just have one quick question regarding traffic laws: Has the law changed regarding turning left onto a two way street on a red light when no oncoming traffic is present? Three times in three days now I've witnessed separate drivers who were stopped at a red light suddenly turn left onto a 2 way street. The first was Saturday at about 10:30 AM. We were behind a red SUV who was stopped for the red light in the left turn lane at the corner of Division Ave and Lakewood. The car was facing South and turned East onto Lakewood and the light was about ½ the way through being red. That same evening we were on E 7th Street here in Holland going straight so we could turn on to River Avenue eventually. We were at the light on E. 7th and I believe Columbia when a small car with a very loud muffler pull up on my left, came to a complete stop at the light and then turned left going south on Columbia (Not sure about this street) which was a two way street... . The third case was at a very busy intersection and there was traffic. The car was headed northbound on River in Holland at the corner of Douglas. There are two left turn lanes but the light was red and we were stopped. The light was real red. A black pickup truck all of a sudden punched it and turned left. No accident occurred but had there been it would have been ugly. Thank you and all your team for everything you do for the people of Michigan. You've got a tough job but each of you do a magnificent job and we appreciate you. Rob: The law has not changed, so "no" you cannot make a left turn on red onto a two way roadway. You can however, turn left on red from a two lane roadway onto a one-way roadway, unless of course it's otherwise posted. Here is the language in case you want to refer to it in the future 257.612: Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after stopping before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or at a limit line when marked or, if there is no crosswalk or limit line, before entering the intersection, may make a right turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 2-way street or into a 1-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn or may make a left turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 1-way roadway carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn, unless prohibited by sign, signal, marking, light, or other traffic control device. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians and bicyclists lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Thank-you for your kind words of support and drive safe. Paul: Under what circumstances might a vehicle have a succession of temporary plates over six months or longer? A black BMW in our parking lot on Willow Lake Drive in Kalamazoo has Michigan plate with an orange Dec expiration sticker. This spring it had a paper plate in the back window showing a 6/2016 expiration. That changed to a temporary plate showing a 9/2016 expiration. Now, it has changed to one showing an 11/20/16 expiration. I am curious as to what might be the circumstances surrounding this. Rob: To my knowledge there is no limit on the number of temporary registration permits you can buy for a vehicle. To give an example, those in the military will buy them off and on based upon when they're in the country. There certainly is no financial incentive to doing this, as it can cost as much as $30 for one month. If you believe there is something suspicious about the vehicle please contact local law enforcement.

These three retailers have been heeding that call for years. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 29, 2016 at 9:08AM Source: HillaryClinton.com The presidential campaign is finally entering its home stretch, and in less than two weeks we'll know who our next president will be. While the outcome isn't certain, most polls show Hillary Clinton leading the race, making it most likely that she will be president come January.  Clinton has called for raising the minimum wage to a living wage, and has promised to work to lift base hourly pay to $15/hour over time. She has also said she would encourage companies to invest in workers by rewarding companies that share profits and make investments in their employees. Raising the minimum wage has long been controversial among businesses and political interests, who claim that such a policy would actually force layoffs by incentivizing automation and raising prices on customers. While the consequences of such a policy are debatable, there are several companies that have found success by paying above-average wages and investing in their employees. Here are three of them. 1. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) Best known for its rock-bottom prices on bulk goods, Costco also pays its employees surprisingly high wages.  Earlier this year, the warehouse retailer said it would bump up its base pay rate by $1.50 to $13-$13.50/hour. The average Costco worker now earns more than $20/hour, much better than last year's median wage of $10.47/hour. Costco has long had an employee-friendly compensation policy, as it believes that reducing turnover and keeping employees within its ranks saves money in training and hiring costs over the long run. The high wages also mean the company avoids much of the bad press that has sullied rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)  over the years. Wal-Mart's employees have demanded higher wages, and interest groups have assailed it for poor labor practices. Costco's business model enables it to pay higher wages than Wal-Mart because its revenue per employee is nearly three times as high as Wal-Mart's, meaning wages are a lower percentage of its costs. Wal-Mart, however, seems to be borrowing from Costco's strategy, as it's noticed an improvement in store performance and customer satisfaction since it lifted wages to $10/hour. 2. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Like Costco Co-Founder and former CEO Jim Sinegal, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has often led with an employee-first mindset. Schultz has taken steps to provide unique benefits for frontline employees, including offering tuition reimbursement for all full-time and part-time benefits-eligible employees who wish to pursue their BAs online through Arizona State University.  Employees are also eligible for stock grants after one year of employment with the company. Starbucks offers new hires restricted units it calls bean stock, with employees becoming eligible to receive 50% of shares after their first year and the remaining after the second. Introduced in 1991, it was the first such program of its kind in retail. The coffee giant has also been consistently ahead of the curve in providing healthcare coverage to its employees. Even before the Affordable Care Act, it offered insurance to part-time employees, a rare benefit in the restaurant industry, and today the company covers about 70% of premium costs and 100% of preventative care costs. 3. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) Founder Danny Meyer refers to his booming burger chain as not fast food or even fast casual, but as fine casual. That attitude seems to be reflected in the way the company treats its employees. Shake Shack has a policy of paying workers a premium above the minimum wage, and according to Glassdoor, it pays more than $2.50 above the prevailing fast-food wage. Meyer and his company see that as the price for attracting and retaining a higher-quality workforce. As Costco has found, doing so reduces turnover and helps the burger chain fill managerial roles as the company expands.   As far as benefits, Shake Shack also offers a 401(k) matching program, comprehensive healthcare after 90 days, and a monthly bonus program based on store sales and other metrics. CEO Randy Garutti summed up the company's employment philosophy, telling The New York Times, "The No. 1 reason we pay our team well above the minimum wage is we believe that if we take care, they will take care of our customers." Notably, all three of these companies have outperformed their peers by wide margins. Shake Shack and Starbucks continue to thrive at a time when many fast-food chains are suffering from the so-called restaurant recession, and Costco has been one of the few mass-merchandise retailers that has been able to consistently grow despite the threat of Amazon and e-commerce. As Hillary Clinton hopes, perhaps more companies will soon take notice that such policies can reward employees and investors.  Jeremy Bowman owns shares of Shake Shack and Starbucks.

Within weeks of enrolling in the class, Rexford had more advanced knowledge of how rail, air, maritime, warehousing and e-commerce are used to meet key business objectives. He knew the importance of accounting for weather, vibration and other factors when getting a product from one point to another. He started looking at ways to optimize how freight was handled at the distribution center. He began to make plans to complete an Associate of Applied Science degree in logistics and supply chain technology at Lee College, and he convinced his son to sign up for the training course and pursue a degree, too. “You’re not just moving a box,” said Rexford, one of 17 Walmart warehouse managers who will be the first to graduate from the training program in December. “You’re learning how to move a box differently, in the face of different obstacles and to achieve different goals.” It’s the primary lesson that Keith Coleman, director of the Lee College Logistics Program, intended to impart to his students when he designed and launched the Walmart training course: logistics encompasses a broad spectrum of transportation, storage and distribution activities that companies use to move products as cheaply and quickly as possible. With the development and implementation of new technologies, like drones and driverless vehicles, successful logistics professionals will need the vision and understanding to think beyond the traditional. “In the military, the faster and more effectively you can move things, the more lives are saved. In the business world, money is saved – but industry executives are not trained logisticians,” said Coleman, a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer who has overseen steady growth of the logistics program at Lee College and will soon open a full-scale Logistics Training Center on campus. “Logisticians see the whole picture,” Coleman said. “They create the game plan. They are the problem solvers. Being in this program allows these students to get hands-on and see a future for themselves. They’ll remember Lee College as the place where they got the training that made a difference.” In addition to technical knowledge, the logistics training for Walmart managers also aims to help strengthen leadership and communication skills. Coleman frequently assigns role-playing exercises that simulate a wide range of on-the-job scenarios between supervisors and employees, as well as presentations that require students to dress professionally and practice public speaking. Many say their confidence and ability to guide and instruct others have improved as a result. “When you come to work, you know who has been taking the training because you can see that we’re growing and learning,” said Jerry Duarte. “We’re using different terminology, thinking more quickly and being more creative.” For Amanda Erne, getting back into the classroom for logistics training at Lee College made her realize that seeking additional education was long overdue. The encouragement from Walmart and camaraderie she and her colleagues in the program have built made returning to college less intimidating and more rewarding than she expected. “We tend to have a more narrow view of our jobs; we know what we do, but we don’t know why we do it,” said Erne, who now aspires to a life-long career as a logistician – just like all the Baytown Distribution Center managers in the class. “This program has given us a wider perspective and deeper understanding of how logistics works.” Discussion Be the first to comment on this article!

Summerland resident Bob Mair left his wheelchair near the store's entrance on Wednesday, opting to use one of Walmart's complimentary motorized scooters while he did his shopping. When he left the store, his wheelchair was gone. "People that steal from a disabled person are really just scoundrels," he said. Fortunately, the theft was caught on surveillance video. Walmart has cameras in the entrance, and police have obtained the footage. Video shows a person being wheeled out on the chair by another, but the best look at the pair is from a video shot earlier. That footage shows them entering the store through another door in a less expensive chair, suggesting they may have made an upgrade. Fellow shoppers were horrified that someone made off with the chair. "It's amazing that people have the nerve to do something like that... It's sad," one person said. "Too many crooks around," another added. Mair has had to use an old, beat-up chair since the theft, and is having a hard time getting around. His neighbours said the theft was the last thing he needed, and that the senior has been struggling. The senior is hopeful his workers' compensation may replace the chair, but was shocked that the thieves had taken "advantage of someone that is somewhat defenseless." He said the stolen chair was "probably the top of the line" in Canada. RCMP said the wheelchair is a custom Helio A7, and is worth more than $3,000. It has been described as all black, with polymer-type rims and an upgraded seat cushion. Its footrests have been removed, and the brand name "Motion Composites" is printed on the backrest.  "We urge the person who took the chair to drop it off at any RCMP detachment or simply return it to the store," Cpl. Jesse O'Donaghey said in a statement. "RCMP would like to quickly reunite the victim of this senseless crime with his much needed mobility device." Anyone with more information is asked to contact officers at 250-768-2880, or call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS). With a report from CTV Vancouver's Kent Molgat Photos The thieves were caught on camera leaving the West Kelowna store with the wheelchair. Summerland resident Bob Mair left his wheelchair near the store's entrance. When he returned, the chair was gone.

(Spoiler: Yes) Posted By Vince Grzegorek vgrzegorek@clevescene.com> on Wed, Oct 19, 2016 at 12:55 PM Last September we bestowed the Steelyard Walmart with the title of Worst Walmart in America. It was not a decision made lightly. Nor was it a close call. All manner of incompetence lives in the building (and parking lot, for that matter). The vortex of suck is so strong at 3400 Steelyard Dr. as to threaten to disrupt entire weather systems. The disregard for common human decency so total it inspires fear. The feedback so one-sided one wonders how no one has noticed or rectified the situation. Then again, given that employees and managers at the store are either nonexistent or on their phones, it's not entirely surprising. But we held out hope for improvement. We thought maybe, just maybe, that our missive would reach receptive ears at Walmart headquarters. That our little award might filter its way to Top Men at the superstore. That someone in charge might say to themselves, "Holy shit, this is bad. Let's fix this." We should have known better. One year later, it appears as though nothing has changed and no one cares. We can't vouch for that ourselves, since we haven't stepped foot in that particular brand of hell since last year. But evidence continues to pile up. It is irrefutable. There are concerns, and there are many. There is woeful resignation. There are pleas for help. There are endless examples. Here are just a few from the last calendar year.

News Sports Life Obituaries E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Super construction will lead to summer opening for Barstow Wal-Mart Friday Oct 28, 2016 at 1:10 PM Oct 31, 2016 at 4:54 PM Mike Lamb @mlambdispatch BARSTOW — The Super Wal-Mart under construction next to the present Wal-Mart on Montara Road and East Main Street should be ready to open by next summer, according to a city official. Consulting City Engineer Brad Merrell told the City Planning Commission on Monday the new building should be ready by May or June. He said that would give Wal-Mart a month to transfer everything from the present store to the new building. "Once that is done, they will demolish the old building. That will bring us in compliance," Merrell said. Economic Development and Planning Manager Gaither Loewenstein told the commission the eight retail pads are located where the present store stands. "Although there are letters of intent being signed with retailers now, the actual construction — most of those would occur until after the existing Wal-Mart is demolished. The Super Wal-Mart is opening the summer of 2017 and my suspicion would be the following summer for the additional retailers," Loewenstein said. Merrell said there is a lot of work to be done after the demolition of the old building. "They also have to haul 80,000 (cubic) yards of dirt," he said. "There is a lot of grading that has to go on after the building comes down. So they can lower the pads for the shopping center to where it's more in line to where the new building is. There is about 75 feet of fall across that property. So they are trying to make that up. They brought in a lot of dirt to fill for the new building." Meanwhile, road construction on East Main Street and Montara Road continues. Merrell said Shames Construction will soon start paving of East Main Street from the Super Wal-Mart site toward the Marine Corps Logistics Base. "There is going to be quite a few weeks left of working on East Main and there will be two-way traffic with flagging," he said. Merrell also said work crews will also be cutting into Montara Road in front of the AMPM to put a tie into the sewer. He said that probably won't start until Nov. 7. After that is complete, Merrell said a vault will be installed to replace the fiber optics. "They also have a new traffic signal to put in. That will be at the westbound offramp on the I-40 and Main Street. One of the conditions of Wal-Mart was to place a new traffic signal at that intersection in front of the hotel there," Merrell said.

The Index of Consumer Sentiment hit 87.2 in October, according to the University of Michigan on Friday, the lowest level since October 2014. Economist expected the consumer sentiment index to hit 88.2 in October, down from 91.2 in September final reading, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. The decline was due to "less favorable prospects" for the national economy, with half of all consumers expecting an economic downturn within the next five years, according to the survey. "Objectively, the probability of a downturn during the next five years is far from zero-this would be the longest expansion in 150 years if it lasted just over half of the five year horizon. Nonetheless, the October rise may simply reflect a temporary bout of uncertainty caused by the election," Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said in a statement. The report said if interest rates rise in December, it will have a "minimal impact" on spending. It said consumers also expect a small slowdown in job creation that is likely to prevent any more declines in the unemployment rate. "Overall, real personal consumption expenditures can be expected to increase by 2.5 percent through mid 2017," Curtin said. The monthly survey of 500 consumers measures attitudes toward topics like personal finances, inflation, unemployment, government policies and interest rates.

Intel Leads Tech and Telecom Green Power Rankings Related Topics All EL Stories Clean Energy Climate Environmental Policy & Law Feature Solar Energy Sustainable Strategy & Leadership Utilities Wind Energy The corporate community is leading the green energy economy. Today, nearly 1,300 organizations are partnering with the US Environmental Protection Agency to either generate or buy green energy. The result, according to EPA: lowering carbon emissions and greater brand equity, making the proposition a win-win scenario. “By using green, an organization not only can dramatically reduce its carbon footprint but it may be able to save money, stand out from competitors, and meet corporate environmental goals, which is of growing importance to stakeholder groups such as customers, Wall Street analysts, shareholders and employees,” says EPA. Some of the leaders: Intel, Kohl’s Department Stores, Whole Foods Market, the city of Houston and Dell. Take Kohl’s: It is one the world’s largest retail solar hosts, says EPA, with solar panels that are placed in stores in not just on the West Coast in California but also on the East Coast in New Jersey and Connecticut. Wisconsin is another key location. Much of that is through power purchase arrangements, where a third party generates the electricity that is bought over a period of years by Kohl’s. That gives the developer a guaranteed income stream while it allows the retailer to keep its prices in check. Wal-Mart is another big box retailer that is active in the green market. It is purchasing wind power from a Duke Energy wind farm in Texas, which supplies the retailer with 15% of its electricity needs in that state alone. Nationally, Wal-Mart says that it gets 25% of its energy from renewables and that it has a goal of 100%. And according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wal-Mart and Target are the two biggest installers of solar power in the nation. They have installed 145 megawatts and 147 megawatts, respectively, it adds. “Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio,” said Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart. “This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam’s Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business. Being recognized by the SEIA for our efforts is confirmation that we are moving in the right direction with regards to renewable energy, specifically solar.” “At Target, sustainability is a principle that drives the decisions we make across the company – from the products we make to the way we run our business,” adds John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target. “We’re incredibly proud of the progress we’ve made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress.”  More than 860 utilities offer green power programs to their customers, says the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. That is giving more than half of the electricity customers nationwide the option to buy renewable energy from a provider. Eco-minded businesses are snatching up the credits. Software manufacturer SAP says that it has a goal of getting to 100% green fuels while Microsoft says that it now gets 80% of its electricity from renewables. As the technologies are getting incorporated by the nation’s bigger companies, they are subsequently becoming more and more accessible to all businesses. And with that trend, the New Energy Economy has taken root and will only sprout higher.

Tami Denny posted a video to Facebook showing the Sunday evening scene at the Walmart parking lot, where hundreds of blackbirds were covering the pavement and parked vehicles like a scene out of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. "Unbelievable! Invasion of the blackbirds," she said in the video. Denny experiments at the end of the video with honking her horn, which predictably causes the birds to fly away from her vehicle. "This is crazy....they were on every car in the parking lot AND on the ground," Denny wrote in the video's description. Denny said she's seen similar gatherings around town. "I have seen this before at Walmart, but I've also seen it at Neiman Marcus, the Galleria and they used to be down in Saks," she told KTRK-TV. Hannah Bailey, head of the bird collection for the Houston Zoo, said blackbirds gather for numerous reasons, including to find food, to search for warmer areas as the temperatures cool, and for safety in numbers. "They are part of our environment and help with insect control throughout our area, so while they might be messing up your car, remember they are eating bugs and mosquitoes, so be happy for that," Bailey said.

And world roamers have taken to an online forum to do just that, sharing their anecdotal reasons as to why certain places left a bad taste in their mouths. Destinations cropped up from every corner, from Egypt - described as being 'smelly with aggressive shop vendors' - to America, where one visitor said people are 'fake' and Walmart shoppers are 'scary'. One tourist wrote of the Russian city of Vladivostok (pictured): 'Most sightseeing consists of numerous soviet monuments, which are as fun as sitting on the couch and observing a wall' Despite its rich culture and the lure of its pyramids, Egypt was one of the destinations that came up most often on the Quora forum thread.  'You get off the plane and immediately everything smells like garbage mixed with soot,' one claimed, adding: 'The local currency I bought at the airport was like dirty grey-pinkish crumpled napkin'.  Another lamented the street vendors, writing: 'They would pretty much grab you off the street into their store and “help” you try on things - a lot of touching involved. Rejection is not exactly understood and they have a strong grip.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Traveller set to become the fastest female to visit EVERY... Doors flying open at 70mph and trains with no timetable:... Share this article Share America, too, attracted its fair share of complaints from visitors. One holidaymaker complained: 'Places I’ve been to (every single one of them) were stained with the smell of weed. It was literally everywhere - in hotel rooms, on the beach, at parking lots.'  She went on: 'Fake friendliness everywhere - they smile as long as you are paying, but talk behind your back. The people freaked me out sometimes. Walking around in Walmart was scary as hell!' Despite its rich culture, Egypt (pictured) was one of the destinations that came up most often, with one writing: 'You get off the plane and immediately everything smells like garbage' Luxembourg, a small European country bordering France and Germany, was another country which was covered a few times. 'What this place lacks is liveliness,' one stated. 'We were bored. The trains were half empty, the restaurants were looking dull and the people were unresponsive.' The people freaked me out sometimes - walking around in Walmart was scary as hell! Another wrote: 'Luxembourg grabs the top spot. Lived there for a year. Dreadful weather, dreadful food, only finance people and banks.' In a similar vein, one remarked of Liechtenstein: 'I’m aware that people [there] have a high income and a great lifestyle. So they can wipe off their tears of boredom with their money.' Another concurred, writing: 'A bunch of empty houses for the rich to keep a residency for tax purposes and a bunch of cruise ships.'  A tourist wrote of Luxembourg (pictured): 'We were bored - the trains were half empty, the restaurants were looking dull and the people were unresponsive' Switzerland also got a look-in, for being perhaps too idyllic. 'It's a lovely country but I constantly feel as if I have an inferiority complex when I'm there,' one remarked. 'Just a little too perfect for my taste.' Further afield, one traveller took a stab at Canada, albeit a tongue-in-cheek one.  Chile bored me to death in spite of its beautiful landscapes  'There weren’t enough overly large meals of predominantly fried foods,' he stated. 'There weren’t enough guns, people were too polite (and kept apologising!!), they insisted on Arabica coffee [and] it got bloody cold.' Chile was mentioned more than once as being a somewhat reserved place to visit. 'Walk through a crowded market in Santiago or a monument - people just murmur, take a metro - its pin drop silence,' one wrote. 'Finally for the last battering, the food and (lack of alcoholic) drinks.  'Just like a very nice but emotionally unreceptive person makes a bad life-partner, Chile bored me to death in spite of its beautiful landscapes and polite people.' Another tourist said the same about the Russian city of Vladivostok, remarking: 'Most sightseeing consists of numerous soviet monuments, which are as fun as sitting on the couch and observing a wall.' Several tourists bemoaned the rude taxi drivers in places including Panama, Jamaica and Paris (stock image) One noted that their trip to Bahrain had been sullied by Ramadan - an Islamic period of fasting during daylight hours. 'I mistakenly believed [this] wouldn’t apply to foreigners. I was wrong,' they wrote. 'I couldn’t eat or drink anything while outside the airport. This eliminated one of the main pleasures of travelling to a new country. '  I mistakenly believed Ramadan wouldn’t apply to foreigners. I was wrong Several tourists bemoaned the rude taxi drivers in places including Panama, Jamaica and Paris. And one wrote of Malaysia: 'We got thrown out of taxi just for closing the trunk too fast.' And last but not least, the case of a traveller with a seemingly indestructible spirit, who said he couldn't name a single place he wouldn't return to.  'I was in Turkey a couple of years ago and got tear-gassed by the police two nights in a row,' he wrote. 'But that was an experience and it didn't put me off going there again.'  Read more: What countries will you not visit ever again? - Quora Share or comment on this article e-mail 5.1k shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

(Jefferson County Jail) Print Email Carol Robinson | crobinson@al.com By Carol Robinson | crobinson@al.com The Birmingham News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 28, 2016 at 6:00 AM, updated October 28, 2016 at 9:26 AM comments You've heard of Nigerian scammers? Well police believe some are based right here in small-town Alabama. It's a complex investigation of a complex set of cons, but Adamsville authorities say a trio of people in that Jefferson County city helped bilk hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting Americans and wired the cash to criminals – perhaps even terrorists -- in Nigeria. Adamsville police first became aware of wrongdoing in September of 2014 when a man in Chippewa County, Minnesota filed a report with sheriff's deputies there about a potential scam. The victim told investigators he learned he had won a $100,000 lottery, but in order to collect that money he had to fork over $2,462.50. He did so via a Walmart MoneyGram, and the recipient was to a woman named Jacinta Girrado Derby, a 57-year-old Adamsville woman. Det. Rick Whitfield said they looked into the case, but there wasn't immediately anything that could be done. They kept an eye out for any other similar complaints, but there weren't any. That changed in February 2016. This time, Adamsville police received a call from the Washington County Sheriff's Office, also in Minnesota. A woman there reported she was selling a piece of furniture on Craigslist, and that a buyer had offered her asking price. The buyer, Whitfield said, deposited the agreed-upon price into a supposed PayPal account and included $950 for shipping costs. He then asked the victim to send him that $950 shipping money back to him, which she did from her own bank account via a MoneyGram picked up by Derby. "Is she the main culprit? At that point we didn't know,'' Whitfield said. But they were determined to find out. They launched an investigation to figure out if there was a crime, and if so, did that crime happen in Adamsville? Later that same month, another complaint came in – this time from Port Neches, Texas. Whitfield said a man selling a motorcycle on Craiglist found a buyer, who was willing to pay him the full amount plus $950 for shipping. Again, the money was supposed deposited in what appeared to be a legitimate PayPal account and that seller, also, was asked to front the shipping money from his personal bank account to send via a Walmart MoneyGram to a man named Edward Ford, also in Adamsville. The seller, however, became suspicious. "The buyer was in California but they wanted him to send the money to Alabama?" Whitfield said. "He didn't send the money, and he contacted us." In March, a young single mother met with Adamsville detectives and said she feared her life, and her son's life, was in danger. She told authorities she had become involved with a man over Facebook, a man who supposedly worked on an off-shore oil rig and needed her help handling his pay. He would send her money via MoneyGram, which she was instructed to then wire to someone else. Over a period of only about six months, the woman had wired an estimated $500,000 to $600,000, usually to a recipient in Nigeria. "She was a very naïve woman," Whitfield said. Investigators looked to see if there was any connection in that case to the one they were building against Derby and Ford, but didn't find any apparent link. "We interviewed her and she denied any association with them,'' he said. In June, Adamsville police were contacted by a victim in Washington State who was selling a couch on Craigslist. Again, the woman was told the price of the couch plus $650 for shipping was deposited in a PayPal account, and $650 was to be wired to a person in Adamsville – this time a woman named Debra Shields. She sent the money, but was then told that wasn't enough and was asked to send more. Instead, she called Adamsville police who told her to file a report there, and they would handle things from the Alabama end. As the investigation continued, they received yet another call from Bosque County in Texas. A woman was selling a tractor and ended up sending $1,200 via MoneyGram in shipping fees only to realize she had been scammed. The problem, Whitfield said, was that the PayPal accounts were fake but looked eerily legitimate. So the victims, thinking they had that money sitting in the "PayPal" account, used their own money to wire the buyer shipping costs. The "buyer," in all of the cases, ended up asking for even more in shipping costs and that's when the sellers realized they'd been had. Some realized it immediately, he said, but one sent more than $2,000 of his own money before he realized he was being scammed. Adamsville's investigation showed that Derby, Shields, 54, and Ford, 64 – described in transactions as "pickup agents" - all lived within two blocks of each other in Adamsville. Detectives sought, and received, surveillance videotape from the Adamsville Walmart that showed all three sending and receiving MoneyGrams on multiple occasions. The videos show Derby by herself, and with either Ford or Shields. Once subpoenaed and received, Walmart spreadsheets of the transactions by the trio showed that every time a MoneyGram was received by one of them, another was sent the very same day for nearly the same amount – minus their fee which was roughly $20 to $30 per transaction. In all, Whitfield said, Derby sent at least $500,000 to Nigeria, so much that Walmart no longer allowed her to use the money-wiring service. That's when, Whitfield said, she enlisted neighbors Ford and Shields to help her as "pickup agents" to "make a little extra money." Shields also sent money to Nigeria. Ford, Whitfield said, apparently kept most, if not all, of the money without sending it to anyone. Detectives met with the FBI and with Jefferson County District Attorney's Office. He said federal investigators said they would assist in any way possible, but that it was Adamsville's case and that it would be virtually impossible to track the money once it left the U.S. The District Attorney's Office issued felony theft of property warrants for all three. Derby was arrested Sept. 23, and is out of jail on $15,000 bond. Shields was arrested Sept. 24, and is out of jail on $5,000 bond. Ford was arrested Oct. 9, and he is out of jail on $10,000. "We interviewed each one of the separately and one of the main questions I asked them was 'Did you not feel or sense something wasn't right about this?' And in each case, the answer was yes, yet they continued,'' Whitfield said. Derby told investigators she was recruited into the business by another woman, who is now dead. She also gave investigators the names of four people for whom she worked, and each one of them had people in Nigeria to whom they were also sending money. Some of the names she provided matched the names of the "buyers" given to police by the out-of-state victims, Whitfield said. Whitfield and other detectives carried out search warrants at the homes of Derby and Shields, confiscating computers and phones that are undergoing computer forensic analysis. They also have names of other people recruited by Derby, and those investigations are ongoing. Interestingly, he said, Derby, Ford and Shields all said they did not know the young woman that told Adamsville police she feared for her life, which backed up her own story that she wasn't working with that group and didn't know them. It appears to just be a coincidence that she was part of a similar scam and also lives in Adamsville and shows the scope of such cons. "These people are just recruiting people everywhere,'' Whitfield said. "You always see these 'work from home' advertisements. I know it's a cliché, but if seems too good to be true, it probably is." That woman wasn't arrested because police believe she was didn't realize what she was doing was wrong. "We see her as a victim as well,'' Whitfield said. "We just told her to cut ties. They had been bluffing her with threats into continuing." Though the pay for "pickup agents" seems nominal, Whitfield said it adds up when you're talking about millions of dollars. However, it's not likely they were getting rich and, if they were, they weren't living like it. "If you saw where Derby lives, you wouldn't believe a million dollars had passed through there," he said. Adamsville police said their gut tells them this money was going to support terrorist activities. "Can we prove that? Not at this time,'' Whitfield said. "But we can't help but feel like that's a good possibility because of the nature of how the transactions were done, the sophistication behind it, the way people were recruited, where the money was going and the day in which we live." The hardest part of the case has been getting victims to come forward. They all live out of state because that's the only way the scam could work since it deals with delivery fees. He said people need to be more careful when carrying out sales and other transactions online. "Before you send money to somebody, make sure that you have done your research and it's legitimate," he said. "If you are a victim, then report it. Don't be embarrassed, be mad. Because if these few people had not come forward, they would still be out there collecting money and sending it overseas." The investigation is still ongoing and how far up the hierarchy they will go still remains to be seen. Already, however, Adamsville police deem it a major success. "Our goal was to shut down this operation in Adamsville," he said, "and we've done that."

(CBC) David Common Host of CBC's World Report David Common has reported from more than 50 countries, from the beaches of the Seychelles Islands to eight trips to Afghanistan. He helped cover the 2003 invasion of Iraq, toured the Arctic on a Canadian icebreaker and covered the U.S. elections, the Japanese tsunami and the devastating earthquake in Haiti. David hosts World Report, the morning national newscast with more than a million listeners.

More grocery stores encourage 'bring you own container' initiatives 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste Walmart Canada has promised to review its in-store processes related to food waste after a CBC Marketplace and Go Public investigation examined how much food the company throws away.    Over the course of more than 12 visits to two stores in the Toronto area, Marketplace staff repeatedly found produce, baked goods, frozen foods, meat and dairy products in garbage bins out back. Most of the food was still in its packaging, rather than separated for composting. In many cases, the food was well before its best-before date and appeared to be fresh. Also in the bins: bottles of water, frozen cherries that were still cold and tubs of yogurt. Here's how much food Walmart throws away over 12 days "For sure, there are mistakes being made and one thing we need to do is tighten up the execution of our in-store processes for the food that is going into the bins," said Walmart spokesperson Alex Roberton. "We need to be more certain that that is food that needs to be thrown out." Walmart initially declined multiple requests for an on-camera interview from Marketplace, but the retailer agreed to talk this week, following a significant online response. With 407 stores across Canada, Walmart is one of the country's largest grocers. The company says it has set a goal of eliminating food waste being directed to landfills. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters) Plans to change Walmart, which is one of Canada's largest grocers, has set a goal of eliminating food waste being directed to landfills, says Roberton. At some of its 407 stores across Canada, some food items are donated to local shelters or food banks, he says. But many of the charities lack trucks or refrigeration of their own to transport and hold donations. Watch the Marketplace investigation on food waste online The company has donated millions of dollars to Food Banks Canada to increase their capacity to collect, prepare and distribute donated food items, he says. Walmart will also roll out a "customer value program" to reduce prices on certain fresh items that are approaching their best-before dates, Roberton says. In an earlier statement, Walmart said it believes the food Marketplace found was unsafe for consumption. (CBC) The company acknowledges that associates will sometimes make mistakes, or throw out items that should be donated or directed to recycling and composting streams. "If we're putting food that's good to eat in the wrong bin, then that's a mistake we need to correct," says Roberton. "And that's one of the areas that we need to focus on improving." Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash Food is occasionally thrown out for safety reasons, Roberton says, which could include any item that requires refrigeration leaving the cold chain for even a short period of time. A number of current and former Walmart employees have reached out to Marketplace following coverage of the food found in trash bins. They describe large amounts of food being discarded routinely. Scale of the problem About $31 billion worth of food is wasted in Canada each year, according to a 2014 study from Value Chain Management International. Grocery stores are responsible for about 10 per cent of that waste. "We're very keen on getting that number down," says Roberton. Even more is discarded directly by consumers, with 47 per cent of food waste happening in the home. $31B problem: How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Food waste could be part of Canada's first-ever national food policy, which is currently in the research phase, says Federal Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay. France recently introduced legislation barring grocery stores from throwing out food, which has led many stores to change the way they stock their shelves and manage donations. Walmart Canada says it will consider supporting future government initiatives aimed at eliminating food waste in Canada.

City says appeals against building Walmart exhausted BY JILL BARNES NELSON jbnelson@tehachapinews.com jbnelson Oct 27, 2016 City of Tehachapi An artist's rendering of a proposed Tehachapi Super Walmart. It looks like a done deal. The City of Tehachapi released a statement that the California Court of Appeals declared Monday that the case against Walmart in Tehachapi is complete and there will be no more appeals. “We believe it was the right thing to do,” City Manager Greg Garrett said Thursday in a phone interview. “On Monday (Oct. 24) at the end of the business day, we received that information. This has been going on for a long time and it seems the appeals process has been exhausted through the legal system, and the EIR (environmental impact statement) has been satisfied.” The decision comes two months after the Fifth District Court of Appeal ruled that the City of Tehachapi had adequately addressed environmental issues related to the proposed Walmart. That decision by the three-judge panel on Aug. 24 was unanimous, and followed a hearing on the case held July 26. It was the third attempt for an appeal by a group called Tehachapi First. Tehachapi First questioned the plan to build the Walmart in 2011. It challenged the adequacy of environmental reviews related to the proposed Walmart through its attorney, Mark Wolfe of San Francisco. Efforts to reach representatives from Tehachapi First on Thursday were unsuccessful. Both Garrett and Jay Schlosser, head of development services for Tehachapi, said the city has been in contact with Walmart throughout the process. “Pending encroachment and building permits from the city, Walmart will begin preparation for the physical plans,” Schlosser said. “Walmart is actively working with the development services to begin the preparation of the various plans that have to be produced, the engineering and architectural level drawings that have to be produced to guide the physical construction.” Garrett also reported that the city has been in contact with CalTrans in regard to traffic, since the retail store will be near Highway 58, along Tucker Road. “A lot of time and money (by Walmart) has been spent to reach this goal,” Garrett said. “But on the other side of the coin, this is what makes America great, the checks and balances. We've gone through the process with our eyes open. Residents have said they wanted a Walmart and we believe we've listened to them.” Garrett said there isn't yet a timeline to begin construction. However, once construction begins, he said it probably will take about 18 months to complete the project.

And in 2015, the average person spent over $800. Between the holiday ham and toys for the kids, end-of-the-year spending can cut through any devoted saver's budget. Here are 40 ways to trim the fat off your spending — without making you look like a Grinch. 1. Create a Spending Budget Before you buy anything, you need to know how much you can afford to spend so you don’t rack up debt or wreak havoc on your finances. Personal finance expert Natasha Campbell said you should write down a list of everyone you plan on giving gifts to and decide how much you're willing to spend per person. Once you've established a realistic gift budget, think about how much you'll need to spend on food, decor and entertainment during the holidays. Knowing how much you can expect your expenses to increase will help you save ahead and keep you mindful when you're at the store. 2. Buy Gifts Little by Little Buying everything in a single day during the holiday rush not only means you'll overpay on certain items, you'll also put a bigger strain on your wallet, said Regina Conway, consumer expert for Slickdeals.net. “By spreading out your purchases throughout the next few months, you’ll be able to budget accordingly and not have a credit hangover in January,” she said. Plus, it will allow you to take advantage of the various sales throughout the holiday season. Read: What Warren Buffett and Bill Gates Teach Their Kids About Money 3. Establish Realistic Expectations Your kids might not understand the ins and outs of your finances — and that's okay, as long as you help them establish reasonable expectations for gifts. Rather than allow your kids to fawn over every new toy and gadget that's coming out this holiday season, help them come up with a gift wishlist by establishing a clear budget for their presents. Knowing your kids aren't expecting the latest consoles, a pony or other outrageously expensive gifts will alleviate some of the pressure that comes with shopping for loved ones. It also helps your kids understand that the holidays aren't necessarily about getting the coolest toys they can flaunt at school. 4. Know When to Shop “Retailers are trying to get shoppers into stores earlier and earlier each year, but that doesn't mean shoppers will get the best deals,” said Kristin Cook, managing editor of Ben’s Bargains. For example, the best prices on toys and video game consoles often appear in December, she said. Sites such as BFAds.net create comprehensive buying guides to help you understand when and where the best values are. Fatwallet.com shows the best current deals next to upcoming Black Friday deals, helping you make smart decisions on whether to buy early or wait. “Knowing the times that things go on sale can help you be one of the lucky ones that nab those limited, time-sensitive deals,” said Brent Shelton, an online shopping expert with Fatwallet.com. 5. Shop in Early November You don’t have to leave your Thanksgiving dinner to battle the crowds on Black Friday to get the best prices of the season. Several product categories, such as in electronics and home appliances, will be marked down to Black Friday prices starting in early November, said Cook. Look for these early discounts from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Target and Walmart. 6. Set Up Deal Alerts A good way to track sales so you don’t miss out is to sign up for deal alerts, said Shelton. For example, you can get alerts when savvy deal hunters post price drops in the Fatwallet.com "Hot Deals" forum. Slickdeals.net, meanwhile, will send you alerts when a deal is posted that matches keywords or products you select. 7. Shop Online the Night Before Thanksgiving All of the best advertised — and unadvertised — online deals on Thanksgiving will start going live Wednesday night, said Cook. In fact, many stores advertise at midnight but will unofficially start an hour earlier to get a jump on competitors. To snag the best deals before inventory runs out, watch retailer sites as deals go live. Cook said the Ben’s Bargains team has seen some of the best deals sell out in an hour, but most lasted a few hours. “While retailers will intentionally time sales of different products throughout Thanksgiving, staying up late the night before Thanksgiving will pay off significantly,” she said. 8. Get Black Friday Prices After Black Friday You don’t have to stand in line outside a store at the crack of dawn to get doorbuster prices. You can get many items at a discount on eBay a day or two after Black Friday, said Kyle James, founder of coupon and deal site Rather-Be-Shopping.com. It’s commonplace for people to buy items during Black Friday and then sell them for small profits online. “So be sure to check eBay on Black Friday weekend and pay only slightly more than if you had stood in line for hours,” he said.

Turn Old Gadgets Into Holiday Money Unused tech gadgets like mobile phones, tablets, computers and video game consoles can easily be turned into cash for the holidays. You can sell your unwanted electronics — even damaged ones — on sites like Gazelle.com, NextWorth.com and uSell.com. Or you can trade them in for gift cards at retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Walmart, said consumer expert Andrea Woroch. You can even turn used ink cartridges into holiday gift money. Staples offers $2 in rewards for every cartridge you recycle, she said. 10. Buy Used and Refurbished Electronics The latest gadgets, like the newly-released iPhone 7, are cost prohibitive for many holiday shoppers. Rather than buying the latest tech, look to stores that sell refurbished or used devices for less. Even buying a slightly older model can save you hundreds of dollars. Brian Kramer of Gazelle.com recommended buying preowned electronics. In a survey of 750 Gazelle users, "70 percent feel the high price of a new iPhone or iPad prohibits them from buying it as a gift," he said, noting that many shoppers can find devices for up to 40 percent off, compared to the cost of a new device. 11. Stock Up on Discounted Gift Cards You can save money on holiday purchases by buying discounted gift cards from sites like CardCash.com, GiftCards.com and Raise.com. “Not only can you give a discounted gift card as a gift, you can also use it as your currency to shop,” said Conway. 12. Sell Unwanted Gift Cards If you have a stash of gift cards from last Christmas you never used, you can sell them online for 80 percent to 90 percent of their value, said Phillip Christenson, a financial advisor for Phillip James Financial. You can get cash for your cards on sites such as CardPool.com and GiftcardZen.com. 13. Avoid the Upsell Don’t spend more than you have to. Say no to extended warranties, or at least pick up a lower-cost warranty from a protection plan service such as SquareTrade.com, said Shelton. 14. Avoid Shipping Fees For online shoppers, when it comes to learning how to save money at Christmas, don't look much further than shipping fees. Shopping online makes it easy to compare prices while avoiding crowds, but shipping fees can wipe out your savings. Woroch recommended shopping with retailers that offer free shipping for purchases and returns or that have a physical store near you where they’ll ship for free or accept returns. 15. Earn Cash Back Shopping Online You can earn cash back on purchases to alleviate the cost of holiday spending. Sites like BeFrugal.com and Ebates.com allow members to earn cash back from thousands of online retailers. Cary Carbonaro, author of "The Money Queen's Guide: For Women Who Want to Build Wealth and Banish Fear," said to, "Bring your smart phone and check RetailMeNot before you buy." 16. Check for Coupon Codes Before you buy anything online, visit sites such as Offers.com to find coupon codes that can be entered at checkout. You can also follow your favorite retailers on Facebook and Twitter and sign up to receive coupon codes via email. Use a mobile app such as Coupon Sherpa while you shop to see what coupons and discounts are available at nearby brick-and-mortar retailers. If you find a coupon you can use, you can pull up the barcode at checkout to get a discount. 17. Use the Online Chat Service Some holiday shopping tips require you to be a little more proactive. This holiday season, take advantage of the live chat features on retailer sites. Ask about promotions or even unadvertised discounts that might be available. To encourage a one-time discount, you can even mention that you’re considering a competitor’s product. You can also pick up the phone and call customer service to ask about discounts and whether they will honor an expired coupon or recent sale price. Other times, it's as easy as asking for a discount. "Wherever I shop, I always ask for a discount, and I usually get it," said Teri Gault, author of "Shop Smart, Save More." 18. Take Advantage of Price Matching “Price matching is a great way to grab the lowest prices without bouncing from store to store, but it does require a bit of initiative,” said Howard Schaffer of Offers.com. As a shopper, it's up to you to keep an eye on the prices of products and show proof to retailers that competitors are offering the same product for lower prices. Apps such as RedLaser and ShopSavvy can help. You also need to be aware that some retailers’ price-matching policies are better than others, Schaffer said. Major retailers like Target and Walmart have some of the best policies, matching local competitors' prices as well as the prices of online retailers, such as Amazon. 19. Download Browser Tools You can download free browser tools that help you comparison shop and hunt for discounts. FreePriceAlerts.com, for example, has a downloadable tool that will alert you if a product you’re viewing on a retailer’s site is selling for less elsewhere. 20. Track Price Drops Even if you buy items at full price, you still might be able to score savings if they go on sale. Several retailers — including Macy’s, Sears, Target and Walmart — offer price adjustments if an item you buy at full price is marked down within a certain number of days from the purchase date. 21. Clear Your Cookies The internet is a great place to score deals. But first, clear out your cookies. Cookies are generated by websites and stored on your computer. They allow sites to load faster but can also be used to gather information about you. Woroch said you should clear your browser’s cookies so stores can’t track your purchases and browsing patterns, which they might use to adjust the prices you see on their websites. 22. Use the Right Credit Card If you are in the habit of paying off your credit card balance each month, you can benefit by using credit cards during the holidays. “By choosing and using credit cards strategically, you not only can track your spending more easily, you can save money and earn rewards on purchases,” Schaffer said. 23. Redeem Rewards for Holiday Cash You might have a source of untapped cash for the holidays — your credit card rewards. Take the opportunity to cash in your points for cash or gift cards to help cover some of your holiday spending. See: 9 Best Credit Card Hacks to Save Money on Everything 24. Don't Drink and Shop The holidays are a time of cheer and celebration, but a bit of drinking before hitting the mall can derail your gift budget. April Masini, a relationship expert and author, said, "Drinking and shopping won’t get you killed, but it will get you buying what you can’t afford because you slide into purchases on a wave of martini-fueled good cheer. Starbucks and shopping, yes. Cocktails and shopping, no." 25. Shop With Cash A good way to limit your holiday spending is to shop with only enough cash to buy items on your list. This tactic is ideal for someone who already has credit card debt and doesn’t want to rack up more. Shopping with cash will not only help you avoid impulse purchases, it can also stop the trend of buying gifts for yourself, Woroch said. 26. Sign Up for Store Rewards Programs Sign up for rewards programs with retailers you'll visit during the holiday season to help you save, Schaffer said. For example, by enrolling in Kohl’s Yes2You Rewards, you earn one point for every dollar spent and get a $5 reward for every 100 points you accrue. Often, retailers with rewards programs will send coupons to members, while others will increase rewards during holiday sales. 27. Shop Garage Sales Personal finance expert Catherine Alford said she saves money by buying gifts for her children on Craigslist and at garage sales. “All kids want on Christmas morning is to have fun and play with toys,” she said. “They have no idea how much you spent on them or who played with the toys before they did — nor do they care.” For example, she paid less than half the retail price for a train table with tracks and trains by buying a gently-used one. 28. Use Your Warehouse Club Membership If you belong to a warehouse club such as Costco or Sam’s Club, you can score savings during the holidays. Costco, for example, sells gift cards for major retailers at a discount. Plus, you can buy wine for holiday gatherings in bulk, which comes with its own savings. Related: 35 Best Deals at Costco 29. Don’t Ignore the Dollar Store If you want to know how to save money for the holidays, look no further than your local dollar store. You can save a lot by purchasing certain holiday items at discount stores, such as Dollar Tree. Rather than spend several dollars on a roll of gift wrap or a gift bag, you can get both of these items for just a buck. You also can find ornaments, decorations, candles, stocking stuffers, Christmas cards, paper plates and napkins for just $1. 30. Don’t Wait Until the Last Minute Waiting until the last minute to do holiday shopping can be a huge mistake. “If you wait until December, you may not find what you're looking for and end up spending more on an alternative gift,” said Barry Choi, personal finance expert at MoneyWeHave.com. 31. Opt for Low-Cost Gifts You don’t have to spend a lot to give a memorable gift. Susan Kessler of TheFrugalDiva.com recommended giving magazine subscriptions. “Every month, they remember what a considerate person you are,” she said. And you can find annual subscriptions for a variety of magazines for just $5 on Amazon. You can also turn a holiday gift set that features several items into multiple gifts for coworkers and neighbors. Woroch said you can buy a big box of chocolates from a warehouse club and then divvy up the chocolates into cellophane bags with bows. You can also make homemade jams. “This allows you to get more mileage from your gift shopping,” she said. 32. Focus on Meaningful Gifts Rather than spend money on presents, show friends and family how much you care by giving them your time, personal attention and affection, said Campbell. “That could mean anything from quality time with loved ones, babysitting or an hour volunteering your gifts and talents to help others,” she said. 33. Make Your Own Ornaments Cut the cost of decorations for your Christmas tree by making your own ornaments. You can pick up a bunch of inexpensive supplies from craft stores and even host a party with friends to make it fun, Woroch said. If you have kids, get them involved and start a holiday tradition. 34. Save on Meals Out You might find yourself picking up more meals on the go during the busy holiday season — or dining out with friends to celebrate. You can keep the cost of restaurant meals under control by buying discounted restaurant gift certificates at Restaurant.com. Or look for discounted restaurant gift cards on GiftCardGranny.com. 35. Host Holiday Potlucks Rather than provide all the food for holiday gatherings you host, ask friends and family to bring their favorite dishes, desserts or beverages to share. Not only will this help you save money, it can make the event less stressful for you. 36. Invest in LED Bulbs "Lighting accounts for a significant portion of electricity usage, and LED bulbs are up to 10 times more efficient and last up to 50 times as long as compared to incandescent bulbs," said Alex Goldstein of Eligo Energy. So while decorative lights might be the highlight of your holiday decor, don't let them sap your monthly budget. Invest in LED bulbs that will last you for years to come. 37. Ask for Money-Saving Gifts If you're expecting gifts from others this year, consider asking for presents that will help you save money over time. Goldstein recommended the Nest Thermostat, a self-programming thermostat, and a programmable sprinkler system that can help you cut back on water costs throughout the year. Even a simple gas gift card can help you save. 38. Give the Gift of Volunteer Work Save money by spending less on gifts and giving more of your time to help others by volunteering during the holidays, said Steve Repak, author of "6 Week Money Challenge." Get friends and family to agree to donate some of their time to a soup kitchen, homeless shelter or charity of their choice rather than exchanging gifts, Repak said. “This is a great way for everyone, especially kids and teenagers, to feel in the spirit of the holidays,” he said. 39. Institute a No-Gift Christmas Christenson said he once tried to orchestrate a no-gift Christmas with his family. “Instead of gifts, I suggested we do something together as family, like go to a nice restaurant, a movie or some other memorable event,” he said. “The holidays are normally a stressful and expensive time, so this would reduce that stress and save some money. You might even create a new family tradition that could last for years," he said. 40. Celebrate Christmas After Christmas "I know this is holiday heresy because everybody wants to go home for the holidays. However, you can save a lot of hassle, stress and money by simply delaying your visit until January," said Greg Geronemus, a travel expert and co-CEO of smarTours.com. "The prices will be far better, much lower, there will be less hassle and chaos at the airports and train stations, and certainly less stress," he said. You can also choose to delay exchanging gifts, allowing you to take advantage of after-Christmas sales.

It has also forced digital pioneers such as Amazon to set up a physical space for their customers – proving yet again that as customers evolve, so must retailers. For both customers and retailers, this is a time of discovery and disruption. Retailers need to rethink their business model, especially with a growing generation of digital native customers, pressures to enhance efficiency and processes, and the need to find new sources of revenue. Understanding the new reality of retail in the GCC After a period of rapid growth for years, with the region successfully positioned as a leading international retail destination, there has been some expected slowing of momentum recently. According to Kantar Retail, the Middle East retail market is expected to grow at 7.7 per cent CAGR between 2015 and 2020, down from 9.8 per cent CAGR between 2010 and 2015. Keeping this in mind, the GCC retail sector needs to think through its digital strategy, assess short- and long-term opportunities, prioritize, prepare for challenges and regulations, and tailor plans to region-specific demands.  The GCC population is remarkable in the fact that a large percentage of the population is under the age of 25, making it even more imperative for retailers to have a strategy in place to cater to a generation of digital natives. According to Alpen Capital, the GCC population is projected to reach close to 60 million in 2020, of which, the number of people below 25 years of age is likely to surpass 22 million.1 But before we think digital, it is important to also understand the changing role of brick and mortar. Today, instead of just a store to grow sales, the physical space is an experience zone for customers, to establish long-term relationships and turn customers into brand loyalists. A case in point is the Apple Store in the Mall of the Emirates, which allows an immersive experience where customers browse, lounge and leave with hopefully a better understanding of the technology that the brand offers instead of feeling pressured to buy a product. So the retail space has evolved into a marketing tool, demand generator, and brand differentiator2. Getting phygital This shifting role applies across all touch points in the customer cycle – be it pre and post sales, and more and more seamlessly across physical and digital sales platforms, or what are collectively becoming known as phygital platforms. This is where digitization can play a crucial role to enhance the customer experience and where associated advanced data analytics can draw beneficial marketing and service insights from the massive amounts of customer data being generated. All of this can then be used to provide a 360-degree personalized view of the customer for advancing more intelligent and enhanced customer experiences, and for also identifying new customer bases with similar interests. Aggregated data provides insights into customer behavior and preferences, thereby enabling more targeted marketing options for retailers. Innovation in the retail space through digital strategies can be lateral or vertical. Lateral involves leveraging existing product lines that can be made into regular or repetitive revenue streams, such as groceries packaging and delivery. Vertical innovation is through offering new product lines that didn’t exist before, based on analyzing customer behavior data, both online and in-store, such as customized 3-D printed objects. Customers are ultimately best placed to benefit from digitization. Besides being offered a variety of options so far unavailable, all at the click of a button, they are also being empowered to make the right choice with easily accessible knowledge and the support of a community of informed peers on social media – a collective digitally-enabled market-backed selection process. Facing fears As digital strategies change the sector, it is important for retailers to prepare for some of the expected challenges. For example, today automation allows for the tracking of products through the delivery process: from manufacturing to shipping and delivery. Automation enables process efficiencies and optimization, and eliminates redundancies. This will lead to a redistribution of jobs, and some traditional functions will need to be repurposed. There is an understandable fear that digitization and automation may threaten jobs. Smart change management is key towards addressing this fear, to gain large-scale support for digitization in the retail sector. It is important to understand that instead of creating redundancies, digitization and automation enable a redistribution of functions and the acquisition or preferably development of new skills as the job roles become more sophisticated. Security is another challenge. It is important to understand that maintaining security is a continuous process. Cybersecurity is a shifting target and includes comprehensive phygital security planning, as the physical and digital enablers tend to increasingly overlap, for example smart HVAC or security systems in malls and their interdependent technology platforms. Another concern is maintaining data privacy. One solution is to anonymize information by stripping off personal details, so that insights from the customer data can be utilized while addressing privacy concerns. Regionally, governments have also sought to drive a number of recent regulations towards enabling greater understanding and inviting more participation among governments and citizens when it comes to data exchange. For example, the Dubai Data Law introduced in 2016, requires both individuals and organizations – public and private – to make their data available, in an anonymous manner, either for free or in exchange for data from other providers. The aim of such initiatives is to have a broad base of customer acceptance so that retailers are able to utilize anonymous data to enhance the customer experience. What’s next? Robotics is a field of much interest and has already started impacting the retail sector. From manufacturing to logistics, the unmanned world will become the norm in the not-so-distant future. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are helping to improve customer experience and are here to stay, a case in point being Marks & Spencer’s Middle East stores, which have launched the Virtual Closet, using augmented reality for customers to try on outfits and accessories. 3D printing is also revolutionizing the retail sector – with industry analysts Gartner predicting at least seven of the top 10 retailers in the world using 3D printing. Spend on 3D printing in MEA is expected to increase from $0.47 billion in 2015 to $1.3 billion by 2019, according to IDC. Regional governments are also preparing for the increasing role of this technology across sectors. For example, the world’s first 3D printed office building opened in Dubai recently, and the Dubai 3D Printing Strategy aims to make the city a global 3D hub by 2030. Higher integration of Machine to Machine (M2M) technology in retail is also expected to enhance the customer experience, whether through m-payment trends or location-based targeted marketing. The connected world is becoming a goldmine of new ideas that can bring benefits to both customers and retailers. Change is always disruptive and digitization in retail will be no exception. What is important is to not rush into it in panic, but instead to systematically plan for how it will drive enhanced customer experience, operational efficiency, transparency, profitability, and new revenue models.

FRONT PAGE FLORIDA OCEAN SPACE CRIME POLITICS WEATHER Saturday, October 29, 2016 Walmart To Start 2016 Black Friday Deals Early Walmart announced plans to launch holiday shopping deals and sales during the entire months of November and December in 2016. Like many other retailers, Walmart is not waiting until Black Friday to offer substantial holiday discounts this year. To kick off the season, the retail giant has launched thousands of new rollbacks combined with tens of thousands of items available at low prices every day. For example, Walmart will offer a new Roku 32-inch HDTV for $125 in November and December, which is the same price as the retailer’s Black Friday offer last year. “I can’t remember another year when I’ve been this excited about the merchandise we are offering customers,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. “It’s not just about one category or one item. Our whole store is going to be stocked with new, exciting items from hot toys to new electronics available at the best prices. We will win the season on price, from the first weekend in November to Black Friday and Cyber Monday and through those final weeks in December.” From an exclusive Disney Princess Carriage and a 3D Virtual Reality Drone to ugly Christmas sweaters, Walmart is stocking its shelves with the items it believes customers will be looking for this holiday season. Walmart To Reduce Line Wait Times With Pickup Service, Holiday Helpers For the first time, Walmart is deploying an army of 'Holiday Helpers' to better serve customers in the checkout line.  The retailer has also dramatically increased the amount of products available through its Pickup service, launched thousands of rollbacks along with other great prices available every day, and will add millions of items to Walmart.com in the coming months. “We are listening to our customers and looking for ways to simplify their busy lives,” said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer, Walmart U.S. “Whether our customers are checking items off their grocery lists or their kids’ holiday lists, we want to make their shopping experiences easy and fun. This includes having clean, fast and friendly stores, an easier check out experience and enabling customers to shop seamlessly through services like Pickup.” Walmart Expands Online Holiday Shopping Inventory Walmart has substantially grown its online assortment from roughly 8 million at the start of this year to 20 million today with millions of additional items scheduled to be added in the coming months. The retailer is also making its broader assortment easier to shop. Starting Nov. 1, Walmart.com will feature a top 20 list of items to help customers discover exclusive offerings, great prices and products they wouldn’t expect to find at Walmart.

Here are two that aren't good ideas and one that is. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Oct 29, 2016 at 8:45AM Image source: Getty Images. With the unrelenting rise of e-commerce putting an increasing amount of pressure on traditional retailers, there are plenty of retail stocks that are best avoided. Some are obvious: Sears is a trainwreck no matter how you slice it. There are some retail stocks that appear to be solid investments on the surface but ultimately come with major downsides. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) are two prime examples. On the flip side, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) doesn't get the credit it deserves. The company may be the quintessential brick-and-mortar retailer, but it's been making some aggressive moves to better compete in a world where e-commerce can no longer be ignored. Why you should avoid Costco stock Costco is a great company, but even the best company bought at too high of a price can make for a lousy investment. The numbers speak for themselves: Costco earned $5.33 per share in fiscal 2016, putting the price-to-earnings ratio at a stratospheric 28. Growth is consistent but slow, with analysts expecting mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and next. Image source: Costco. Costco stock certainly deserves a premium based on the quality of the company, but I think we've reached the point where that premium is excessive. This doesn't mean that the stock price is going to collapse, but I suspect that returns from here will be depressed. Costco stock soared 81% over the past five years. Given the current valuation, I suspect that the next five years won't be nearly as impressive. Beyond valuation, Costco has been extremely slow to embrace e-commerce. This hasn't been much of a problem thus far, as the warehouse club model protects the company to a degree from online retailers. But Costco is going to eventually need to embrace e-commerce and make it work with its fleet of stores. Combine this long-term uncertainty around e-commerce with an inflated valuation and you get a retail stock that doesn't look like a great investment. Why you should avoid GameStop stock GameStop stock looks incredible cheap, trading for a single-digit multiple of earnings. The company has been diversifying beyond selling physical games, opening and acquiring stores that sell used electronics and mobile devices and increasing its focus on selling digital games. Diversification is a fine strategy, and it's the right move for the company. But there's a time bomb built into GameStop's business model that makes it a stock to avoid. Image source: GameStop. GameStop makes a killing from buying and selling used games. In fiscal 2015, pre-owned video game products accounted for 38% of the company's gross profit and carried a gross margin of nearly 47%, nearly twice the gross margin of new video game products. Used games are a cash cow for the company. Unfortunately for GameStop, the age of physical disks will eventually come to an end when game consoles inevitably go all digital. When that happens, the new game business will disappear, and the used-game business, while likely lingering due to previous-generation games, will quickly become far less lucrative for the company. GameStop is going to look a lot different 10 years from now, or even five years from now, compared to today. A bargain valuation doesn't mean much if the main drivers of earnings are likely to disappear. It's impossible to predict how profitable the GameStop of the future will be, and that's a good reason to sit this one out. Why Wal-Mart is a stock to buy Wal-Mart's earnings are currently depressed thanks to the company's various initiatives, including wage hikes, increased employee training, and e-commerce. Wal-Mart expects to produce adjusted earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.35 in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, down from $4.59 in fiscal 2016. Image source: Wal-Mart. The investments that Wal-Mart is making, though, are important. First, the company is trying to improve the customer experience in its stores, raising wages, bringing back greeters, and making it easier for employees to climb the ladder into management positions. The results so far have been encouraging, with U.S. comparable sales consistently growing and customer satisfaction on the rise. On the e-commerce front, Wal-Mart is going big. The company recently acquired Jet.com for over $3 billion, giving it a brand that could help the company appeal to younger customers. Online grocery pickup is a major initiative, allowing customers to order groceries online and have them carried out to their car for no extra charge. And ShippingPass, the $49 annual membership that provides free two-day shipping, is an effort to compete head-on with Amazon Prime. Retailers that fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences are going to be left behind. Wal-Mart is taking aggressive steps to ensure that it can continue to thrive in a world where e-commerce is becoming increasingly important. With the stock trading for around 16 times earnings guidance, Wal-Mart looks like a solid long-term investment. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Police said a deputy noticed a suspicious vehicle about 9:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 28, parked in the Walmart lot at 3999 Alpine Ave. NW. The deputy witnessed people in the car using marijuana. The deputy had a front seat passenger outside of the vehicle when that person elbowed the officer's face, police said. The person then resisted arrest and the deputy saw the person reach toward his waistband. The deputy also felt what seemed to be a handgun. Police said the deputy was able to remove the handgun from the person and distance himself. Soon after, the person was handcuffed and arrested. During the struggle, however, two others inside the vehicle fled the scene. Police called in a tracking dog but could not locate the other persons. The individual with the gun, a .380-caliber loaded semi-automatic handgun, was arrested on multiple charges.

(Ryan Stelting) Related Stories Unanswered questions about mysterious illness leading to British Airways emergency landing Walmart vows change amid concerns over food waste Here's how much food Walmart throws away over 12 days No replacement named for vacant child representative position Province's watchdog for children says government 'retaliated' against her Emotional ceremony marks anniversary of Tofino whale-watching tragedy One year after whale boat sinking, pain from Tofino tragedy remains Each week we put together a list of some of the stories you might have missed: those which dominated the news agenda, and some we just can't resist retelling. There are so many aspects of a potential aviation disaster that can strike fear deep down in our souls.  Commercial flights have long been proven to be one of the safest modes of travel, but incidents like the British Airways diversion this week have a way of confirming our worst fears.  Perhaps that's why our story of the flight being diverted to Vancouver on Monday, Oct. 24 while en route from San Francisco to London was by far our top story this week.  Many questions remain about what happened on the flight, but do read this great synopsis from our reporter Lisa Johnson about what we know and what we don't.  Crew aboard a British airways flight diverted to Vancouver this week were taken to hospital. The airline has yet to answer any questions as to why. (Ryan Stelting) Our other top story this week came from a former Walmart employee in the Vancouver area sharing his concerns about the "heartbreaking" amount of food dumped in the trash at the big retailer.  Daniel Schoeler says on every shift at almost every store, he saw loads of what appeared to be perfectly good food dumped in the trash, even though Walmart says it only discards inedible food.   The story, investigated by our Go Public and Marketplace teams, prompted Walmart to make a vow to change amid concerns over food waste. Daniel Schoeler says Walmart workers tossed what appeared to be perfectly good food into trash compactors on almost every shift he worked. (Erica Johnson/CBC) One of our stories this week, which is well worth a read if you missed it, was about the B.C.'s Representative for Children and Youth claiming the provincial government retaliated against her.  Many who have been affected by Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond's work say she is deeply respected for what she has done over the last 10 years as the province's first, and so far only, Representative for Children and Youth. As our reporter Richard Zussman summed up nicely last weekend, Turpel-Lafond has often had a tumultuous relationship with the province and leaves behind a complicated legacy.  It remains to be seen what the provincial government plans to do in her wake — no replacement has been announced yet.  Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond makes her final presentation as representative for children and youth to the Select Standing Committee on Children and Youth on Oct. 24, 2016. (Mike McArthur/CBC News) Lastly, if you haven't yet, do take time to read this story from our reporter Megan Thomas about the one-year anniversary of the Tofino whale-watching tragedy.  People travelled from as far as Australia to take part in the ceremony to honour the six people who died in the tragedy. But they were also there to celebrate those who survived, and the people who came to their rescue.  The bow of the Leviathan II, a whale-watching boat owned by Jamie's Whaling Station carrying 24 passengers and three crew members that capsized on Sunday, is seen near Vargas Island as it waits to be towed into Tofino, B.C., Tuesday, October 27, 2015 for inspection.

Subject (Source: Greer Police Dept.) Subject (Source: Greer Police Dept.) GREER, SC (FOX Carolina) - The Greer Police Department is seeking assistance in identifying subjects accused in scams at Walmart and a Dollar General store on Wade Hampton Boulevard. Officers reported that on Oct. 18 around 1 p.m., the individuals approached a 87-year-old man who was browsing inside of the Greer Walmart. Officers said the subjects convinced the victim that if he were to provide them with $3,000 for a processing fee, they would split $60,000 with him. Officers said that the victim agreed to the transaction. Authorities said the victim withdrew $3,000 from his account and after obtaining the check and drove with the female subject in order for the check to be cashed. Police said that the cash was provided to the subject but the subject failed to provide the sum of money to the victim. Police have also linked the suspects to two earlier incidents. On Jan. 14, 2016, police said the same male suspect and a yet unidentified approached an 87-year-old woman in the parking lot of the Dollar General at 805 W Wade Hampton Blvd. Police said the duo convinced her that they had found a bag in the parking lot that was filled with money. “The female subject told the victim that she would speak with her manager at Belk, fill out paperwork concerning the money and that they would need a processing fee but would in turn split the findings with her,” Greer police spokesman Lt. Jim Holcombe said. “The victim provided the subjects with $600, which the subjects took and fled.” A similar incident happened in May 2016 when the man and woman approached an 86-year-old woman in the Walmart parking. The duo convinced the woman they had found money found in a wallet and could split it between the three of them paid the victim paid “taxes” on the money found to the business. Holcombe said the victim got $449 out of her purse, which the suspects took and fled “The male subject in this case went by the name Mr. Jenkins and was driving a white Lincoln Navigator,” Holcombe said.

(WDRB) -- Walmart has backed out of plans to build a supercenter at 18th Street and Broadway in west Louisville. Walmart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said the company has decided not to pursue developing the store "after much deliberation and consideration of various business factors and extensive delays to the project." Announced in March 2014, the store had been touted as a boost for economic development in west Louisville, though its suburban-style layout also sparked a lawsuit. Steve Porter, the attorney who filed the suit against Walmart, says one of the main points of the lawsuit was the proposed design and how the parking lot was positioned.  "There was never any push from the city administration to help reach a a compromise," he said.  Porter said that his side had agreed on a deal earlier this year with the land developer, Teresa Bridgewater of New Bridge Development. He added that the lawsuit would be pulled as long as New Bridge Development built other businesses around the Walmart.   Walmart's announced pull-out Friday comes despite subsidies the city had committed for the development -- deals it normally would not offer for a big-box store. Metro government contributed $1.8 million to the property's developer to assemble land and offered Walmart a $500,000 "grant" for building the store. Earlier this month, Walmart said it would open only about half as many supercenters next year as it did last fiscal year, allowing more investments in e-commerce, technology and customer service, according to the Wall Street Journal. "Our project at 18th and Broadway was a casualty of their changing business strategy," Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a press conference Friday. "It is a testament to some people's insistence that progress must only be made on their terms, even if it is a small group of citizens."

I’m referring to your article about Walmart now charging customers five cents each for plastic shopping bags. Walmart says it’s doing it to save the environment. Give me a break. They’re simply the king of nickel and diming (ask any of their suppliers) and are passing yet another cost of doing business on to the customer. If they really cared about the environment, they would ask, or tell, their suppliers to back off the overabundance of plastic packaging on the merchandise. I think what bothers me most about the article, as it’s just another example of Islander apathy. Look at all the dirty deeds going on behind the Liberal government doors and a recent poll shows Islanders falling all over themselves saying they would re-elect this bunch tomorrow.

City Transportation Department Director Fabrizia Rodriguez has developed two fixed routes, named "purple" and "gold," with 22 bus stops overall between the two loops. Each route would have a total of 15 stops before going back to its first stop, with the approximate maximum wait for a bus stop on the "purple" route at 15 minutes and the "gold" route at 20 minutes. Rodriguez is planning to implement the new system on Dec. 1, with the standard fare remaining unchanged at $2. Riders will also begin to utilize the ropes inside buses, which they will pull on to signal they want to get off at the next bus stop, according to Rodriguez. She said this would help bus runs operate more efficiently and avoid unnecessary stops. "If nobody needs to stop at the next stop and the driver is approaching the next stop and he doesn't see anybody standing at the corner waiting for a bus, he's going to keep on going," Rodriguez said. The proposed gold route stops in order from first to last include the Riverfront Center, Stewart's Shop on East Main Street, Creative Connections Clubhouse, Church and Willow streets, Virginia Lane, Woodrow Road and Clizbe Avenue, Isabel's Field, Target at Amsterdam Commons, behind Wal-Mart along Tessiero Square, St. Mary's Amsterdam Memorial building off Route 30, Northampton Road and Guy Park Avenue, Henrietta Street and Guy Park Avenue, St. Mary's Hospital, Amsterdam Amtrak Station and Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook. The proposed purple route stops include Rite Aid, Walgreens, behind Wal-Mart along Tessiero Square, Isabel's Field, Emerald Cinemas, St. Mary's Amsterdam Memorial building, Lincoln Avenue and Market Street, Montgomery County Office for Aging office, Northampton Road and Guy Park Avenue, Henrietta Street and Guy Park Avenue, St. Mary's Hospital, Amsterdam Housing Authority, Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook and the Riverfront Center. The proposed purple route is planned to operate on Saturday, so people can travel to the commercial corridor along Route 30. There were 25 bus stop signs purchased in 2010, but never installed. Rodriguez said she is planning to install the signs after implementing the new route style system. She said the current bus system acts more like a taxi service, which she believes is not the most efficient method to operate the transportation service. If someone wants to utilize the bus service now, they must call the dispatcher at the transportation office and request to be picked up. The bus will only pick people up within the city limits and travel within the city limits or just outside the limits along the Route 30 corridor. There are some runs in the morning traveling to certain major employers in the area, along with a bus run to Albany. After a person requests a pick-up, they are given an approximate time the bus will arrive at their location to pick them up. There are two buses operating in different zones within the city, but depending on where the rider wants to travel the bus could end up driving outside of its zone. Generally, there is a bus covering east to west along Route 5 and another bus covering north to south along Route 30. The bus drivers at the beginning of their shift are given a list of pre-scheduled pick ups, with some riders calling on a weekly basis to schedule their appointments to be picked up. There are around 15 regular riders daily taking a bus to work and around another 20 riders daily traveling for healthcare services. Then riders will call in throughout the day to schedule a pick up. The current system does not have any designated bus stops, but there is a bus run to Fonda where riders would be picked up at Stewart's stores, according to Rodriguez. This run is planned to be terminated under the new route system. "We had three riders last month take that bus and we send it three days a week," Rodriguez said. Mayor Michael Villa hired Rodriguez as the director of the transportation department about a month ago after Cheryl Scott retired from the position this past summer. The position was also changed from full to part time, with Amsterdam officials amending the city charter to allow for it. Villa had worked with the former transportation director to craft more of a loop style service, with the proposal unveiled in April. The new system had been in the process of being implemented before Scott retired, but then was stalled until Rodriguez was hired. Rodriguez then made some additional tweaks to what had been in development prior to her joining the department. There is currently an Albany commuter route from Amsterdam to the Department of Transportation and state campus offices, but Rodriguez is planning to have that bus make a couple new stops in Schenectady. She is looking for one stop to be at the Rivers Casino and Resort, which is still being constructed. First Ward Alderman Edward Russo said the additional stops in Schenectady could help the department generate more revenue. "Now with the casino coming in Schenectady that might be something that can bring in some revenue," Russo said. She is also looking to add routes to the Target Distribution Center, Beech-Nut and Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook pedestrian bridge. Adding four to five more routes directly to major employers she said would allow the department to qualify for a minimum $50,000 stipend in addition to what the state already provides the city. Rodriguez has also begun conversations about cost sharing through partnerships with major employers and the Greater Amsterdam School District. This would allow for an organization to purchase a large quantity of vouchers at a discounted price, which would then be provided to employees or parents and students. She said the cost sharing partnerships could help offset the cost of the service for riders. Her first day on the job, Rodriguez said she followed up with grant funds previously awarded and approved by prior city council members. There were funds awarded to replace an aging bus for $131,000, install video cameras and a GPS surveillance system in buses for $35,000, purchase around $16,5000 of equipment for bus mechanics, and purchase new two-way radios for $10,000. The grant funding was awarded through the federal Department of Transportation and the overall costs for the purchases would require the city to cover 10 percent of the expense, with 80 percent coming through federal funds and 10 percent through state funds. Rodriguez said she plans to periodically audit the video footage from buses and footage could also be reviewed if there were any issues or complaints reported. While resolutions were approved by a prior administration for the various expenditures, there were never bids sought to purchase equipment, according to Rodriguez. Russo said city officials had not followed through with grant funding because there had been uncertainty over the future of the department and whether the city would continue to operate the service in-house. "The biggest thing was we weren't really sure what we were going to do with transportation, whether we were going to keep it," Russo said. "The money is still there and we need to go forward with it and see what happens." There was also $26,000 of capital funding allocated for the transportation department, split evenly between last fiscal year and this fiscal year, which Rodriguez has proposed to use towards purchasing some shelters and benches for riders waiting at bus stops. She said there are not shelters in place to date. The new benches and shelters would also have space to accommodate advertising. Rodriguez is also in the process of trying to attract advertisers for space inside of buses and on the benches and shelters proposed to be purchased. "All of those sponsors for ads kind of just fell through because of all the commotion about whether or not we were going to close," Rodriguez said. "That's something I want to make sure everybody who used to help sponsor ads understands that we're not going away. The council and leadership we have now are definitely trying to make improvements to keep it going and provide more services." Russo agreed the uncertainty over the department had affected the city's ability to attract advertisers. The department had been projected to operate at a $140,000 revenue shortfall this year, which would be a slight reduction from last year at a $150,000. The deficit for the department in 2014 was about $350,000. Rodriguez said she is confident the change in routes to designated bus stops would help riders better understand what services are available and increase ridership, which would boost revenues for the department. "The clarity of the bus stops, where we go and how much we charge is just going to increase ridership," Rodriguez said. "I think it's really going to increase the ridership so much that the amount of fares we have will drastically improve. At the same time business are going to see more riders on ... and they're going to want to advertise with us more."       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/15/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Thursday, November 10, 2016 Election results in Montgomery County update 3 Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Republicans take Legislature Wednesday, November 09, 2016 State news in brief Friday, November 11, 2016 WWII vet shares memories Friday, November 11, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Wednesday, November 09, 2016 3 arrested for prostitution in Amsterdam Monday, November 14, 2016 Deborah L.

Murray Illustration Marc Nipp When I ask retail CEOs what differentiates their stores from the competition, they inevitably talk about customer service and the in-store experience. Yet, when I speak to consumers about their shopping experiences, I commonly hear about disinterested employees, out-of-stock products, awkward return processes, restocking fees, messy shelves and a general struggle to find the products that they want. Clearly, there is a gap between what retailers would like to offer to every customer every day and what they are actually able to provide. That is probably not surprising. If you are Walmart or Starbucks or Zara, you have tens of thousands of employees working in thousands of stores, serving millions of customers, all around the world. Canadian retail giants from Loblaws to Indigo Books to Canadian Tire face a similar problem of scale and scope. The advantage of being big can easily become a liability. Ensuring that every employee in each of those stores is passionate about customer service and the products they sell may be an impossible task. At the same time, corporate giants are under constant pressure to grow their revenue and increase their profitability, which is not always consistent with a good customer experience. As a result, small independent retailers have a tremendous opportunity to succeed in today’s marketplace. The path to success, however, is not what it used to be. Small companies will struggle to compete based on store locations, selection of national brands and product pricing. The big guys have many stores and tremendous power in the supply chain to negotiate and push down prices. Instead, small retailers have an advantage in their ability to deliver personal service, curate unique proprietary products and, increasingly, custom build products. A few successful small retailers have been following this approach for years. For more than 40 years, Calgary’s Owl’s Nest Books, for example, has built its business and reputation on personalized reading recommendations. The employees at Owl’s Nest are passionate about what they do and genuinely interested in their products and their customers. More recently, we have seen Albertan entrepreneurs – like Rocky Mountain Soap Company and Lux Beauty Boutique – leverage small product selections and exceptional service to crack the ultra-competitive cosmetics market. Others have contributed to the growth and expansion of new markets, such as Carbon Environmental Boutique in Edmonton and Reworks in Calgary. I have been especially impressed with small retailers that are taking a chance and bringing their own unique tastes to market. The Uncommons in Calgary is known for sourcing innovative products directly from designers. In Edmonton, The Prints and The Paper recently opened on 124 Street and brings a carefully selected assortment of products that wouldn’t look out of place in the trendiest shops in New York or London. These small companies, and many others, are leading the evolution of independent retail in Alberta. They are not trying to undercut Walmart’s prices, offer Zara’s product selection or be more convenient than Starbucks. Instead, they are passionately serving a segment of customers that they understand with a level of service and a carefully selected assortment of products that larger chains cannot match. While that evolution continues, other small businesses are leveraging technology to revolutionize traditional retail markets. Edmonton’s Poppy Barley has been celebrated for their custom-made footwear with an international reputation for innovation and quality. Less well known, but potentially more revolutionary, is Suits by Curtis Eliot, also based in Edmonton. This fast-growing company is an exciting combination of old-world tailoring and modern tech company that designs and fits suits to its individual customer’s tastes and style. The service is one-on-one, the product is custom built and the quality is world class. They don’t have the flashy locations many of their competitors pay top dollar to maintain, nor do they tie up capital in inventory that may or may not sell. Instead, they focus on a personalized customer experience and a sophisticated supply chain that connects raw materials to the craftspeople that build the final product. As large retailers struggle to evolve their own businesses to give customers a reason to come into the store rather than buying online, many small retailers are leading the way with truly exceptional shopping experiences. Ultimately, customers will vote with their wallets, but this approach to small retail presents a substantial challenge to big retailers. It is not, however, a guarantee of success. Starting a small business and keeping it afloat is as tough as it has ever been. Yet, because consumers are becoming more diverse and more demanding, new opportunities are opening up to meet their needs with superior service and a unique selection of products. In many ways, there has never been a more exciting and promising time to open your own store.

During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000. She was also on the corporate board of Wal-Mart, Lafarge and TCBY (The Country’s Best Yoghurt) – all Arkansas-based companies and clients of Rose Law where Hillary was a partner.   Controversies began with her involvement in Whitewater Development Corp.  When the scandal broke out during the presidential campaign in 1992 and she was subpoenaed to produce her legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.  Two years later, they were found in the First Lady’s Book Room.    Hillary does hold many ‘firsts’ as First Lady, including the first First Lady to be subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury.  However, it all simmered down to "insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing".  Another scandal that surfaced at this time was the Gennifer Flowers affair and Hillary’s "Stand By Your Man" reference.  The Monica Lewinski scandal generated more publicity however.  Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and this was overturned by the Senate.  Scandal seemed to follow her on a regular basis.  In 1993, it was Travelgate – financial irregularities in White House Travel Office operations.  The Teflon coating resulted in a report that she "made ‘factually false’ statements but insufficient evidence that she knew these statements were false".  In July that year, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster reportedly committed suicide.  Allegations were made that Hillary/Bill ordered the removal of potentially damaging files relating to Whitewater and others.  In March 1994, newspapers revealed spectacular profits from her 1978/79 cattle trading futures.  No formal investigation or charges followed.  In June 1996 and it was Filegate – improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on Republican White House employees.  This fizzled out as there was "no substantial or credible evidence".  After they left the White House, there were reports that gifts made to the White House were shipped to their residence.   When pressure mounted, they returned $134,000 worth of such gifts. After 9/11, she strongly supported military action in Afghanistan.  In October 2002, she voted in favour of George Bush’s Iraq War Resolution.  By 2014/15, she fully reversed herself saying she had "got it wrong" and her vote on the resolution was a "mistake".  Her campaign for re-election to the Senate from New York spent some $ 35 million – more than any other candidate for 2006 Senate elections.  Her campaign for 2008 Democratic nominee for the presidential race was a neck and neck battle with Obama for funds and votes, until she and Bill made remarks about Martin Luther King and Lyndon B Johnson that were perceived by many to be racially oriented.  Democratic voters became polarized and Obama took South Carolina with a 2 to 1 majority, or what we locally refer to a two-thirds majority.  The rest is history. There is no denying that Hillary Clinton worked hard during her tenure in the Senate and as Secretary of State, especially to promote and protect women’s and children’s rights and welfare.  After 9/11, as Senator for New York, she was instrumental in getting $21 billion funding for the World Trade Center’s redevelopment.  In an address to the UN Human Rights Council in December 2011, Hillary claimed that "Gay Rights are Human Rights".  In September 1995, she made a speech at the Fourth World conference on Women in Bejing, stating "It is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights".  Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say, "if there is one message that echoes from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights once and for all".  She also presented Russian (interim) President Medvedev with the ‘Reset Button’ although relations worsened when Putin returned to the presidency.  Then again there is the ‘Arab Spring’ where she controversially supporting some regimes and propped up protesters in other instances.  Egypt overthrew Hosni Mubarak;  Libya ended up as a failed state and Syria is still in turmoil.  Iraq was an inherited legacy and the pull out of US troops created a vacuum that IS filled.  The attack on the US Embassy in Benghazi (Libya) that resulted in the death of the US Ambassador and three others still haunts her.  Donald Trump’s ‘hot topic’ with Hillary is the 33,000 e-mails.  This controversy arose in March 2015 when it was revealed that Hillary maintained private e-mail accounts from a non-government private server instead of using the government services while serving as Secretary of State.  After much hue and cry the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that "no charges are appropriate in this case" and the Attorney General declares that the "case will be closed without criminal charges".  Between 2007 and 2014, the Clintons earned almost $141 million on speaking and other engagements, mostly with Wall Street firms and business conventions.  Several organizations have tried to measure Hillary’s political spectrum analytically.  Some rate her as "one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate".  Her economic policy is ‘inclusive capitalism’ as against Trump’s ‘trickle down economics’.  If you’re going for the ‘establishment’, or the known devil, vote for Hillary.  My sister and many of my friends in the US won’t.  That’s democracy – or a demonstration or craziness in politics.  Coming up next – TRUMPETING DONALD    Hits: 584     Send to Friend               Breaking News Await Breaking News Last Updated Nov 14 2016 | 10:17 pm ...   Featured News Amaradeva - the immortal musical... 2016-11-14 Read More   Rangana Herath – another... 2016-11-14 Read More   Support of people cannot be taken... 2016-11-14 Read More         ARCHIVES RELATED LINKS Tuesday, 15th November 2016 [Current Issue] Monday, 14th November 2016 Sunday, 13th November 2016 Saturday, 12th November 2016 Friday, 11th November 2016 Thursday, 10th November 2016 More Archives World Clock Currency Rates Weather     UPALI NEWSPAPERS (PVT) LTD Copyright © Upali Newspapers (Pvt) Ltd.

(Jeff Siner | The Charlotte Observer) CHARLOTTE, NC (WBTV) - If Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump carries North Carolina in what could be a squeaker, it’ll be because of people like Gary Dillon. A 54-year-old operator at a chemical company, Dillon says he hasn’t voted “in a long time.” But this year, he’s eager to go to the polls to try to send businessman Trump to the White House. “He’s not a politician, so maybe he can get something done. Like bring jobs back. American jobs,” Dillon says as he fills up his Ford pickup at the A&L Mini Mart. “I grew up in textiles and I hated to see them go in the ’90s. We need to get the economy back.” Dillon’s anxiety about the loss of factory jobs in small-town North Carolina – and his hope that Trump can reverse that decades-old trend – was echoed again and again last week in this Rowan County town 40 miles northeast of Charlotte. Other people interviewed in Faith also seconded Dillon’s low opinion of Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Prior to Friday’s announcement that the FBI would review newly discovered emails in the Clinton server investigation, Dillon called her a politician who “keeps getting away with lies.” In the battle for North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes, the Trump campaign is counting on places like Faith, home to 815 people, three churches, a soda shop on Main Street and a July 4 celebration that goes on for five days and attracts more than 40,000 people. The town, which stretches 1 square mile, is also predominantly white – more than 95 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. During the town’s annual July 4 parade, which mostly salutes patriotism and the American flag, some have hoisted Confederate flags to honor what they call their Southern heritage. The Trump-Clinton race in North Carolina may be the fiercest and closest in the country. A new Public Policy Polling survey commissioned by the Observer found that, just over a week before Election Day, the two candidates are virtually tied in the state, with Clinton getting 46 percent of the vote and Trump 44 percent – a gap well within the margin of error. What makes North Carolina so key is that Trump likely can’t get to 270 electoral voters without it. No Republican has won the White House without the state in his column in 60 years. Both sides know the stakes, so there have been frequent visits to North Carolina by Trump and Clinton as well as their running mates and surrogate campaigners. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence was in Smithfield on Friday and in Jacksonville on Saturday. All the key Democrats are scheduled to visit North Carolina this week, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine and former President Bill Clinton. Trump supporter Brian Brown has a Hillary for Prison 2016 sign in his yard Hillary Clinton is strongest in Charlotte and other North Carolina cities, and needs a big turnout from the state’s African-American population. Trump is expected to do best with white voters and in small towns and rural areas. In Faith, for example, 63 percent of the 380 active registered voters are Republican. Only 14 percent are registered Democrats. The rest are unaffiliated. People around Faith are quick to admit that they cringe at some of the things that come out of Trump’s mouth, but they say that the candidate’s now-famous slogan speaks to them. A short hike from A&L Mini Mart is MC, short for Melton’s Cycle. Inside, owner Lenny Melton takes a break from building a custom wheel to answer the question: What does “Make America Great Again” mean to you? “It means, ‘Bring back manufacturing, bring Made in America back,’ ” says Melton, 39, who plans to vote for Trump. “You ride through every mill town from here back to Charlotte – you’ll see what we’ve lost. There’s nothing here. Nothing. Unless you want to work at Walmart, Taco Bell, Kohl’s, IHOP. There’s no (other) place to work.” Since 1994, North Carolina has lost more than 369,000 manufacturing jobs. It’s not hard to find “Trump/Pence” signs in Faith – in yards, and even at some mom-n-pop shops. The Faith Radio & TV Company on Main Street, which is only open on Fridays and Saturdays, displays one, along with a sign in a picture window that reads “God Bless America. Pray.” But put up a Clinton sign – or what some may think is a Clinton sign – and you could incur the wrath of neighbors in this conservative Republican town. Trump backer Brian Brown, 44, who formerly worked in manufacturing for Corning Inc., spent $10 at a yard sale for what looked like a Clinton for President sign. On closer inspection, it actually read “Hillary for Prison 2016.” After he put it up in front of his house in Faith, “one of my neighbors yelled across the yard at me,” reports Brown. “He said, ‘What in the hell is that in your yard?’ And I told him, ‘You read the whole thing?’ Then (the neighbor’s) girlfriend came out and said to him, ‘You need to get out here and read the whole thing.’ “He thought I was pro-Hillary.” ‘Time for a change’ It’s lunchtime and the Faith Soda Shop & Restaurant is filling up with locals and with patrons who’ve driven in from nearby cities and towns. Today’s special – country fried steak, mashed potatoes, and Crowder peas. Sitting near framed photos of President George H.W. Bush attending Faith’s 1992 July 4 celebration are Republicans Leonard and Carol Robbins. They run a cleaning service just outside Faith, in China Grove. And they are “most definitely” voting for Trump, says Leonard, 72. For Carol, 69, it’s both a vote for Trump and against Clinton, especially her support for abortion rights. “I am against abortion,” says Carol, who attends Life Church in Salisbury. “That’s murder, in my opinion.” But Carol also likes Trump: “He’s a straight shooter.” For Leonard, the top issues include high taxes and the Affordable Care Act – both are killing small businesses, he says, and Trump has vowed to lower taxes and repeal Obamacare. Leonard says he was also heartened to hear Trump recently call for a constitutional amendment that would place term limits on all members of Congress. “We need new blood. It’s time for a change,” he says. “Trump represents change. He’s not a politician. You can tell by the way he talks – he puts his foot in his mouth. But he’s got some great ideas.” Enjoying chili hot dogs at a table near the entrance are Amber Beaver, 20, and husband Anthony, 24. They’ve driven in from Kannapolis to have lunch at the soda shop – one of her favorite restaurants. Also with them: Their 4-month old son, Aiden. Many voters their age wanted Democrat Bernie Sanders to be the next president. But Amber and Anthony say they’re solid Trump supporters. They like his promise to get tougher on illegal immigration. And they hope, if he’s elected, that he’ll bring more and better job opportunities to small-town North Carolina. “The economy has just crashed; it’s terrible. There are no jobs,” says Anthony, who feels like he is competing for work with undocumented immigrants. “They work under the table for less money while we’re out here trying to find jobs.” Anthony went to trade school – Nashville Auto-diesel College in Tennessee – and wants to someday own his own car lot. His job now is fixing garage doors. Amber, who graduated from a beauty college, serves food at a Sonic restaurant. She’s planning to go back to school to become an elementary school teacher. Next week, she’ll be casting her first-ever vote for president. She likes Trump partly because “he’s not Hillary. ... In one interview, she says one thing. And then in her next interview, she contradicts herself.” Does it bother her that so many women have come forward to say Trump forced himself on them? No, she says, because she’s not convinced the women are telling the truth. And she thinks they may have taken money “to make (Trump) look bad.” Settled in a booth at the soda shop-restaurant with three of his employees is Richard Gould, 42, who owns a painting company based in Salisbury. He and his crew are in Faith to paint a house. He says he disagrees with Trump’s hard line on immigration – some of Gould’s employees are immigrants– and “sometimes I wish (Trump) would just not talk” because of some of the things he says or the way he says them. Still, Gould, who’s registered unaffiliated, says he’ll vote for Trump this year. “People say they want a change. Well, he’s change,” says Gould. “I don’t believe (Clinton) is going to do anything different than what’s been done before.” Hoping for change in 2008, Gould voted for Obama. He didn’t feel like he got it, so he voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. Now he hopes a President Trump will do more to help small businesses and the middle class – both under siege, he says. “I think, somewhere deep down,” Gould says, “(Trump) really believes he wants to help.” ‘Made in America’ It was 1970 and Richard Nixon was president when Tom Jones started cutting hair on Main Street in Faith. He’s still at it, 46 years later. And if he has his way, Trump, not Clinton, will become the ninth president in office during his tenure at Tom’s Hairport. In fact, Jones, now 71, has already voted for Trump by absentee ballot. “He’s right about getting the businesses back in our country,” said Jones, a Republican. “I think that’s great. We’ve been downhill the way we’re going. Our businesses are leaving. ... He’s got a big mouth, but I think he’s doing good.” Jones, who served in Vietnam in 1967-68, says he wants to see “Made in America” on clothes and other products again. “I went to buy a shirt one time and it said ‘Made in Vietnam,’ ” he says. “I thought it looked good, but I threw it on the floor.” But what about the line of Trump clothes – including ties, suits and dress shirts – made in places like China, Bangladesh, Mexico and Vietnam? “I’ve heard that he’s invested overseas. But he says he’s going to bring all those businesses back,” says Jones. “Now, they can tell you anything. You don’t know if they’ll do it. ... But I don’t have much use for Hillary. And you’ve got to trust somebody.” A few doors down, on Main Street, Lenny Melton, the owner of the bicycle shop, also defends Trump, though he would have preferred Ben Carson as the GOP presidential nominee. On Trump not paying federal taxes: He was only following the law. Blame those in power who didn’t change the tax code. On Trump talking lewd about women on that “Access Hollywood” tape: “He’s not running to be the pope.” What’s more important to Melton and others in Faith is that they think Trump is the best bet to revitalize the economy in the many small towns dotting the Piedmont. “My dad’s a truck driver. He’s pulled mobile homes all his life,” Melton says. “Albemarle, Richfield, the next towns down (U.S. Route) 52 – at one point, they had over a hundred mobile home plants. They’re down to about five.” As for his own cycle business, Melton says more than 80 percent of it is now online. Walk-in traffic? “There is none. There’s no money around here,” he says. “When people walk in and see a $400 bike, that’s just something that’s out of their range.” Pilgrimage site Brian Brown’s “Hillary for Prison 2016” sign has disappeared. After two-plus weeks in his front yard, someone took it. “Either they) didn’t like it or they needed it worse than I did,” Brown says. From his porch, he recounts how his front yard became a sort of pro-Trump pilgrimage site in Faith when the sign still stood. The day after he put it up, “you wouldn’t believe the people that were stopping by and taking pictures of it on their cellphones,” says Brown. “They were posting it to their Facebook and everything.” Brown has been gung-ho on Trump from the start, voting for him over a dozen or more other more established Republicans in the state’s GOP primary. Says Brown: “Him being a businessman, he’s not tied to politics and he can’t be bought. I think he’s the man for the little man.” STAFF WRITER GAVIN OFF CONTRIBUTED.

At a time when India’s largest e-commerce company Flipkart is in talks with US retail giant Walmart Inc to raise funds through investment, two of its existing investors — Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II and Valic Co I — have reduced the valuation of their holding in the Bengaluru-based firm by 3.2 per cent and 11.3 per cent, respectively. According to filings made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, mutual fund investor Fidelity Rutland has marked down the price of Flipkart’s shares, which it acquired in October 2013, to $81.55 apiece as on August 31, 2016, compared with $84.29 apiece as on May 31. Another investor Valic Co I has also priced down Flipkart’s stock to $95.84 per share in its books as on August 31, against $108.04 apiece as on May 31. With these markdowns, Flipkart’s total valuation reduced to $8.7 billion against $9.0 billion as per Fidelity’s numbers, and to $10.2 billion from $11.5 billion according to Valic Co’s numbers. Incidentally both these investors had, in the previous three-month period, increased Flipkart’s valuation in their books. And while this seesaw of valuations for the e-tailer continues, operationally, too, the company is facing the chill wind of some of its top talent leaving. On October 25, Flipkart’s chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja resigned from his post. An industry observer said that Baweja was the key person at the e-commerce company responsible for raising funds, and him quitting at a time when Flipkart is in midst of bringing in more investment raises several flags.

Apart from Fidelity Rutland and Valic Co, another Flipkart investor Vanguard Group has also made a filing with the US securities regulator, it has maintained the valuation of its holding in the company during the June-August quarter. An e-mail sent to a Flipkart spokesperson seeking the company’s comments on the latest development did not elicit any response. Based on its previous valuation markdowns, sector analysts had suggested that growing concerns from investors signal a call for change in the current growth-oriented but loss-making business models of e-commerce companies. In June, Flipkart made an effort to ramp up its revenues and pare its losses by increasing the commission it charges the sellers on its marketplace by 5-6 per cent across several segments such as fashion and mobile accessories.

A now-viral video filmed by Tami Denny shows how hundreds of black birds coating the cars and pavement at the Walmart near Hollister and Tidwell. IN A RUSH? Last-minute DIY Halloween costumes that are actually kind of awesome Sure, we're all used to a few more birds hanging around during the winter, but it's not often that trying to get in or out of our car involves trying to get through a hoard of them. (Story continues below...)   This is crazy....they were on every car in the parking lot AND on the ground.Posted by Tami Denny on Sunday, October 23, 2016 "These birds have invaded this parking lot," says Denny in the short clip. "It's the invasion of the black birds." It's an invasion indeed, and just in time for Halloween. Now all that's missing is some back lighting, skeletons and spider webs. Talk about creepy. Take a look through the gallery above to see other facts you probably didn't know about black birds (A.K.A grackles).

Clears Buy Point; Ulta Tries To Retake 50-Day Line (Investor's Business Daily) If sales of Halloween candy is any indication of the health of consumers, the Holiday shopping season could exceed expectations. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) released its game plan to meet the needs of the tens of millions of consumers that will shop at its store, online and and in stores. Wal-Mart is looking to get ahead of the shopping rush but surprising to many, an estimated 34 million Americans already started their holiday shopping. Deploying An 'Army' Wal-Mart said in a press release that it's deploying for the first time ever an "army of Holiday Helpers" to serve customers in the checkout line. Beginning next Friday, the Holiday Helpers will help speed up the checkout process for in-store shoppers. The Holiday Helpers will be "ready with candy canes and smiles" and assist customers find the shortest line and open registers as needed. They will also be tasked with quickly grabbing items that customers forgot to pick up. Santa Clause will also play a role and will make 23,000 appearances throughout all the stores this Holiday season. Online Shopping Shoppers who prefer to make their purchases online could benefit from Wal-Mart's same-day pickup service. During the busier than usual Holiday shopping weeks, the company will add tens of thousands of items that are available for in-store pickup. To help meet the spike in demand, Wal-Mart will allocate additional staff dedicated towards in-store pickups and a Pickup Manager will oversee the process at each store for the first time ever. "I can't remember another year when I've been this excited about the merchandise we are offering customers," said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart .S. "It's not just about one category or one item. Our whole store is going to be stocked with new, exciting items from hot toys to new electronics available at the best prices. We will win the season on price, from the first weekend in November to Black Friday and Cyber Monday and through those final weeks in December." Needless to say Wal-Mart's competition isn't going to sit back. According to The Wall Street Journal, Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) is also heavily investing in Holiday initiatives to spur sales.

Japan refutes old Keynesianism... Home | EconLog | Archives | Permanent Link and Comments The AT&T and Time-Warner merger is attracting considerable attention. The idea of "convergence" between telcos and content providers has been around for quite a while. Still, the idea of "convergence" needs to be tested via the market process. Integrating production and distribution was not necessarily a no-brainer, in the world of atoms. Is the world of bits bound to be different? Robert Colville, editor of CapX, thinks it is. Colville is the author of "The Great Acceleration", a book I haven't read (yet). He wrote an interesting article, expressing a sort of concern with market consolidation: In industry after industry, the market is narrowing down to three or four big incumbents, in a wave of mergers and buyouts. And when these giants confront each other, the earth quakes - or at least Marmite disappears from the shelves. Size isn't by itself a bad thing. It's economies of scale that have enabled Tesco and Wal-Mart to feed us extraordinarily cheaply - or IKEA to cut the inflation-adjusted price of its signature Poang chair from $300 to $129 between 1990 and today. But the problem is that there's another reason firms become larger - to increase their leverage over their customers. As Adam Smith said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices." There are a number of Smith's quotes that are misused, but this one beats them all. What follows, in The Wealth of Nations, would put it in a rather different light: It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary. A regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular town to enter their names and places of abode in a public register, facilitates such assemblies. . . . A regulation which enables those of the same trade to tax themselves in order to provide for their poor, their sick, their widows, and orphans, by giving them a common interest to manage, renders such assemblies necessary. An incorporation not only renders them necessary, but makes the act of the majority binding upon the whole. Careful observer of human nature that he was, Smith pointed out that people prefer "protection" for themselves to the open sea of competition whenever possible. And yet he seemed to maintain that, if collusion was a natural tendency, there was little point in attempting to prohibit meetings that were nonetheless bound to happen. On the other hand, the government ought not to make them more profitable, so to say, by regulation and laws making monopolisation easier, if not inevitable. Getting back to Colville's article...Is there an evident and uncontested tendency toward bigger businesses in the world we live in? Sociologist Richard Bachmann thinks so and maintains the next US President should pursue a muscular antitrust policy. Mergers within big companies are certainly particularly visible. But we can observe different trends too. For example, some purported Internet "giants" are actually "platforms", which create markets for smaller suppliers or self-employed people. On top of that, in things like pharmaceuticals and biotech, my impression is that very often innovation happens in smaller firms, which sometimes end up being bought by bigger ones: which appear to be good places to scale innovation up, but not necessarily to generate it. As a matter of fact, when it comes to integrating production and distribution--the examples of "good bignesses"--Colville cites follow different business models: IKEA sells its furniture through its shop and the web, Tesco and WalMart focus on logistics and marketing of other companies' products. One of the companies that could be "squeezed" by the AT&T and Time-Warner merger, Netflix, is apparently not very worried. What keeps markets fertile and sparkling is this "biodiversity" of business models. Sure it needs free entry to be preserved. But whether we should be worried by size qua size, is still an open question. Comments and Sharing CATEGORIES: Competition EMAIL COMMENTS (2 to date) Latest Comment Harold Cockerill writes: More antitrust enforcement could get twisted to actually protect the big guys (lot of money spent on K street for that). Large businesses have an advantage in dealing with an administrative regime that works to hold back start ups. Big businesses in general are not agile which should make them vulnerable to competition from smaller companies but with the growth of the administrative state we've seen a decrease in new business formation. Big business doesn't want that to change. Too many people want protection both in business and in their personal lives. Government can give short term security but that comes with the loss of long term opportunity. The free market is not so good at short term security but nothing is better for long term opportunity. More government interference in the economy ensures the loss of opportunity and in the absence of a successful movement to make government smaller that's what the future holds for America. Posted October 29, 2016 10:04 AM David R. Henderson writes: Good post, Alberto. Also, in the Industrial Organization literature, there is good reasoning that vertical integration does not typically increase monopoly power, but, on the contrary, can reduce the distortion from successive monopoly.

Credit: Getty Images Eleanor Muffitt 29 October 2016 • 12:00pm Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, has come around once again with retailers gearing up to slash prices to kick-start the Christmas gift-buying season. Last year Asda, owned by Black Friday stalwart Walmart since 1999, called off its Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers, saying it would rather focus on a prolonged series of sales in the run-up to the holiday season.  But will the supermarket have a change of heart this year? Some of you are hopeful... Asda better be taking part in Black Friday properly this year— Enzo Amore (@DarrylPdtKid) 20 September 2016 Rollback . . . to 2015 The shopping giant, which has 525 stores across the UK, is credited with helping to bring the event to the UK in 2013. In 2015, it announced it would not be part of Black Friday due to “shopper fatigue”. The store said customer feedback was behind its decision to invest in £26 million of savings for consumers across the season rather than a one-off day of sales. However, some speculated that its refusal to take part had something to do with the scenes of chaos that were filmed in their branches in 2014. Remember this? Asda Black Friday madness as frantic shoppers fight over TVs Play! 01:13 Can you still pocket the difference? The jury’s still out on whether the supermarket chain will be offering reductions on Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year, but if it does, expect slashed prices on the usual furniture, homeware, tech, toys and electrical goods. Last year, Asda offered non-Black Friday deals in store and online from the beginning of November through to Christmas and the New Year. These included half-price toy sales and deals on skincare, fragrance and gifting with Asda's 3 for £10 offer. There were also deals on consoles and televisions and other electrical items such as the Oral B 2500 which was down to £29.97 from £75.00. So even if the shop doesn't take part in Black Friday in 2016, there will still be savings to be had. Phew! ​ The Asda bottom 'pocket tap' adverts return Play! 00:44 Knowledge is power The key to Black Friday success is staying ahead of the game - so if Asda does decide to get in on the action, you’ll want to be the first to know. To bag the best potential deals, follow Asda’s Facebook and Twitter pages for updates, and sign up to store emails.  If you’re happier shopping in-store than online, note down when your local Asda opens and closes so you can avoid any crowds during peak times. Plus, find out more about all the deals out there by heading to our other Black Friday pages - where we've laid out all the best offers for you - and our Telegraph Promotions Facebook and Twitter accounts. Did you know? The adoption of the Asda name occurred in 1965 with the merger of the Asquith chain of three supermarkets and Associated Dairies. Asda is an abbreviation of Asquith and Dairies.

Emily Drooby (@EmilyDrooby) has a list of this year's oddest sexy costumes. Buzz60 Halloween is on Monday this year and is quickly approaching. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) Halloween spending is expected to reach $8.4 billion this year in the U.S., according to the National Retail Federation’s annual holiday survey. That’s the highest in the survey’s 11-year history. With U.S. consumers expected to spend $82.93 on average, shoppers preparing for a scary good time will be looking for bargains. Here’s where to find deals on costumes, candy and other goodies. Budget bags of candy Bags of candy can add up, especially if you’re expecting a frightening number of trick-or-treaters. Warehouse stores such as Costco, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club offer a sweet alternative because they sell Halloween candy in bulk at lower cost per unit. For instance, a six-count of full-size, 1.55-ounce Hershey’s chocolate bars costs $4.48 at discount giant Wal-Mart (approximately 75 cents per bar), while a 36-pack of full-size candy bars sells for $20.49 at Sam’s Club (approximately 57 cents per bar). Cheap costumes Costumes are plentiful and affordable at Walmart, where a kit to turn yourself into a human emoticon costs $10. Walmart customers can buy almost any of the company’s in-store Halloween merchandise online for pickup at a store while items are available. Kmart.com has over 5,000 different costumes for sale — some up to 50% off — but the retailer is offering an additional incentive to shop in store. On Oct. 29, Freebie Saturday, children 12 and younger can walk away with a free Halloween pail. If you’re looking for a last-minute costume but don’t want to fight crowds of procrastinators, sign up for the email newsletter at HalloweenCostumes.com. It will unlock shipping offers at the costume store, including Saturday delivery from $14.99 (regularly from $34.99) when ordering Oct. 27-28, or Monday delivery from $14.99 when ordering Oct. 28-29. Discounted decorations Dressing yourself is only half the battle. Discounted decorations for your home are abundant in the countdown to Oct. 31, if you know where to look. Select harvest decor is 50% off throughout October at Joss & Main. These decorations will last you through Halloween and Thanksgiving. Jet.com has deals on indoor and outdoor decor. Plus, if you’ve never shopped at Jet.com, you get 15% off your first three orders with code TRIPLE15. Some exclusions apply, and your order must be a minimum of $35. At Target, shoppers who spend at least $30 on Halloween products can save $5 online and in store through Oct. 29. And don’t forget about Dollar Tree. Glow-in-the-dark lawn signs, party supplies, drawstring bags and more are $1 each. Selection may vary by store. Creature features Finally, if you want to deck out your animal friends for the holiday, PetSmart could have what you’re looking for. Here, all Halloween costumes and select Halloween-themed toys are 40% to 70% off. This sale lasts through the holiday. The Oct. 31 holiday, which falls on Monday this year, is rapidly approaching. If you plan to shop online, select an expedited shipping speed to get your tricks and treats in time. Otherwise, skip shipping costs altogether and head to the store.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen West Kelowna, B.C. – RCMP are asking for the public’s help locating a wheelchair they believe two men stole Wednesday at Walmart. Surveillance footage shows a man swapping out his wheelchair for a motorized shopping cart at the West Kelowna store’s east entrance. A second suspect is seen accompanying him as the man heads into the store operating the cart. As the pair leave at the west exit, the second man wheels the first out in someone else’s wheelchair parked at the door. The first suspect was wearing a plaid jacket, black toque and blue jeans. The second suspect had a full goatee and was wearing a tan coat with hood, black shirt, blue jeans and white shoes. “In reviewing the video surveillance footage, it appears as though the suspect knowingly left the store in someone else’s mobility aid device while leaving his own behind,” Cpl. Jesse O’Donaghey said. RCMP said there is also a possibility it was a mistake. Anyone with information is asked to contact West Kelowna RCMP at 250-768-2880 or by leaving a tip with Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

 Amazon is about to become the biggest clothing retailer in the US Hayley Peterson Oct. 25, 2016, 12:14 PM 15,292 facebook linkedin twitter email print An ad for Amazon Fashion. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Amazon is expected to surpass Macy's to become the biggest apparel seller in the US next year, according to a new 58-page report from Cowen & Co. The shift would represent a huge shake-up for the apparel industry, which has long been dominated by department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, and JCPenney, as well as big-box retailers including Walmart and Target. Amazon is a relative newcomer to the fashion world, and it has made a swift rise to the top. The company's clothing and accessory sales are expected to grow nearly 30% next year, to $28 billion, according to the Cowen analysts. Macy's apparel sales, by comparison, are expected to drop 4%, to $22 billion, in the period. As Amazon's sales grow, so will its share of the apparel market in the US. Amazon currently claims about 6.6% of the market. That share is expected to increase to 8.2% by next year and further expand to 16.2% within five years, according to Cowen analysts. By 2021, Cowen expects Amazon to generate $62 billion in annual apparel sales. TJ Maxx is expected to be the No. 2 clothing seller, with $26 billion in sales, and Macy's is expected to claim the No. 3 spot, with $23 billion in sales. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York men's fashion week. Macy's is losing market share to Amazon. David Ramos/Getty Images The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and Vogue editor Caroline Palmer. Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well merchandised and highly curated — not things for which Amazon is necessarily known. Amazon's weaknesses with curation were highlighted in a shopper survey conducted in July by Cowen & Co. "Amazon Fashion got a very lukewarm review for site personalization and ease of use," Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a conference call on Tuesday. Shoppers said it "wasn't particularly easy to browse." Amazon also has the disadvantage of having no brick-and-mortar stores where shoppers can try on items or return purchases, he said. So why do people choose to shop on Amazon for clothes? Amazon Prime is the biggest lure for customers, according to Cowen & Co. Shoppers cited the convenience and free two-day shipping as the biggest advantage of shopping for clothes on Amazon. They also praised Amazon's customer service and breadth of product reviews.

OKLAHOMA CITY - At 18-years-old Meagan Gaddis was addicted to drugs. “Anything,” Gaddis said. “Marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, alcohol, opiates…” Now 29, she spent her college years on the street, ultimately addicted to meth. Her life had become a revolving door between the needle and the jail cell. “The only thing that I knew, that was familiar to me was to get arrested I took a check that was made out to somebody else and I took it to Walmart and I signed my name to the back of it and I said could you call the cops because I'm trying to go to prison,” Gaddis said. But she didn't go to prison, instead she was able to get treatment because of a plan only offered in Oklahoma County to single mothers, and it's the reason why she's support state questions 780 and 781. The questions are joined together. State question 780 reduces several felony drug crimes to misdemeanors. State question 781, which can only pass if 780 does, sets up rehab and job training programs designed to get drug users out of prison and back into the workforce. But law enforcement officials say it will make their jobs harder and potentially put more drugs and drug dealers back on the streets. “Just because there's a problem, the first person to stand up and say here's a solution doesn't make it the right solution,” Fraternal Order of Police Vice President Mark Nelson said in a previous interview. 10/21/16 Related Story: Oklahoma Police Officers Voice Opposition To SQ 780, 781 But Meagan disagrees. “We can be smart on crime instead of tough on crime and then we can start changing things that need to be changed.” NewsMore>> Biggest Thanksgiving Travel Rush In Nine Years, Predicts AAA Biggest Thanksgiving Travel Rush In Nine Years, Predicts AAA [File Photo] The slowly improving economy could boost travel over the Thanksgiving holiday to levels not seen in nine years.More >> The slowly improving economy could boost travel over the Thanksgiving holiday to levels not seen in nine years.More >> OHP: One Person Killed In Multi-Vehicle Crash Involving Semi In Grady Co.

(Photo by Dylan Deprey) If Antonishia Davis never hopped the number 6 bus for her first day at the FedEx Shipping Center in Waukesha, WI, her five-year-old daughter may have had a very different life. The roughly forty minute car ride from her house near 19th and Capitol to FedEx, where she works as a parcel sorter, would have drained her wallet having to pay gas money for rides to work, especially during the peak winter season. Luckily for her, and others looking for work in the City of Milwaukee over the past two years there has been two bus lines creating a bridge between jobless employees in the city and employers trying to fill vacant positions in the suburbs. “For a lot of people this is the difference between having a job or not,” said County Executive Chris Abele. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele said JobLines was a start, but more funding was needed from the state to improve transportation. (Photo by Dylan Deprey) JobLines 6 and 61 are a joint collaboration of the Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope (MICAH), Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin (BHCW) and Milwaukee County Transit Systems (MCTS). The lines connect employees to around 150 employers along two routes. JobLines 6 runs south to BuySeasons in New Berlin from N. Port Washington Road to W. Capitol Drive in Milwaukee, and JobLine 61 runs north to Walmart in Germantown from N. 35th St. and N. Toronto St. (Near W. Capitol Dr.) Over a year span since 2015, JobLines has seen a 23 percent increase in ridership, and have provided around 1,000 daily rides to positions outside of Milwaukee. The rebranding for JobLines 6 and 61 was announced during a press conference Oct. 25, in an effort to spread the word out about the need for skilled laborers along the two routes. “I love that this is called JobLines because its getting people to work, but we could just as accurately call it Life Lines,” Abele said. Speakers during the press conference included State Rep. David Bowen, Michael Crowley, Antonishia Davis, Chris Abele, Rev. Willie Briscoe and Jarrett Fisher. (Photo by Dylan Deprey) Waukesha County Board Supervisor Michael Crowley is the vice president of Midland Plastics in New Berlin, which is also on JobLines 6. He said that over the past two years he has witnessed economic growth along the bus route, including 10 to 15 openings after an expansion at Midland Plastics. Both routes allow commuters different opportunities in a variety of fields including manufacturing, electrician, retail and industrial supplying. Crowley and Abele amended the collaboration between employers in Waukesha and MCTS. “We have been working well together as counties, and communities,” Crowley said. Jarrett Fisher, the assistant Hub Manager for FedEx Ground in New Berlin said that including Davis there were over one hundred employees who use JobLines. He also said that the bus line worked with FedEx to run with first, second and third shifts. Although some have their doubts about public transportation, Davis said that she is “thrilled to get on the number 6 bus everyday.” She said that unlike what some people assume, the drivers on the JobLines were always friendly and reliable. She mentioned a story about a time a driver waited for a pregnant woman who happened to be running late. “Sometimes people are skeptical and be like, ‘Oh I can’t make it to this job’ and this is a way for people to make it to jobs,” Davis said.

Let’s clear up some misconceptions now, and give you a bit of conversation fodder to drop at your next dinner party or date. Who invented Girl Scout Cookies? Girl Scouts, obviously. The very first cookie sale was held in 1917 by a troop in Oklahoma, and it quickly caught on: A few years later the Girl Scouts magazine published a cookie recipe, encouraging troops to bake for fundraisers. In the beginning, the Scouts baked their own sugar cookies and sold them door-to-door; it wasn’t until the late 1930s that they began contracting commercial bakers to produce the cookies en masse. When is Girl Scout Cookie season? The exact timing depends on where you live, but generally speaking it occurs for only six to eight weeks each year. The majority of cookie sales are held between January and April, but some troops begin slinging cookies as early as September. The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York will start selling this year’s cookie supply a couple weeks before Christmas, while the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas will launch their sale in mid-January, just to name a couple examples. (Find out when they go on sale in your area here.) Where can I buy them? Good question. The Girl Scouts website has a handy cookie locator that will help you track them down by entering your zipcode. In general, Girl Scouts tend to set up shop outside high-traffic areas frequented by people who probably like cookies — think grocery stores and big-box stores such as Target and Walmart. Even better, in 2014 the Scouts launched online ordering, though it’s not quite as simple as say, using Amazon Prime; they’re still only available during the six-to-eight week cookie season, and in order to purchase cookies you’ve first got to get an email invite from an actual Girl Scout (meaning late-night impulse cookie purchases are basically impossible). Tom Simpson/Flickr Who makes Girl Scout Cookies? Sadly, they are no longer personally baked by the Girl Scouts themselves. Every Girl Scout Cookie sold in America is produced by one of two big bakeries: Little Brownie Bakers (which is actually a subsidiary of Keebler), or ABC Smart Cookies. Troops choose which baker they purchase from, and each baker makes them using slightly different recipes and different names. That’s right, Peanut Butter Patties and Tagalongs are basically the same thing from different companies, as are Caramel DeLites and Samoas, and Peanut Butter Sandwiches and Do-Si-Dos. (Thin Mints are Thin Mints no matter where you are in the country, though.) What flavors do they come in? The current lineup of flavors is as follows: Thin Mints: a crispy chocolate-mint wafer coated in chocolate Samoas: crispy coconut and caramel-coated ring-shaped cookies with chocolatey stripes Tagalongs: crunchy cookies topped with a layer of peanut butter and dipped in chocolate Trefoils: shortbread cookies Do-Si-Dos: a peanut butter sandwich cookie Lemonades: lemon-iced shortbread cookies Savannah Smiles: another lemon cookie coated in powdered sugar Thanks-a-Lots: shortbread cookies with a layer of fudge on one side Trios: a gluten-free chocolate chip-peanut butter-oatmeal cookie Toffee-tastics: a gluten-free buttery toffee cookie This year to celebrate the Girl Scouts’ centennial, two different varieties of cookies inspired by the classic campfire treat the s’more are also being introduced: a graham cookie coated in creme icing and coated in chocolate, and a graham sandwich cookie with a chocolate-marshmallow filling. brianpdx/Flickr Which Girl Scout Cookie flavor is the best? While many will argue that the top Girl Scout cookie is the cool, chocolatey Thin Mint, the crispy, creamy, sweet and just-a-little-bit-salty peanut butter and chocolate Tagalongs may actually be the queen of all cookies, Girl Scout or otherwise. The caramel and coconut Samoas also have hordes of devoted fans. Those are easily the top three flavors, and after that there’s a sharp drop-off: Trefoils are boring old shortbread; Savannah Smiles are lemon and really, who gets excited about lemon cookies? The peanut butter sandwiches known as Do-Si-Dos are weirdly dry and crumbly and a little bit bland; and many of the others aren’t even worth mentioning. Stick with the top three and you won’t go wrong. (Pro tip: Thin Mints and Tagalongs are fantastic straight from the freezer.) Where does all the cookie money go? Proceeds from cookie sales are distributed amongst the Girl Scouts at three different levels. Only around 20 percent or less of the cost of that box of Samoas actually goes to the troop you purchase them from, and they might use it for community service projects or troop activities. The bulk of it goes to the regional council, which uses the cookie money to support its local troops by funding programming or supporting summer camps. None of the profits from cookie sales go to the national Girl Scouts organization, but they still get their cut: They earn royalties from the bakers who produce the cookies, and also make money off partnerships with big food brands who want to use the Girl Scouts name (more on that below). How can I get Girl Scout Cookies out of season? You can’t, unless maybe you find some scalper on Craigslist who keeps stock in their freezer year-round. If you’re really jonesing for a GSC fix, knockoffs can be found in the cookie aisle from both Keebler’s and Walmart’s Great Value brand that approximate Thin Mints, Samoas, and Tagalongs — but they’re not as tasty as the real thing, and perhaps more importantly, they lack the charitable aspect that comes along with buying direct from the Girl Scouts. The Girl Scouts have collaborated with a number of food companies on GSC-inspired products, however, including Breyers ice cream, Coffeemate coffee creamer, and Friendly’s ice cream cakes, and in January, General Mills will launch a limited edition line of Girl Scout Cookie cereals in Thin Mint and Samoa flavors. (There’s also a strain of marijuana called Girl Scout Cookies, but that’s a decidedly unauthorized use of the GSC name.) Like many wonderful things in life, Girl Scout Cookies are fleeting — and really, waiting 10 months for them to come back in season makes them taste all the better. • All Sweets Week Coverage [E] More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos Supported By The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Anthony Bourdain ‘Parts Unknown’ in Japan: Just the One-Liners Internet Crazies Think This DC Pizzeria Is the Center of a Clinton Sex Ring Read Restaurateur Danny Meyer’s Post-Election Letter to Employees Vivian Howard Can’t Swear on TV The 2016 Eater Gift Guide Newsletter By signing up you agree to our terms of use.

Bethania Palma Oct 28, 2016 Share - - In September 2016, Wilma Price was driving through a Walmart parking lot in Huntsville, Texas, when she spotted a homeless man named Patrick holding a sign that said, "Dog in pound. Need help." Price, who runs a rescue called Mr. K's Pet Shelter, stopped to help. She said Patrick had been arrested for trespassing and taken to Walker County Jail in Huntsville. His dog, Franklin, had been taken away to the Rita B. Huff shelter in Walker County, where he was listed as a stray. Price took him to the shelter where she paid $120 to get his dog back. The two have since formed a tight friendship, and Price is fundraising to help Patrick get back on his feet. The story proved to be an irresistible bit of happy news amid a dark and nasty presidential election cycle, and after telling it to a dog web site and CBS News, it spread far across the Internet. In a bizarre and confusing twist, a web site called the Alabama Observer (which generally seems to post legitimate news items) published the same story — but with the location changed to Huntsville, Alabama (not Texas). The names of the people involved were also changed in the Observer story, which does not carry a byline.  In that version, the homeless man's name is changed to Mark Spencer and the dog's name is changed to Wilbur, and the woman who comes to their aid is Elizabeth Masterson, 29. (Price said Patrick's last name is phonetically pronounced "Balisky," but she doesn't know the spelling). Price told us that the publication also took a picture of Patrick holding Franklin that has been published with their story, but reversed it. She said no one has responded to requests to remove the erroneous information. There are so many [versions of the story] going that honestly I haven't had time to keep up with it. I'm aware of [The Alabama Observer] one, and there was a couple other ones. I’m shocked that it went as it has. I don’t feel like I did anything that anyone else wouldn’t do. There is no contact information on the Observer's web site, but a rather lengthy and unusual "Terms" page makes it appear that the content on the site is submitted by various users, as opposed to typical news organizations that hire reporters and freelancers to file stories, which are then vetted and edited before publication. Price said a stranger started fundraising for Patrick and they had to get the page removed from GoFundMe (Price has herself started a fund for Patrick, which has raised thousands of dollars). Price said Patrick has been helping her with animal rescue efforts since the two met, and her Facebook page documents their adventures together: Originally published: 28 October 2016 Tags: dogs alabama observer animal rescue Bethania Palma Bethania Palma Markus is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has covered everything from city hall to crime to national politics.

Markdowns by investors, constant struggle to retain leadership in the market thanks to fierce competition from an aggressive Amazon and failure to retain top talent internally—India’s largest ecommerce firm has been facing its demons. To add it to woes, Bengaluru-based Flipkart’s chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja quit amid the festive season, which is a crucial period for ecommerce companies. In a chat with Techcircle, Baweja speaks about the reasons behind his decision to quit the ecommerce major, Flipkart’s financial position and much more. Edited excerpts: Are you satisfied with Flipkart’s financial performance? It was something that I thoroughly enjoyed. As a team, we have really expanded. Because the focus has been on acquiring customers, we have innovated all across. Be it low-cost EMIs or product exchanges, all that was because we were customer centric. Everything else took a back seat and ruthless execution helped in a big way. I am really proud to have been part of this. Financially, we are much better than what we were. We have a substantial amount of cash and a very strong run rate. Secondly, from a financial profitability (angle), if you look at numbers six months ago and now, there has been a substantial positive move. These two years have been great in terms of value and volume growth, profitability improvement and overall cash availability. Was resignation a tough decision for you? All decisions where you leave things are not easy. I am a relationship guy. Therefore, there is the pain of leaving behind your people. There have been media reports of an impending investment by Walmart in Flipkart and Flipkart seems to be in the middle of a fundraise. Also, this is the festive season which is important for ecommerce companies. Why exit at this point? There is no absolute aggressive fundraise programme. As of now, we are not doing anything. Like I said, there is enough runway available. Funds are available for more than two years. That is one aspect. But yes, one or two transactions will continue to happen. If there are investors who want to talk to us, whether strategic or financial, we will continue those (talks). But are we aggressively pursuing or running a process? That is not true. Doesn’t your exit during the festive season affect Flipkart’s focus? Some activity will be happening always. In that sense, there will be no right time. One has to make a view and move on. What was the reason behind your decision to move on? I have built a team and made a lot of changes. Something else came up and I thought let me try that. You had come from a conglomerate to a startup. Do you think it was a mistake? Not at all. I enjoyed the journey. There was a lot of learning and I personally believe that I have added a lot of value to Flipkart. A startup needs a lot of processes; we were able to do a lot of that. I don’t think I regret it. How do you see Sachin and Binny Bansal’s leadership? They are great entrepreneurs. They are the ones who initiated the whole thing. They will take the firm to much greater heights. One can move forward only if the leadership is great. Both have distinct styles. They will move forward in a big way. How has been the competition with Amazon over the past two years? For them, India is one of the biggest markets left, as they could not do much in China. They are very aggressive. But we have been maintaining our lead. We have done really well. October was a substantial month for us. We are an Indian (company); there is an Indian-ness about us and we will continue to lead the way. Yes, they have global processes, but we understand the Indian psyche better. There have been a couple of investor markdowns in the past. How have the markdowns affected Flipkart? Valuation markdowns were done by some investors due to other compulsions in terms of market realities. I don’t think it has impacted us. Someone is coming up with a mathematical exercise for internal calculation without even elaborating—a number doesn’t matter. There was also a media report which said Flipkart was in talks with Amazon for a sell-out. Is that true? No. This is a figment of imagination from your fraternity. There has never been such a thing. There were layoffs at Flipkart in the past. Were those measures driven by concerns with regards to profitability? I don’t think there were any layoffs like that. Those were normal attrition and (related to) performance issues. Do you think Flipkart has made any mistakes in terms of decision-making or organisational restructuring? Every startup continues to learn and define the way it operates. It is a continuous process. An allegation of fraud against you has been making the rounds in social media. Have you seen it? I have seen it. It came out of nowhere. We have always followed a well-regulated process. Where are you moving to? Are you starting up or moving to another company? I have not really thought about it. I am unlikely to be in the startup world. Will you be taking a break before joining the new place? I have never taken a break. There is also an offer in air. Any regrets? These are exciting times. But there are other things to be done also. For instance, I have been away from my family. There are no real regrets. There are other opportunities that I am wanting to pursue. Like this interview? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

Since this part of town has recorded several recent car burglaries, Alvarez deemed it prudent to conduct a field inquiry. Police said Oliver explained that he had just left a bar in Harrison and was walking home to Newark. Since Newark was in the opposite direction, Alvarez deemed it prudent to conduct a warrant check and found that Oliver was wanted by Rochelle Park for hindering apprehension ($500/full), police said. A search incident to arrest on said warrant reportedly revealed a bag of suspected marijuana in his pants pocket.  Alvarez, with Officer Victor Girdwood as backup, brought Oliver to headquarters, where the arrestee reportedly became profane and offensive and “declined to cooperate to any degree” with the booking process. When his defiance increased, police said, he was put in a holding cell, and the officers had to forcibly remove the standard accoutrements (belt, shoelaces, jewelry, etc.) of which cell-bound suspects are relieved. Later, when Det. Frank West and Officer Alan Stickno went to the cellblock to get Oliver and complete the booking, they found he had removed all his clothing and was wrapped in a blanket, his bare legs sticking out, police said. Ordered to get dressed, Oliver reportedly responded that he was aware of his rights under the Second Amendment. Eventually, he was formally charged – on the warrant and with possession of pot and drug paraphernalia – and at noon was shipped to the Hudson County Jail. (Editor’s note: Yes, we know you might like to see the mugshot, but because of the booking difficulties, Oliver’s photo apparently could not be taken until he was at the jail, so we don’t have it.)  ••• Other recent reports from the Kearny police blotter included the following: Oct. 13 Officers Luis Moran and Richard Poplaski responded to a 4 p.m. report of someone smoking a CDS in a Trinity Place backyard and reportedly found Jason Lilly, 19, of Newark, puffing away on a patio. He was arrested for possession of pot and paraphernalia. Oct. 14 At 3:15 a.m. near QuickChek, Officers Mina Ekladious and Jose Castillo observed a man discard a small plastic bag on the ground, recovered same and arrested Earl McLeod, 27, of Willingboro, on charges of possession of pot/paraphernalia. Oct. 15 At 4 a.m., police said, Officers Jason Rodrigues and Rich Pawlowski observed a 2017 Toyota – its lights on, its engine running, its gear in “drive” and its driver asleep behind the wheel – in the Seabra lot on Schuyler Ave. When they and backup Officer Sean Podolski were unable to rouse the driver, they tried to open the doors so they could turn off the ignition. At that point, police said, Andres Quiroz-Tejada, 22, of Kearny, woke up long enough to try to drive away, but the car travelled only a few feet before hitting a curb and coming to a halt. At which point, the driver fell asleep again. With the aid of Sgt. Mike O’Neill, the cops got the doors open, rendered the vehicle safe and removed the motorist, who allegedly was so intoxicated that he was “in no condition” to be given field sobriety tests. Quiroz-Tejada was brought to HQ and charged with DWI and refusing to take an Alcotest. ••• Officers Stickno, Jordenson Jean and Kyle Plaugic were called to the mall area at 200 Passaic Ave. at 3 p.m. on a report that two teenage boys on bicycles had discarded a backpack under a parked vehicle. At the sight of the patrol cars, the youths abandoned their bikes and fled on foot – one running toward BJ’s; the other, toward LA Fitness. Stickno and Jean caught the latter. Plaugic and off-duty Officer Jose Castillo, working in BJ’s, found the other in that store.  Police said the backpack, found beneath a Dodge van, had apparently been stolen from Kmart, as had its contents: four pairs of NBA socks, two T-shirts, one pair of black slippers and a handbag/fanny pack. A window on the van had been smashed with a large rock, and the vehicle’s owner reported that its interior was in disarray and that some change was missing, police said. The two 15-year-old suspects from Newark were charged with burglary, conspiracy, obstructing the administration of law and two counts each of receiving stolen property, and were released to the custody of parents/guardians.   ••• At 8 p.m., Officers Chris Medina and Michael Gontarczuk were dispatched to the Verizon store in the Walmart mall on the report of an unruly customer, identified as Carl Rutherford, 34, of Newark. According to management, he  removed a phone from a display case, setting off an alarm, became confrontational and refused to leave the premises. Police said Rutherford was found to be wanted on a $3,000 traffic warrant out of East Orange, was arrested and processed at HQ and turned over to the East Orange PD.   Oct. 16 At 3:10 p.m., an individual approached an East Orange couple sitting in a car in the Walmart lot and asked the man, who was in the passenger seat, for $1. When the request was refused, the panhandler reached through the window and attempted to snatch a chain from the man’s neck. The female driver put the car in gear, but the would-be thief, despite now being dragged, did not release his grip. Until the victim bit him on the hand. He then fell to the pavement and was last seen running into the meadow area behind the Walmart building. Officer Chris Levchak took the incident report, obtained a description of the suspect and contacted Walmart for security videos of the area. As of this writing, the perp had not yet been identified. Oct. 18 Shortly after midnight, Officers Alvarez and Darwin Paulino stopped a 2007 Pontiac that had run a red light on the Newark Turnpike and saw passenger Ali Jenkins, 19, of Newark, discard a tissue apparently containing loose marijuana, police said. The tissue was recovered and Jenkins was arrested for possession of pot/paraphernalia. The driver, a 21-year-old Jersey City woman, got a summons for the signal violation.  Oct. 19 At 10 a.m., Vice officers observed a 2015 Hyundai driven by David Conway, 46, of Lyndhurst, enter Kearny from Belleville. As he passed the unmarked police car, he became bogged down in traffic and was reportedly seen inspecting several wax folds. When the officers stopped him at the Pike and Passaic Ave., police said, they saw him stuff something into his mouth and begin to swallow, and he allegedly admitted he had ingested two folds of heroin.  Conway was arrested and brought to HQ, where Kearny EMS assessed his condition and took him to Clara Maass Medical Center for observation. He has been charged with possession of the drug and paraphernalia and with tampering with evidence. ••• Officer Gontarczuk, on patrol near Belgrove Drive and Bergen Ave. at 8:10 p.m., detected the odor of burning marijuana apparently emanating from Veterans Field, where a group of young adults had congregated. When the smoke cleared, three were under arrest. Jomar Diaz, 23, of Newark, and Kristiana Schmidt, 19, of Kearny, were each charged with possession of pot and paraphernalia. Police said Marllon Marques, 22, of Kearny, was taken into custody on two warrants: Newark, DWI, $500, and Kearny, failure to appear, $100. Oct. 20 During a 3 a.m. traffic stop at Kearny Ave. and Liberty St., Officer Jonathan Dowie reportedly detected the familiar odor and found in the center console of a 2009 Saturn a small case containing wax dabs of marijuana and a scraper used to apply these to a vaporizer. Driver Keith Henderson, 24, of Newark, was charged with possession of pot/paraphernalia, possession of a CDS in an MV, and a brake-light violation.  – Karen Zautyk Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Email Print Related News Karen Zautyk | Observer Correspondent More Posts Post navigation Previous Article← Fashion & art & Goodwill Next ArticleMonumental undertaking for Explorers → This week’s e-Edition Schuyler Savings Bank Abbott/Milano Insurance Brady, Brady & Reilly NOTICE Have you or someone you love been involved in a crash or accident involving New Jersey Transit?

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | October 28, 2016 -- 22:05 GMT (15:05 PDT) | Topic: E-Commerce Amazon Prime officially launched in China on Friday, as CNET reports, where it will give Amazon another shot at taking on Alibaba and JD.com. For for 388 yuan (about $57), Prime members in China can sign up for sign up for a year's worth of unlimited deliveries of a selection of US-shipped and domestic items. For the first four months, Amazon is offering memberships at a promotional price of just 188 yuan (about $28). While the price is lower than a Prime membership in the US, Chinese customers won't have access to video and music streaming services. So far, Amazon hasn't gained much traction in China, and its competition is stiff. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart announced a strategic partnership with JD.com, China's second largest e-commerce company. Amazon has had better traction in India. In June, after seeing its market share in India grow in a year from 14 percent to 21 percent, the company invested another $3 billion there. However, Amazon's spending abroad -- including its expansion in India and investments in Prime services overseas -- took a toll on the company's third quarter financial results. Amazon reported on Thursday that its international segment had a Q3 net sales of $10.6 billion but even higher operating expenses of $10.9 billion. The $541 million operating loss dragged down Amazon's notably overall operating income. The company also noted Thursday that it to invest more in its AWS infrastructure in China, with a second infrastructure region opening in China in the coming months.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next FORT COLLINS, Colo. – A Fort Collins woman nearly fell victim to what police are saying was likely another case of a “virtual kidnapping” scam Friday morning. Gina Scott received a phone call Friday morning from someone purporting to be an EMT that her daughter had been involved in a crash with a motorcyclist. The “EMT” handed the phone over to another man, who said he was the father of the motorcyclist and that Scott needed to wire him money for his “son’s” medical expenses or she “wouldn’t see [her] daughter again.” The person on the phone asked Scott to meet him at a local Walmart, so Scott called her friend to follow her there. Scott’s friend called police. Shortly afterward, Scott found out her daughter was actually safe and sound in school, and that she had almost fallen victim to the scam, which police in Denver, Arvada and Boulder have warned about in recent months. “I’m so angry they played on my emotions,” Scott told Denver7. “The minute that you hear your daughter is in trouble, all of your sense go and all you can think about is helping her and getting her back safe.” Fort Collins police say they have yet to determine the origin or the identity of the caller. The department advises people not to answer calls from unknown or blocked numbers, as was the case for the person who called Scott. The police department also advises people not to wire anyone money or send them gift cards if they contact you over the phone. Anyone who suspects they are receiving calls from scammers should report the calls here. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

I park                                          beneath branches, crank up the AC                                                                                                                                         in the Jeep.

Last week, beneath a sky Wal-Mart blue,                                            in a clearing full of bottles, sneakers,                                                                                                                                                   TP rolls, I found a body.

But Jeff Bezos’s company apparently still sees enough present opportunity in China to invest in new big projects there today. Amazon on Friday unveiled its popular Amazon Prime membership program in China, a market where it has long struggled to crack the dominance of Alibaba or the rise of another competitor, JD.com. Amazon Prime will cost Chinese shoppers 388 yuan a year, or about $57, according to Bloomberg. That’s cheaper than the $99 U.S. shoppers pay for Prime, but the program perks aren’t the same in both markets. China’s version of Prime does not include any digital content — video and music streaming — the way it does in the U.S. Instead, the program focuses on giving free shipping to consumers who place orders of more than 200 yuan — or around $29 — from a catalogue of millions of overseas products. There is strong demand in China for products from Western brands. Still, the launch of Prime in China is somewhat surprising considering how long Amazon has already been in the market and how much it has struggled there to date. Research firms estimate that Amazon only owns 1 percent to 3 percent of China’s e-commerce market, more than a decade into its efforts there. That’s because the Chinese e-commerce market has long been dominated by Alibaba, which operates the Taobao shopping site where cheap, no-name brands are popular, as well as the Tmall site where many big Western brands have set up shop. In recent years, another e-commerce site, JD.com, has also risen in popularity. JD has a market cap of more than $36 billion and recently acquired Walmart’s e-commerce business in China. Walmart now owns nearly 11 percent of JD.com. As Amazon has struggled in China, it has vowed to invest $5 billion in India, the world’s second-most populous nation where there is not yet a dominant e-commerce power. At the Code Conference in May, Jeff Bezos said Amazon has passed along some high-level learnings from its stumbles in China to help inform its India strategy. "We mostly tried to roll out what worked well for us in Japan, Germany, the U.K., Spain, France, Italy, the U.S., etc., and it needed more local market customization," he said of the company's approach in China.

Cases of the flu will peak from December to March, circulating at their highest levels throughout the United States. Here's why you should get a flu shot.  1. It's free. If you have insurance, you can get a flu shot free of charge at your doctor's office, your local health department, or other various locations. If you don't have insurance, it's still cheap. Vaccines are available at large companies including Walmart and CVS. Costco has the cheapest available version for $15 per shot. 2. You can still spread the flu even if you don't feel sick. Some people who get the flu will have minor symptoms or none at all. Even so, you can still pass it on to someone who may experience much more severe or life-threatening symptoms from it. Related Stories Flu Season Means Uptick In Flu Shots Will There Ever Be A Cure For The Common Cold? 3. You'll save your sick days. Even if you do end up contracting the flu after getting a shot, the vaccine will likely make your illness much milder, reducing the amount of work you'll miss. The flu accounts for 11 million lost workdays and $7 billion in lost productivity each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 4. You won't get the flu just from getting the shot. It's a myth that you can contract the flu just by getting a flu shot. While the vaccine does contain flu viruses, these viruses have been inactivated so you won't contract it from the injection alone. The worst symptoms you're likely to experience are some aches, swelling at the injection site, or a low-grade fever. 5. You can save someone a trip to the hospital. Many people are at high risk for complications from the flu, including very young children, people over 65, and those with pre-existing conditions like heart disease or asthma. These people are at a much greater risk of developing serious complications like pneumonia or infection that can potentially be deadly.  While you might not fall into any of these categories yourself, you could pass it on to someone for whom it may be life threatening.

Retale Retale, The App That Puts Weekly Store Circulars On Your Smartphone, Raises $12 Million Browse more... needed Needed’s smarter shopping app will find you the best nearby deals Posted Oct 28, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Why Apple’s MacBook Touch Bar was the right thing to do A new app called Needed, now officially launching, wants to upgrade your mobile shopping list. Instead of turning to a simple note-taking app or to-do list, Needed aims to help you save on groceries by automatically searching for deals and sales that match the items on your list. The idea is to help you shop smarter locally, however – Needed doesn’t focus on online stores, or on-demand grocery delivery services. Instead, Needed looks at the local circulars for stores like CVS, Sam’s Club, Walmart, Kmart, Winn-Dixie, Big Lots, Sears, Best Buy, Macy’s, Haverty’s Crate & Barrel, Save-a-Lot, for example, some of which carry groceries, while others only carry household items that may also match things on your list. To use the app, you can either enter in products manually or just general descriptions like “cereal,” or you can scroll through a tappable list of the most commonly shopped-for goods. These are organized into color-coded sections like Bakery, Dairy, Fruits & Vegetables, Health & Beauty, Meat & Seafood, Snacks, and many more. screen696x696-7 screen696x696-8 screen696x696-9 screen696x696-10  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit And while Needed is primarily focused on grocery shopping, there’s also a section for Electronics where you can enter in a custom item in order to get updates about matching deals. Once your list is complete, each items will indicate how many nearby deals are available, and you can tap to view the store’s ad. For serious value-hunters, the app could help you more easily access the paper circulars that many of us no longer receive since we cancelled our newspaper subscriptions years prior. The app emerged from location-based mobile ad platform Retale, as part of its “App Lab” initiative, which is a new unit at the company focused on creating standalone mobile shopping experiences. This is the group’s first product, says Retale, whose flagship shopping app has seen over 40 million downloads to date worldwide. Essentially, Needed is repurposing Retale’s technology, which also delivers the weekly ads to your smartphone or tablet in a digital format. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see relying on Needed alone to make shopping trips productive. While the Retale platform is used by 5,200 of the world’s top retailers, the company says, when I tested the app it failed to load up deals from two top local stores, Target and Publix. This is odd, given that Target is one of the retailers that supposedly works with Retale – but its ad isn’t showing in the Needed app or on Retale’s website. Regardless as to why that’s the case, the end result is that there’s a weekly ad out there – and maybe several  – that aren’t popping up in Needed. That means you’re not seeing all the deals. However, if you primarily shop at one of the supported stores, like Walmart, Needed could be an easier way to shop for savings without having to plow through the paper ad. According to the app stores, the app has actually been live for some time, but the company is only now making its debut public following testing. Needed is a free download on iOS and Android. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase iOS Apps Description Native mobile application that allow entrepreneurs to connect with their prospective co founders within or outside their vicinity.

Her co-workers allegedly used them to terrorize her. By Cleve R. Wootson Jr. / The Washington Post Friday, October 28th, 2016 at 9:31am .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Angry Trump kept coming back. Alexandra Avila’s work computer usually displayed a smiling picture of her daughter. But when she logged in one morning last summer, she was greeted by a “belligerent looking picture of Donald Trump,” a lawsuit says. Again and again, she switched the desktop back to her daughter’s photo. But two co-workers got an IT employee to break into Avila’s computer to re-upload a sneering, pointing picture of Trump, according to the lawsuit. “One co-worker told Alexandra that Mr. Trump was saying ‘(Expletive) you!’ specifically to her,” the lawsuit says. Advertisement Continue reading The harassment only got worse for Avila, who was born in the United States and is of Mexican descent. The people Avila worked with at Sedgwick Claims Management Services in Iowa bombarded her with racist memes, embarrassing her on group chats of more than a dozen people, the suit says. One pictured a Hispanic man in an oversized sombrero. “No books,” it said. “Only Manuels.” Avila’s co-workers signed her up to volunteer for Trump’s campaign, according to her lawsuit. Once, a supervisor asked the team to vote on what food they wanted for a congratulatory potluck. “Alex can’t vote,” a co-worker replied. “She’s an illegal immigrant.” Avila started working in 2012 for Sedgwick Claims Management Services, which administers employee benefit programs for other companies. “At Sedgwick,” the Memphis-based company likes to note, “caring counts.” Sedgwick employs 14,000 people in about 275 offices in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Ireland, according to company literature. Advertisement Continue reading Avila worked in Sedgwick’s Iowa office, in Johnson County, where less than 6 percent of people identify as Hispanic, according to census data. Every day, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Avila handled family leave requests for Walmart employees. She was fired by the company last November. Her harassment and discrimination lawsuit was filed Monday and names her company and two former supervisors as defendants. The supervisors did not respond to requests for comment. Sedgwick Claims Management Services said in a statement sent to The Washington Post that “we are aware that a suit has been filed by Alexandra Avila, a former colleague in our Coralville, Iowa, office. Prior to her dismissal for cause in 2015, Ms. Avila never reported any such activity to management or our colleague resource team. Sedgwick consistently maintains fair employment and workplace harassment practices, and we are confident the facts will prove Ms. Avila’s case has no merit. “Our company fosters a diverse, inclusive workplace in which all colleagues are encouraged to achieve their full potential; this is the foundation of our success.” Avila’s alleged workplace troubles paralleled Donald Trump’s political rise: According to the lawsuit, the harassment started in earnest after Trump announced he was running for president in June 2015. During a speech declaring his candidacy, he made incendiary comments about Mexicans and immigration. Advertisement Continue reading “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” the man who would become the Republican nominee for president said. ” … They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” As the Associated Press noted, Trump’s rhetoric has contributed to racial tensions across the country. “Build a wall” chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana, the AP noted. “With the political climate the way that it is, it’s a little more charged,” said the principal of the Iowa school whose players were taunted. Dan Marburger, the principal at Perry High, told CNN that some of his students, at a school with an usually high percentage of minorities for that part of the state, feel that “this inflamed rhetoric is happening and it’s okay. No one is stopping it. They see it in a presidential campaign and now it’s okay for everyone to say this. It’s almost a sense that you feel that you don’t belong in your own country.” The only Hispanic person on her team of about a dozen, Avila was born in California and moved to Iowa as a child, her attorney said. Trump’s comments about Mexicans bothered Avila, and she confided in her co-workers, according to the lawsuit. “Alexandra’s coworkers knew she was upset by Mr. Trump’s bigoted remarks, so they needled her about them,” the lawsuit says. The ensuing harassment took all forms – a snide illegal immigrant comment here, a dancing Trump GIF there, according to the lawsuit. Advertisement Continue reading Avila told supervisors about the comments and messages, but they did not take action, the lawsuit says. Sometimes, they laughed too. “It just kept getting worse and worse,” Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler, told The Washington Post. “She tried to pretend that these things weren’t bothering her for a while because she had to work with these people. She’s not someone who likes to make waves. . . . Until she got fired, I don’t think she ever would have gone and complained outside the company.” The lawsuit says Avila was fired after a supervisor claimed she lied on timecards, although the suit says her supervisors’ attitudes toward Hispanics factored into Avila’s termination. The lawsuit claims that she and other employees often worked overtime or through their unpaid lunch break and that a supervisor told them “to find a way to get all their work done and that they were not allowed to write down any overtime hours.” The 2015 meeting where Avila was fired marked the first time she had heard about the timecard issue, the lawsuit says. She was terminated and escorted out of the building; her now-former employers said they would send her personal property to her home, the lawsuit says. Even though she was fired, the harassment did not stop, Avila claims. When the company mailed her a box with some of her belongings, a piece of paper was included that read: “Just call me La Trumpa.” Advertisement Continue reading On the back of the paper, someone had written: “Illegal immigrants can’t vote or work. Good luck finding a job.” In January, the lawsuit alleges, Sedgwick employees “continued to harass Alexandra on her Facebook page – greeting her with ‘Hola Alex’ and inviting her to a rally to see Donald Trump, ‘the next president of the United States.'” In the lawsuit, which was filed Monday, Avila is suing for harassment and discrimination based on race and national origin. Her attorney said she is also entitled to damages for wage theft and emotional distress. Fiedler said Avila sobbed as she recounted how she had to replace her daughter’s picture on her computer’s desktop over and over again: “The fact that they went into her computer and they replaced this beautiful, beautiful picture of her child and they replaced it with a photo of Donald Trump yelling and shaking a finger at her, really struck her and makes her feel violated,” the lawsuit says. iowa-lawsuit Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Scandal? Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report Why Is Nobody Talking About the Latest N.F.L. Scandal? Seeing is believing. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgOctober 28, 2016 11:00 am Email Facebook Twitter By Michael Loccisano/Getty Images. We all remember the Ray Rice domestic violence story. But an arguably worse case of abuse, and National Football League complicity, inspires far less national attention. And Christine Brennan, stellar sports columnist for USA Today, thinks that her colleagues are partly to blame. For sure, Rice was a big star, at least far bigger than Josh Brown, an end-of-career New York Giants kicker who was arrested for domestic violence in 2015 and whose then-wife, we now learn, told the cops she'd endured “more than 20 incidents” of abuse by Brown. Brown was only given the boot last week when tawdry details leaked out, including word that this had all been known previously to Giants owner John Mara. He's a respected member of what Brennan calls “the boys-will-be-boys club” of league owners. Mara did zilch. The NFL did zilch. Mara said after the Rice mess that there's no place in the league for domestic violence. Unless, of course, you need a kicker and re-sign a guy whom you know allegedly beat his wife. So it was wrong to buy the NFL's belated contrition about its handling of the Rice case and the vow to get tough on domestic abuse matters. Shame (again) on the NFL and Roger Goodell, the toady $34 million-a-year commissioner. (USA Today) As for the media, Brennan tells me, “Clearly because there is no tape to go to, the story isn't as intriguing to our culture and to people in sports media.” “Let's be honest. Seeing it makes all the difference in the world, and that is a huge problem since this such an important issue. To think that video somehow makes it more real. Yes, of course, I realize the importance of seeing it. But in these kinds of awful stories, you would think that power of the written word would still carry a lot of weight.” But, she says, look at Donald Trump. His reputation for crude dealings with women was known. But it wasn't until we saw—over and over —that “Access Hollywood” tape that we were moved to outrage. “It is disappointing that we apparently have to see it on video for anybody to get really riled up about it.” Twitter shuts Vine “While Vine’s growth had slowed in the past year and a half, it was once one of the most vibrant and creative factories of culture on the internet." (The Atlantic) “From 2012 to 2015, there was simply nowhere online like Vine. You could get lost in Vine like it was Wikipedia, and you could laugh on Vine like it was YouTube. It welded the old internet’s spontaneity and 'randomness' to the new social web’s scale and diversity.” “As the web continues to expand and corporatize, as more companies merge an Apple-like aesthetic with Walmart-like scale, it’s hard to imagine anything like Vine happening again.” Big picture Amid the incessant references to a supposedly narrowly Clinton lead in some states, it was helpful to have CNN's John King, master of election maps, underscoring yesterday that a Trump win still looks like a total long-shot. Behind a Snapchat IPO Why might Snapchat's parent raise a desired $4 billion in an IPO? From Cooper Smith at Cheddar.com, the new site and digital newscast for business-minded millennials: “Approximately 150 million people use the Snapchat app daily. For perspective, that’s more than Twitter but fewer than Facebook. That said, Snapchat is acquiring active users at a far faster clip than competing platforms. Snapchat’s daily active user base grew 68 percent between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, whereas Facebook’s grew just 17 percent.” Nearly 75 percent of Americans “aged 12 to 24 have used the app, whereas only 23 percent of all age groups have used it.” There are expected ad revenues of $370 million this year, and an expectation it can get to $1 billion very soon. Bill Clinton's clamps on the press We now all know, thanks to Julian Assange in London's Ecuadorian embassy, about howBill Clinton aides strong-armed combo donations for his foundation and himself. But while he desisted with the giant speaking fees about six months after his wife started her campaign, he did demand significant expenses and private jet travel, even from public universities. He also, it turns out, insisted on “prepublication review of news releases, social-media posts and website materials. Mr. Clinton’s aides often imposed strict prohibitions on media interviews and other limits but asked public-affairs officials to keep the no-interview policy out of news releases.” (The Wall Street Journal) In case you missed that New York Times story on the Clintons... “The CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley” last night gave us “New Ammunition for Trump” and “The First Lady Embraces Clinton.” Its two-part opening was largely a regurgitation of a New York Times story that detailed double-dealing of Clinton via Doug Band, a foundation bigshot-turned-consultant. On “NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt” it was “Money Trail: A hacked memo raises new questions about how the Clintons struck it rich as Hillary Clinton hits the trail with her not-so-secret weapon.” The opening tale was initially about the First Lady embracing Clinton, then largely a recap of a New York Times story that detailed double-dealing of a foundation bigshot-turned-consultant (“not verified by NBC News,” Andrea Mitchell said, as if the qualifier maintained journalistic purity). On ABC's “World News Tonight” with David Muir, there was his hyperbolic opening: “Tonight, breaking news. The new polls just out as Michelle Obama joins Hillary Clinton for the first time on the trail. What they reveal about each other, just as WikiLeaks reveals major questions about millions made by Bill Clinton.” I took a pass on Diane Sawyer's “PREDATOR ON CAMPUS?” segment. But not before seeing the newscast's first commercial, for Otezla, which helps psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Yes, “it increases the risk of depression,” as the ad made clear. But so can the sameness of the evening news some nights. The morning babble “Fox & Friends” started as usual with Trump reporter John Roberts and “PLANE PANIC,” namely the the Mike Pence plane that skidded off a runway. a Fox producer, who was on board, described the scare. It was the same on CNN's “New Day,” at least with the Pence plane, since there was a CNN producer aboard, too. But it also delved into, would you believe this early, actual policy as it checked out Trump and Clinton tax plans (as it's done before). MSNBC's “Morning Joe'” John Heilemann didn't buy the notion of a “tightening” race but sees signs of Clinton's lead accelerating. Like CNN's John King yesterday afternoon Sam Stein rattled off all the big states he could win, like Florida and Ohio, and still get wiped out. Rolling Stone trial There was evidence that University of Virginia administrators were convinced of the article's potential bias the weeks before it actually came out. The dean of students' wariness, articulated in an email, “proved prescient.” (The Washington Post) There was also evidence that the university, in what could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, had the alumni magazine commission a piece on how it handled sexual assaults. Top officials who didn't want to deal with Rolling Stone let themselves be interviewed but, ultimately, there were qualms about the draft and it never saw the light of day. And somewhere at Wrigley Field tonight... Mark Kipnis was a top legal aide to newspaper magnate Conrad Black, and there was collateral damage when Black was convicted and wound up in prison for defrauding investors. Black's Chicago trial showed him and some confederates, one in particular, to be slimeballs. But not Kipnis, who didn't make one penny off the deals and signed various documents as told. A federal judge realized that and, despite the jury's guilty verdict, sentenced him to probation and a $200 fine. Many people thought it was justice at work. You can bet there'll be a similar sense of vindication when he surely shows at Wrigley Field tonight for the first World Series game there in 71 years. His son, Jason, who grew up in the Chicago burbs and was a huge Cubs fan, is the Indians second basemen. He gave his parents his $575,000 signing bonus out of college to assist with the dad's legal expenses, their mortgage payments and his siblings' education. Mike Miner of The Chicago Reader, an alternative weekly I briefly ran, covered the Black prosecution and writes, “If I'm going to root for one player above all others during the World Series, it won't be one of the Cubs. And I mean no disrespect to the Cubs.” (Chicago Reader) Well, I have four soccer games to get to this weekend and no World Series tickets. But I'm not bitter. Yes, nitwit local politicians and radio ad sales reps scored tickets but not me. Again, I'm not bitter. Have a good weekend. Corrections? Tips? Please email me: jwarren@poynter.org.

         ABOUT JOIN CONTACT ADVERTISE READ THE PRINT ISSUE News Sports Opinion Arts & Culture Multimedia FUN News Sports Opinion Arts & Culture Multimedia Fun About Advertise Contact Lifestyles Plan the spookiest pregame with these tips By Odeya Pinkus - October 28, 2016 Kevin Sussy/ Photography Editor Close It’s the end of October and you just pulled your rabbit ears out of the closet. Or maybe you finally tried on that bro tank and realized that this costume was your true form. One way or another, State Street will literally be bursting at the seams with Harley Quinns and Harambes by 1 a.m. But before all that madness starts, before the spilled beer awkwardly ruined your chances with that girl in The Rat, and before you sent that text you shouldn’t have, there was the pregame. Ah yes, the pregame, the precursor to all the weekend madness. At every other pregame, you’re probably listening to Flo Rida and throwing back shots. But not this pregame. This one is different. This is Halloween. 1) Decorations — You don’t need to turn your dorm into a haunted house, and you definitely don’t need to spend a lot of money to make your suite seem festive. When it comes to decorations, it doesn’t have to be fancy. You can use anything that might be scary and hang it up. If you’re a sophomore, try taping up a printed version of your empty Degree Works on the wall. If you’re a senior, then hang up your most recent GRE result. Nothing is scarier than the future looming over your head. But if that doesn’t do it for you, then check out the Halloween section of Wal-Mart for orange lights and fake cobwebs. 2) Music — OK, so now your suite is spooky, but what about the vibes? No Halloween party is complete without some good old tunes, so check out Pipe Dream’s Halloween playlist for all your musical needs. If you need some more ideas, try playing some famous movie scores. Even without the threat of the Dark Lord, John Williams’ score to “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” will get you in a creepy mood. If “Harry Potter” makes you more happy than it does scared, then check out the music from movies like “Jaws” or “Carrie.” 3) Drinks — So, now the mood is properly set, but what is there to drink? Frankly, what you’re drinking doesn’t matter as much as what you are chasing it down with. It might be Halloween, but it’s also still fall, so be festive. For an incredibly seasonal drink, mix Fireball and apple cider. It can be served both hot and cold, so if your mood is “I need to prepare for State Street’s freezing chill,” then sip this warm drink before you trek into the cold. Regardless of your drink, remember that it’s the Solo cup that counts. Get black and orange Solo cups for just the right aesthetic. Now when you wake up in the morning and need to clean your whole suite, you’ll still feel in the holiday spirit. 4) Games — Sure, you have drinks and vibes, but what about games and activities? Halloween is the perfect time to show off your knowledge of fortune telling. If you don’t have that knowledge, then it’s a good time to start learning. Try reading your friends’ fortunes with tarot cards, or pull out a Ouija board to connect with the spirits of Binghamton’s past. If those games don’t satisfy you, then go for something simple, like “pin the tail on the donkey.” For a scarier version, get political and try pinning the candidate in the Oval Office.

(Mark Quinn) Related Stories Costco store proposed for Thunder Bay Walmart to stop taking Visa in Canadian stores Goliath vs. Goliath: consumers caught in middle of high-stakes fee fight between Visa and Walmart City officials in Thunder Bay, Ont. say work continues behind the scenes to try to bring a Costco location to the Lakehead. The city has been in discussions with the developer for the big box retailer for some time now, and mayor Keith Hobbs told CBC News more talks are planned. Costco store proposed for Thunder Bay "We're talking about pricing, pricing of buildings," he said, adding that remediating land set aside for the project is also on the slate. "The city of Thunder Bay is really fixated on Costco. They want it more than an event centre I'd think." Hobbs said he's been working to get the retailer to build a location in the city for the past five years. "I think a Costco would be great for this community," he continued. "It's frustratingly slow." According to Hobbs, city manager Norm Gale is scheduled to speak with the developer soon, where he's slated to receive another update. "The municipality has done everything that we can do to bring Costco here, and work with the developer," Hobbs said. "It's basically in their hands."

Posted: Friday, October 28, 2016 2:00 am Sharing the love Jessica Else - The Garden Island The Garden Island Newspaper | 0 comments LIHUE — Receiving a $25 gift card in 2012 is a memory that will forever stick with Aaliyah Keala Nero. She and her family spent two months at the YWCA women’s shelter that year and when they needed it most, someone gave them that card. Now Keala, who turns 11 on December 20, honors that day with a gift card giveaway on her birthday and she administers that giveaway through a foundation she started last year: Keala’s Big Sister Club. She collects the gift cards from donors in the community. “I want to give back because it felt good to get that $25 gift card,” Keala said. “The cards go to kids in need and they can get things like school supplies or food, too.” Last year was the debut gift card giveaway and Keala gave away seven cards. This year, her goal is to distribute 50 in a ceremony that will be held at Kukui Grove on Dec. 18. “The gift cards can come from anywhere on Kauai,” Keala said. “They can come from Times, Walmart, Kmart — a lot of stores.” Originally, Keala targeted girls as recipients of the gift cards and as the focus of her foundation. “I don’t have any sisters and my mom suggested starting a foundation so I can be a sister to other girls,” Keala said. Her mother, Stephanie Shinno, said Keala, who has two brothers, kept asking for a sister, so she suggested starting a foundation. “She really wanted a sister but that wasn’t going to be happening,” Shinno said. “So, the foundation was a way for her to get that.” “It was supposed to be just girls, but then I thought about my brothers and I thought it’d be good to have boys too,” Keala said. The idea behind the gift card giveaway is to help people and Keala said she’d like to do that for the rest of her life. “I want to be a kid’s doctor when I grow up because I want to help them be healthier,” Keala said. In her down time, Keala likes to play sports and run, she models for Maile Taylor Models and she’s running for Miss Kauai Pre-Teen USA 2017.

Charlena Poole had learned on Oct. 18 that police in Rio Rancho, a suburb of Albuquerque, found her 17-year-old daughter wandering near a Walmart close to a busy intersection. Jones was last seen by her mother on Dec. 17, 2015. Missing Saginaw teen found in New Mexico But on Oct. 19, Poole had landed in Albuquerque, and Jones was relieved to see her mother. "Yes!" was what she said when Jones saw her mother. Relieved to be finally going home, Jones said that she was happy. And thanks to the generosity of Saginaw businessman Gil Johnson, president of Saginaw Valley Ford Lincoln, Poole was able to get her daughter home faster than if she would have had to raise money herself. Johnson read about Jones being found by police in New Mexico, and how Poole was trying to raise money to bring her home. Johnson decided to purchase plane tickets for them. Businessman pays for plane tickets for found missing girl It was Jones' first time on an airplane. "I got like, kind of light headed," Jones said. Jones doesn't speak a lot. Usually giving one-word answers to questions. She also avoids eye contact by looking down or gazing at the wall when she does speak. It took a minute for her to remember her first meal when she came home. "Taco Bell," she said before taking a long pause. "Oh yeah, the 5-layer burrito." Poole said her daughter has been through a lot, much of which she still hasn't disclosed to her, just giving her bits and pieces. "My goal is to get her therapy and someone to talk to a few times a week," Poole said. Poole said her daughter now sees a counselor at Solutions Behavioral Health, 1010 N. Niagara St. A spokesperson for the company said, "We are here to serve anyone who needs it and is dealing with any kind of trauma." Poole said that she is also going to focus on getting her daughter back in school for her senior year and prepare her for college. "I'm glad this is over," Poole said through tears. "I wouldn't have wished this on nobody. What I felt and me not knowing. It's beautiful to have her here." They hugged.

Smaller players too have left no stone unturned to maximize gain from loosened customer purse strings for this period, investing heavily in technology back-end platforms and front-end improvements, starting as early as February in some cases. Backend technologies such as warehouse management and demand forecasting systems were the focus for Bengaluru-based CampusSutrra, a collegiate-fashion brand. Dhiraj Agarwal, co-founder, CampusSutra said, “We have invested close to Rs 8-10 lakh to build a customized backend model that works specifically for our needs, focusing only on technology upgrades that have given us maximum returns, including a demand forecasting capability to enable our supply chain to service orders from platforms like Myntra and Amazon.” CampusSutra has also created a real-time software for replenishable goods, along the lines of Walmart’s Retail Link tool that acts as a decision support system. At online fashion retailer Myntra, Products chief, Ambarish Kenghe adds, “We have assisted our brand partners with demand forecasting tools that help them manage demand from our platform.” Delivering on end-user experience A number of initiatives, both ongoing and specific, helped Flipkart-owned Myntra that recently acquired Jabong manage a seamless user experience. “The Myntra mobile app, at 15MB, is much smaller than competition, and does not take up valuable data space on phones. In terms of data usage too, the app takes uses little data according to customers,” says Kenghe. Keeping the patchy Indian cellular network in mind, Myntra has allowed for apps to adapt image resolution depending on the strength of the network. The retailer has also strengthened the payments wallet, with an improved service record of 20% over the previous year, delisting payment wallets that haven’t added value. Kenghe adds, “We also have a full-fledged user experience team at Myntra, comprising actual users, who test all UI/UX customisations and improvements done across our platform. This allows us relevant insight and feedback that translates into significant improvements in terms of user experience.” Adds Ajit Narayanan, SVP and Head-Engineering at Myntra, “To anticipate and manage the spike in demand during the promotion, we run continuous simulations that mimic actual user traffic patterns on the app. We also had admission control systems in place to manage a surge of traffic. This allowed us to queue users, and allow systematic access while also manage on-the-spot fixes as and when needed without diluting the end user experience.” Myntra’s microservice architecture was also built to scale out particular services on the app to manage the spikes in Diwali demand. The Diwali demand for Myntra is similar to 25 times the usual BAU (business as usual) figure as seen in Myntra’s EORS (End of Reason sale) in July, adds Kenghe. A focus on scalable solutions has also helped the retailer manage the system of return and exchanges by and large without issue, during this period. Manoj Manalparambil, a designer at a Bengaluru based advertising agency said, “I had placed orders on Myntra during the Diwali promotion. They were delivered the same day, and I not only tried on the clothes but also returned them the same day! It was all on COD and there was no hassle at all.” Myntra had introduced the concept of ‘Try and Buy’, allowing users to try on clothes at home before paying through COD. Logistics and supply chain were a key focus for CampusSutra as well. What the future might look like At Myntra, another feature rolled out during the festive period was the ‘Personalised Store’. Based on machine learning, and leveraging its extensive data centres, Myntra has translated information on customer browsing patterns, understanding price points and brand preferences, to show customers a store front on the app and desktop that is customised to their tastes. Kenghe said, “We can customise the store for everyone, based on both individual preference, and also by location. So for example, someone in Kolkata would have seen a different selection during Durga Pujo than a user elsewhere in the country at the same time.” Even allied sectors such as jewelry and furniture have seen tech innovations being brought in, to differentiate brands in a crowded market. Online jewellery retailer BlueStone introduced Gold ATMs in Bengaluru and Delhi, where customers can purchase certified 24 carat gold coins between one to twenty grams in weight. Taking innovation in technology offline, the brand hopes to mimic the touch and feel aspect of the sector through these ATMs, while also providing customers both convenience of avoiding crowded stores and having to wait for products to be delivered home. With a firm eye on retaining customer loyalty and growing revenues, e-commerce firms are now looking at technology to create brand differentiation that will prove hard to replicate for competition, giving customers reason for celebrations all year round!

The company, based in the capital, Nairobi, is in discussions with foreign and domestic investors that are expected to be concluded within weeks, Chief Executive Officer Atul Shah said by phone Friday. The company grew its number of stores to more than 60 across Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania that resulted in debt ballooning to 15 billion shillings ($148 million) from 4 billion shillings in 2010, he said. “We are negotiating on the price of the stake, so we cannot comment on the value of the business,” Shah said. “We hope to conclude talks soon, in the next one month.” Kenya has sub-Saharan Africa’s fastest-growing retail market, with consumer spending having surged 67 percent over the past five years, according to the London-based Oxford Business Group. That’s attracted new entrants including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Game chain, Carrefour SA of France and Gaborone, Botswana-based Choppies Enterprises Ltd. Formal retailers account for as much as 40 percent of sales in East Africa’s biggest economy, second only to South Africa and double that of Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy. Nakumatt, which begun as a mattress store half a century ago, targets mostly middle- and upper-income customers. Indigenous competitors include Tusker Mattresses Ltd., or Tuskys, Naivas Ltd. and Chandarana Foodplus. Expansion Program Nakumatt announced plans in 2015 to add 14 new branches over two years as it sought to boost annual revenue to more than $1 billion. Last year, it concluded the purchase of Yako Supermarkets Ltd., a closely held retailer. “They could have expanded too quickly,” Eric Musau, a senior research analyst at Standard Investment Bank, said by phone. “It is a surprise because it does not seem like they invested too heavily.” Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., Nakumatt’s smaller rival and Kenya’s only publicly listed chain store, is battling to repay creditors as much as 3.6 billion shillings. The company emerged from a four-year receivership in 2010 after a government bailout. “Like any other business operating in this market, Nakumatt Holdings has faced a number of unforeseen business challenges,” the company said in a statement on its Twitter account Thursday. Challenges include higher operating costs and extraneous factors such as risk management against security threats. Kenya has faced a series of attacks by Islamist militant group al-Shabaab over the past five years that targeted an upmarket shopping mall in Nairobi, where Nakumatt had a flagship store, and a university in the northeast of the country. Nakumatt is also renegotiating terms with suppliers and is “undertaking a management enhancement program that involves recruiting and retaining qualified personnel,” according to the statement.

(AP / Paul Sakuma) Mae Anderson, The Associated Press Published Friday, October 28, 2016 1:49AM EDT NEW YORK -- Amazon wants you to order your turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce online this Thanksgiving - its latest effort to make its Prime subscription service a central part of food shopping, much the way it's done for other consumer goods. Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon - which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 - is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It's a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. "Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them," said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It's a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it's expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon near-decade of experimentation "gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas," Sebastian said. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program - $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program - started earlier this month. Amazon doesn't disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it's probably not. Rather, it's a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. "They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they're clearly leveraging that loyal membership base," Sebastian said. Amazon's monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. "I think they've gotten to the point they can be more flexible," Sebastian said. "It's an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they've gained some efficiencies." EVER-EXPANDING PRIME Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it's worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. "If you become a Prime member you buy more from us," he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. "That's what closes the loop from the business angle," he said. After posting little-to-no profit for years each quarter as it invested in its business, Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters. On Thursday, Amazon said net income tripled to $252 million, or 52 cents per share, from $79 million, or 17 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter. That missed analyst expectations of 85 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue jumped 29 per cent to $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $32.57 billion. For the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $42 billion to $45.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $44.7 billion. The third quarter is a seasonally light one compared to the bustling holiday quarter coming up.

Next Article China Puts the Brakes on Additional Free Trade Zones » Trends in China’s E-Commerce Market Posted on June 4, 2014 by China Briefing By Harun Rauf SHANGHAI – China is currently experiencing huge growth in e-commerce. It is estimated that e-commerce in China will be worth US$540 billion by 2015, and by 2020 worth more than e-commerce in the U.S., the UK, Japan, Germany and France combined. This is linked with the number of people connected to the Internet in China, be it via computers or smartphones – there are over 600 million internet users and over 500 million mobile internet users in the country. The Chinese government has a target to connect 1.2 billion people (85 percent of the population) to 3G or 4G mobile internet by 2020. To date, several foreign firms attempting to break into this lucrative market have met with failure: eBay has withdrawn from China, while Wal-Mart and Best Buy are still struggling to compete with local firms. Alternatively, some success may be found through joint operations with a Chinese firm. Shoprunner, a U.S. rival to Amazon.com, recently struck a deal with Alibaba Group Ltd. in which Alibaba Group purchased a 39 percent stake in Shoprunner for an investment of US$202 million. Under the terms of the deal, Alibaba Group will assist Shoprunner’s expansion into China in exchange for allowing Alibaba to supply U.S. goods to Chinese consumers hungry for foreign luxury items. While there are plenty of physical shopping options in China’s larger cities, lower-tier cities cater less to international luxury brands. In light of this demand, the internet has allowed many retailers to offer goods to consumers in lower-tier cities and further afield without the need and cost of setting up a physical outlet. China’s economic rise coinciding with the dawn of the information age means its consumers are web savvy and are thus increasingly going online to make many of their purchases. The internet serves as an information source for digital consumers who regularly log on to review sites and use social media to make consumption choices. Furthermore, Chinese consumer trust in online shops is stronger than previously imagined and people are more willing to buy luxury items online. KPMG recently surveyed 10,200 people on their online spending habits on luxury goods. One of the most striking pieces of information discovered by the report was that the last item purchased online by respondents cost on average RMB 1,515 (US$243). The average price paid for items increased according to customer age. The average amount spent by those in the under-20 age group was RMB726. This jumped to RMB1,657 for 25-29 year olds and continued to climb for the oldest age group surveyed, 45-49 year olds, who spent an average of RMB2,108 on luxury goods purchased online.

However, women buy more luxury items online and spend more overall than men. This plainly demonstrates the significant sums of money now being spent online by Chinese consumers. The primary motivation for consumers to shop online is price, and digital consumers were found to be more sensitive to price changes. This is primarily due to the ease of making comparisons online, but also because social networking and review sites allow consumers to make more informed choices. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed felt that when buying online they felt more assured of the item’s country of origin. Convenience and a greater range of available products were also found to be important consumer motivators. Twenty-eight percent of respondents opted for online shopping to find something unique, and this proportion rose to 41 percent for those aged 25 or under. There were some common concerns expressed by digital consumers. Seventy-eight percent of respondents were concerned with the authenticity of items sold online. Digital consumers were also concerned about not being able to test out products before buying them (70 percent) and sizing (55 percent). Reliability of sellers was also a worry: forty-eight percent reported concerns that the product shown online would differ from that delivered, 41 percent doubted online sellers’ guarantee of after-sales services, and 37 percent raised concerns about complicated return procedures. Alibaba has gone some distance to address these concerns. Its Tmall site guarantees genuine products and gives users a more direct route to connect with sellers. Tmall has become so popular that international high fashion brands such as Burberry have established their own shops on the site. The survey also addressed buying trends such as which categories of products consumers tend to buy online. Cosmetics were found to be the most popular type of luxury product bought online—with 51 percent of respondents having used the Internet to make purchases in this category. The next most popular categories were women’s shoes (39 percent), women’s apparel (36 percent), and accessories and bags (both at 34 percent). RELATED: E-Commerce Trends and Developments in Asia-Pacific The survey found that 70 percent of online shoppers use their home computers to shop online, 60 percent use their smartphones and 30 percent use tablet computers, with a trend toward greater smartphone use. With faster mobile internet speeds and websites increasingly catering to mobile users, it is becoming more and more convenient to use smartphones wherever and whenever one desires. In time, with further innovation, drawbacks such as small screen sizes and poor connections will be remedied by improvements to user interfaces and investment into mobile internet infrastructure.  Despite these challenges, using phones to shop online is already very popular in China; around 55 percent of China’s smartphone users have made a mobile payment, while the equivalent figure in the U.S. is just 12 percent. This underlines the importance of facilitating access to online shops for smartphone users. The primary payment method for online purchases in China has changed over time. Previously cash-on-delivery was the favored method of payment, but this has since changed to automated online payments. Around 70 percent of payments are now electronic, a reversal of five years ago when around 70 percent of payments were cash-on-delivery. The Chinese government has granted over 200 licenses allowing firms to set up electronic payment systems but the market remains dominated by four main players — AliPay, TenPay, Union Pay and 99bill combined account for 85.5 percent of the electronic wallet market in China. Overall, the survey found that consumers in China are more partial to shopping online, especially through their smartphones. All age groups displayed high confidence in online platforms.The survey found that as people get older their average per-item online spending increases. While men were found to spend more on individual purchases, women spend more overall in their online purchases. Finally, the report found a shift away from cash-on-delivery payments toward the use of online payments. Asia Briefing Ltd. is a subsidiary of Dezan Shira & Associates.

Candidates Speak at Forum Hannah Pope� There were about 25 members of the public at the old Hillsboro School House last Thursday for a community forum for candidates vying for District 3 Board of Commissioners (BOC) seat. Incumbent Gene Trammell was present along with challenger Ross Hays. Of those 25 persons in attendance, only two of those signed up to ask the candidates questions, although many in attendance, voiced opinions of their own. For introductions Mr. Trammell started stating that �I just completed my first term. I am a retired 21 year school superintendent, prior to that I was a vocational Ag teacher and even earlier than that, I was in the dairy business for 13-14 years.� Mr. Hays began by saying, �I care about y�all. I believe that we need more �folks� voices heard. I believe that the BOC does some good stuff. There is also some things done that I disagree with.� He also stated that he was from Turtle Cove when prompted from an audience member. Of the requests to ask questions, Andrew Boyd asked Mr. Trammell �I see articles in the newspaper and hear buzz about growth. My question is who is looking for growth?� Mr. Trammel responded by stating, �A majority of people in Jasper County like the rural environment � the country flavor. But growth can be done properly. I would like to see industrial growth.� Mr. Trammell then stated that every home provides $1 in tax revenue to $3 in costs for services. Industries generate $2 for every $1 in costs for services. He also stressed that he was interested, primarily in �green industry,� as in �industry that fits our folks.� These industries, he said, have no waste and employ our people. He said that he is in favor of improving the quality of life for the people in the county and is an advocate for those things such as recreation and the public library. Mr. Hays replied by saying, �I don�t want industrial growth. When I think of industrial growth I think of steel mills. I am in favor of small businesses. I work in a small business, I see what good a small business in this community does. I think of my co-workers more as family than of actual co-workers.� �And I don�t mind having to go out of town for things. I don�t want a Walmart in Jasper County I like it just the way it is.� He concluded by saying that he believes that the county should maintain and preserve the Jasper County that �we have.� Mr. Trammell retorted with �No growth equals no jobs. Costs continue to increase and we�re going to have to change somewhat to absorb those costs. We�ve cut the budget � but citizens want services. I believe that change � it�s inevitable, and if we guide it and plan for that change that we can preserve what people love about the county.� There was some discussion amongst the audience and the candidates chimed in, as to road conditions. Mr. Trammell stated that District 3 has 43 percent of the roads in Jasper County. He also stated that it costs $350,000-$500,000 a mile to pave those roads. �We received just over $700,000 this year from the state. Mr. Trammell stated that there were more roads than money to repair them and that the BOC had been triple surfacing some, using LMIG money on others and �doing the best we can with what we have. It�s not the best, but it�s what we can afford.� Preston Wynens asked about putting down soil instead of rock on the roads. He said that he knows that it has worked well in Jones County. Mr. Hays stated, �We�re not maintaining what we have now. I�ve been riding roads over the last few days, a lot of them, and the public works are good people, but I drove the triple surfaced roads and they�re not good. There are still pot holes. How are we going to sustain growth and maintain what we have?� After a few minutes, Mr. Boyd asked about the math for roads. He asked/asserted that �we will never catch up,� on road repairs and paving based on the number of roads and the cost to maintain them. A random attendee asked the question, �Is the autopen for signing checks acceptable?� Mr. Hays replied that he didn�t want a machine to sign the county�s checks. He said, �I need to see what�s going on. I know that checks sent out have been done so prior to approval at the commission meetings. Mr. Trammell informed the audience that there was a process in place that included the CFO and invoices are reviewed by the department head and if need be, Mike [Benton], the county manager. Mr. Hays stated that �it�s not the county employee�s job to do the county�s business.� There was some discussion and an impromptu comment from Ken Tillman to Mr. Trammell, as to having five commissioners, surely they could sign checks. Mr. Trammell informed a comment/question from another citizen as to how many invoices the BOC may have a month for which he replied 1,000-2,000. Mary Patrick stated that the county was buying a crack sealer for the roads, but Public Works had no supervision, and asked who can use it? Mr. Trammell advised that even he could use a crack sealer. Mr. Trammell followed up by saying, �The room for improvement is the biggest room in the house. None of us are doing our best. Yes there are better things that we can be doing, but we�re doing the best that we can with what we have.� There were comments as to the citizen�s comments being at the end of the meetings. Someone asked if those running would push for comments to be moved. Mr. Hays said that, �this was a rough subject and I don�t care for comments at the end of meetings.� He stated that he wanted 10 minutes after each business item for discussion and presentation (two minutes per person). He stated that �this is a simple courtesy to let the people paying taxes inform the BOC of what they want.� �I am only one of five,� Mr. Trammell stated. �We have found that having the comments at the end works best. We encourage the people to come to us with any issues that they are having. They usually do so at least three days before the meeting. If you let 10 people talk, there will be 11 ways to resolve the issue. When do you have time to evaluate?� After this there was much discussion about the BOC signing non-disclosure agreements. Mr. Hays said that he would not sign one unless there was a law that stated he must. Mr. Trammell said that at times you can�t avoid signing one. Mr. Trammell explained that companies today will not do business with the county unless an agreement is signed. Mr. Trammell explained that there are some industries that do not want publicity when looking to relocate as they may not have decided or told the current location that they were moving. He also explained that there was one instance where a company wanted to bring a process here with a pending patent. He stated that a non-disclosure agreement was signed that pertained to the patent. He also noted that a non-disclosure was just to get it through to voting time. He said that it will still be voted on in a meeting before final approval. �You�re not going to see a time without non-disclosure agreements,� Mr. Trammell ended.  submit your comments  Sitemap { Magazine Template by bulletlink.com }

But at what point does our kindness become our downfall? And how do we assert ourselves while coming off with confidence and not uncertainty? I set out to find the answers after a lot of the stories we air here on 7News made me question how I would react. In surveillance tapes from September at the Moundsville Walmart, a man is seen walking to a self checkout line with a woman. She pays for his item, then gives him cash back. According to police the man, who was eventually arrested in Belmont County, approaches mostly females, is insistent, invades space, and intimidates. Now imagine yourself in that woman's shoes. What would you have done if he asked you to pay for his item and for cash back? Many of us don't prepare ourselves for a moment like that.  Former police officer Michelle Molnar has seen plenty of crimes committed against women in her days patrolling the streets in Ohio.  I set out to find out how women can protect themselves, and learned some valuable information along the way.  First, I took a mini self-defense course with Lieutenant Kevin Kettler with the Wheeling Police Department. He's been teaching rape prevention and defense for about four years. He showed me a basic move, using your toe area or the inside of the foot to strike an attacker in the nerve cluster that runs down the front of the foot. He demonstrated the move, where an attacker may grab a woman by the shoulders. If she grabs on to him, she can take her toe or the inside of her foot to strike the nerve, then deliver a knee strike to the gut. It's true that an attack can happen anywhere, but Kettler says a majority of the time, women know the suspect. Bars are one of the most common places that a predator can get to know their victim. Kettler calls it a "target rich environment" - a place where people are intoxicated and can easily let their defenses down.  Statistics show that six out of ten rapes take place in someone's home or residence, and only about one in 12 attacks would happen in 'darker' place like a parking garage. Another thing that makes women vulnerable is a lack of attention to her surroundings. "Perpetrators are now getting lazier. They don't want to fight. They just want to do their damage and go," Molnar said.  "Perpetrators are now getting lazier. They don't want to fight. They just want to do their damage and go," Kettler added. Confidence also plays a big role in how a predator may view a woman. Michelle said walking around with your head up and looking someone in the eye can send them walking away, when you could have been a victim. Michelle's salon, Five Star Spray Tan in Elm Grove, hosts something called "Safe and Sassy Saturday" on the first weekend each month. Women are invited to come in between noon and 4 p.m. to check out the Damsel in Defense products she sells and test them out to feel their power.  "You can't wait for your husband to come home and take care of you, you can't wait for the guy walking down the street to take care of you, because most people, they don't want to be bothered. They don't want to get involved," she said.  Lieutenant Kettler offers a number of tips to women, most importantly: pay attention to your surroundings. If you're walking to your car, have your keys and pepper spray (if you use it) handy. Carry yourself with your head high, and always listen to your intuition.  "If you start getting clues or something starts telling you 'I shouldn't do this' you should probably listen to it. That inner voice that tells you that you're being put in a dangerous situation," Kettler said.  Kettler is willing to teach free classes to any groups of women who want to learn self-defense. He has a 45 minute power point presentation, then does a hands-on demonstration. If you are interested, call the Wheeling Police Department at 304-234-3664.  Michelle's salon is located at 40 Junior Avenue in Wheeling, and her next Safe and Sassy Saturday will be held on November 5.

Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon — which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 — is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It's a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. "Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them," said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It's a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it's expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon's near-decade of experimentation "gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas," Sebastian said. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program — $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program — started earlier this month. Amazon doesn't disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it's probably not. Rather, it's a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. "They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they're clearly leveraging that loyal membership base," Sebastian said. Amazon's monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. "I think they've gotten to the point they can be more flexible," Sebastian said. "It's an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they've gained some efficiencies." EVER-EXPANDING PRIME Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it's worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. "If you become a Prime member you buy more from us," he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. "That's what closes the loop from the business angle," he said. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. fell in after-market trading on Thursday after the online retailer reported third-quarter net income that missed analyst expectations. The Seattle-based company said it had profit of $252 million, or 52 cents per share. The average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 85 cents per share. The online retailer posted revenue of $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $32.57 billion. For the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $42 billion to $45.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $44.7 billion.

Skip to content The Elm The Student Newspaper of Washington College since 1930 Primary Menu Home News Opinion Columns Letters Sports Lifestyle Student Life Advertising Archives Meet the Press Creepy Clowns Re-enter U.S. Zeitgiest: Odd Reports of Recent Clown Sightings Sweep the Nation, Annoy All by The Elm October 27, 2016 Filed under: Opinion By Amy Rudolph Elm Staff Writer As if societal tensions, innocent people dying, poor presidential options and Zika weren’t enough to worry about, now we have killer clowns. The crazy clown phenomenon has been a Halloween staple for decades but the trend really took off after the release of “American Horror Story: Freakshow.” In “Freakshow,” there is a murderous clown that terrorizes a town by luring women and children into the woods and then either killing or torturing them. The character is depicted with a sinister smile, uncontrollable hair, and dead, constantly staring eyes. Being the freaks that we are in America, this quickly became a Halloween costume that you could buy at popular stores such as Walmart and PartyCity. People have been scared of clowns since long before this, as clowns went from happy, silly entertainers to beings that make us uncomfortable and fearful the minute that they smile. The adoption of kill clowns in media and costumes to look the part have caused unforeseen consequences. When “American Horror Story” creator, Ryan Murphy created Clown, he probably never expected people to mimic that look and go out and terrorize real living people. There have been countless reports in over 10 states of clowns scaring unsuspecting citizens at night and even robbing or assaulting them in the process. Many women and children have reported instances in which clowns attempted to lure them into the woods at knifepoint. College campuses have been put on lockdown because of these incidents and even some places in South Carolina have even begun instituting curfews to protect their residents, according to Heavy.com. The “trend,” as some news circulations have been referring to it as, has even spread to other countries such as Germany where two teenage girls were assaulted with baseball bats and knives, each on a separate occasion, according to the Morgenpost. One woman in Germany was threatened with a chain saw by a clown jumping out of a bush, also according to Morgenpost. This problem is not just an American one. Thousands of tweets have surfaced in which people state that if they see a clown lurking in their neighborhood they would not hesitate to assault the clown first. Police departments in Utah have urged residents to not harm the clowns as they did not want “innocent people” getting hurt. Many people saw the irony in this as stories flash across our televisions far too frequently of actually innocent black people being gunned down by police without robbing anyone or threatening anyone at knifepoint. Since more and more citizens have thought to react violently to clown sightings, a new, ridiculous movement, “Clown Lives Matter” has popped up in some states with some of these bozos actually forming protests to demand equal rights to terrorize others around the country. Unfortunately, clowns will not be arrested just for lurking around town and being creepy as that is not a crime in the U.S., and as a result, many police forces will not investigate any creepy clown sightings unless a crime is actively being committed. So standing on the side of the road yelling at people, trying to lure unsuspecting victims into a wooded area and in general causing a disturbance are rights that clowns get but not anyone else? These actions, that we cannot protect ourselves from as many police have given up, can have an extremely negative effect on our quality of life. If you have to start looking around at night to avoid getting mugged by a creepy clown or your children cannot play outside without the threat of being nabbed by a knife wielding lunatic, your rights are being infringed upon. It seems as though clown lives do matter more than anyone else’s. This raises some serious concerns about American priorities. When we have so many other things to be worrying about, clowns should not be one of them. In trying to better understand how to combat the creepy killer clown craze, psychologists and researchers in both Germany and the U.S. have tried to pinpoint what makes the clowns want to go out and do this in the first place. Some experts have said that it has something to do with wanting to exert power over another person by scaring them and once you do that, you can either assault or rob them. These theories make sense, but ignore the fact that people would not do this if they knew they would get caught. The lack of police enforcement around this issue has only fed into the problem rather than addressing it. It is now a crazy clown free-for-all until someone steps up and puts an end to this madness. With Halloween quickly approaching and children becoming more and more eager to go trick or treating, this issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible.

What are you Afraid Of? Thu, 10/27/2016 - 7:36pm -- Hannah J. Moore I wanted to write something Halloween themed for this column but had a hard time solidifying a topic. One idea was about how people should just enjoy the holiday despite its “pagan” origins, because even Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter have “pagan” references. I thought about describing why some types of costumes are insensitive, like Native American headdresses or the latex suicide wounds Walmart was selling on their online store until they were removed. Another idea I had was talking about how a pair of animal ears and lingerie aren’t a real costume, not trying to police what women wear, but commenting on the hypersexualization of a holiday based on death. Gross.  Instead, I’m going to talk about fear, something as ubiquitous to Halloween as sticky pumpkin seeds or a white bed sheet with two holes cut out for eyes.  Fear is an unpleasant emotion that develops in response to a perceived danger of the present or future that can produce both physical and behavioral effects … at least that’s what the expert psychologists say. Halloween is the only holiday where we willingly subject ourselves to horror films and out-of-the-ordinary situations just for the sake of being afraid. I used to consider Halloween my favorite holiday, mainly because I like free candy and the sound of crunching leaves under my feet, but nobody told me that when you get older you have to buy your own candy and that Arkansas’ trees don’t shed their leaves fully until November. I’ll never understand intentionally frightening yourself in celebration of a holiday, because, quite frankly, the experts were right in saying that fear is unpleasant.  That being said, I’ve been afraid of a lot of things in my short lifetime. As a kid, I was afraid of talking to anyone outside my family. I used to be afraid to march in the end-of-the-school-year parade in elementary school. In middle school, I was afraid of making new friends after moving. In high school, I was afraid of dating and graduating. As a senior in college, I’m still afraid of dating and graduating. To be honest, I’m still afraid of a lot of things. And it’s not even the things themselves that I’m afraid of, but the potential for failure. I was afraid that people wouldn’t like me, that I’d get my heart broken again, that I wouldn’t amount to anything.  The only good advice I’ve heard lately dealing with overcoming fear came from my favorite TV show, “Game of  Thrones:” “The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords.” This is the nerdy, less cliche version of “the only thing to fear is fear itself.”  If I wanted to make friends but sat quietly at my desk and didn’t talk to anyone, I wouldn’t have made any friends. If I want to date someone but I don’t ask them out or tell them that I’m interested, I’m never going to date them. If there’s an open position at my dream company but I don’t apply, I’m definitely not going to get the job. Fear hinders you from accomplishing your goals, and that can be more harmful than trying and failing. You can’t predict the future, unless you’ve read “The Walking Dead” comic books before the TV show airs like my roommate has. If you at least try, there’s still a chance that you’ll succeed, make that friend, date that person or get that job, but if you don’t try, you’ll automatically fail. Isn’t that what we feared in the first place?  I take my previous statement back; subjecting ourselves to fear isn’t as exclusive to Halloween as I once thought.  I now ask the rhetorical question: what are you afraid of? Take a second to think about it. What are you really afraid of? Now go do it. It’s better to have tried and failed than to have failed automatically by never trying. Call this my own version of “it’s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.” Halloween is the holiday for appropriation, after all.    285 reads The Bison Multimedia See interviews, features, and more from the Bison's multimedia team.

It was a third-floor walk-up, very large, and only $850 a month. When my roommate moved out, the landlord said that I actually was subletting against the lease, which wasn’t true. When I came home one day, they had hired movers to put all my stuff in storage, and changed the locks. I took my case to the Residential Tenancy Branch and won, but I couldn’t get my apartment back. It took six months to get through the tribunal, and by that time they had repainted the apartment, upped the rent to $1300, and moved someone else in. It was a sneak renoviction. Luckily I was renting a studio for my art, and after I was evicted, I was able to move into that space. Back in 1986, 339 Railway challenged the city bylaws so that parts of Chinatown and downtown’s industrial district will permit artists to live in their studios—provided that more than 10 per cent of the square footage isn’t modified for living purposes. Because it’s a commercial tenancy, though, it’s not covered under the Residential Tenancy Act. I lived there for five years, but they were able to evict me without much notice. There were 30 people that lost their work space, and a number lost their homes. Next I went to a few house showings I found on Craigslist. A number of them told me that the viewings were cancelled because they’ve had too many applications, and the few I did see were packed with people climbing over each other to fill out forms. There were at least a dozen people in line for each one-bedroom condo. It was very discouraging. Instead, I shipped all my stuff up to my Dad’s in Powell River, and decided to live in my van. My overheads are just insurance, gas, and parking. The van is not fuel efficient and parking tickets are bad, so if you’re not careful that can cost a fair bit of money. It’s hard to entertain people, so my social life basically only exists of work. I also can’t cook so I have to go out to restaurants a lot more, which can be expensive. But it’s still cheaper than renting. When I’ve parked to find a spot to sleep for the night, sometimes there’s dozens of other vehicles—mainly all over Strathcona, and in Grandview by the Walmart and Costco. I have no idea how many of us are living in our vans, though. It’s funny. For the last two years, I volunteered to help with the homeless count. I didn’t think that I would be homeless myself one day. I would stay with my Dad full-time, but I work in the film industry, so I have to be here. It’s not difficult to find work, but it’s incredible difficult to find somewhere to live that’s really worth the trouble. It’s a frankly moronic situation that Vancouver’s real estate is so bad that there’s an abundance of work here, but people have nowhere to live. This isn’t Fort McMurray or anything. It’s an industrialized, major city. My long term plans are to save as much money as I can and then get out of Vancouver. I’ve got a leave of absence from medical school, and I’m planning on returning in the autumn next year. Hopefully by then I’ll be out of the van.” Got a story to share? Tweet Kate Wilson here.

They were calling for justice in the police shooting of Keith Scott. The protesters were pushed back up a hill by police who had temporarily closed that section of the freeway in anticipation of the coming protests. Justine Miller jmiller@mcclatchy.com A protestor kicks a tear gas canister fired by Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers along Old Concord Rd. in Charlotte, NC on Sept. 20. A protest began on Old Concord Road at Bonnie Lane, where a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott in the parking lot of The Village at College Downs apartment complex. Jeff Siner jsiner@charlotteobserver.com Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers walk through a haze of tear gas on Old Concord Rd. in Charlotte, NC on Sept. 20. Jeff Siner jsiner@charlotteobserver.com 1 of 3 i By Michael Gordon, Mark Washburn and Fred Clasen-Kelly mgordon@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Against the fury of a mob and a hailstorm of stone, Charlotte police were powerless to rescue even themselves in the earliest hours of September’s rioting. Filings this week in federal court provide the most detailed accounting to date of two nights of unprecedented violence that crippled Charlotte after the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott on the afternoon of Sept. 20. Details of the city’s response are contained in a filing made by city attorneys in response to a complaint from eight Charlotte residents that police used tear gas, riot techniques and other forms of excessive force against peaceful protesters. Their attorneys asked a judge to issue a temporary restraining order banning police from using such tactics against non-violent demonstrators. What emerges is a portrait of a city overwhelmed by violence, fueled by deepening national protests of police shootings of African-Americans. Although thousands demonstrated peacefully for a week, the account focuses on pockets of vandalism, looting and assaults on police that attracted international attention. According to the city’s chronology, evidence technicians began to be escorted from the scene about four hours after an officer shot Scott. Darkness fell and menacing crowds gathered around them. At 9 p.m., an officer found himself trapped in his car – he was surrounded by a crowd and people started jumping on his vehicle and tried to overturn it. Officers who came to his aid were then encircled by the taunting crowd, estimated at 150 people. A call went out for two squads of officers from the Civil Emergency Unit, the city’s riot unit. By 9:30 p.m., they set up a defensive line so the last of the crime scene officers could reach their cars. Commanders then decided that removing the 30 or so riot police might de-escalate the situation. A CATS bus was sent to get them, but agitation was growing around them. At 10 p.m., tensions surged. “News cameras turn on lights for live broadcasts,” says an affidavit filed in the case, “and the level of irritation in the crowd grows noticeably.” At 10:15 p.m., a fusillade of bottles rained down on officers. Then some in the crowd found a pile of rocks at a nearby rail bed improvement project. They unleashed them on police, who retreated to the bus – and were quickly surrounded. Response to suit In the court filing made by city attorneys Daniel Peterson and Mark Newbold, police acknowledge using an array of munitions – from tear gas to smoke canisters to sting grenades and non-lethal bullets. But they say they used the chemical weapons and other force either to defend themselves or after giving protesters ample warning. Documents describe police fleeing the crowd that had threatened to overwhelm them on the first night of violence, when officers were pelted with rocks for at least three hours – leading to more than a dozen injuries – before protective shields arrived. In another instance, an uptown protester rubbed the blood of shooting victim Justin Carr upon the faces of several officers standing near her. In several instances, police commanders limited their response to the growing violence in an attempt to defuse tensions, documents indicate. Amid the largely peaceful protests, city attorneys said, officers were sometimes the target of violence from residents they were sworn to protect. “Rather, this case is about a throng of people, in the immediate hours and days after Mr. Scott’s death, that took advantage of the perceived anonymity of the crowd, in order to perpetrate mayhem,” they wrote. “Specifically, CMPD officers were assaulted with rocks and other large projectiles ... private citizens were assaulted, one person was murdered, businesses were damaged and looted, tractor trailers were ransacked, traffic was blockaded and fires were set in the streets of Charlotte and on Interstate 85.” [READ MORE: Sept. 21: Man shot in uptown during protests] [READ MORE: Sept. 21: State of emergency declared after rioting] [READ MORE: Sept. 23: Scott’s wife releases cell phone video] [READ MORE: Sept 24: Police release videos of Scott shooting] [READ MORE: Sept. 26: Mayor faces furious crowd at City Council meeting] [READ MORE: Oct. 6: Reconstruction of the Scott shooting scene] Braxton Winston, one of the citizens who brought the lawsuit against police, said demonstrators at the shooting scene that afternoon were demanding that Mayor Jennifer Roberts, Police Chief Kerr Putney and other city officials come to the scene to answer questions about Scott’s death. Police and citizens at first interacted calmly. Officers answered questions and engaged in conversation with people crowded around the shooting scene. But according to the city’s filings, Winston’s own Facebook video stream also reflected how the civility deteriorated. “F--- the police,” the crowd chanted. Other bystanders screamed in officers’ faces, “You’re a bitch ass n-----,” the documents said. First tear gas Surrounded at the CATS bus on the first night and under assault by rocks, Sgt. Sam Orlov grabbed what he thought was a smoke canister to drive the crowd back. Instead, he threw a tear gas container, the filings said. According to an affidavit from Maj. Mike Campagna, Capt. Ken Schul used the bus public address system to warn that police would use chemical agents if the crowds did not allow the bus to leave. Instead members of the crowd moved in and rocks flew, keeping some police from boarding the bus. Police fired what is known as a stinger grenade, which contains rubber pellets and an irritant known as OC powder, then a flash bomb, the documents said. Then the bus pulled out. Other riot officers were still lined up nearby on old Concord Road. As the crowd descended, the police formed two lines, back to back, to protect themselves. They were soon surrounded. Officer Chris Frunzi was struck and went down. Officer Benjamin Hearn was hit in the shoulder and forearm. Officer Jay Rubino took a rock to the head and suffered a concussion. Just before 11 p.m., police gave another dispersal order followed by hand-tossed tear-gas canisters “in a self-defensive effort to cease the barrage of rocks being thrown at officers,” the documents said. Rifle case in car Police tried to head south but were blocked by the crowd. They moved to a nearby overpass, leaving a marked police car behind. It was soon looted, forcing the officers to push back into the crowd to the car to keep a rifle case from being stolen “and used by a rioter on a civilian or CMPD officer,” the filing said. All the while, the barrage of rocks continued, the violence worsening. Outnumbered 4 to 1, police started firing non-lethal ammunition containing a powdered irritant. At 11:45 p.m., a portion of the crowd headed toward nearby W.T. Harris Boulevard, damaging two police cars. At midnight, after police say they had been under attack for some three hours, protective shields finally arrived. At 1 a.m., the crowd headed toward Interstate 85. Twenty-five minutes later, with police now more than a mile away, demonstrators blocked traffic at Harris and North Tryon Street and then on I-85 by pulling construction barrels into the roadways. “At that point, CMPD had no choice but to re-engage to stop this illegal conduct and dispatched a full platoon of [riot] officers to I-85,” the filing said. Looting of I-85 trucks The violence would continue for more than two hours – with rioters throwing rocks from overpasses on passing I-85 traffic. Tractor-trailers were stopped and looted. Fires were set. Traffic on I-85 halted. Police say they used stinger grenades and other techniques to disperse the crowds. At 3:14 a.m., police reported that rioters were hurling alternators taken from the looted trucks. Several more officers were injured. Capt. Nate King was struck both by a bottle and a rock. Twenty minutes later, police warned employees of the Wal-Mart on North Tryon to lock their doors. Looters broke in anyway. “Employees inside were terrified,” Campagna wrote. “Mobile CEU officers respond quickly and are able to prevent significant damage and looting.” Some began breaking into nearby convenience stores – a QT and a Circle K. It was 4 a.m. before order was restored. Police said about 25 officers were injured, at least two with concussions. Sept. 21: Uptown erupts The next evening, about 1,000 people gathered in Marshall Park to protest the Scott shooting. Later, about half walked to the Little Rock AME Zion Church while the others headed west toward the EpiCentre. Although the uptown group did not have a parade permit, CMPD decided to let the march continue with police keeping traffic out of the way. Just after 8 p.m., they entered the EpiCentre. Campagna was the only officer inside. Within minutes, he heard the shattering of windows at the Kandy Bar and called for help. Chairs were then hurled at Suite, another club at the EpiCentre. Campagna called in the riot squad, led by Capt. Rob Dance. At 8:25 p.m., the riot-clad officers were set up in front of the Omni Hotel, then moved between the Ritz-Carlton and the EpiCentre. When rioters began leaving the EpiCentre, police pulled back to de-escalate, the city said in its filing. “However they had been spotted by the crowd, which immediately followed them up the street.” When the crowd tried to follow the riot squad into the Omni, police established a line by the parking garage on West Trade Street. Crowds moved in. Water bottles were thrown at police. Tear gas at omni. And flash bang? #KeithScott pic.twitter.com/YrdxZ9K29L&mdash; Ely Portillo (@ESPortillo) September 22, 2016 A bang and then blood At 8:30 p.m., “a fuse lit explosive device” – apparently some kind of firecracker – came out of the crowd and exploded at the feet of police. Dance asked superiors for permission to use tear gas. He was turned down out of concern for the number of peaceful demonstrators, filings said. A minute later, 21-year-old Justin Carr, standing between the Omni and College Street, was hit in the head by a gunshot. Rayquan Borum, who police say was in the crowd that night and was caught on surveillance looting a nearby bar, has since been arrested and charged with murder. Authorities say he has admitted to shooting Carr. But the crowd, believing Carr had been shot by police, erupted. A woman who says she was standing next to Carr – later identified as Elsie Marie Greene – rubbed Carr’s blood on the arms and faces of officers Dennis McClain, Nick Palomba and Charles Bolduc, court documents allege. (Greene, who is charged with three counts of assault on a police officer, wouldn’t comment. The officers could not be reached.) Meanwhile, the crush of people blocked medical personnel from reaching Carr, the filing said. Firefighters finally carried him to a van nearby, then took him to a Medic ambulance. At 8:40 p.m., as he drove to the scene, Officer Joseph Pendergrast was struck by a wrench thrown from the crowd. His windshield was also shattered, sending glass into his eye, Campagna’s affidavit said. Looting of the EpiCentre continued. Within minutes, full bottles of beer, liquor and champagne – along with large rocks and concrete – were being thrown at police at Trade and College. According to the affidavit, police began giving a series of dispersal orders to the crowd just before 9 p.m. Eventually, they gave bystanders 20 minutes to leave, then counted down with subsequent orders. When the crowd failed to disperse, Dance gave the order for tear gas and smoke canisters to be used. But then he was struck in the face with something thrown from the crowd and removed for treatment. He later returned. Assaults on police, bystanders Assaults on police and bystanders continued into the night. A group of demonstrators pushed a trash bin filled with cardboard into Trade Street and tried to set it on fire in front of the Transit Center. Police stopped the blaze from being set. Once police moved into the crowds, dozens of otherwise peaceful demonstrators were arrested and charged with such crimes as failure to disperse, impeding traffic and curfew violations. Najah McEntire of Charlotte says the chaos was overwhelming. When police started firing smoke canisters, she told the Observer that she stood in Trade Street with her arms raised. When she was arrested for failure to disperse, she said a police officer shouted in her ear, “Are you proud of yourself? Are you f------ satisfied?” “I was thinking, ‘At any moment, I could be a hashtag,’ ” McEntire told the Observer this week, an account in which she complimented some of the police she dealt with that night. “I made a mistake. I was in Marshall Park, and then I walk into riot gear? What the hell?” Constitutional rights, but whose? The lawsuit filed by the citizens was timed to allow peaceful protests to proceed without police intervention last weekend. Those demonstrations came and went without incident. But the larger issue of how Charlotte-Mecklenburg police will respond to public protests remains. In their lawsuit, the attorneys for the eight residents accuse police of using policies “designed to target and punish demonstrators, and to deter them from ... speech and assembly activities.” Some of those measures, including the use of flash bombs, chemical agents and excessive force, came without warning, they say, and “advanced no legitimate law enforcement objective.” In response, city attorneys say police are experienced in cooperating with residents involved in peaceful protests. This was a riot, they say, not an expression of constitutional rights. “Assaults on police officers,” the attorneys wrote, “are not protected by the First and Second Amendments.” Michael Gordon: 704-358-5095, @MikeGordonOBS Related content Police confrontation with protesters at Interstate 277 LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Crime Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:58 Artist group claims responsibility for body-shaped installation hanged from trees at Winthrop University Pause 5:14 McCrory: 'We're going to check everything' 2:22 Video shows deadly police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott 1:28 Campus hall named after racist needs to change, Winthrop students say 3:36 A timeline of the Charlotte police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott 0:31 Fire damages uptown condos under construction 0:58 Novant Health Charlotte Marathon 2:32 Trump names Priebus chief of staff, other top advisors await appointments 2:52 Dan DiMicco is Trump trade adviser 1:49 Trump and Clinton made a combined total of almost 30 visits to North Carolina since June but did voters care?

Business Update: Americollect lauded in list USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 10:11 a.m. CDT October 29, 2016 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Americollect on ‘best workplaces’ list A Manitowoc debt collection agency has been named among the Best Places to Work in Collections. Americollect Inc. has made it on insideARM’s best-places list for the eighth year in a row. The publication covers the ARM — the accounts receivable management, or debt collection — industry. The Manitowoc agency is ranked fifth nationally among the ranking’s “large” companies — those with 150 or more workers. The company’s online profile says it specializes in collections in the health care industry, noting it handles collections work for more than 70 hospitals and more than 7,000 physicians around the country. The “best places” listing includes an analysis of, among other things, agencies’ workplace policies and a survey of employees. For details about the company, visit americollect.com. Cellcom gifts Woodland Dunes A regional cellular and wireless company says it’s donating money to a local nature preserve. Cellcom, based in De Pere and covering a swath of northeast and central Wisconsin and parts of upper Michigan, says it’s awarded a $2,500 “Green Gift” to Two Rivers’ Woodland Dunes Nature Center. The money will support Woodland Dunes’ Cottonwood Trail program, which teaches students how Wisconsin animals survive and grow. The program reaches students in Manitowoc, Brown, Sheboygan and Kewaunee counties. The cell company says it’s giving about $37,800 in Green Gift money to 22 eco-friendly nonprofits in its coverage area. The money comes from the company’s cellphone recycling program. Lakeland Care District nets grant A local public health care organization that offers help to seniors and disabled adults in Manitowoc and other northeast Wisconsin counties has hauled in an employment grant. The Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities says it’s given a 2016 Employment First Partner grant to Lakeland Care District. In a news release announcing the award, Lakeland Care says it plans to work with the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, other local service providers and local schools to host a “flipped” job fair for people with disabilities. The idea behind the job fair is this: instead of people coming to talk to employers about employment, employers will be invited to come and talk with disabled people for onsite interviews. The job fair is aimed at introducing local job providers to a new potential workforce. The state board says it’s awarded grants to 15 organizations in Wisconsin to increase employment opportunities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Lakeland Care District runs Family Care, a Medicaid managed care program giving long-term support and service to seniors and disabled adults in northeastern Wisconsin, including in Manitowoc County. Utility, bank partnering on bill payments Manitowoc Public Utilities says it’s partnering with Bank First to process payments. The partnership went into effect Oct. 15, and means all utility payments will get processed through the local bank. The utilities company says the move should speed up processing for payments while keeping the payment processing work local. Utility bills will begin showing a new “remit to” address of P.O. Box 41 in Manitowoc, to which all payments should be sent. For details about the move, contact the utilities’ customer service team at 920-683-4600. City lauded as in employer event The City of Manitowoc was named an “exemplary employer” at Manitowoc County’s second annual Employer Recognition Ceremony Oct. 25. Winning “outstanding” employer awards were A&W and Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants and Carmike Cinema. Other businesses that got recognition at the event included: Christel’s Piggly Wiggly in Valders; City Limits Bar and Banquet Hall; Festival Foods; Manitowoc Health and Rehabilitation Center; Manitowoc Tool & Machining; McDonald’s in Two Rivers; North Ridge Medical and Rehabilitation Center; Planet Fitness; Rick’s Piggly Wiggly in Kiel; River’s Bend Health and Rehabilitation Center; Shady Lane; Shopko in Kiel; Walgreens; and Walmart. County Bancorp reports 3Q income A Manitowoc bank’s holding company reported $3.1 million in net income for the third quarter of 2016, which ended Sept. 30. County Bancorp Inc., the holding company of Investors Community Bank, with headquarters in Manitowoc, says that compares with $3.3 million it reported in net income in 2015’s third quarter. The latest quarter's income translates to 46 cents of diluted earnings per share, compared with 55 cents at the end of the same quarter in 2015. The bank says its total assets by the end of the quarter were $1.2 billion, a $56.6 million jump from the end of its second quarter in June. Total loans were $992.5 million, while deposits totaled $929.4 million. Investors Community Bank also has full-service locations in northeast and central Wisconsin. Bank First reports quarter numbers A Manitowoc-based bank says it earned $3.8 million in net income for the third quarter in 2016, which ended Sept. 30. Bank First National Corporation says that’s an 11.1 percent increase from the same period in 2015. The quarter's income equals 60 cents per share, the bank says. Net income for this year through the third quarter was $11.4 million, or $1.82 per share. Net interest income after provision for loan losses was $9.7 million for the quarter, compared to $8.9 million for the same quarter last year, a 9.9 percent increase. Bank First saw $95.8 million in total loan growth from last September, and ended the period at $1.03 billion in total loans. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/2eY9Rnw

On May 5, 2012, Heintz was recovering from not feeling well the previous day. Feeling better, he decided to mow the lawn and remembered that he had to finish some work with the rain gutters. "I was exhausted," Heintz said. "After that, I don't really know what happened." Article Photos Gary Heintz (right), Arbor Park Head Caregiver Joy Frye, and Heintz’s cat pose for a photo. (Submitted photo Heintz tripped over something, causing him to fall and hit his head on the concrete. He couldn't move, thinking he had had a stroke. A neighbor found him, and he was taken to the hospital. Doctors later told him that he had an incomplete spinal cord injury, meaning that his spinal cord had been pinched, cutting off his brain signals to the rest of his body. "I had no control, and the doctor told me there was no hope for me," Heintz said. "I told him, 'No way, I'm going to walk again.'" From there, it has been four and a half years of learning how to live again. "It's like starting your life all over again. I had to learn how to balance and sit up again. I had to learn how to eat again," Heintz said. Heintz attended Sanford Health in Fargo for physical therapy then transferred to Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute in Minneapolis, MN. He now resides in Moorhead, MN, in Arbor Park Assisted Living. "It's my home now," Heintz said. "I had hopes of going back [to Rugby], but the doctors said I was not stable enough. That was just a shock to me, that I'd never be able to go to Rugby again. I just wish I could go back and walk into all the small town stores." Heintz began driving school buses in Rugby in 1979, when he was 20 years old. He owned and operated a route until 1990, when Hartley's Buses took over. Heintz then drove for Hartley's, both school buses and charter buses. He drove charter buses for Hartley's from 2000 to 2012. "I miss the challenge of driving the buses in the wintertime," Heintz said. "I miss being around the children, talking to the parents, and being out in the country just enjoying driving. Every day was something different. The kids would always say I was the best driver, which made me feel good. I miss all that." Heintz has lived in Arbor Park for two years now, where he is able to enjoy barbeques in the summertime. Recently, he has found company with the facility's cat, who spends most of her time in Heintz's room. "The darn cat keeps coming into my room, but I don't mind. It's a therapy for me," he said. In addition to playing with his new cat, he surfs the Internet and sometimes visits Walmart. One of Heintz's fondest memories of his time since the accident was when he met Henry Winkler, best known for his role as Arthur Fonzarelli in 'Happy Days.' Winkler was visiting Heintz's facility and gave a speech about the benefits of Botox. "He was the first movie star I ever met in my life," Heintz said. Heintz now spends his days in a power wheelchair. "Every time I drove a school bus, there would be a wheelchair lift," he said. "Now I'm in one." Heintz takes therapy every six months in order to maintain his body. He also exercises every morning and evening for about 45 minutes in order to keep his muscles moving and his body in shape. "I'm in a lot of pain," he said. "A lot of people don't realize what a spinal cord injury does to you. I can't dress myself. I can't go to the bathroom on my own. It was hard to adjust, and I've accepted it. I could be in a lot worse shape. My brain still works, just my body isn't working." Since his injury, Heintz has not had much interaction with his friends in Rugby. "The sad thing is that when something like this happens to you, people shy away from you. They don't know what to say, I think. Your friends, even your family members, stop talking to you," he said. Throughout everything, Heintz remains positive, considering himself lucky to have survived. During his time at the Courage Institute, there were patients who had suffered head trauma and spinal cord injury who became blind from the impact. "They called me a rock star because I was doing so well and had a good attitude and was not giving up," Heintz said. "People complain all the time about things, and I always say, 'I would gladly trade places with you.' If I could go out and walk again and just enjoy life again," Heintz said. "I still enjoy life, just in a different way now."

(Reuters/Thomas Mukoya) Share Written by Joshua Masinde i October 29, 2016 Quartz africa East Africa’s largest retailer, Nakumatt, will cede up to 25% of its shares to an international private equity investor to plug cash flow glitches that have plagued its operations, according to a person close to the company. It comes after a surprise announcement by the Nairobi-based company that it had run into liquidity hiccups after photos of empty shelves at some of its Nakumatt outlets in Uganda circulated on social media. The retailer, which has 61 branches across East Africa, has remained tight lipped on the potential partner it will bring on board but indications are it will not be another supermarket chain but an international private equity financier. Photos of empty shelves at its outlets in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, jolted the retailer to issue a statement saying its business was solid despite challenges triggered by a harsh operating environment. The empty shelves have been linked to contractual fall-out with suppliers in Uganda. What cancer's eating away some of the Nakumatt outlets in Uganda?Lots of empty shelves especially Oasis Branch. This was shot last Saturday pic.twitter.com/ilzNdQTrMa — Jimmy Kiberu (@KiberuJimmy) October 27, 2016 A number of the suppliers opted not to supply the retailer until issues around improving their margins and shortening of the credit period should be agreed on. It is understood that some suppliers demanded to be paid within 30 days or less, despite the supermarket’s credit period ranging from between 180 and 270 days. This had been increased from 90 days when the retailer began facing cash flow challenges. The retailer has also been relying heavily on commercial debt, which stood at $150 million at the start of 2015 up from $42 million at the end of 2011. Should everything go according to plan, the deal will be sealed “in a few weeks”. “With the ongoing financial re-engineering engagements focused on accessing a significant capital injection, we are confident that the overall debt will further reduce once the process is concluded,” the retailer said in a statement. International strategic investors such as WalMart and Carrefour and private equity investors have been eyeing the East Africa’s rising middle class for some time as an opportunity with local retailers. In recent years, East African markets have turned tumultuous for both indigenous and international retailers. Uchumi, a Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed retailer, exited Uganda and Tanzania last October after failing to break even five years after expanding in those markets. The subsidiaries were, in fact, draining the parent company in Kenya, which is laden with debt and facing challenges paying suppliers. Shoprite, a South African retail giant, sold its Tanzania outlets in 2014 and those in Uganda in 2015 to Nakumatt, and exited the regional markets on the back of poor performance and growing competition. The supermarket had been operating in Uganda for 15 years and Tanzania for 13 years. But, it’s the struggles at Nakumatt, which has all along seemed sound, that will raise most concerns. “The business doesn’t look good. Times are tough,” tweeted Victoria Odipo. “We could also say that the shoppers are emptying the shelves faster than tbe supermarkets can stock them. Great economy,” one Jamie tweeted. Botswana-based Choppies, which acquired a 75% stake in a family-owned Kenyan retailer, Ukwala reported a $2.7 million loss in the year to June 2016. Major supermarkets in Kenya are still family-owned but foreign operators such as Choppies, French-multinational, Carrefour and South Africa’s Game, a brand of MassMart have since opened outlets in the country.

StarTran's revised citywide bus schedule begins Nov. 1. Starting Tuesday Lincoln residents will be able to work later, shop later, visit friends later and still catch a bus home. Travelers also will be able to take a bus between downtown and the Lincoln Airport. StarTran’s new bus schedule -- with later service on almost every route, more efficient routing and more frequent service on some routes -- begins Nov. 1. Download PDF The Lincoln City Council added about $390,000 to StarTran's annual subsidy to help pay for five of the nine drivers added to accommodate the expanded service. The major improvements include the following. * Evening service on three routes -- South 13th Street, North 27th Street and O Street -- ending about 9:50. The majority of the other routes will end around 8 on weeknights. Just three routes -- West A, Gaslight and Sheridan -- will end at the traditional 6:30 p.m. * Increased frequency of service during the middle of the day, with every half-hour service on the three busiest routes -- South 13th, North 27th and O Street -- on weekdays. * New service to the airport and the northeast Wal-Mart, plus additional service to Southeast Community College. The revised schedules and routes also will make it easier for people transferring buses downtown, said StarTran Manager Mike Davis. There will be no more than a five-minute wait for riders with destinations in other parts of downtown. StarTran has also changed the routing system, pulling buses off neighborhood streets and putting most stops along arterial streets. The bus system will end the practice of allowing people to flag down a bus and will pick up passengers only at designated bus stops.  For the next month, bus service will be free and drivers will be reminding people about the logistics of the new routes if they show up at the wrong spot.

Starting Dec. 3, drivers will stick to the new schedule.  StarTran has been working for two years on the route changes, and about 300 people attended three open houses explaining the new system in September, Davis said.  StarTran has been installing new bus stop signs and will have all old signs removed by Tuesday. Each stop will also eventually have schedule information, so riders will know when the next bus is scheduled to arrive, Davis said.   The changes came out of a $193,000 study on the city's bus system. Reach the writer at 402-473-7250 or nhicks@journalstar.com.  On Twitter @LJSNancyHicks. First Friday celebration To celebrate its new routes, StarTran is offering free bus rides and prize drawings during the First Friday Art Walk this week. From 6 to 8 p.m. the Star Shuttle will provide riders with a warm, quick way to visit all downtown galleries. In addition, KFRX-FM will broadcast live from Tower Square, where The Coffee House will provide free coffee and cookies.

 BT CEO: 'It's possible that 80% of the jobs people do today won't exist in the future' Oscar Williams-Grut Oct. 29, 2016, 4:24 AM 7,296 facebook linkedin twitter email print BT CEO Gavin Patterson. Scott Olson/Getty Images The CEO of BT thinks the global jobs market is on "the cusp of a radical transformation." Speaking at the second annual HSBC Innovation Summit in London on Friday, Gavin Patterson said: "It's a combination of ubiquitous networks, ubiquitous data, ubiquitous processing capabilities, sensors in everything, augmented reality, virtual reality — the future looks very, very different. "Frankly, it's quite possible that 80% of the jobs that people do today won't exist in the future. It's not quite clear where we go from here." This is a big claim coming from a man whose company employees over 80,000 people. Stuart Gulliver, the CEO of HSBC, agreed with Patterson's point. HSBC employees over 265,000 people globally. Gulliver, who was on the panel with Patterson, said: "It's unlikely that there will be the same number of jobs in today's skill set in five years time." The World Economic Forum claims the world is on the cusp of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution," caused by the rise of robots and artificial intelligence. WEF estimates that these technologies could potentially put 5 million people out of work by 2020. A joint study by Citi and Oxford University earlier this year estimated that an incredible 77% of jobs in China could be at risk of automation, while the figure stands at 57% of jobs across the OECD. Foxconn, Walmart, and the US Department of Defence — 3 of the world's top 10 employers — have also already begun replacing manufacturing, warehouse, and combat roles with robots. But Gulliver added that the fact that certain jobs could be replaced by robotics and advanced computing would not necessarily mean that fewer people would be in work. He told the audience: "There may be new jobs that emerge and our responsibility is to manage that transition." Patterson told the audience that BT has a technology scouting network across Silicon Valley, London, Israel, and Berlin to keep the company abreast of the latest technological developments. HSBC's Gulliver said: "People of my kids' age don't expect to work 35 years for the same company in the same sector. Actually, again, you shouldn't think about this in terms of how can offer someone a 35-year career when they're aged 22 leaving university. That isn't what the person aged 22 wants anyway." However, Patterson caveated his jobs predictions by saying: "One of the things about looking into the future is you can look one or two years in the future but looking ten in advance is really very hard."

Salus, Ann Veronica Skrzysowski, Anthony Joseph James Halpin / Published: October 29, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Hart   WILKES-BARRE — The arson trial against the son of the Wilkes-Barre Township fire chief ended in a mistrial Friday evening after the jury reported it was hopelessly deadlocked on a verdict. After about five hours of deliberations, the jury of 10 women and two men could not agree on whether 19-year-old Richard Hart was guilty on charges of arson, reckless burning and burglary. Luzerne County Judge David W. Lupas declared a mistrial. A smiling Hart declined to comment as he left the courthouse surrounded by family. Assistant District Attorney Thomas Hogans said he intends to re-prosecute the case. The charges stemmed from a fire that broke out early the morning of Dec. 21, destroying a vacant home at 115 Casey Ave. Police quickly identified Hart, a member of the township fire company and son of fire Chief Richard Hart, as a suspect based on his behavior after responding to fight the fire, including a comment he made about its origin point. Hart initially denied responsibility for the blaze, but in a subsequent interview he claimed he set it after following a cat into the vacant house, accidentally kicking over a can of gasoline and then dropping a lit cigar. On the stand Friday, Hart testified that he falsely confessed because he was “scared and nervous” after repeated police interrogations. “I was 18 years old. I never had to deal with anything like this before. I was nervous,” Hart said. “I thought if I’d tell them a story they would leave me alone.” Hart testified that he was with a friend at his home the night of the fire and that they ordered a pizza at 1:18 a.m. Hart then decided to walk down to McDonald’s on Wilkes-Barre Township Boulevard to get an iced coffee but returned after learning it was closed, he said on direct questioning. By the time he got back home five or 10 minutes later, the pizza had been delivered and he ate a slice before falling asleep on the couch, Hart said. About 3:15 a.m., he awoke to pagers for the fire and responded to the blaze along with his father, he said. Hogans, however, sought to cast doubt on Hart’s changing story, noting that when he showed up for a fourth interview with police he denied setting the fire and instead claimed to have seen a suspicious man following him and a friend the night of the fire. But the friend — who claimed to have been with Hart almost the entire night — testified he didn’t see any such character, and Hogans noted that despite allegedly seeing a suspicious character loitering in the neighborhood, Hart still decided to leave the house minutes later for a McDonald’s run by himself. “If you were that scared why would you chance it?” Hogans asked. “Because I wanted a coffee,” Hart said. During cross-examination, Hart maintained he never made it to McDonald’s because the man pulled a gun on him and told him to get out of the area. Yet Hogans noted that he failed to mention it to anyone — including to his best friend when he got back home — until after he recanted his confession. The defense rested its case with Hart’s departure from the stand. During closing arguments, defense attorney John Pike told the jury that Hart, a high-school dropout who worked at Wal-Mart, was manipulated into giving a confession by police with decades of experience and training in eliciting admissions from suspects. “He broke,” Pike said. “He’s an 18-year-old dropout in a room alone with lions.” Hogans urged the jury to use common sense during their deliberations and to consider whether Hart would logically have left his house to get coffee right before bedtime, only minutes after seeing a suspicious man lurking behind cars on the street. Hart’s story falls apart because of numerous inconsistencies, including that he failed to tell anyone about the suspicious man until a month after the fire, he said. “It doesn’t make any sense at all,” Hogans said. After the case was declared a mistrial, Pike said he was happy with the outcome of the case, which allowed Hart to remain free on bail. The case, he said, came down to Hart’s statements. “The issue as I saw it was obviously the alibi and reconciling that with his statement,” Pike said. “That’s what they apparently, I think, were struggling with.” One name that did not come up during the final day of the trial was former township fire Chief John Yuknavich. A day earlier, Pike noted that Hart at one point alleged Yuknavich, a rival of his father’s, was trying to set him up. Yuknavich, who served six months in federal prison for stealing about $45,000 from the department, is currently facing harassment charges alleging he was “verbally harassing” the new chief during the Giant’s Despair Hill Climb in July. Yuknavich denies any involvement in the case and threatened legal action against his accusers when asked about the allegations Thursday evening. He arrived at the courthouse Friday morning, offering to testify for the prosecution as a rebuttal witness but was not called. After the case ended, Pike said he didn’t know whether Yuknavich was involved in the case. “That was something that we were looking at. The testimony was out there,” Pike said. “There was evidence to support that there was somebody else behind what was going on with my client.”     570-821-2058, @cvjimhalpin We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

At some point, my cereal consumption could almost be measured at an hourly basis. I have always considered taste, texture, and milk-to-cereal ratios apart of the art of eating cereal. It took until the ripe maturity of ten years of age to be able to carry the milk gallon from the fridge to the counter with ease, though I think I was actually thirteen-ish when I could finally carry it with one hand. Before then, my younger brother and I were completely dependent upon my mom making cereal for us. And thanks to her, we learned to drown our cereal in milk and mix cereals when two boxes became too low to make an entire bowl. But she and my father both worked multiple jobs to keep food on the table, so the task typically fell into my older brother’s hands. We’d ask him to make us cereal, and sometimes he would decline the request. But when he accepted, Blake and I had a little choreographed number, catchily entitled “The Cereal Dance,” that we’d perform. While Scott stood on the counter and carelessly poured cereal and milk into three bowls, Blake and I rubbed our hands over our eyes and lifted our knees up like the Soggybottom Boys, making a 360-degree rotation while squealing in bouts of anxiety. Nowadays, neither my parents nor brothers are around often enough to eat cereal with me. But when my brothers and I do get together, cereal is the one love we know we all have in common. We head straight to the grocery store for two boxes of cereal and a gallon of whole milk to accompany a list of Adam Sandler comedies and our parents’ deep-seated couches. But we always face the same problem when arriving at the cereal aisle and picking our victims for the night: where did all the good cereal go? And I’m not talking good like Cheerios, Special K, and Kashi. No, I’m talking about Waffle Crisp, Rice Krispie Treats, and French Toast Crunch. The sugary goodness that is the building block of our childhood. Nights dedicated to this topic with my fellow Cerealeans have yielded nothing but frustration and unsatisfied hunger. But the internet has given these cereals of our childhood another chance at life (or death?) so that we might live out our youth for a little bit longer. Waffle Crisp This cereal may or may not have dictated my priorities in life at one point. They were mini-waffles that were more crispy than crunchy, and got extremely soggy after five minutes of being in the bowl. This is why and how I learned to eat cereal quickly — because there are only a couple of cereals in this world that are better soggy, and they involve the Flintstone’s. Waffle Crisp’s mascot, at its peak of tastiness, was a group of elderly women who slaved over the making of Waffle Crisp. So you know they tasted the way Grandma would make ‘em. She wouldn’t worry about the sugars or the calories. And that’s exactly how Waffle Crisp tasted. They smelled like syrup and brown sugar. They tasted more like that than a buttery waffle. And the milk turned a light beige and tasted almost like the smell of cinnamon rolls. Waffle Crisp actually has not been discontinued yet. For some reason, Post cereal has just drastically reduced its production of it. I found it once in a North Georgia Ingles. I was dizzy with excitement and hope for the future of Waffle Crisp. Over the years, Kellogg’s Eggo Cereal took Waffle Crisp’s spot in major grocery stores. The upsetting part about Crisp’s competition is that it really isn’t the same. It’s like drinking skim milk after having whole milk for ten years. There’s less sugar, less texture, and the Eggo’s are thinner. They pale in comparison. But fear not, the Waffle Crisp market on the internet is vast, affordable, and easy to find. Rice Krispie Treat… the cereal edition Okay, so Kellogg’s got it right when they decided to give RKTC a chance. It first appeared in 1993 and judging by the profits Kellogg’s got by my family alone, I’m pretty sure it had no problem selling. But over the years, it vanished, and is also in limbo with Waffle Crisp… not officially discontinued, but also not easily found at any grocery store. However, when I was seventeen or so, Kellogg’s pushed it for a limited time in numerous major grocery stores. I literally gave money to someone from work, while I was on shift, to run over to Wal-Mart and buy three boxes for me. It might’ve made me a candidate for sainthood in my brothers’ eyes. RKTC is portioned off pieces of Rice Krispie Treats that are dry enough to avoid the goop of fresh, homemade Rice Krispie Treats, but sweet and frosted enough to rule out the sweetness of Frosted Cheerios, Frosted Flakes, and Frosted Wheaties combined. RKTC cannot be found on the shelves anymore, though I hope Kellogg’s goes for another push with them, but there are options for the RKTC addict: 1.) The internet 2.) Making Rice Krispie Treats and allowing them to set at room temperature for three days. At that time, they are dry enough to put in milk and enjoy, and you actually have control over what goes into the making of the RKTC. French Toast Crunch French Toast Crunch had a shelf life from 1995 to 2008. Apart of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch family, it took on the approach of the Crisp family (Cookie Crisp, Waffle Crisp) in that the cereal itself was shaped as small pieces of french toast. These crunchy delicacies had the ability of staying in milk for a rather long period of time without getting soggy. But when General Mills decided to make French Toast Crunch look the as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, sales plummeted… at least in my household. The flakes didn’t carry the same flavor. They actually seemed even more sugary, with a brown sugar coating, and lost the imitational taste of french toast. Along with losing the taste, they lost their texture, getting soggy at a much quicker rate. Though Cinnamon Toast Crunch is and was another favorite, the problem with this change was that General Mills lost its FTC market. And subsequently stopped manufacturing the cereal. Which is probably the biggest blow to my childhood taste buds. Although all of these cereals lost their spotlight, they never lost their following. Many blog posts and discussions from kids of the 90’s era are dedicated to the understanding of the shelf life of perfectly perfect cereals and their disappearance. It leads me to ask one thing: if the market remains, why not give these cereals another chance? Though that question may never be answered or fulfilled, there is one thing I can promise. If it does happen, I will not hesitate to do the cereal dance once more. What's your reaction?

In fact, the median amount owed on a credit card is $2,000, found GOBankingRates.com’s 2016 U.S. Household Debt survey. If you’re one of these people carrying a high balance on your card, you’re probably racking up interest charges. So, as your credit card issuer is making money off the interest and fees you have to pay, you’re losing more and more of your hard-earned cash. But there’s a smart way you can pay off your credit card debt: Make your credit card work for you. Sure, swiping your card everywhere you go won’t get you rich quick. But when you use your credit cards strategically, you can generate some cash for payments. Or, if you’re debt-free, you can use the extra funds to pay for an upcoming trip or that flat-screen TV you’ve always wanted. Here are seven creative ways you can make money with your credit cards. 1. Get Money With Cash-Back Credit Cards To make money using credit cards, get a card that pays you to shop. This type of card is called a cash-back credit card. Depending on the type of card you get, you can earn 1 percent or even 5 percent in cash-back rewards for certain purchases. Take the Discover it card, for example. Ranked: Best Cash-Back Credit Cards of All Time With this credit card, you can earn 5 percent cash back in rotating categories — such as gas, restaurants and more — on up to $1,500 in purchases every quarter. So let’s say you spend $1,500 on qualifying purchases — that’s $75 going right back into your pocket. And in addition to 5 percent cash back, you get 1 percent unlimited cash back on all other purchases. This card also offers a rare perk: Discover matches dollar-for-dollar all of the cash back you earn in your first year, which can add up quickly. The more you use a cash-back credit card, the more cash you can earn. Be careful, though. Pay off your credit card balance in full every month to avoid racking up credit card debt and paying high interest charges. If you fall too deep into debt, the cash-back rewards might not be worth it. Syda Productions / Shutterstock.com 2. Earn Bonus Rewards Points “The best way to leverage credit cards for money, in my experience, is to open a new card with a large flight mileage bonus, and use the points toward a free or heavily discounted flight,” said Stacy Caprio, search marketing manager at TimePayment, which provides equipment financing for businesses. You can take your pick of credit cards offering sign-up bonus points. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card — named one of the best travel rewards credit offers by GOBankingRates — lets you earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in purchases with the card in the first three months after opening an account. That’s the equivalent of $625 you can use toward travel. So, you might want to use this card, or similar rewards cards, for as many expenses as possible. And if possible, see if you can rack up rewards points by using your credit card to pay your rent. “It’s common knowledge that the best way of getting value — or money — back from credit card use is earning points,” said Roman Shteyn, co-founder of RewardExpert.com, which helps travelers make the most out of their credit card points and airline miles. “However, oftentimes people are not charging one of their biggest monthly expenses to their cards: their rent.” 3. Invest Your Cash Back You can also put cash-back rewards to work for you and invest the money — even if you earn less than a few hundred dollars. Thanks to the power of compounding interest, your cash-back rewards will grow into a sizable nest egg over time. Let’s say you earn $300 in cash back every year. If you invest that $300 into an account that earns 7 percent interest annually, in 10 years your balance will grow to more than $4,000. As an added credit card benefit, some rewards credit cards allow card owners to link their cards to eligible investment accounts. Take the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature credit card: You can earn unlimited 2 percent cash and have those rewards automatically deposited into an eligible Fidelity account, such as a brokerage account, a 529 college savings plan, a retirement account and more. To maximize your investment earnings, look for credit cards with no restrictive categories. The more restrictions, the fewer opportunities to cash in and invest your rewards. 4. Sell Your Rewards Points — But Be Careful Travel rewards credit cards are a godsend if you’re a frequent traveler. But what if you don’t travel often? Shteyn suggested selling your points for money by booking tickets for friends and family with points in exchange for cash. “It can be a win-win for both parties,” he said. “Your friends get a discounted ticket, and you get cash back at a higher rate than your bank may offer.” But, before you get too excited and start selling your unwanted rewards for cash, know the risks. Although some rewards programs allow members to gift rewards or points to their family and friends, selling these perks for cash might violate the terms and conditions of some programs. So before you sell, carefully read your credit card rewards’ terms and conditions thoroughly — and make sure the process is not illegal in your state.

Do Your Shopping Online As a credit card benefit, some cards allow you to earn cash back or points by shopping online. You might need to log into your credit card account in order to access these savings and take advantage of the deals. For example, eligible Discover card members can earn additional cash back when they shop through Discover Deals. This includes 5 percent cash back when they shop LivingSocial, Apple, Walmart and other online retailers. They can also score gift cards, like a $25 Sam’s Club gift card, or savings off their next purchases. Other credit card issuers have similar shopping portals. Whichever shopping portal you use, read the terms and conditions and fully understand how the program works. Antonio Guillem / Shutterstock.com 6. Join Acorns and Link a Credit Card If you want to invest but don’t know where to begin, the Acorns app might be an excellent starting point. This investing platform automatically invests your spare change from everyday purchases. Simply sign up, and link your credit card or debit card. For every purchase you make, Acorns rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference, turning your spare change into income. Your funds are invested in a diversified portfolio to lower your risk, and you can link as many credit cards as you like. The amount you can potentially earn through the app depends on how often you use a linked credit card. There’s a $1 monthly fee for using the service. But if you’re a college student with a valid “.edu” email address, you can use Acorns fee-free for up to four years. Andrey_Kuzmin / Shutterstock.com 7. Get Creative With Expired Credit Cards You can’t make a purchase with an expired credit card — but you can turn the card into art and cash in. This is probably a foreign concept, but some DIY-ers are exploring their crafty side and making handmade jewelry using expired credit cards. The profit you can generate from selling these unique fashion pieces vary. But if you’re interested, there are credit card accessories on Etsy.com selling for as little as $5 and as high as $20. Since the credit cards are cut into tiny pieces, the chance of someone piecing the card together and getting their hands on your card number is unlikely. Still, it’s safer to err on the side of caution. Don’t use too many pieces of the same credit card for one piece of jewelry. Credit cards can get you into financial trouble if you don’t keep a close eye on spending. But if you use them to your advantage, you can get free cash from everyday purchases and use these earnings to pay down debt.

The man said he was standing outside of his Myers Park home when he got into an argument with a neighbor. According to the report, "the argument turned into a physical altercation when the victim stated that the suspect threw a large pumpkin that struck him on the left side of his torso." The suspect then drove off in their car. The man suffered minor injuries, including a bruised ego, but did not need medical attention. Don't Start Shit There are worse things to be hit with during an argument than a pumpkin, as one woman learned in east Charlotte last week. The woman told officers that she was arguing with someone when the person suddenly threw a cat's litter box at her, striking her in the leg. The woman was not injured, although one could argue that, if the litterbox was full, that's a grievous injury in itself. Ummm What A 15-year-old boy apparently fell victim to some sort of fraud last week in east Charlotte. The kid apparently was ripped off for a pair of shoes, probably by someone on the internet, but the police report left more questions than answers. For those who are into translations, try your hand at this language, which is the CMPD's way of saying that a kid got catfished: "The victim stated that the listed suspect made a representation about a past or existing fact or a future event that is false and was calculated and intended to deceive, and the representation does in fact deceived (sic) the victim, and the suspect obtained the listed property." Sounds like when you've got a five-page paper due and two pages of ideas. These Don't Work A thief in the NoDa neighborhood was looking for a pharmaceutical rush last week, but was surely disappointed after checking his stash after the fact. A 23-year-old woman told officers that someone broke into her car and stole 20 pills in her prescription Adderall bottle. The thief wouldn't be getting much done by popping them, however, as the victim added that she had run out of her prescription and had filled the bottle with Advil in case of a headache. Jackpot An east Charlotte man who filed a police report after his home was broken into last week was clearly a foodie, as he felt it necessary to give the proper description of each food product the thief had walked out with. The 72-year-old man told officers that someone broke into his home in the Tanglewood neighborhood and stole 12 eggs, a spiral ham, four pounds of Bulgarian cheese, some domestic cheese, filo dough, 10 pounds of shrimp, candy bars and a batch of baker's chocolate. It's probable the man offered such descriptions in hopes police would find the food, but it's all the more probable that food was eaten within the hour. Shopping Spree A suspect was apparently playing their own game of Supermarket Sweeps at a Walmart in northwest Charlotte last week, although there were no cameras and employees weren't playing along. Management called police to report a shoplifter who had grabbed a seemingly random cache of items and made a dash for the door before being stopped by security officers. The suspect was caught with Budweiser beer (a staple in the average Walmart shoplifter's booty), paper towels, laundry detergent and a bag of dog food. The report was later updated after officers found that the man was also attempting to conceal a Citronella candle. We don't want to know where. Teary Eyed A student took things to the next level last week during a fight with another girl in the hallway at Mallard Creek High School. According to the police report, a female student assaulted a 17-year-old girl while the two were in a hallway walking to class. Following the fight, police seized a bottle of pepper spray from one of the students, but it's unclear whether she ever got a chance to use it. I'm sure the students standing nearby could tell you. I Deserve It While it's already rude to not tip those in charge of serving you food, one young customer at Five Guys at SouthPark Mall last week decided he would take it a step further. Apparently thinking that the service was so bad that he was owed a tip instead of obligated to give one, the kid simply reached in the tip cup and grabbed $25. Employees stopped the kid and called police, and the suspect was referred to a program for juvenile suspects. Threat of the Week A New York man recently showed his hand a little early during an argument with a woman living in Charlotte. The woman filed a report stating that the man called her and said, "I'm going to come burn your house down with you in it and nobody will know it was me because I live in New York." Safe to say, now that this threat is officially on the record, that's not such a great idea. Blotter items are chosen from the files of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. All suspects are innocent until proven guilty.

Salus, Ann Veronica Skrzysowski, Anthony Joseph James Halpin / Published: October 28, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     MARK MORAN / THE CITIZENS’ VOICE Richard Thomas Hart, a Wilkes-Barre Township volunteer firefighter and son of fire chief Richard Hart, plans to plead not guilty to remaining arson charges.   WILKES-BARRE — The arson trial against the son of the Wilkes-Barre Township fire chief ended in a mistrial Friday evening after the jury reported it was hopelessly deadlocked on the verdict. After about five hours of deliberations, the jury of 10 women and two men could not agree on whether 19-year-old Richard Hart was guilty on charges of arson, reckless burning and burglary. Luzerne County Judge David W. Lupas declared a mistrial, paving the way for a repeat of the three-day proceeding. The charges stemmed from a fire that broke out early the morning of Dec. 21, destroying a vacant home at 115 Casey Ave. Police quickly identified Hart, a volunteer firefighter, as a suspect based on his behavior after responding to fight the fire, including a comment he made about its origin point. Hart initially denied responsibility for the blaze, but in a subsequent interview he claimed he set it after following a cat into the vacant house, accidentally kicking over a can of gasoline and then dropping a cigar. On the stand Friday, Hart testified that he falsely confessed because he was “scared and nervous” after repeated police interrogations. “I was 18 years old. I never had to deal with anything like this before. I was nervous,” Hart said. “I thought if I’d tell them a story they would leave me alone.” Hart testified that he was with a friend at his home the night of the fire and that they ordered a pizza at 1:18 a.m. Hart then decided to walk down to McDonald’s on Wilkes-Barre Township Boulevard to get an iced coffee but returned after learning it was closed, he said on direct questioning. By the time he got back home five or 10 minutes later, the pizza had been delivered and he ate a slice before falling asleep on the couch, Hart said. About 3:15 a.m., he awoke to pagers for the fire and responded to the blaze along with his father, he said. Assistant District Attorney Thomas Hogans noted that the first time anyone heard about a suspicious man was in Hart’s fourth interview with police. Hart claimed the man followed him and a friend to Hart’s house on their way home from his girlfriend’s house the night of the fire, yet his friend never saw anything unusual, Hogans noted. Despite allegedly seeing a suspicious character loitering in the neighborhood, Hart still decided to leave the house minutes later for a McDonald’s run. “If you were that scared why would you chance it?” Hogans asked. “Because I wanted a coffee,” Hart said. During cross-examination, Hart maintained he never made it to McDonald’s because the man pulled a gun on him and told him to get out of the area. Yet Hogans noted that he failed to mention it to anyone — including to his best friend when he got back home — until after he recanted his confession. The defense rested its case with Hart’s departure from the stand. During closing arguments, defense attorney John Pike told the jury that Hart, a high-school dropout who worked at Wal-Mart, was manipulated into giving a confession by police with decades of experience and training in eliciting admissions from suspects. “He broke,” Pike said. “He’s an 18-year-old dropout in a room alone with lions.” Hogans urged the jury to use common sense during their deliberations and to consider whether Hart would logically have left his house to get coffee right before bedtime, only minutes after seeing a suspicious man lurking behind cars on the street. Hart’s story falls apart because of numerous inconsistencies, including that he failed to tell anyone about the suspicious man until a month after the fire, he said. “It doesn’t make any sense at all,” Hogans said. One subject that did not arise during the final day of the trial was former township fire Chief John Yuknavich. A day earlier, Pike noted that Hart at one point alleged Yuknavich, a rival of his father’s, was trying to set him up. Yuknavich, who served six months in federal prison for stealing about $45,000 from the department, is currently facing harassment charges alleging he was “verbally harassing” the new chief during the Giant’s Despair Hill Climb in July. Yuknavich denies any involvement in the case and threatened legal action against his accusers when asked about the allegations in an interview with The Citizens’ Voice on Thursday evening. He was outside the courtroom Friday morning offering to testify for the prosecution as a rebuttal witness.     570-821-2058, @cvjimhalpin We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

'I just wanted to kill them,' Todd West, 24, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, said Thursday as he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in Lehigh County. West shot and killed Francine Ramos, 32, and Trevor Gray, 22, while they were riding in a car in Allentown on July 5, 2015. He said he shot Kory Ketrow, 22, in Easton, about an hour earlier because Ketrow looked 'tired'. 'I don't think I've ever seen a case like this,' Common Pleas Judge James Anthony said in sentencing West to three consecutive life sentences.  'There doesn't seem to be any motive here beyond the desire to kill. Just cold-blooded murder.' Victims: West shot and killed Francine Ramos, left, and Trevor Gray, right, while they were riding in a car in Allentown on July 5, 2015 West is one of three men charged in the Pennsylvania killings. Kareem Mitchell, 24, of Newark, New Jersey, and Robert Jourdain, 22, of Easton, are scheduled for trial next year on homicide charges. Prosecutors contend Mitchell drove around while West picked out his shooting victims.  Jourdain is accused of buying the bullets from Wal-Mart shortly before West gunned down Ketrow nearby. Both men have pleaded not guilty.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Twice-deported illegal immigrant who was freed on bond after... Texas man, 53, is accused of shooting his stockbroker...

West's court-appointed attorney declined to comment after Thursday's guilty pleas, which West entered after Pennsylvania prosecutors agreed to not pursue the death penalty.  West was also fined $150,000 and ordered to pay the victims' funeral costs. Lehigh County First Assistant District Attorney Steve Luksa told the Morning Call: 'This was a heinous crime and he's an evil, evil man. 'But the families did not want to go through the emotional turmoil of a trial.' The victims' relatives had plenty to say in court, calling West a 'coward'. 'He's a coward. He shot people in the back,' said Richard Bader, Ketrow's stepfather. 'He killed helpless people for no reason.' 'Look at what you did to all these families here,' said Ramos' aunt, Sandra Dolson. 'Look at you, grinning. You're a coward. Your day will come soon.'   Read more: 'Just cold-blooded murder' judge says as he sentences killer of three - The Morning Call Share or comment on this article e-mail 30 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Serial thief Gary Thigpen was there as a work trusty, which means he was working on a site with a supervised group of inmates, wearing jail uniforms.

After the maintenance man noticed Thigpen was missing, he saw that one of the roller doors had been rolled up. “They have to have someone with them all the time,” said Jacksonville Fairgrounds Vice President of Marketing Gayle Hart.  “We were all baffled. I mean, we have not had this happen before. So we were totally baffled. This guy had worked with us only a few weeks.” Thigpen had eight months left on his one-year sentence for felony theft. #JSO is searching for escaped inmate: Gary M. Thigpen, 23 years old.

It’s the seventh time he’s been convicted and served jail time for theft since 2012. Hart said Thigpen’s escape will not cause the Jacksonville Fairground’s to re-think its inmate work program. “Absolutely not. It’s just one person that made a decision for himself,” said Hart. “This obviously was a trusty that couldn’t be trusted,” said Action News Jax Crime and Safety Expert Ken Jefferson. “There are times when they get an itch to want to not be on work release and not go back to jail, and they leave. But what they’re doing is adding more time to their sentence.” A JSO spokesperson said Thigpen was not wearing an ankle monitor. © 2016 Cox Media Group.

(WPVI) WPVI By Alicia Vitarelli Friday, October 28, 2016 WEST PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- In West Philadelphia, there are two sisters making sauces and marinades that they are ready to introduce to the world. Now, they're bringing their homemade, homegrown flavors to the investors at ABC's "Shark Tank" and hoping they take a bite. For the Beard sisters, Kelly and Jorrae, every single jar of their Joyce's Lulu Bang sauce is a family affair. Joyce is their late mother and the sisters say everyone in West Philly knew her food. "She was famous for cooking she would feed the entire neighborhood," said Kelly. Lulu Bang is an ode to their brother Michael who also passed away "His nickname was Lulu Bang as a kid," said Kelly. And the sisters say their sauce does have a bang - a little kick. "And our slogan is: 'We bang everythang!' We laugh because you can use it on anything," said the sisters. Their Lulu Bang line has 4 sauces, from the original BBQ fusion to the Bourbon marinade. "(The BBQ infusion) is infused with a lot of herbs and spices and with our sauces we do not use fillers, it's all sauce," said Jorrae. "And we want warn you - (the Bourbon marinade) has real bourbon in it." All of the recipes are Jorrae originals. "Kelly tasted it and said this is going to make me a million dollars someday," said Jorrae. Right now, they sell them at 200 Walmart stores across the country, some local Shoprite stores, and online. Every jar is handmade - from the sauce to the labels - in West Philadelphia. The Beard sisters are asking the Sharks for $150 thousand dollars and a 10 percent share of their company to help market their sauce and expand their reach. You can watch their episode of "Shark Tank" Friday at at 9 p.m. on 6abc.

[PNG Merlin Archive] RAEF / PNG The City of Lougheed is a project from Shape Properties in Burnaby that will comprise 23+ towers. For Westcoast Homes. [PNG Merlin Archive] RAEF / PNG Project: The City of Lougheed Project Address: 9855 Austin Road, Burnaby Project Scope: A total of 500-plus one-, two- and three-bedroom homes contained in Tower One, a 55-storey concrete highrise sited in the community’s “first neighbourhood.” One of 23 towers on a 40-acre site at Lougheed Mall. An 18,000-square-foot amenities area on a raised podium will include activity rooms, fitness, lounge facilities. Located on two SkyTrain lines, there will be more than 300 shops, restaurants serving the neighbourhoods. Prices: From $329,900 for one-bedroom homes starting at 550 square feet Developer: Shape Properties Corp. Architect: James K. M. Cheng Architects (master plan) GBL Architects (Tower One) Interior Designer: Shape Living Interior Design Sales centre: 9850 Austin Road, Burnaby Centre hours: 10 a.m. — 6 p.m., daily Sales phone: 604-328-7128 Website: www.thecityoflougheed.com Occupancy: Late 2020 The City of Lougheed, a $7-billion plan to build what is purportedly the largest master-planned community in Canada, will feature up to 23 residential towers, public plazas and pocket parks in a 16-city block area and more than 300 stores in a reconceived Lougheed Mall. Developer Shape Properties Corp. has already opened its three show homes for its planned 55-storey Tower One highrise building in an 18,000-square-foot presentation centre on Austin Road. Architect James Cheng, whose firm is overseeing the award-winning master plan, says the challenge of such a large project is to make “a better city for people to move into, not just by increasing density”, but by building individual communities with amenities and services to which they can walk rather than drive. “People will walk everywhere,” the architect said. “When you move to Lougheed, most of the time you won’t have to use your car. Everything is self-sufficient. You go downstairs and walk outside and you have everything. You can have your bowl of noodles or you can buy a wedding gown.” A major asset for the City of Lougheed, he said, is that it already sits in the middle of a major transportation hub where two SkyTrain lines and a major bus loop meet, ensuring the master-planned development will thrive as a community. “People are not just interested in buying into a single apartment building in the middle of nowhere,” Cheng said in an interview. “They like to know when they buy there, its easy to go the airport, to go downtown, to catch a show, to recreate, to be entertained, and also they want to be safe.”  Cheng says without planning, “towers would be springing up willy-nilly everywhere.” Instead, his firm clustered the towers in seven “character precincts” or neighbourhoods, to which residents feel attached and identify, as they do in any city. “In Vancouver, if you live in Kitsilano, you know you live in Kitsilano, and you’re not worried about Dunbar or Kerrisdale.” Separating the clusters of three and four towers will be pocket parks, public plazas with water features, and landscaped gardens, he said. One neighbourhood, called Creekside, will even have a revitalized creek brought to the surface after running underground through a culvert beneath Lougheed Mall’s parking lots. Another stretch, called the Grand Promenade, will be comparable to Paris’ Avenue des Champs-Elysees or Chicago’s Michigan Avenue with its extra wide sidewalks and shops. At 40 acres, the City of Lougheed is one of the largest new master-planned communities in Canada, if not in North America, said Darren Kwiatkowski, Shape’s executive vice-president, development and design. The only other project of comparable size is one called the Hudson Yard project in New York, said Kwiatkowski. Called a “super regional shopping centre,” City of Lougheed has attracted commitments from several major tenants to anchor 1.4 million square feet of retail space, including Walmart, Hudson’s Bay, London Drugs, Safeway, Sport Check and H & M, among others. Another one million square feet is designated for commercial office space. The City of Lougheed will house some 10,000 residents, about double the New York development’s anticipated population, he said.   Cheng’s firm shared with the city of Burnaby an award from the Planning Institute of B.C. for excellence in planning practice for the City of Lougheed master plan. Karin Hung, Burnaby’s senior current planner, said the city is most proud of the fact that new residents and the general public will enjoy use of a number of facilities in the development. “Significant public amenities will be delivered with each phase of development,” she said in an email. “Thirty per cent of the core area will be public open space, including a civic park and plaza at the heart of the core area, a weather-protected transit plaza, a naturalized creekside park, a pair of terraced pocket parks, and an extensive network of tree-lined streets. “The area will have 4.5 kilometres of new pedestrian pathways, five kilometres of new cycling routes, and 3.5 kilometres of upgraded sidewalks.” As the plan is executed, she said, there will be a continuous stream of bonus funds directed back into the community for major civic amenities, including a community centre, pool and library or other amenities such as affordable housing, non-profit office space and public art. Tower One will be in the southeast quadrant of the City of Lougheed at the corner of North Road and Austin, less than a one-minute walk to the Skytrain, said sales manager Angelica Yang. Home sizes will range from 550 to 1,250 square feet with an impressive array of floor layouts. There are eight one-bedroom models, 10 models of two-bedroom and two bedroom and den homes, three three-bedroom models and two versions of the three-bedroom and den suites. All suites come with balconies that have room for outdoor furniture. The balconies are generously proportioned with a one-bedroom model of 561 square feet having close to an equal amount of outdoor space (496 square feet) Balcony space for two bedroom models range up to 661 square feet and include wrap-around configurations. Some three-bedroom models come with two balconies, each facing in different direction taking in spectacular views. All suites have at least one parking stall and a storage locker. Retail is mixed in throughout the whole development, Yang said. Buyers can feel confident that Shape will be there years from now overseeing the roll-out. “We control the entire asset and we have a long-term commitment to the master plan.” Inside the homes, Shape prides itself on making the best use of space. Homes have floor-to-ceiling glass allowing in lots of light. Every kitchen is configured in an “L” shape with an island topped by polished stone. Appliances are premium quality Bosch with a gas cooktop, and a wall oven, refrigerator and dishwasher integrated into full-height European cabinets that provide 30 per cent more storage space. Providing additional storage space is a full-height kitchen pantry. Finishing off the modern look is recessed lighting and a marble herringbone backsplash. Shape has also created dedicated space in most homes for owners to add a computer work station. The 18,000-square-foot amenities facility spans three levels. Inside, residents can organize game nights and table tennis tournaments, enjoy yoga, Pilates or intense cardio workouts, host festive holiday dinners in private event lounges with full kitchens. Residents can enjoy spectacular sunsets and fresh air on the facility’s rooftop with its community garden plots for raising vegetables and areas for lounging and open-air yoga. The space also includes outdoor sitting areas and barbecue areas.                     Yaletown home showcases extensive renos throughout Large custom-built home rich with high-end details Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

What is this ? X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Audrey Rouleau’s son, Zachary, is always smiling. The 12-year-old lives with Phelan-McDermid Syndrome and rarely has a bad day – but in a shopping centre, Rouleau constantly worries he might wander off with a stranger. “Just getting groceries, it’s complicated,” she explained. To make life easier, Rouleau worked with Stephanie Leclerc, whose daughter, Sarah, also has special needs, to bring adapted shopping carts to Quebec. Story continues below “She can run around, run away. She can go with any kind of stranger because she has no sense of danger at all,” Leclerc said. “She likes to grab things off shelves and throw them on the floor.” Running simple errands requires “making a schedule with another parent or hiring a babysitter,” explained Rouleau. A couple years ago, both women came across Caroline’s Cart, which was invented in the U.S. by a woman whose daughter has special needs. Since then, the two mothers have been writing to Quebec stores and asking them to purchase Caroline’s Cart. The secure seat is adapted to fit in a shopping cart and can hold up to 250 lbs. Leclerc said knowing stores will have adapted carts is a relief. “I don’t have to think, ‘who will stay home with my girl when I need to go get milk?'” she told Global News. Caroline’s Cart has been popular in the U.S. and other provinces in Canada, but had not yet arrived in Quebec. “It needs to come from the customers,” Leclerc explained. Walmart responded to their lobbying effort and confirmed it will soon have Caroline’s Carts in all its Quebec City stores. “We try to create an environment that’s stress-free,” said Michel Arruda, assistant manager at the Lebourgneuf Walmart. “When you always have your kids on your mind, you don’t have the facility or the time to do your shopping.” Fifteen other stores have also brought in the carts, including three in Greater Montreal. “This is inclusion,” said Leclerc. “We know that there are many families out there everywhere in the province that need those carts, so we want them to know that it exists.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
