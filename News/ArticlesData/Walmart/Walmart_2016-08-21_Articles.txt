A lawsuit involving a deadly random shooting spree in Allentown and Easton will be heard in a Philadelphia court. (MORNING CALL/FILE PHOTO) Peter HallOf The Morning Call Walmart must defend claims over ammo sold in Lehigh Valley killing spree in Philly court. A lawsuit claiming Walmart and its employees negligently sold handgun ammunition used to kill three people in Allentown and Easton last year must be heard in Philadelphia County Court, a judge has ruled. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed in January, Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart moved the suit by the families of three people killed in a random early morning shooting spree from Philadelphia court to federal court in Allentown. The company's lawyers argued the suit belongs in U.S. District court under a rule that gives federal courts jurisdiction when none of the defendants reside in the state where the case was filed. Although two store managers who live in Pennsylvania are named as defendants, they weren't involved in the sale and can't be held liable, Walmart's lawyers claimed. Walmart alleged the managers were "fraudulently joined" in the lawsuit to give a Pennsylvania state court jurisdiction over the case. U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Leeson said last week that even if the managers weren't involved in the sale, the victims' families may have a valid claim that they are liable for failing to properly train the unidentified cashier who did sell the ammunition.

(Peter Hall) The suit alleges Walmart should not have sold a box of .38-caliber ammunition to 20-year-old Robert Jourdain, who had been drinking for hours before he walked into the retailer's Lower Nazareth Township store shortly before 3 a.m. on July 5, 2015. After purchasing the ammunition, Jourdain joined alleged gunman Todd West in a sport utility vehicle with Kareem Mitchell at the wheel. The three men drove to Easton, where West allegedly gunned down 22-year-old Kory Ketrow just steps from his Lehigh Street apartment, then to Allentown, where West allegedly shot city residents Francine Ramos, 32, and Trevor Gray, 21, as they sat in a car at North Sixth and Greenleaf streets.

(Laurie Mason Schroeder) The families claim selling the ammunition to Jourdain was negligent because Walmart's employees should have recognized he was too young to buy it legally and was mentally impaired by alcohol. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company extends condolences to the victims' families and is reviewing its next steps. In which court the case moves forward is a matter of significance because each side stands to gain an advantage. Attorney Matt Casey said the victims' families, whom he represents, can legally sue Walmart in Philadelphia simply because it does business there. But the city's courts boast a case management system that guarantees a trial in 18 months. He also noted that personal injury lawsuits are statistically more successful in Philadelphia than in suburban or rural Pennsylvania courts. "As the lawyer for these families, my judgment was the Philadelphia venue was the best place for this case," Casey said, noting that it could also be litigated in Lehigh or Northampton county courts. Walmart, on the other hand, would potentially benefit from any federal case law that develops as a result of the lawsuit because it would apply to similar cases elsewhere in the nation. The suit is noteworthy because it seeks to hold Walmart responsible for the victims' deaths under a narrow exception to federal immunity to liability for firearms and ammunition dealers under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Only a handful of similar cases have succeeded and Casey said his suit is the first of its kind in Pennsylvania. The suit alleges Walmart is not protected by the law because its employees negligently entrusted the ammunition to Jourdain and because the sale violated a federal law prohibiting the sale of handgun ammunition to people under 21. Leeson also rejected Walmart's claim the case belongs in federal court because there is a dispute whether its employees violated federal law. Walmart claims they did not because the .38-caliber ammunition at issue can also be used in rifles and rifle ammunition can legally be sold to 18-year-olds. Jourdain, now 21, of Easton; West, 23, of Elizabeth, N.J., and their alleged driver, Mitchell, 24, of Newark, N.J., face trial on charges of homicide and attempted homicide in Lehigh County. West, who faces the death penalty for the killings in Lehigh and Northampton counties, is also charged with killing four people in New Jersey. peter.hall@mcall.com Twitter @phall215 610-820-6581 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Morning Call Trials and Arbitration Homicide Allentown police dash cam captures double-murder scene Dash Cam video of the July 5th, 2015 double homicide in Allentown Breaking Popular Obits Biz Cycle Sports LV Craft Beer Video/Photos Classifieds 46°

They’re also a hotspot for police calls. In Vancouver, Washington, there were more police calls to the Walmart at Northeast 104th Avenue than any other one location in the city in 2015. It was nearly twice the number of calls as the second-highest location, Vancouver Mall. Compared to Fred Meyer, Walmart stores generate more than twice as many calls on average in the Portland metro area.   In Multnomah, Washington and Clark counties, police were called to Walmart on average of 803 times a year, compared to 374 for nearby Fred Meyers. And one store isn't skewing the data. Every single Walmart generated significantly more calls than the nearest Fred Meyer. Police departments are already strapped for time and the calls cost taxpayers, who foot the bill. In the Portland metro area, officials at several police departments said the calls are not a significant burden and not every call is a report of a shoplifter.  “We have enough time to handle those calls because they really don’t take that much time for the officer,” said Chief Bob Richardson of the Battle Ground Police Department. But this isn’t just a local issue, and police departments in other cities say it’s putting a strain on officers.  Across the country, Walmart generates a disproportionate number of police calls. The Tampa Bay Times found Walmarts in four Florida counties generated four times as many calls as Target stores.  9News in Denver found Walmart was one of the top generators of police calls in the city and surrounding areas.  In Tulsa, Okla., there’s an officer known as “Officer Walmart” because his job is to police the local Walmart, according to a Bloomberg report.  “We have teams in place that are there to deter and prevent and stop shoplifters, but they are not law enforcement,” said Erica Jones, spokeswoman for Walmart. “If someone is stopped shoplifting or committing a crime at our store, we will call police.” Jones said the company has launched programs at Walmarts around the country, including Portland-area stores, to reduce calls. “We’ve enacted preventative measures here in the past few months including a program called ‘More at the Door,’ which bolsters a presence at the front of the store to deter criminal activity,” she said. Walmart also started a program called “Restorative Justice.” First-time shoplifters can choose to participate in an educational program instead of dealing with police. Jones said the programs reduced police calls by 40 percent in the first store they studied.  The Restorative Justice program is not without critics. Time Magazine reported that a company Walmart hired to give the courses is being sued for overcharging and false imprisonment. The article also questioned the ethics of forcing shoplifters to choose between paying money or face the possibility of an arrest.  It’s unknown whether Fred Meyer has enacted similar programs or if there are just fewer crimes committed at the stores. A spokeswoman for Fred Meyer said the company does not publicly discuss its security measures. Jones says Walmart hopes the new programs help ease the burden on local police departments, including the ones in the Portland area. “We don’t want people in our stores or the community for the wrong reasons,” she said. “We value our partnerships with law enforcement agencies and if there is some way we can enact some measure in our stores that can either prevent crime or reduce those calls for police service to our stores then we’re going to look at those and do what it is that we can.” Published August 22, 2016.

Off the Street Video Research Politics World Science Policy Tech Energy Religion Defense Sports Recent Videos Advertisement: August 23, 2016 Wal-Mart's Jet.com Buy Puts Online Sales Tax at the ForefrontBy Jessica Melugin This month, Wal-Mart announced plans to acquire e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion in the largest ever buyout of a U.S. e-commerce business. Wal-Mart should give itself a Smiley-the retailer's iconic happy face indicating a cost savings - and slash its budget for lobbying Congress to expand online sales taxes. The deal undercuts Wal-Mart's argument that the lack of online sales taxes allows competitors an "unfair" advantage in the marketplace. In fact, it illustrates that large retailers believe bigger distribution networks for faster delivery to customers and a strong online presence, is more of a competitive advantage than the lower prices achieved by avoiding sales tax obligations. How Wal-Mart will handle tax collections from purchases at Jet.com has not been released, but it is likely Wal-Mart's lobbyists will be in the awkward position of demanding an end to the online sales tax "loophole," while the company simultaneously chooses not to take advantage of it. States can only collect sales tax from companies with a physical presence, like a store or warehouse, within their borders. The Supreme Court's 1992 Quill decision enshrined this manifestation of "no taxation without representation," preventing states from taxing companies in other states that happen to sell to their residents. But state politicians seeking to fill tax coffers are petitioning Congress for expanded taxing authority. Specifically, they would like to reach outside their borders and collect sales taxes from companies that have no physical presence in their states. Never mind that these companies have no political voice in those states and don't benefit from the public services those taxes fund. Moreover, compliance costs for calculating for almost 10,000 distinct tax jurisdictions, each with its own base, rates, and tax holidays, would prove fatal for many small and mid-sized online sellers. State officials also seem nonchalant about their plan's detrimental effect on interstate tax competition and the free flow of goods the Constitution's commerce clause was written to protect. Joining state sales tax enthusiasts on Capitol Hill are lobbyists for big box retailers like Target and Best Buy-in addition to Wal-Mart. Their stores trigger sales tax obligations in all 50 states, so they feel they're at a competitive disadvantage relative to online retailers, which don't face those same tax liabilities. If the thought of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, needing the federal government to protect it from folks selling hand-knitted socks on eBay seems absurd, Wal-Mart's Jet.com purchase only makes it more so. It's hard to imagine Wal-Mart will forgo all the advantages of fully integrating Jet.com just to preserve the latter's current advantage of paying sales tax in only seven states. To do so, would deny Jet.com access to Wal-Mart's warehouses and stores in all 50 states, as that would trigger sales tax obligations for all Jet.com purchases. It's more likely Wal-Mart will sacrifice the tax advantage of Jet.com's small physical footprint in order to take full advantage of the parent company's vast distribution network to get customers what they want faster with less hassle. Wal-Mart wouldn't be the first to take this approach. Amazon.com, the number one online retailer in the U.S., has come to the same conclusion. For years, Amazon opposed expanded sales taxes online, but then reversed its position as it changed its strategy from a limited physical presence in only five states to distribution warehouses all over the country to offer faster delivery and even same-day service in some areas. Amazon now collects sales taxes in 28 states and on a majority of the U.S. population. Amazon's continued support for online sales taxes also creates a market for its tax software to help mom-and-pop online sellers comply with burdensome calculating and remitting requirements across the nation. Amazon has much to gain from government intervention and is therefore unlikely to reverse course again. In the bigger picture, online retail sales continue to grow-10.6 percent in the first half of 2016. Therefore, inequities in the way online sales are taxed may need to be addressed. But let's not forget, expanded sales taxes mean more bureaucracy on the Internet, higher costs for taxpayers, and could even be the death nail for smaller sellers-an unacceptable price to pay to end a tax policy that its critics can't even be bothered to exploit. The best solution would be an origin-based approach that requires online retailers to collect sales tax according to the point of purchase, not the residence of the customer, like their brick-and-mortar counterparts do. This system treats all types of retailers the same, allows states to collect only from within their borders, preserves healthy tax competition among states, and alleviates the costly compliance burden for companies. Now there's an idea Wal-Mart lobbyists might want to embrace.

Nominate yourself for the W100 now » When Carol Leaman took over as president and CEO of Axonify, the Waterloo-based e-learning company had exactly one client. Mind you, that client was not your typical first customer. Most startups start with small businesses, who typically have less complicated and lengthy procurement processes and are more willing to work with unknown partners. By contrast, Axonify’s initial sale was an American automotive parts retailer called Pep Boys, with $2 billion in revenue and a fleet of 20,000 employees. Leaman admits that signing Pep Boys to Axonify, which develops game- and incentive-based employee training software, took a bit of luck. But once the company was in the Axonify fold, keeping it and finding other giant corporations to partner with was easy. Soon, Leaman was selling her product to Toys R Us, Walmart, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and FedEx, to name just a few. It’s only now, five years later and with nearly $10 million in annual revenue, that Leaman,who ranked No. 26 on the 2016 W100 Ranking of Canada’s Top Female Entrepreneurs, has started focusing on selling to smaller businesses. While the approach—starting with mega clients and working down to the small ones—runs counter to the conventional startup strategy, it’s helped Axonify achieve mass success early on and accelerate quickly. Here, Leaman offers advice on how to start big and grow small. Focus on needs, not size “One of the things I’ve learned over the years and after four companies is [that you need to] pick your sweet spot and drill deep to get a footprint and a repeatable sales story,” says Leaman. After seeing what worked for Pep Boys in the area of health and safety training, Leaman and her team sought out companies with similar needs and sell them on Axonify’s product based on their first client’s experience. By targeting companies based on their needs rather than their size, Leaman ensured Axonify would have a compelling case to present. “With every big client, it made selling to the next one easier and easier,” Leaman says. Sell your vision “With larger companies, there tends to be inertia when it comes to change,” says Leaman. “They’ve invested millions of dollars already into training and it’s hard to see how this one service is going to change the game.” For a company like Walmart, for example, adopting Axonify’s product meant spending tens of thousands of dollars across several countries to reach 2.3 million employees. “The impact across the organization is so potentially great that they can’t afford to fail,” says Leaman. That’s why you need to create a vision of what the client could achieve if they worked with you. “You really have to get that person or team you’re selling to excited about the opportunity to transform the business,” says Leaman. “In smaller organizations, people can wrap their heads around it more easily.” Offer a trial period Even with a handful of positive testimonials, many FORTUNE 1000 companies weren’t willing to work with a little-known startup claiming to make huge impacts on employee behaviour. “We had to prove ourselves before they’d jump in with both feet,” says Leaman. Axonify won their trust by offering short-term pilot programs at a reduced rate for three to six months. One such arrangement was with Walmart, which adopted Axonify’s health and safety training for 5,000 employees across eight distribution centres over a six-month period. Walmart’s goal was to reduce the number of occupational health and safety reports by 5%; at the end of six months, the actual reduction was 54%. “Once we did enough of these pilots and converted them to long-term deals, we didn’t have to do trial offers anymore,” says Leaman. “Our existing customers were happy to talk to prospective customers to validate that our programs work.” Don’t ignore the value of small deals In the last few years, “gamified” employee training has become something of a trend, as research suggests ongoing development can yield significant improvements in employee retention and performance, and the bottom line. Coupled with Axonify’s growing name recognition, this increased interest has helped the company to attract small and medium-sized businesses organically. While these businesses don’t generate nearly as much revenue for Axonify as the multinationals, Leaman says they’re still worth her team’s time, especially if they’re easy to work with. “The benefit to those organizations is that we are often the first and only technology-enabled learning that they employ,” she says. “So we aren’t needing to integrate with other software solutions, or compete with the statement: ‘We’ve already invested in this other thing so how are you different and better?’ It makes the value we provide specific and unique.” Leaman also notes that many of the small and medium businesses she works with will someday be large companies with more resources and a greater need for services like Axonify’s. Staking a claim with these companies early on could lead to major payoffs down the road—particularly if you’re selling in an increasingly competitive market. “If we feel the smaller companies can grow,” Leaman, “it’s great to get in early and grow with them.” MORE ON LANDING BIG CLIENTS: Master the Art of Landing Big Clients » 6 Ways to Make Your Company Look Bigger Than It Really Is » How to Bag a Trophy Client » 3 Low-Cost Keys to Getting Big Companies to Trust You » Who Your Most Valuable Customers Really Are » Subscribe to our e-newsletter Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Follow us on LinkedIn Print Email Comment Share: Directory Learn more about Canada’s Best Places for Business 2016 Photo gallery Damn Good Advice from the 2016 PROFIT 500 On… BusinessCast 3 Good Reasons Not to Franchise Your Business Loading comments, please wait.

Across Western Europe, the food market is dominated by a number of large corporations including, but not limited to, Walmart, Carrefour, Metro AG, Tesco, as well as many more subsidiaries. In order to sustain businesses on such a massive scale, these businesses require large numbers of staff in order to fulfill day-to-day operations. Much of the work required to keep these companies going from falls under the remit of the customer assistant. The traditional customer assistant role is defined as being fairly low-skilled, low-paid, and often filled by young people as their first job. As food retailers have the potential to have a large environmental impact across their operations, be it through sourcing suppliers, how their products are farmed and produced, logistical operations, as well as the environmental impact of store locations, it is doubly important for a succinct environmental policy to be implemented. A quick look on the big players websites such as Walmart, Lidl and Tesco shows that these businesses do appear to take the environmental cost of their operations seriously. An environmental mission statement is only as good as it’s execution, however. For a large retailer to reduce it’s impact on the environment, an green attitude must be adopted across the entire business. Last month, Raz Godelnik argued that CEOs have limited control over the environmental impact of their businesses. Here, the issue is largely similar, as it requires engagement from staff at every level. The question that those in the upper management level should be asking themselves is what can be done to encourage every single one of our employees to invest in our vision for sustainability. Some retailers are better at employee engagement than others. The UK supermarket Waitrose is part of the John Lewis Partnership, an employee owned department store, famed for how well it’s staff are treated. John Lewis is frequently cited as being one of the best companies to work for in the UK. Looking at Waitrose, we can see that this same attitude is fostered through the treatment of new employees. Upon receiving a work contract, new customer assistants are given shares in the company and made ‘Partners’ through their Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Giving new workers a tangible stake in their place of work is a proven method of improving company commitment. The Waitrose website reveals a strong commitment to environmentalism. The business practices they have implemented cover a variety of issues, ranging from reducing the amount of waste generated by individual stores, to the responsible sourcing of fish, as well as collaborative work with environmental charities such as The Woodlands Trust and The Prince’s Countryside Trust. Bringing it back to the workers of Waitrose themselves, what can we glean from this combination of staff engagement and ambitious environmental policy? A closer look at the supermarket’s Indeed profile shows a rather impressive 4.1 out of 5 score. This gives us a snapshot that Waitroses’ employees are satisfied, and makes for interesting reading when compared with other British supermarkets such as the Walmart owned ASDA, whose employees gave them 3.7 out of 5, and Tesco, who have 3.8. So when we put satisfied staff with an ambitious environmental policy, what do we have? (Interestingly, Waitrose’s parent company John Lewis, which also uses an ESOP has a rating of 4.2.) Research conducted by ethicalConsumer.com found Waitrose to be the third most ethical supermarket in the UK behind the Co-Op and M&S. The poll’s scoring system actually puts Waitrose top of the pile, however researchers at ethicalConsumer.com have adjusted their qualitative data to put the Co-Op and M&S ahead. The research took into account a number of variables including workers rights, supply chain management, and environmental impact. As Waitrose scores high on both how they treat their employees, and how environmentally conscious they are, other retailers should recognise that the two go hand in hand. It’s all too easy to stereotype low level supermarket customer assistants as disinterested and workshy. What we see online does little to help dissipate this image, with the likes of Grocery Store Bingo, and the People of Walmart website. However, when a large company takes the time to engage and invest in employees at every level, you end up with a business with a common goal. When that goal is to reduce the environmental impact inflicted by their operations, we end up with an example that other food retailers should be following.

Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Wal-Mart sells just about anything a consumer could want And so when its sales results fall short- it sends a broader message about the economy: Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman: SOUNDBITE: JOE FELDMAN, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "It definitely seems like there is a slowdown, broadly speaking, at that more moderate consumer, certainly in the U.S. and globally as well. I mean, there was some sales pressure as well. But here in the U.S., the 2 percent payroll tax is definitely weighing on the consumer. The paycheck cycle was still very pronounced for Wal-Mart meaning people were really timing purchases around when they get their paychecks." Wal-Mart didn't just miss on its same store sales- the discounter lowered its outlook for revenue and profits for the year. Shares of Wal-Mart fell on the news. But the pain was selective- and looking at what sold and what sat on the shelves- is a window into what's going on in retail. SOUNDBITE: JOE FELDMAN, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Grocery was fine and we are still seeing grocery fine. But if you remove that from the table Apparel was a better category for them. That's been mixed from a lot of the retailers that have been reporting so far and next week I think it will be mixed as well. Home was actually pretty good. They are still seeing home furnishing trends being very strong. Bed and bath. Sporting goods was actually better than we had expected so I think that might bode well for Dick's Sporting Goods. We do think next week, back to the home theme, Home Depot, Lowe's will do well. Pets was another good category. So I think that bodes well for Petsmart." Also tough for Wal-Mart- international sales were not up as much as hoped. The company says it will be doing more to control costs in those markets.

Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) Aug 21, 2016 at 2:47PM Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported fiscal 2017 second-quarter results on Aug. 18. The retail giant saw its e-commerce sales growth rate accelerate, and the company boosted its profit outlook for the year ahead. Wal-Mart Stores results: The raw numbers Metric  Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Growth (YOY) Revenue $120.854 billion $120.229 billion 0.5% Net Income $3.773 billion $3.475 billion 8.6% Earnings Per Share $1.21 $1.08 12% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores' Q2 2017 earnings press release. YOY = year over year. What happened with Wal-Mart Stores this quarter? Total revenue rose less than 1% to $121 billion, and 2.8% on a constant currency basis. U.S. comparable-store sales edged up 1.6% -- making Q2 2017 Wal-Mart's eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps -- as traffic increased 1.2%. The performance of Wal-Mart's smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores was again a source of strength, with comps increasing 6.5%. These rising comps helped fuel a 3.1% year-over-year increase in Wal-Mart's U.S. sales to $76.2 billion. However, sales at Sam's Club fell, decreasing 1.3% to $14.5 billion. Wal-Mart's international sales also declined, falling 6.6% to $28.6 billion, as foreign currency fluctuations once again dampened results. Excluding the negative impact of these foreign exchange rate movements, Wal-Mart's international sales rose 2.2% to $31.3 billion. Importantly, global e-commerce sales increased 11.8% on a constant-currency basis, as Wal-Mart continues to invest heavily in this area, including its recent $3 billion deal for Jet.com. "We remain focused on building e-commerce capabilities globally and executing our omni-channel plan, as evidenced by our recent alliance with JD.com in China and agreement to acquire Jet.com in the U.S.," said CEO Doug McMillon in a press release. "Walmart is uniquely positioned to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience where we save them time and money." Yet this growth has come at a cost. Wal-Mart's e-commerce investments -- along with its decision to boost wages for many of its employees in order to improve morale and, by extension, customer service -- have taken a toll on profits. First-quarter operating income -- adjusted to exclude a one-time gain related to an asset sale -- fell 7.2% to $5.6 billion. Despite the lower profits, Wal-Mart's cash generation remains strong, with the retail giant producing nearly $15 billion in operating cash flow and more than $10 billion in free cash flow in the first half of fiscal 2017. That allowed Wal-Mart to return nearly $3.7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases during the second quarter. Looking forward In the third quarter, Wal-Mart expects comparable-store sales growth of 1% to 1.5% for its U.S. locations, while Sam's Club comps are forecasted to be "slightly positive" when excluding the effects of fuel sales. The company also anticipates third-quarter earnings per share will be between $0.90 and $1.00. Additionally, Wal-Mart raised its fiscal 2017 full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $4.15 to $4.35, up from its prior guidance of $4.00 to $4.30. "I'm pleased with the momentum in the business," added McMillon. "We have a plan, and we are executing against it and customers are responding favorably."

Two decades after Simon began assembling a small empire of natural foodstuffs, Hain is enjoying a bountiful season. Sales are rising 20%-plus as it fills new distribution channels and builds on its well-known Celestial Seasonings tea offerings by acquiring trendier items like The Greek Gods yogurt, Sensible Portions veggie snacks, and BluePrint raw juices. Its trajectory and market position have endeared Hain to Wall Street analysts and famished growth-stock investors, who've awarded the stock (ticker: HAIN) a multiple of earnings and cash flow that's 50% higher than its peers. Having tripled in the past three years to $62.20, shares of the Melville, N.Y., company trade at 28 times earnings for the 12 months ended September 2012, and about 17 times free cash flow (after capital expenditures).

Its multiples, however, are lower than those of the natural-food fan's No. 1, Annie's (BNNY). But Hain could find it tough to sustain the growth rate that has propped up its pricey shares. If, for example, competition weighs upon hit products or Hain falls off its acquisition pace, the stock could lose its premium multiple and spill, by our estimate, roughly a third of its value. Too many servings of these health-food shares—however wholesome—can still raise your risk. Enlarge Image Close Stronger competition is definitely on the way in veggie snacks and Greek-style yogurt, categories from which Hain has been getting its organic growth—that's "organic" in the accounting sense of "not acquired." There's also some evidence of what investors might call style drift in Hain's purchases in the U.K. of a half-billion dollars' worth of sandwich and jam products that are not particularly natural. Accretive natural-food acquisitions aren't always available when you need them. Nor is it easy to keep score of the returns on Hain's acquisitions. Simon and his colleagues invite shareholders to heed a measure they call "adjusted net income," which excludes costs like merger fees, severance, product-line "rationalization," and other items that seem to be recurring expenses in a business dedicated to the roll-up acquisition of niche organic-food companies. Incentive compensation for management has been keyed off the adjusted-earnings number, instead of the standard earnings determined by generally recognized accounting principles. Those GAAP earnings were 40% lower than the "adjusted" number in the five fiscal years through June 2012. WHILE FREELY CONCEDING THE CHALLENGES, Simon contends that natural foods are only in their salad days. "We are in the early stages of health and wellness," he says. Teen vegetarians will grow into the next generation of parents who choose baby foods and kids' snacks. One measure of future opportunities: Although California voters only narrowly defeated a proposition to require labeling of genetically modified ingredients, it's possible that other states will embrace GMO-labeling. Hain is already prepared with labels bragging of its GMO-free products. "I've juiced for three days," says Simon, 54, recalling a juice-fast cleansing. "The biggest prevention and biggest cure is what you eat." After working at Slim-Fast Foods and Häagen-Dazs, Simon found the seed for his ambitions in 1993 when he took over a kosher-food business called Kineret. The next year, he bought Hain Pure Foods from Pet Inc. Many acquisitions followed: Terra Chips snacks in 1998, Earth's Best Organic baby food in 1999, and Celestial Seasonings herbal teas in 2000. Enlarge Image Close Under the name Hain Celestial Group, Simon's company did more than a dozen transactions over the ensuing decade—financed with modest levels of borrowing, rather than dilutive stock offerings. Simon and his chief financial officer, Ira Lamel, are proud that they avoided the balance-sheet heroics that brought grief to other acquisitive food companies, such as Diamond Foods (DMND). "Any investment banker that comes in to present a deal to us...his opening line is, 'You're way underleveraged.' " says Lamel. They've examined and declined billion-dollar deals. Hain's moderate growth rate since its creation started to perk up a couple of years ago. Revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2012 was $1.4 billion, almost 25% above the prior year's, with earnings of $79 million, or $1.73 a share, 40% above the previous year's earnings per share, despite a 33-cents-a-share loss from now discontinued operations. Including the just-acquired British jams, revenue for the June 2013 year could approach $1.8 billion, with Hain projecting net around $2.40 (counting the new U.K. spreads). These recent years' strong performance sent the stock on its post-2010 tear. A goodly portion of Hain's recent revenue growth has resulted from new sales channels. In a determined campaign to fill in the white spaces on its distribution map, the company dedicated sales teams to key accounts, including Costco Wholesale (COST), Wal-Mart (WMT), Target TGT 1.040195197123411% Target Corp.

New outlets led to a nice jump in sales for Hain products like Terra Chips—made from the likes of taro, yucca, and sweet potato—and Garden of Eatin' tortilla chips. Simon aspires to expand Hain's distribution roster, from about a third of all food retailers (as measured by industry sales volume) to half. But after the initial stocking of these mass outlets, Hain will maintain its revenue momentum only if consumers like the stuff enough to drive same-store sales. Enlarge Image Close To be sure, Hain's recent sales strength hasn't all been from channel fill. Hain broadens distribution of its acquired products, but also comes up with new flavors and packaging. Overall sales of Sensible Portions products and The Greek Gods yogurt have more than doubled since Hain bought them two years ago. But looming ahead of these products is big competition. Private-label veggie straws have now appeared at Whole Foods and even Kmart. As Barron's reported last month, industry production of Greek-style yogurt will expand enormously in the next few years ("A High-Stakes Food Fight," Oct. 29). Yoplait vendor General Mills is becoming an aggressive late entrant with Greek-style products. Backed by influential politicians like Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), New York State is helping to add yogurt-factory capacity at Chobani, Fage, and even PepsiCo, which is building a $206 million yogurt plant in a joint venture. And Danone is adding production. In their September-quarter conference call, Hain executives confirmed that yogurt rivals were engaging in "price dealing" or, more plainly, price-cutting. This will likely become more intense as additional production capacity comes online. Simon acknowledges that competition will increase in Hain's categories. "What keeps me up at night?" he asks. "To ensure that we keep ahead of the competition." Hain is feeling the heat in sales of its Soy Dream and West Soy beverages, says Simon. The rival product Silk has fared so well that Dean Foods did an initial public offering of 14% of its WhiteWave Foods unit in October, with plans to distribute its remaining stake to Dean shareholders. Other disappointments for Hain were sandwich and prepared-meal businesses acquired last year in the U.K. and since disposed of as discontinued operations. Fortunately, a single product's underperformance can't sink Hain: Simon notes that no one brand, or customer, represents more than 19% of its sales. Even so, given Hain's reliance on acquisitions for growth, an ill-starred deal makes it harder to keep up the pace. EARNINGS GROWTH IS HARD to pinpoint in an acquisitive company. A good yardstick, suggests CFO Lamel, might be free cash flow—a measure of cash flow from operations, less capital spending. That number has grown nicely in Hain's past five years, from just 11 cents a share in the June 2008 year, to $2.21 in the June 2012 year. But if investors care about all the capital invested in Hain's acquired businesses—including equity, debt, and things like deferred tax liabilities—even those free-cash-flow numbers don't add up to an impressive return on invested capital. Over the same five-year stretch, Hain's free cash flow ROIC averaged a modest 4%. That's better than a Treasury note's return, but well below that of a comparable–and cheaper – food stock like WhiteWave with its 6% ROIC. Simon and his team have done an admirable job of consolidating products whose ingredients are more healthful than conventional fare. If Hain can't maintain true organic profit growth, however, its shares could settle to a more conventional earnings multiple below 20. That would cut the price by about a third and annoy a tough financial-health-conscious customer named Icahn Associates, which owns about 16% of Hain's shares.

Whole Foods Market (WFM) announced third quarter ended June 30, 2016 total sales of $3.70 billion, up 2 percent year-over-year from $3.63 billion during the same period last year. Whole Foods Market declared third quarter of 2016 net income of $120 million or $0.37 per diluted share, down 22 percent year-over-year from $154 million or $0.43 per diluted share in third quarter of 2015. The global organic foods provider reported continued year-over-year slight improvement in its top line primarily driven by a healthy trend of comparable store sales and rising sales from the company’s increasing number of global organic foods outlet. Focusing in the right areas   Whole Foods Market has illustrated notable improvement in top line for the first quarter of 2016 after witnessing continued revenue decline since last four quarters. However, operating margin for the company declined 58 basis points during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and despite significant cost-saving initiatives being undertaken by the company. Going forward, Whole Foods Market is consistently facing significant competition from value-driven organic food providers like Trader Joes, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and conventional retailers like Costco (COST), Kroger (KR) and Walmart (WMT). Therefore, Whole Foods Market needs to deliver superior product innovation in order to successfully counter the expanding competition from these well-established organic food players. The organic foods company is believed to continue to suffer top line losses and market share loss to several other organic foods retailers that have sheer size and impressive financial position to support their growth operations while delivering attractive innovation in their organic food offerings. The overall financial performance of Whole Foods Market has diminished with the expanding competition. Image by PublicDomainPictures / Pixabay The company declared 8.4% of EBITDA margin during the first quarter of 2016, which is believed to be the weakest since past 16 quarters. However, Whole Foods Market’s sales per square foot were recorded better than Walmart (WMT), Fresh Market (TFM) and Kroger (KR) while weaker than Costco (COST). Whole Foods Market same-store sales remained the highest among its competitors and the company registered the greatest EBITDA margins. Impressive moves   Whole Foods Market has undertaken several growth efforts to enhance the value perception, expand long-term profitability and restructure traffic such as strategic investments in core technology platforms and superior digital technologies, improved external marketing initiatives, strategic and well-planned price reductions, enhanced promotional activities, introducing attractive stores, enhanced focus on prepared foods and exclusive brands and impressive cost restructuring. Moving ahead, Whole Foods Market targets on opening three major 365 stores from May 2016 till August 2016. The organic foods company has already declared 13 key leases for 365 store format. These innovative 365 stores are expected to support the company in better managing the value sensitivity issues and would target millennials. The company is expected to be successfully countering the rising threat from other major organic foods retailers through the strategic introduction of new stores at key destinations while optimizing its financial position for successfully supporting the well-planned growth efforts. Whole Foods Market delivered 45 basis point enhancement in comps since last quarter, with a notable growth in items per basket hugely offset the decline in the average cost per item and the number of transactions. The combined operations optimization efforts of Whole Foods Market including, the company’s value strategy, customers moving towards selecting smaller-priced items and disinflation in certain item types caused year-over-year fall in average cost per item. Although the company’s value approach is consistently and negatively impacting gross margin and comps, while Whole Foods Market is continuing to witness a widespread improvement in the number of items per basket and seems stimulated with expanding traffic trends through some major departments, mainly produce. Conclusion Overall, the investors are advised to “Hold” their position in Whole Foods Market, Inc. considering the company’s significant long-term growth prospects but, currently weaker financial position with significant total debt of $1.05 billion against weaker total cash position of $625 million only, restricting the company to make future growth investments. The profit margin of 3.04% seems satisfactory. The PEG ratio of 4.91 indicate healthy company growth. Published on Aug 22, 2016 By Subhen Mittra Copyrighted 2016.

Residents have expressed concern about more cars on the road when developments like Walmart are completed. Stephen Fastenau sfastenau@beaufortgazette.com i By Lucas High lhigh@islandpacket.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Beaufort County and the City of Beaufort moved closer Monday to resolving a conflict over who should responsible for paying for a traffic study along the Sea Island Parkway corridor on Lady’s Island. County officials balked earlier this month at a request by the city that the county carry the full burden of paying for the nearly $88,000 study — sparking what Rep. Shannon Erickson described as a “turf war” between the two entities. Beaufort Mayor Billy Keyserling and city manager Bill Prokop came back before the county’s governmental and finance committees Monday with a new proposal that appeared to be more palatable for county officials. We have to be very careful and very frugal in how we spend our funds. Beaufort County Councilman Jerry Stewart Recommended unanimously by members of the finance committee, the new deal would require the county to pay for 90 percent of the study — roughly $79,000 — while the city would shoulder the remaining 10 percent of the cost. Funding for the study would come from road impact fees paid by Walmart, which is building a new store on Lady’s Island. Lady’s Island “has become a very popular place” to live and shop, and congestion is already an issue prior to the opening of the Walmart, Keyserling said Monday. “There is a traffic problem on Lady’s Island that needs to be addressed,” he said. While county officials agreed with city leaders about the need for a comprehensive traffic study in the area, County Council members said the city ought to have some skin in the game. “We have to be very careful and very frugal in how we spend our funds,” Councilman Jerry Stewart said Monday. He said he thinks that “it is important that the city does contribute” to the cost of the study. County Councilman Steve Fobes said he remains “a little conflicted about the dollar amounts” spent by the county compared to the city, but he isn’t “going to quibble ... whatever the split is” at this point in the process. Despite the recommendation by the county’s finance committee, the full council must approve funding deal with the city. If the deal were to fall through, the city would be on the hook for the full cost of the study, Prokop said Monday. “We’re committed. We signed a contract” with engineering firm Ward Edwards to perform the study, he said. “We will have to cut other things out of our budget” if the county declines to fund the vast majority of the study, he said. While there are still lingering differences in opinion on who should pay for what, everyone involved seems to agree that traffic in the area is a problem. A comprehensive study would be the first step toward finding solutions, officials from both the city and county say. Concerns were brought late last year from local residents who said entering and leaving the area around Lost Island Road would become more dangerous when the new Walmart, along with several other proposed developments, open. The residents asked state Erickson to bring the S.C. Department of Transportation into the discussion. The agency joined a group including the city and county to form a plan in recent months. The funding split proposed by city leaders Monday will likely be introduced to the full County Council for consideration next month.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Topic News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted For Bloggers PRNewswire Distribution Search Progressive Real Estate & SRS Real Estate Sell Former Walmart Bldg in Perris, CA for $4M Former Walmart Sold in Perris, CA for $4M   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Retail * Commercial Real Estate * Progressive Real Estate By Industry: * Real EstateRANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. - Aug. 22, 2016 - PRLog -- Progressive Real Estate Partners and SRS Real Estate Partners announced today the sale of a 127,000 square-foot former Walmart building for $4,050,000 in an all cash transaction.  The building is located at 2560 North Perris Boulevard in Perris, CA and is also part of the well-established 292,000 square-foot Spectrum Shopping Center which includes Cardenas, Dollar Tree, Wells Fargo Bank, Verizon, Taco Bell and Payless ShoeSource. Investment sales experts Greg Bedell and Paul Galmarini of Progressive Real Estate Partners and Townsand Cropsey of SRS Real Estate Partners exclusively marketed the property and represented the seller, a Santa Monica–based private investment firm.  The buyer, a private California investor, was represented by Drew Wetherholt of Marcus & Millichap in Ontario, CA. Built in 1991, the 127,000 square-foot retail building is easily divisible, has excellent pylon signage and ample parking with approximately 750 parking spaces.  The building is zoned community commercial allowing for a variety of retail uses which was a key selling point.  Located off the 215 freeway at the signalized intersection of N. Perris Boulevard and Orange Avenue, the Spectrum Shopping Center is on a major retail thoroughfare with excellent visibility to 34,000 cars per day.   The property is also directly adjacent to the proposed 1800-unit Harvest Landing residential community and a 228-unit apartment complex. "Prior to placing the building on the market, we were able to generate significant pre-leasing interest from multiple national retailers making it a particularly attractive investment opportunity, especially in a market where there is limited new ground-up construction.  As a result we were able to sell the property at a price that was 22% more than what our client had paid for it approximately 6 months prior,"  according to Greg Bedell, Investment Sales Specialist at Progressive Real Estate Partners.   "Furthermore we had multiple offers and were able to execute a non-contingent contract with a 10-day close.  With historically low interest rates and rising values, demand remains strong for well-located retail properties in SouthernCalifornia's Inland Empire market," he added.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 22, 2016 1:27pm   Comments Share: BMO Capital has maintained its Underperform rating on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), despite better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and gross margin. The world's biggest retailer reported adjusted EPS of $1.07, which exceeded the Street estimates by $0.05 a share and BMO estimates by $0.07. Wal-Mart's revenue grew 0.5 percent to $120.9 billion and topped the analysts' expectations of $120.16 billion. Its comp sales rose 1.6 percent. Guidance And Analyst Take Moving ahead, the retailer raised its full-year adjusted EPS view to $4.15–$4.35 from $4.00–$4.30. BMO also raised its full-year EPS estimate to $4.34 from $4.22. "The year-to-date improvement in GM rate has been the single biggest surprise in 2016 as we expected price investments to lead to pressure," analyst Wayne Hood wrote in a note. Related Link: Have Discount Retailers Remained "Amazon Proof"? However, Hood said although e-commerce and GMV sales grew 11.8 percent and 13 percent, respectively, most e-commerce retailers are posting similar, if not higher, sales growth. Wal-Mart is actually below the average with total U.S. e-commerce sales growing at 15.8 percent year-over-year in the second quarter according to the U.S. Census Bureau. "We are concerned that, in an effort to catch up in the e-commerce game, Walmart may jeopardize its margins and not get the corresponding return it expects," Hood highlighted. Hood also expressed his concerns that the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition is on top of Wal-Mart's plans to invest $1.2 billion–$1.5 billion in e-commerce in 2016. Further, the analyst said Marc Lore, Jet.com founder and CEO, who will join Wal-Mart and run both Jet.com and Walmart.com, has limited experience running a business long term. "We have concern about Marc Lore's ability to run a company and also that he will move on sooner rather than later given his track record," Hood noted. Justification Hood's Underperform rating is based on the thesis that further large increases in gross margins could lessen as price investments accelerate into 2017, despite the company's steps to restore traffic, grow SSS and reduce inventory point to success. "Importantly, at 17x 2016 EPS, expectations are high for a company with a LSD long-term EPS growth rate, leaving us at Underperform," Hood added. At time of writing, shares of Wal-Mart were down 0.33 percent to $72.51. Hood raised his price target to $67 from $60. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

According to the ‘FACT SHEET: White House Announces New Commitments to the Fair Chance Business Pledge,’ companies and organizations that pledged to Ban the Box collectively employ over 3 million Americans. By signing the Fair Chance Business Pledge, these companies demonstrate a commitment to reduce barriers to jobs for the approximately 70 million Americans with some type of criminal record by: Using practices such as “Ban the Box” to delay criminal history questions until later in the hiring process; Ensuring that information regarding an applicant’s criminal record is considered in proper context; and Engaging in hiring practices that do not unnecessarily place jobs out of reach for those with criminal records. The White House FACT SHEET explains that the Obama Administration is committed to reducing barriers facing individuals with criminal records trying to reenter society. Over 2.2 million individuals are incarcerated in American prisons and jails and the majority of them will return to their communities. Improving education and job opportunities for these individuals reduces crime and helps communities. Along with Walmart, larger U.S. employers who have taken the White House Fair Chance Business Pledge to Ban the Box include American Airlines, Best Buy, Coca-Cola, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Hersheys, Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Kellogg Company, Koch Industries, Lyft, Microsoft, Oklahoma City Thunder, PepsiCo, Prudential, Staples, Starbucks, Uber, UnderArmour, University of Pennsylvania, and Xerox. The White House launched the Fair Chance Business Pledge in April 2016 to encourage U.S. companies to ensure that all Americans – including individuals with a criminal record – have the opportunity to succeed by eliminating barriers for those job seekers with a criminal record. A full list of employers taking the Ban the Box pledge is at www.whitehouse.gov/issues/criminal-justice/fair-chance-pledge. More Ban the Box Information from ESR The Ban the Box movement that removes the box job applicants are asked to check on applications if they have a criminal record is spreading rapidly. Currently, more than 20 states and over 100 cities and counties in America have some form of Ban the Box legislation.

You would think that after a bomb threat, accidental shooting, and hostages were held at gunpoint by a disgruntled employee, this Walmart would have exhausted its bad luck. However, just this weekend, another unfortunate situation played out. Around 3:30 on Sunday, August 21st, police were called to the parking lot, where a 51-year-old woman had been struck by a vehicle. She said that one of the passengers of the car that hit her got out and took her purse, then fled. The story only gets crazier: a witness saw the robbery and followed the vehicle out of the parking lot. After a short drive, the vehicle stopped and a man got out with a gun. He pointed it at the witness, threatening to shoot him if he continued to follow them. The witness drove back to Walmart to speak to police. APD is currently looking for these suspects. There were two Hispanic women in the front seat and three Hispanic men in the backseat of a four-door red Lincoln Town Car. Thankfully, the victim of this crime only received minor injuries and was able to be treated. Please contact the police at (806) 378-3038 or Amarillo Crime Stoppers if you have any information about the suspects. You can call (806) 374-4400 or submit an online tip here.

The all-out brawl occurred inside the store in Crestwood, south of Chicago, and was all captured on video by a witness. The fracas involved four women and was attempted to be stopped by a single male security guard, who got lost in the fight.  Brawling: The four women starting hitting and screaming each other inside the Walmart  The incident occurred at the store in Crestwood. One woman her top ripped in the fight, which exposed her breasts  A woman at the center of the brawl had her top pulled down in the melee, exposing her breasts. Another woman was then finally dragged away from the group by the security guard, though she continued to fight against him and scream. It is unclear what started the argument that led to the brawl. Crestwood Police did not have records of any arrests. The video was uploaded to YouTube last week and has received thousands of views.   Break it up: A security guard managed to get one of the women away from the group  Melee: The woman continued to shout and yell back at the group  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The amazing results of the 'walk to Walmart' diet: Arizona...

(WFLA) – A four-drawer wooden chest sold on Walmart’s website is being recalled over concerns they could tip over onto children. This recall involves four-drawer wooden chests made by Sauder Woodworking sold under the Storybook brand (model 416407). The white laminated chests have a single white wood pull on each drawer. The recall states the chests are unstable until they are anchored to the wall, posing a serious tip-over risk. The chests were manufactured between April 2016 and June 2016. They were sold exclusively at Walmart.com from April 2016 to June 2016 for about $100. A label with the date code is located on the back of the unit. The chests measure 42.13 inches high by 29.25 inches wide and 16.25 inches deep. There were no reported injuries or incidents in connection with this product. Consumers should immediately stop using any recalled chests that are not properly anchored to the wall and place them in an area that children can’t have access to them. The company is contacting all known purchasers directly and sending free repair kits and wall anchoring kits. If you can’t attach the repair kit, you can contact Sauder Woodworking for a full refund. Consumers who request a refund will be provided instructions by Sauder on how to properly dispose of the chests. CPSC strongly recommends that all dressers be anchored to the wall.

Porter’s and Kramer’s Creating Shared Value approach is “moving into the mainstream and growing exponentially. Companies that adopt shared-value thinking remain committed (as they should) to philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. But they’re moving beyond often-fuzzy notions like sustainability and corporate citizenship, and instead making measurable social impact central to how they compete.” Sustainability as a fuzzy notion for business strategy? I’m going to push back on that. As the environmental NGO that spearheaded a first of its kind partnership with McDonalds over 25 years ago, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has partnered with hundreds of leading companies to address sustainability in specifically non-fuzzy ways. We do it by following the science and making sure that every EDF+Business project drives measurable environmental and business results. Porter and Kramer single out EDF and our 10+ year partnership with Walmart. (Thank you, we’ve actually worked with 15 companies on the Fortune list!) The non-fuzzy win-win to this partnership is that EDF helped Walmart set a first of its kind goal for reducing its supply chain greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 20 million metric tons (MMT) by 2016. We helped design the stretch target and then stuck around for the tough middle miles of execution, forging solutions across their global supply chain to achieve that goal. The result? A reduction of 36.5 MMT of GHG emissions by the end of 2015. EDF is also working with Walmart to eliminate chemicals of concern from health and beauty products on their shelves. The result? A reduction of 23 million pounds of chemicals out of products in 24 months. This is just one example from our rich history of collaboration with leading companies. Our partnership with McDonald’s eliminated the Styrofoam clamshell packaging and over 300 million pounds of waste. Our partnership with FedEx created the first fleet of hybrid delivery trucks reducing emissions by 65%. Our work with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) resulted in 27 KKR portfolio companies achieving nearly $1.2 billion in avoided costs and added revenue, while eliminating more than 2.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, 27 million cubic meters of water use, and 6.3 million tons of waste through eco-efficiency efforts. I could go on, but I think you get my point. Plus, unlike August 1, 1990 when we launched our work with McDonald’s, we’re no longer alone, our colleagues at BSR, Ceres, CI, TNC, WRI and WWF are leading complementary, collaborations with leaders across the economy and around the world. When business partners with an NGO like EDF, the results are anything but fuzzy. When NGOs and Business work together, they can change the world. @TPMurray Click To Tweet Powered By CoSchedule With that said, the key themes in Porter and Kramer’s article are solid. Corporate leaders need to integrate societal, and in broader terms, the planet’s needs into their core strategies. Investors need to consider creating value for the planet as well as themselves when allocating capital resources. And businesses and NGOs need to work together to ensure that creating shared value is the strategic norm for the future.

 TECH INVESTOR: We're in a huge bubble — but it's not what you think Rob Price Aug. 22, 2016, 6:19 AM 12,803 facebook linkedin twitter email print "I'm not in a bubble! YOU'RE in a bubble!" Ethan Miller/Getty Images What links Walmart's $3 billion purchase of Jet.com, Unilever buying up Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion, and GM buying Cruise for $1 billion? They're all examples of smaller startups being acquired by dominant incumbent rivals. And according to Dave McClure, a venture capitalist at the investment firm and startup accelerator 500 Startups, they're indicative of a bubble — but not where most people think. Bubbles are among the tech sector's favourite topics of discussion: Is the industry in one? And what happens when it pops? With huge volumes of venture capital sloshing around, and the increasing proliferation of billion-dollar-plus startups, known as unicorns, plenty of people think there's a tech bubble. And amid a decline in VC funding and valuation write-downs of some of Silicon Valley's darlings (including Snapchat), we may already be in a contraction, the argument goes. But McClure takes the opposite approach. "Most unicorns and many tech IPOs are perhaps overvalued, but a few of them are actually UNDER-valued as well," he argues in a new blog post. The investor points to Facebook as an example of how tech company valuations can skyrocket postvaluation — and makes the case that if anyone is in a bubble, it's the traditional incumbent companies, ripe for disruption. Of course, McClure works in the venture capital business, so it's no surprise that he's trying to talk down the idea that he might be contributing to an unsustainable bubble. He has his livelihood and the valuations of his investments to think about. With that in mind, it's an interesting argument, not only for its own merits but also because of what it tells you about the vision of boundless meritocratic "disruption" that startup investors are trying to sell to the world. Is that unicorn a dog in disguise? John Moore/Getty Images McClure asserts: "The REAL bubble is in far-too-generous P/E multiples and valuations of global public companies, whose business models are being obliterated by startups and improved by orders of magnitude." As a result, he argues, we should expect to see plenty more acquisitions like Walmart's purchase of Jet.com, as the incumbents wake up to the threat that smaller startups are posing and attempt to "hedge their own public valuations by buying the very same unicorns that keep them awake at night." He goes on (emphasis ours): "Of course, this might be risky, but it's no more risky than not doing anything and expecting to keep your CEO job intact and the stock price rising. Hedging your public company stock by buying potentially disruptive unicorns for only 5–10% of your market cap may be one of the simplest ways to defuse the startup threat and keep on trucking ... this is the Unicorn Hedge. ... "No surprise, most of the now-public tech giants are investing in and buying OTHER tech startups and unicorns to stay on top of their game. Microsoft bought LinkedIn and Skype. Google bought YouTube and Android. Facebook bought WhatsApp and Instagram. In fact in the past five years ALL of the top 5 highest-value public companies are tech companies. So what do you think is more overvalued? The average unicorn or tech IPO? Or the average non-tech public company that hasn't innovated in over a decade?" These allegedly non-innovative public companies, McClure argues, are ripe to come crashing down (emphasis ours): "The REAL twist is Wall Street finance getting disrupted by Silicon Valley tech (and, by NYC and LA tech too). The REAL twist is the S&P 500 not realizing their avg P/E multiple should be ~5–10 instead of ~15–25. The REAL twist is big oil & gas and automotive companies not realizing their market caps aren't just overvalued, but that in 10–20 years THEY WILL GO TO ZERO as electric power and autonomous vehicles become the norm. The REAL twist is thousands of public companies hemorrhaging billions in losses and value over the next ten years, like gigantic, collapsing Manhattan skyscrapers in slow motion … except that it might not be that slow." In short: It's the traditional billion-dollar companies that are overvalued — not the startups that are planning to eat their dinner. It's certainly true that some big incumbent companies will be toppled by the next generation of entrepreneurs. But even the most ardent bubble-theory advocates wouldn't disagree with that. It's the extravagant spending in some corners of startup culture and the allure of meteoric growth and hyperbolic investor promises that are in question. And as McClure points out, these incumbents are more aware of — and taking steps to counteract — the threat posed by startups than ever before. At the same time, when multibillion-dollar startups can blow through hundreds of millions of investor dollars before imploding — or hire hundreds of employees and then close without ever launching a proper product — it gets harder and harder to believe that the tech sector isn't at least a little inflated.

The request from District 1 Supervisor Roger Gitlin sparked a debate among commissioners Tuesday about whether a property owner — in this case the county — can remove someone’s possessions even though they’re living on that property illegally. The Del Norte Solid Waste Management Authority decided to table the request until the Del Norte County Board of Supervisors weighs-in on the cleanup. The homeless encampment is on county-owned property northeast of Walmart. District 2 Supervisor Martha McClure led the discussion, pointing out that other agencies, including the City of Eureka, had to go through the court system in order to remove people’s possessions from illegal encampments. She said she was concerned that by approving Gitlin’s request, the Solid Waste Management Authority was opening the door for other bin donation requests from private individuals who are also dealing with illegal campers. “I’ve been in enough of the encampments to know the folks who are suffering, many times are also people who are working in the community,” said McClure, who recently stepped down as Solid Waste chair. “The folks who are suffering, who are doing with hardly anything, are doing that because of whatever their predicament is. It is not because they want to be scofflaws.” As part of its franchise agreement with Recology Del Norte, the Solid Waste Management Authority can donate up to 20 dumpsters a year to community events and other cleanup activities. The bins can be up to 40 cubic yards, according to Director Tedd Ward. The value of the allocation and waiving of fees is about $186.16 per dumpster. The donation of a bin does not include the disposal fee to Hambro/WSG, which operates the transfer station, Ward said. Gitlin, who founded Take a Bite out of Blight in 2013 and is currently seeking re-election, said he was frustrated at his request being tabled and felt that it was personal, blaming it on a “cantankerous election year.” Shortly after he founded the program, Gitlin and Take a Bite out of Blight volunteers cleaned up a different section of the same county-owned property. That clean-up effort was in an area south of Walmart near the parking lot that code enforcement staff eventually fenced off. “No one gave us permission to clean up the county-owned property contiguous to Washington Blvd.,” Gitlin said, adding that then-Solid Waste Management Authority director Kevin Hendrick approved of the group’s request for a dumpster. “We only went to the (Board of Supervisors) when we asked them to pay for $150 worth of ‘no trespassing’ signs.” Gitlin’s current request involved the removal of trash and what appears to be a tent behind the store. The debris is only on the county’s property, Gitlin said, not the neighboring Walmart property, which has been cleaned up by the store’s employees. Take a Bite out of Blight volunteers had been involved in Solid Waste-authorized cleanups before, Ward said, but he doubted they involved homeless encampments. He said there is no current criteria involved for allocating bins and wasn’t sure what policies the county has in place when it comes to cleaning up homeless encampments. “I don’t know if the county has a mechanism or a process by which they establish of the county-owned properties which ones are the priorities for being cleaned up,” Ward said. “I don’t know if there’s a process for instance also of the homeless encampments, the following are of greatest environmental concern. If in doing a cleanup, making sure that law enforcement is appropriately involved and people are appropriately trained, again I’m not sure what process that is. To the extent the authority supports these kinds of activities it makes sense we would jump through those hoops.” The authority’s new chairman, Crescent City Councilor Blake Inscore called for input from county supervisors indicating that they approve of the cleanup effort and that they would take on the liability of such an effort. “I’m very concerned about volunteers being in any kind of homeless encampment without this having been weighed-out by law enforcement,” he said. “I’ve been in some of the encampments as well and I think there’s a safety factor we should consider before we, in essence, put our stamp of approval and put public funds toward something.” Gitlin pointed out that since county property is involved he will have to get permission from the Board of Supervisors to clean up the homeless encampment. But he said he’ll probably wait until January to address the issue. “I’m not going to grovel for a bin to provide free labor for,” he said. “My first protocol is to get the bin and on consent I would ask the county to approve our intention to clean up this area at zero cost to the county, but everything is such cantankerousness that they have to decide as if this is going to cost Del Norte County penny one and that’s where my frustration boils over.” Ward is expecting a dumpster request for next month’s beach cleanup and said with the eight the authority board approved Tuesday its allotment will be exhausted for the year.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) is killing off retail brick-and-mortar stores may not ring true in respect to major discount retailers. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported a strong Q2 earnings beat Friday, beating analyst's estimates on revenue by nearly $700 million, generating nearly $121 billion in sales. It was Wal-Mart's eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps. Wal-Mart's strong quarter may suggest that big discount retailers may be immune from Amazon's e-commerce reign. Many consumers fear that Amazon is becoming a near monopoly and that prices are too high as a result. This leaves room for discount retailers.

Investors may want to keep a close eye on Burlington Stores Inc (NYSE: BURL) and Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE: BIG) coming into their Q2 earnings reports, on August 25 and 26, respectively.

"The victim forgot the cash and walked away," Keller said. "When she walked back the cash was gone." Walmart's Security Department checked store video surveillance and saw another woman had taken the money, Keller said.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States How Analysts View Wal-Mart After Earnings By Paul Ausick August 21, 2016 10:35 am EST Print Email Tweet In the same week that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported quarterly results, the retail giant also announced the $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce website Jet.com. By the time the acquisition was announced, it had been on investors’ radar for a few days and had weighed on the stock price. The earnings announcement pushed shares to a new 52-week high on Thursday, but by Friday’s close shares had retreated again. Wal-Mart posted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21 on total revenues of $120.85 billion, which includes membership fees in Sam’s Club. Second-quarter results beat Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $1.02 and $120.16 billion in revenue. Wal-Mart also raised its full-year EPS estimate from a prior range of $4.00 to $4.30 to a new range of $4.15 to $4.25. Analyst reactions were nearly uniformly positive, although most adjustments were to price targets only while ratings were left alone. One exception was S&P Global, which raised its rating from Buy to Strong Buy and lifted its price target from $82 to $88. The firm’s analysts noted: We see higher wages, inventory improvements and the expansion of online offerings and in-store pick-up services supporting continued favorable U.S. comparable store sales and e-commerce sales trends. We expect sales growth to fuel an acceleration in price cuts. Commenting on its Hold rating on Wal-Mart stock, the Argus analyst said: We are optimistic about the company’s new plan to invest more in its staff. Based on the stores we visit, the company has a significant opportunity – and need – to provide better in-store service, have the shelves better stocked, and have faster checkout times. The challenge for management will be to make sure that a better shopping experience translates into attractive returns on incremental investments. Analysts at Merrill Lynch were less sanguine. The firm rates the stock Neutral, but did lift the price target from $72 to $76: Near-term investments should limit the earnings benefits of positive US same-store sales and traffic, better merchandising execution globally, and a more integrated e-commerce business. Longer-term global sales and profit growth should return as WMT leverages its significant investments on people, technology and price. Other analysts’ actions included the following: Baird raised its price target from $75 to $80 and rates the stock Outperform. Deutsche Bank lifted its price target from $77 to $79 with a Hold rating. Jefferies rates the stock a Buy and raised its price target from $85 to $86. RBC raised its price target from $73 to $76 and rates the stock Underperform. Telsey Advisory rates the shares as Market Perform and raised its price target from $71 to $78. Wal-Mart stock closed at $72.81 on Friday, down 2% for the day. The 52-week range is $56.30 to $75.19, and the 12-month price target is $72.64. The latest ratings may not yet be included in the consensus price target.

Published Aug 21st, 2016 8:56 am roby@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Mike Malone, the outgoing CEO of the Northwest Arkansas Council, said that while regional workforce needs are pivotal to continuing the area’s momentum, he’s also certain that improving the Arkansas’ national image will be critical for future growth across the state. Malone, who appeared on this week’s edition of Talk Business & Politics, announced last week that he will be stepping down from the influential Northwest Arkansas Council after nearly 10 years at the helm. The powerful and influential business group has been a driving force in infrastructure development, regional amenities, and a coordinated vision for growing Northwest Arkansas. Malone will leave the group to work with Tom and Steuart Walton, grandsons of Wal-Mart founders Sam and Helen Walton, who have a variety of entrepreneurial and quality of life projects underway in the state. With Northwest Arkansas experiencing low unemployment, Malone contends that employers are not satisfied with the region’s strong position and are eager to capitalize on the momentum. “The unemployment rate is at 3.1%. That sounds good, but I’ve got employers saying, ‘Where are the next wave of workers coming from? We want to expand. Give us some workforce.'” said Malone. With Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, J.B. Hunt and the University of Arkansas driving much of the economic engine of Northwest Arkansas, Malone said that diversification has been a big part of the conversation on how to continue the region’s growth, which has seen an average of 30 new residents on daily. “The economy has really been built on retail, food and logistics and then industries and services that have built up around that. That’s been a great run. Those will continue to be our growth sectors, but we think we can diversify around that,” he said. “So, IT and the startup community has certainly been a point of emphasis over the last five years… we think we’re already starting to see some diversification because of some of the startups that are starting to scale.” With recent investments and announcements from Northwest Health System, Washington Regional, Arkansas Children’s Hospital and Mercy Health, Malone sees another big regional challenge in the health care sector. “There’s a half a billion dollars worth of health care construction underway in the region right now. $500 million. There’s a massive investment in health care if we can find the workforce. That becomes the next challenge,” said Malone. While Northwest Arkansas has been a driver for the state’s overall economy, Malone said he and others recognize that the rest of the state is needed to help the region sustain growth, especially when it comes to outsiders’ perceptions of Arkansas. “These are 100 years, or maybe 200 years of folks elsewhere making fun of us or having these myths and misperceptions about Arkansas. We need – because we’re trying to attract talent and businesses – and the rest of the state needs – because we’re all trying to attract talent and business – an enhancement in our reputation. Some of that’s on us. We can do a better job of selling ourselves,” he said. Malone added: “I’m real encouraged by what this [Hutchinson] administration is doing with more money for marketing economic development, partnerships between economic development and parks and tourism marketing. I think we all own a piece of that. We’re all humble and shy and kind of play along with the jokes they make about Arkansas. It’s time to change that. Let’s stand up and show how dynamic and what a great place it is in which to live.” You can watch his full interview in the video below.

While Meijer still sees stores as large as the one that opened this month in Flat Rock (shown here) as central to its future, it is looking for new locations in cramped urban areas and considering what a smaller store might look like. Meijer Inc. is still betting big on the big box. Competitors such as Wal-Mart and Target are experimenting with smaller stores in an effort to draw millennials and fit stores into more compact urban footprints. But the pioneer of that type of superstore still sees stores the size of three or four football fields, like one that opened in Flat Rock earlier this month, as central to its future. That's not to say Meijer isn't hedging its bets. Company officials say it is looking for new locations in urban areas and taking another run at what a store about half the size of a typical Meijer might look like. One thing the company says isn't happening, though, is a rumored store in the district surrounding the new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. The privately held, family-owned retailer, based in Walker — with revenue of $16.1 billion according to Forbes — was being courted to open a smaller store to fit into the Woodward Square area of The District Detroit, which immediately surrounds the forthcoming Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit, Crain's reported in January. However, Hank Meijer, CEO of the retailer, said at the Meijer store opening in Flat Rock: "We don't have any specific plans for (The District Detroit). We know that at some point it would be important for us to have a smaller format that could take advantage of other opportunities, but we're not there yet." Frank Guglielmi, senior director for communications for Meijer, added: "That's a rumor. We don't know where that started, but we were all scratching our heads as to where that rumor came from. We think it's because we're a major partner with the Detroit Red Wings. So a lot of people said, 'Oh, they must be putting a store there.'?" Still, Meijer is thinking about smaller stores. The retailer's first 102,000-square-foot mini-supercenter in Niles, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, closed in June after opening about six years ago. The retailer has opened four approximately 100,000-square-foot stores offering predominantly food, and has plans to open a similarly sized concept close to home in Grand Rapids in 2018 at the earliest. How Meijer's forthcoming Grand Rapids store could differ from the closed mini-supercenter in Niles is unclear. Meijer's mini-supercenters are about half the size of a typical store. "We have committed to opening a smaller format store in Grand Rapids, in an urban project that we hope we'll learn from," Meijer said. "We've still got a lot of work to do on that one. We hope that will begin to give us a model to put in other areas." Guglielmi said it's important to keep in mind that Meijer's "smaller" stores are still relatively large, and consumers won't see the retailer doing a 20,000- to 30,000-square-foot concept that would fit neatly into a big city's downtown. He said the reason Meijer's prices are lower for groceries compared with traditional supermarkets is because there are higher profit margins for general merchandise. Smaller stores make that difficult because the stores can't stock as much. "Never say never, but I think you'll see traditional Meijers around Detroit before you see smaller ones," Guglielmi added. That's because Meijer's two supercenters in Detroit — one at the Gateway Marketplace development at Eight Mile Road and Woodward Avenue and the other in northwest Detroit where Redford High School once stood at Grand River Avenue and McNichols Road — have been successful, especially the supercenter at the Gateway Marketplace, the first store Meijer opened in Detroit. Photo by Adrienne Roberts Hundreds of people gathered for the opening of the Meijer in Flat Rock recently. The stores have done so well, in fact, that the company is looking at other locations in the city, such as along Jefferson Avenue between I-375 and Grosse Pointe Park, Crain's has reported. Meijer had no updates on the reported plans. Guglielmi said that when looking for a location to build a new store, Meijer looks at a combination of population density, traffic patterns and distance from competitors. "We continue to be very excited about Detroit," Meijer said. "Our competitors are making big investments here, too, but we want to build share, and that's our goal." Despite recent efforts by retailers to move away from the big-box format, Ken Dalto, founder and owner of Farmington Hills-based business consulting firm Kenneth J. Dalto & Associates, said Meijer does well when it opens its typical large superstores in underserved areas. The three areas of growth for big-box retailers are in online sales, opening smaller stores and building stores in areas that lack a variety of retail and grocery options, he said. While Target Corp. has succeeded in capturing millennials' dollars online and opening smaller-footprint stores (the retailer has used names such as TargetExpress and CityTarget for these concepts), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Meijer have done well opening in underserved areas, such as in northwest Detroit, or certain areas of northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. He said Target has captured millennial dollars because it's seen as a one-stop shop for food, name-brand clothing, home improvement products, small appliances and pharmacy needs. "When people tell you they're going to Target, they have everything, (and shoppers are) going to get everything," Dalto said. He said that while Meijer has similar offerings, it's still viewed primarily as a place to buy groceries. Cindy Ciura, principal of CC Consulting in Bloomfield Hills, said another challenge for Meijer opening a smaller-footprint store is that shoppers choose to go to a Meijer because "the selection is amazing, there are such wide varieties, and they buy so deep." She said that when Meijer tries to fill more of a niche for shoppers with its grocery-focused mini-supercenters, it's a case of "stores trying to be something that they're not," and consumers don't latch on to the concept easily. She said niche retailers like the discount supermarket chain Aldi or Trader Joe's, Whole Foods or a smaller-footprint Target (because it's "nimble") would do well in downtown Detroit. "(Retailers are) tempted to want to do something (in downtown Detroit because) it's so under-groceried, and they want to capture that market," Ciura said.

(Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images) Target announced on Aug. 19 that it has ended its relationship with Indian textiles company Welspun, after an investigation revealed that the company was supplying fake Egyptian cotton 500-thread count bed sheets for its consumers.   The second largest discount retailer in the United States—behind Walmart—was unaware that the Mumbai-based company was supplying bed sheets made from fake Egyptian cotton under the Fieldcrest label for Target for nearly two years, beginning in August of 2014. The phony product is a violation of Target’s Code of Conduct and its Standards of Vendor Engagement. “After an extensive investigation, we recently confirmed that Welspun substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016,” Target said in a statement. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them.” Following the investigation, Target removed the counterfeit products from its store shelves and its online retailer, and are offering refunds to customers who purchased the bed sheets between August 2014 and July of this year. To obtain a refund, customers who purchased any sheets between the aforementioned time frame should fill out and submit this web form and will subsequently receive a refund in the form of a gift card. According to its website, Welspun is a $3 billion company and a leading supplier to 14 of the top 30 U.S. retailers, making it one of the largest textile manufacturers in the world. Some of its retailers include: Bed Bath & Beyond, Walmart, JCPenney, Kohl’s, and Macy’s. Shares in Welspun India fell by 20 percent after Target announced that it will cut ties with the company. Welspun issued a statement on Aug. 20 that it was investigating a product specification issue with one unnamed client program of a subsidiary. “We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the Big Four) to audit our supply systems and processes,” Welspun said. “This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it.” The statement continued: “We have an impeccable record of supplying quality products to our customers globally for over two decades. We reiterate our commitment to the highest standards of customer service and compliance.” Read More Counterfeit Pills Likely Came to Prince Illegally Editor’s Picks China’s Growing Trade Deficit with US, Rising State and Corporate Debt: Very ‘Concerning’ Says Congressional Report What Trump’s Presidency Means for Health Care Sector Grass-Roots and Professional, Anti-Trump Protests Seek Healing and Political Change Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

Some investors are breathing a sigh of relief as it seems like the sector might finally be rebounding. Trader Pete Najarian said that the retail stocks are moving higher because they "didn't do as poorly as people expected" during earnings season. He said investors are also looking at retail companies because their valuations remain relatively low. Trader Dan Nathan agreed and said to keep an eye on Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Costco for a breakout. He pointed out that all three of those stocks hit 52-week closing highs this month. Trader Tim Seymour said he thinks "the long-term prospects for [Ralph Lauren] are good." The stock has gained 9 percent in the last month. He said, however, that retail stocks with a lot of short interest are still struggling with an "existentialist moment" in reworking their business models. Trader Steve Grasso said Ulta looks attractive, as its shares have been on a tear this year, soaring 46 percent.

Best Buy Is a Battlefield InvestorPlace 8/22/2016 Dana Blankenhorn © Reuters: Brendan McDermid, File Best Buy Co Inc. reported a 4 percent drop in quarterly revenue due to lower traffic in its stores. Practically since the day Circuit City went bankrupt, during the Crash of 2008, analysts have been expecting big things from Best Buy Co (BBY) and have been disappointed. Quotes in the article Best Buy Co Inc BBY ▲ 47.08 +0.48 +1.03% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.27 -0.53 -0.47% After all, the thinking goes, the Richfield, Minnesota-based retail chain is the last big box electronics specialist left. They should dominate all areas of consumer electronics, from TVs and music to computing and phones. But they don’t. Mass market retailers like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and online retailers like Amazon.com (AMZN) have picked up much of the growth folks expected to go to Best Buy. Sales were fiscal 2016 were lower than for fiscal 2012, and even in a good year only 2% of those sales drop to the bottom line. 7 Stocks the Smart Money Loves … Or Hates The result is that BBY stock has become a “battlefield stock,” with the shares prone to large price swings, bulls and bears constantly pulling it in one direction or the other, the stock often moving based on rumors or their own comments. The Bull Case for BBY Stock The bulls will note that the shares are up 8% over the last year. They see the shares being buffeted by problems at other companies and short-term opportunities abounding in spread trades. Best Buy is due to report results for its second quarter on Tuesday, August 23, and many analysts are optimistic. There is an official estimate of 42 cents/share in earnings on $8.48 billion in sales, but a “whisper number” of 48 cents, following a better-than-expected first quarter with 44 cents in earnings on $8.4 billion in sales. Extra attention is being paid Best Buy right now because it is turning 50, and it held a big sale to celebrate. The company is phasing in same-day deliveries to compete with Amazon. The Bear Case Against Best Buy As quickly as you can state the bull case for BBY stock, you can also state the bear case. Best Buy has had many false dawns. The shares are down by one-third from where they were 10 years ago. The stock is subject to sudden downdrafts, as after the 2013 Christmas season, when it plunged from $40 per share to $25 and, for a day or two, seemed to take the whole market with it. Best Buy had a good Christmas in 2015, the shares rising from $25 to $34 in the month as those earnings came out, but shares got little benefit from that good first quarter, and had to fight their slow way from $29 in June to $34 just a few weeks ago before falling back. Expectations for the current quarter seem muted despite having been increased recently. The shares, in short, seem to be going nowhere fast. A Trade, Not an Investment Right now BBY stock has a mean rating of hold, with one calling it an outright “sell.” There has been some movement from hold to buy among analysts over the last two quarters’ solid earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Unleashes Major Apple Store Shakeup All of which tells me that disappointment could be right around the corner. Buying and holding Best Buy is not indicated. If you like action, trade it. You may make some money, you may lose some, but there are big differences of opinion here, and that means someone is making money. Maybe it will be you this time.

Red Cross Aug 22, 2016, 16:53 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Aug. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross remains on the ground, with volunteers across nearly half of the state of Louisiana helping the thousands of people who have lost everything they own in the devastating flooding last week. But the relief organization reports a significant gap in funds raised. To date, the Red Cross has received approximately $7.8 million in donations and pledges designated to support Louisiana – not nearly enough to cover the estimate of at least $30 million in costs.

Red Cross photo by Marko Kokic "This intense storm wasn't given a name, but it affected as many as 110,000 homes in Louisiana and has changed countless lives forever," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "The situation in Louisiana remains critical. People need help, and they need it now. The Red Cross is providing for immediate needs like food and shelter, and will be there during the clean-up and recovery."

"Today, we are sounding the alarm to urge people to make a financial donation to help our friends and neighbors in Louisiana."

In addition to providing food and shelter, Red Cross volunteers are providing emotional support to help people cope.

(Photo: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) During the Democratic primaries, unions that held member votes over support of a particular candidate almost invariably chose Sen. Bernie Sanders, while unions that made an endorsement based on the decision of its leadership mostly supported Hillary Clinton. Clinton’s political record is the antithesis of the labor movement. During her husband’s presidency, she strongly supported NAFTA, a disastrous trade agreement for American workers, and more recently helped further negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement before opposing it out of political expediency. The surrogates she appointed to the Democratic Party platform supported the TPP, and her 2008 campaign chair, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, claimed she would ultimately support it. A former Wal-Mart board member, Clinton also supports a $12 national minimum wage. This is compared to the $15-an-hour national minimum wage movement led by labor unions across the country. While Clinton has claimed to be the champion of the middle class, her lavish fundraisers, billionaire campaign surrogates and Clinton Foundation pay-to-play donations suggest otherwise. As a result of Clinton’s troubling political record on behalf of the labor movement, several unions have refused to either switch their initial endorsement from Sanders to Clinton, or make any endorsement for president this election. The National Nurses Union (NNU) has been one of the most visible unions throughout the Democratic primaries. Donning bright red shirts, members of the 185,000-strong union campaigned aggressively on behalf of Sanders. NNU chief RoseAnn DeMoro told BuzzFeed News that the labor movement’s failure to fully support the Sanders movement is a “horrendous historical reality.” She then called the resulting BuzzFeed story on the NNU’s apprehension to endorse Clinton a “hit piece on Bernie supporters.” Several other unions believe neither Clinton nor Donald Trump sincerely represent the labor movement. The International Association of Firefighters, which represents over 300,000 people, has refused to endorse either candidate, and the 1.4 million members of the Teamsters Union have also withheld an endorsement so far this election. The only reason Clinton has received more support from labor unions than Sanders is because national leaders have chosen Clinton. Local chapters of the same labor unions frequently endorsed and heavily supported Sanders.   “More than a dozen local and regional union groups have broken with their national leadership and voted to support Bernie Sanders,” wrote Andrew McGill for The Atlantic in April. “While it’s common for a national union to stay neutral so its regional affiliates can endorse independently, it’s far more rare to see a local affiliate buck the will of its leadership and tack in another direction.” Sanders criticized establishment endorsements for Clinton, from large national labor unions and organizations like Planned Parenthood and Human Rights Watch. Often, the leadership of these organizations makes decisions to formally support a candidate without the participation of its members. Such organizations maintained the status quo to further their own interests, instead of taking the risk to support the candidate going up against the entire Democratic establishment. Sanders’ New Deal populism embodied the labor movement, yet several large labor organizations opted to endorse Clinton based on their leadership’s desire for political access. When the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) helped Barack Obama win the presidency in 2008, they were granted access for representing the labor movement’s positions on several policy developments in the White House. Clinton already has appointed SEIU’s former national political coordinator as her election manager. For establishment Democrats and leaders of Democratic-leaning organizations, Clinton has always been the default candidate. Endorsing her to expedite the primary process served the Democratic Party’s interests—and therefore labor union leadership interests—while contributing to the labor movement’s steady decline. Instead of urging Democrats to earn worker support, many labor unions and leaders offer it blindly. While unions support Clinton to stave off anti-labor union policies from the right, they are inviting their own decline by lending help to Clinton, whose interests have been throughout her political career aligned with the corporate and wealthy donors that have enabled her rise to power.

(Reuters/Peter Power) Share Written by Madhura Karnik August 22, 2016 Quartz india Target, America’s second-largest discount retailer, has decided to cut ties with Indian textiles manufacturer Welspun India because of fake Egyptian cotton sheets supplied by the Mumbai-headquartered company. On Aug.19, the Minneapolis, Minnesota, retailer said that between 2014 and 2016, Welspun India supplied sheets saying they were made of Egyptian cotton, although they were not. “After an extensive investigation, we recently confirmed that Welspun substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016,” Target said in a statement. Target is contacting customers and offering a refund to those who bought these sheets, it said. The retailer has also removed the product—sold under the Fieldcrest label—from its stores. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Target added. Some 750,000 such products were impacted over the two-year span, Molly Snyder, a Target spokesperson said in an email. Welspun India is one of the world’s largest textile makers and typically caters to the US, UK and European markets. Target is Welspun India’s second largest customer, behind American retailer Bed, Bath and Beyond, Bloomberg reported. J. C. Penney, Macy’s, Costco, Home Depot and Walmart also buy from Welspun India. The manufacturer also makes towels for the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Other products it makes include bath robes, bath rugs and mats, area rugs, carpets, bed sheets, utility bedding and fashion bedding. Shares of Welspun India fell as much as 20% on the BSE Aug. 22, and hit the lower circuit. The company said in a statement (pdf) to stock exchanges that it has commissioned an audit. “We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the Big Four) to audit our supply and processes,” said Welspun India, part of the $3 billion Welspun Group, adding the issue is of “highest priority.” Important customers The textile maker—and its shareholders—have reason to be worried because it has a huge exposure to the US market. “Every 5th towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India,” according to its annual report (pdf). The company depends on exports for 95% of its revenue. It earned a total revenue of Rs4,961 crore for the 2015-16 financial year. Future growth hinges on the US market where the company is targeting the hospitality sector, analysts have said. “Growth potential in the US hospitality and health care channels remains immense as Welspun sales from hospitality channel at $25-30 million (versus market size of $1.5 billion across both these segments). Welspun is in business development phase in its healthcare segment,” analysts Avi Mehta and Sameer Gupta of IIFL Institutional Equities, a brokerage, wrote in a July 27 research note. Welspun India didn’t immediate reply to an email from Quartz inquiring on the specific business impact of Target’s decision. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

(Photo: Richard Drew, AP) Investors aren’t typically known for their patience. That’s why Wall Street’s willingness to wait around for corporate earnings growth to resume is somewhat surprising. Second-quarter earnings season has all but wrapped up, now that retailer Walmart has reported its results. Investors are at least pleased the dip in profit growth by companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 was less than expected. The companies ended up reporting 2.1% lower adjusted profit per share, somewhat better than the 5% profit drop expected on July 1, S&P Global Market Intelligence says. It’s the fourth consecutive drop in quarterly earnings growth. USA TODAY Investors will be watching Yellen in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this week Stock prices, though, keep moving higher and are trading near all-time highs. “Investor optimism remains unscathed,” Michael Thompson, managing director of S&P Investment Advisory Services, says in a note to clients. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is trading for “an elevated” valuation of 17.6 times expected profit over the next 12 months. Perhaps most surprising is investors’ Teflon optimism remains intact as the timetable for the S&P 500’s return to corporate profit growth keeps getting pushed back. Currently, analysts are forecasting another drop in corporate profits, by 0.03%, in the third quarter. In April, analysts thought corporate profit would rise by 4.8%. Now, investors are closely watching the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 as being the time earnings growth returns. We’ll see. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2bgoZuL

Matt Goad mgoad@newsobserver.com i By Matt Goad mgoad@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story KNIGHTDALE The Town Council on Wednesday, Aug. 17, gave its final OK to two rezoning requests, one that paves the way for a movie theater to come to town and another for a nearly 600-unit subdivision. The development that could include a movie theater is called Parkstone, and plans call for a shopping center and town homes on the 57-acre property on the south side of Knightdale Boulevard between Widewaters Parkway and Parkside Commons Drive. Development on the property has been proposed for more than a decade, but a lawsuit and then the recession delayed movement on the site until recent years. The original plans called for more big-box-type development, including a Walmart Supercenter, but the developer, Knightdale Development Ownership, LLC, said changes in the market since led it to change the scope of the project. The council voted 3-0 to approve the rezoning. Council member Pete Mangum recused himself because he works for Wake Stone, which is directly across from the proposed development and may be affected by construction of its entry road. Council member Mark Swan was out of town and absent from the meeting. Town staff recommended approving the rezoning, along with the Land Use Review Board, which unanimously voted to recommend approval, but with a 30-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer around the whole project. Assistant Development Services Director Jennifer Currin said the developer had said 30 feet all around the project would not be practical because of the grade of the land in some spots, but that it would replant vegetation to help reduce noise. Instead there would be an opaque buffer of undisturbed vegetation of 20 feet, with replanting on 10 feet of the buffer that would make the development invisible from neighboring properties when the plants reach maturity in 15 years. Mayor Pro-Tem Mike Chalk asked if larger plantings could be required that would reach maturity quicker. Currin said the trees planted will be 6-8 feet tall at the time they are planted. Brian Long, representing the developer, said town staff will have to sign off on whether the opaque requirement is met. He said the 20-foot slope along the border will also help reduce noise. “I feel a lot better about it now than I did when I came in here,” Chalk said. Chalk was the lone dissenting vote against a rezoning request for the 596-unit Silverstone subdivision that had raised the ire of some of its neighbors to the north in the Cheswick neighborhood off Hodge Road. He expressed concerns about increased traffic from Silverstone that would likely travel through Cheswick to get to a traffic signal to be constructed. Town staff and the LURB had recommended approval of Silverstone.

The company said it will review its supply chain and expects an audit to be completed within six to eight weeks. "There has been a failure on our part, without an ambiguity," said Welspun managing director Rajesh Mandawewala on a conference call Monday. "The error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it." Target on Friday said it discovered 750,000 sheets and pillowcases supplied by the textile manufacturer were mislabelled as Egyptian cotton between August 2014 and July 2016. The company pulled the items from its shelves, will offer customers refunds and is phasing out all Welspun products. The issue was of "fibre provenance" and not about quality, said Mandawewala. Welspun said it's "actively engaged" with other customers. Target is Welspun's second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs, and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Other major clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc, JC Penney Co, and Macy's Inc. A "Big Four" accounting firm will be brought in to examine supply systems and processes, Welspun said on Saturday. Cheaper sheets Welspun shares fell by the daily 20 per cent limit to Rs 82.3 in Mumbai trading, poised for its biggest loss since May 2006. The decline cut the company's market value to $1.2 billion and erased gains this year. "This is a big setback for the company," said Sumant Kumar, a Mumbai-based analyst at Elara Securities India Pvt. "This incident will not only hit the company's goodwill and image but will also raise questions about India's brand image as home textile was emerging as one of the top sectors for exports." Bed Bath & Beyond and Walmart also carry Welspun Egyptian cotton sheets. Both retailers carried the company's 500 and 800-thread count sheets online. They retailed for as much as $175 a set. Kumar said investors are concerned about other Welspun customer relationships. "There is likely to be a bigger problem for the company if other customers too start raising questions," he said. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be higher quality. Yantai Pacific Home Fashion, a Chinese supplier of Egyptian cotton bed linen based in Shandong province, said the incident presents an opportunity for other players in the industry. "India companies have usually been offering lower prices than Chinese companies and that's why the American retailers chose them," said company representative Jack Yang. "It's better if customers go for quality over low prices."

Alicia Buzzard, 21, formerly of Heidelberg Township, Lebanon County, pleaded guilty to a shoplifting charge Friday in Myrtle Beach, S.C., police said Monday. Buzzard, along with Elliott Ravert, 18, of Narvon, Lancaster County, were arrested by Myrtle Beach police Aug. 12 after being accused of shoplifting at a Walmart. 'A fierce wolf: Facebook page offers insight on mindset of man who took woman at gunpoint from hospital Ravert is accused of ordering two nurses to let him into the locked ward at Philhaven Hospital where Buzzard was being held Aug. 10, taking her out of the facility, court documents say. He is reportedly scheduled for a hearing Aug. 23 and is being held in the J. Reuben Long Detention Center in Myrtle Beach. Buzzard was sentenced to time served and was released to a safe house, said Chief Bruce Harris of Cornwall police. "She told her family she is not coming back," Harris said. According to Lebanon County court documents, her mother, Jacqui Shay, was granted legal guardianship of her daughter in 2014 after she was ruled an incapacitated person. Buzzard's mother, Jacqui Shay, told Lancaster Online that her daughter is bipolar and has other mental health issues and that the family intervened in the romantic relationship that developed between her daughter and Ravert. Shay said the two visited a friend in Manheim after leaving Philhaven and that she seemed happy. Harris said he doesn't know how the family feels about Buzzard not returning. "My understanding is the daughter called and said she's not coming back, and because of her age, they are not in a position to do anything about it," Harris said. Harris said he believes Buzzard left the hospital willingly with Ravert. "I think she was very actively involved in getting out," Harris said. So far no charges have been filed against her regarding the incident, but the investigation continues, said the chief. He said Myrtle Beach police will notify Cornwall when they can bring Ravert back to face charges of robbery, aggravated assault and terroristic threats, which were filed Aug. 9. UPDATE: Ravert's hearing date is reportedly Aug. 23. Robbery, assault charges filed against man who took woman from hospital at gunpoint PENNLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Get 'Today's Front Page' in your inbox This newsletter is sent every morning at 6 a.m. and includes the morning's top stories, a full list of obituaries, links to comics and puzzles and the most recent news, sports and entertainment headlines.

Yesterday, we talked  with O’Donnell about what the process was like, whether the New York venture scene will be impacted by the $3 billion sale of e-commerce company Jet.com to Walmart, and how a small operation like Brooklyn Bridge Ventures can make an outsize impact on a shoestring budget. TC: We sat down last November and you’d mentioned that you’d circled $13 million or so for this new fund. CO: I estimated that I had about $13 million in estimated commitments, and we didn’t go into detail on what that meant. For me, it’s a spreadsheet that has a [potential investor] in the fund, a number, and a percent chance of closing, much like a sales pipeline. Comparatively, my first fund took 9 months from announcement to first close, and 15 months from first close to last close. This fund took 6 months from first close to last close, with 70 percent of the capital commitments coming in the first two closes.That all seemed super fast to me. TC: We were wondering if you ran into trouble this year with investors; some of the institutions that fund venture firms say they were mobbed earlier this year by firms that raised funds a couple of years ago and that didn’t want to be the last in line for their new fund. CO: Most of my [investors] aren’t in any other funds. An endowment that wrote me a $1 million check certainly is. And I think my lead investor is in one or two other funds, along with maybe a handful of individuals [who wrote me checks]. But they’re definitely in the minority. At my size, I’m not talking to many traditional [investors]. I have no idea why they keep writing checks every two years for funds that haven’t proved themselves out yet. I came from the fund side. I thought VCs raised every three to four years. TC: You’ve funded a lot of very promising companies. In your past life as a principal with First Round Capital, you also backed a number of companies that have sold. Do you have any “exits” yet at Brooklyn Bridge? CO: One exit returned its capital, but given that most of these companies average about two years old or less (it was a three-year investment period fund), it would be pretty early to start seeing exits at this stage. Also, standouts like [the smart home security company] Canary are ramping up revenues and releasing new and improved products and not looking to take an early exit anytime soon. TC: People have long said that New York needed a giant exit, especially after certain companies that looked to become big wins saw their fortunes change, including Gilt Groupe and Fab. Was Jet that exit?  CO: Jet was certainly a large exit and a testament to the great team the company assembled. Three billion dollars is a lot of money, but given how much they raised right out of the gate, I don’t know what multiples its investors got given what one would assume were the entry prices. So, do the aggregate dollars count or the return multiple? I’m not sure, but I’m also not someone who believes in the “giant exit” theory. What’s supposed to happen when we get a giant exit? We get more angels? More people want to start companies? NYC has never been short on risk-taking capital. The investment world is centered here, regardless of whether it was always earmarked for venture. And I don’t think NYC entrepreneurs only start companies because they hear about companies in their own backyards. I’m sure the Facebook story inspired just as many entrepreneurs in NYC as it did in the Valley. TC: We’re currently seeing a young Bay Area firm struggle after trying to grow too fast, and at a cost that it couldn’t necessarily afford. You’ve meanwhile taken a very different tack, doing a lot of network-building community events on the cheap. For people interested in packing a punch with a small fund, what can you share about how you work and how these events work? CO: I don’t think you have to always offer people free stuff to get them to show up. We’ve done baseball games, and we just sell the tickets. Awesome people show up, just because they love hanging out with other people from the community. We’ve done over 70 dinners at people’s apartments and homes in the last year all across the city, and we just split the cost of the chef. We have a reputation for curating really interesting and inspiring attendees, the food is amazing, and you’re getting to meet your neighbors. The value is there and people are more than willing to pay to show up. If people only show up at your party because it’s free, how real are those networks? I think a big part of it is that I’ve been part of the NYC ecosystem for over a decade. I apprenticed under investors like Fred Wilson and Josh Kopelman. The community has known me for a long time and in many ways, it watched me grow up. I didn’t just show up out of the blue and start throwing the biggest parties. TC: What’s the coolest new company you’ve seen in New York and why should people pay attention to it? CO: I’m currently working on securing co-investors for Industrial/Organic, which has created a scalable and city-friendly alternative to composting. Current composting technology is a smelly pile of rotting food in a field that no one wants near their house. I/O is working to contain this process, speeding it up by weeks through the use of special microbes. This will enable them to cost effectively process nearly 15 tons of organic waste per day by the end of their seed round. Obviously, it looks different than a lot of other companies. It’s not an idea for the faint of heart. But it’s attractively priced and has an IPO-sized potential. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase First Round Founded 2007 Overview First Round is a company incubator that couples the most suitable top experts (board, team and shareholders) with the best business ideas already at the setting-up stage.

So said Donald Trump on August 9 in North Carolina, in an interview that followed controversial comments he'd made earlier that day. Warning his audience of the danger of Hillary Clinton's choosing new Supreme Court justices, he seemed to suggest that gun rights activists could take action to stop her. "If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks," he said. "Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know." It was another provocative reminder that the New York real estate tycoon and Republican presidential candidate has made himself the most pro-gun-rights nominee in modern GOP history. He has harnessed the power of the Second Amendment people, a strength that comes less from unity than desperation. I grew up among Second Amendment people, and I'm a Second Amendment person myself. My father and grandfather taught me at age six how to fire a Ruger single-action .22 revolver off a sandbag rest. My father and I went shooting every weekend we could in Middlesboro, Kentucky, and I spent hours with my grandfather at the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife shooting range near Ashland. Back then, in the late 1980s, being a proponent of gun rights was far less of a party position. But a dozen years later, as communities like the one I grew up in lost industry and jobs, and finally dignity and hope, guns became more political. Voters in towns like mine have come to view themselves as the men on the wall guarding the last outpost of a disappearing way of life. The recent Gallup analysis of how economic anxiety translates to support for Trump suggests that his message resonates with these voters not because they themselves necessarily have lost their livelihood to what he calls the forces of "globalism," but because they see no future for the next generation, their kids. But it's also true that Trump picks up support from the bottom of the scale: The four poorest counties in the country by median income, all rural, voted for him in the Republican primaries. In the heartland, these are people who feel they've been the victims of sustained economic violence at the hands of tyrannical governments of both parties. In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama's notorious misstep got one thing right: Rural people will "cling" to guns. Not because they are sad or misguided, but because it is the last right they feel they still have: a liberty at least, in place of opportunity. Yet once, there had been opportunity. Middlesboro, nestled in an ancient crater near the Cumberland Gap, was a thriving Appalachian city. There were thousands of jobs in coal, but not just coal. My mother worked at The Middlesboro Daily News, a local newspaper that published seven days a week and did in-depth reporting. The city attracted young couples from around the region who were eager to start their lives. We even had a food co-op. Then came NAFTA. Democrats more than anyone were against the North American Free Trade Agreement because they believed it would hurt U.S. workers and industry. Economists may differ, but in Middlesboro, the trade deal opponents' fears came to seem justified. By the time my generation was leaving high school, stores were shutting down all over town -- the locally owned shoe store, the grocer, the downtown department store, the women's clothing store, all owned by people my family knew and spoke to, all gone and replaced first by a mall and then, a decade later, by a Wal-Mart, sitting like a company store at the edge of town. In 2000, when I was 23, Charlie Burchfield, a close family friend who had been variously a miner, a sheriff's deputy and a detective in eastern Kentucky for decades, told me, "There's nothing here for a young person, Daniel." Rural white voters feel abandoned to their own devices, while America's cities continue to swell with countryside emigrants. Bell County, Kentucky, where Middlesboro is, has seen a population decrease of 11 percent since 1994. By contrast, Fayette County, which includes the city of Lexington, Kentucky, where I now live, has seen an increase of about 67,000 people in the same period. Although population loss outside the cities slowed considerably in 2015, the four years before saw population losses averaging 33,000 a year. These losses came mostly from the young. Among the young who stay, there is an even more tragic kind of loss. Rural suicide rates among 10- to 24-year-olds nearly doubled from 1996 to 2010, matching the time frame when globalization destroyed so many U.S. industries. This is a culture so despondent and at such a loss for what to do that it has become increasingly self-destructive. Witness the influx of heroin, the devastation of prescription opiates. On July 4, I was driving home to Middlesboro for the holiday weekend on Highway 25. The radio was playing, and when it broke for a station identification, a monster truck rally voice said, "No outsourcing here," and a man with a stereotypical Indian accent asked, "How can I help you?" The monster truck voice came back on and said, "Just 100 percent made-in-America rock classic." Startled, I thought to myself, "When did outsourcing become the subject of station IDs?" But, of course, it would be. I've lived in big cities, including New York, for long enough that I've forgotten the things you hear on rural radio. Progressive views about diversity and the benefits of immigration are not among them. Instead, the monster truck voice says that even though all else is slipping away, at least we still have our music. These touchstones are important. They tell us who we are. Outsourcing and guns: These are the twin issues animating Trump voters in rural Kentucky. The two are linked and feed off each other; the only difference between them is that white rural voters see outsourcing as a losing battle, whereas protecting and expanding Second Amendment rights is the only policy they've been able to get politicians to move on. For that reason alone, it is totemic. Trump has nurtured this conception of defending constitutional rights under threat: "It's been said that the Second Amendment is America's first freedom," says his campaign site, paraphrasing a 1997 speech by the NRA's first vice president, Charlton Heston. "That's because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights." What gun owners hear when Trump echoes NRA talking points against certain kinds of gun control is that they can be trusted, that they are responsible citizens. No politician since Ronald Reagan has affirmed them the way Donald Trump has. And he feeds their just sense of grievance. His message on trade is that rural white voters -- and anyone who has lost a job because of outsourcing and globalization -- has been wronged. He calls NAFTA "a disaster" -- and who would disagree among the dozens of people I went to high school with who left their hometown because they couldn't make a living? Who would disagree in Detroit, for that matter? Trump says more. In a June speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania, he leveled an indictment: "Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another -- from NAFTA to China to South Korea." We are at war, he says, a war he promises to win. "The era of economic surrender will finally be over." This is where his Second Amendment rhetoric and his economic rhetoric conjoin: guns and butter. If NAFTA, signed into law in 1993, was tied to the Clinton era, it is not lost on rural voters that the last major legislative effort on gun control was, too. The following year, President Bill Clinton put his signature on the assault weapons ban. Trump reassures them that the bans have always failed, and he reassures them that when bad things happen with guns, it is assuredly not their fault. "Violent crime in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and many others is out of control," he proclaims, and yet law-abiding gun owners are "the ones who anti-gun politicians and the media blame when criminals misuse guns." This is how it's seen by rural people -- and they're not wrong, even if they're not all the way right either. After all, why should residents in the heartland give up their perceived rights so that, maybe, a problem somewhere else can be solved? Why give up rights when gun murders fell by half nationally between 1993 and 2013 -- despite the expiration of the assault weapons ban 12 years ago? Only Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent who notably has a record of supporting the rights of gun owners in his home state of Vermont, has made anything like the connection with the people of Appalachia that Trump has. The rural people who actually have the guns are also the ones who feel they're being left behind on purpose, in exchange for cheaper labor at home and overseas. The parties and politicians have to give rural white voters a reason to come down off their guard wall. Otherwise, why would they ever give up their guns when they can keep tormenting their supposed tormentors with their "assault" rifles, Second Amendment rights and the lobbying power of the NRA? It's the only power they have. Daniel Hayes is a writer for the online magazine Thought Catalog and the editor of the essay collection "Guns."

Video courtesy Bill Fenstermaker Flooding in Southern Louisiana (Photo: BPSO) 18 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE BATON ROUGE — An economist with Louisiana State University has predicted that it will take a full year for south Louisiana to recover what's been called the worst storm to hit the United States since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. “You can count certain things (right now), such as the number of homes that were flooded, business that were flooded, public facilities such as schools that may have been flooded … then you start asking, ‘what are the real issues that are going to be coming over the next year?’”  LSU Economist and Professor of Public Administration James Richardson said in a press release from the university. “Businesses, for the most part, will get back up and running quickly. Perhaps not some small businesses in areas badly hit like Denham Springs … but national chains will have resources and additional dollar amounts to get (going again).” For the short-term, Richardson said a boost to the local economy can be expected. People will need to purchase items like appliances, furniture and even vehicles to replace those lost in the flood. Restaurants will see an increase because those affected will need to eat out more. Big-box stores like Target, Wal-Mart and Costco will most likely also see a temporary spike in sales because flood victims will need to buy basic items. Add in monies from federal assistance and bank loans, Richardson said, and that is a lot of “new dollars” being added immediately to the local economy.

Evacuees in shelter desperate for answers “In about a year or so, that’s when you start seeing the drop-off,” Richardson said. “(People think), ‘I don’t need to buy more things and I need to start paying back my debt.’ On a broader scale, the state’s economy will also feel the effects of the flood, albeit in a different way than one might think. “The first element is it’s taking all of the time of the governor, the commissioner of administration, and most of the cabinet officers to deal with this. So that means that if there’s any other pressing issues, they really just have to put them on the back burner and everybody understands that,” Richardson said. “In terms of dollars, the governor has been very upfront in saying he’s not going to let the budget prevent him in terms of response. And probably (the state government) has people working on how do we get this money back? There will be different federal mechanisms to do that.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn PHOTOS- National Guard Repairs Levee in Gueydan  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Most people did not have flood insurance, meaning private insurance dollars will not be substantial in contributing to recovery. Instead, they will have to rely on personal assets, refinancing their homes and borrowing from banks. There is also the possibility of aid from the state and federal government; however, all of these methods come with terms and conditions and ultimately put the financial burden squarely on the individual. “The next part of recovery is more complicated; the people that were so injured are going to have to lead the parade to get back where they were,” Richardson said. “They’ve got to recover their wealth, their assets. They’ve got to do something which is very hard and now probably without the same level of resources they had before. So they have to come back strong and then the state, the federal government, private individuals, charities, etc., we all can start pitching in to help them in some form or fashion. “People are tough, people are resilient and they will always rise to the occasion.” 18 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2016/08/22/economist-expect-flood-recovery-last-least-one-year/89105138/ TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Watch: Suspect sought in vehicle burglary 0:10 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Teurlings Muggle Quidditch Tournament 0:22 WATCH: Kenneth Boudreaux wants to remove civil service board 2:08 Meet the new LPD Chief, Toby Aguillard 1:25 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 More Stories Langlinais comes home for 'Right Hand Road' Nov. 23, 2016, 12:06 p.m. Agreement means 2 degrees in 4 years for IT students Nov. 23, 2016, 11:56 a.m. Police: Victim in Bienville Street shooting a teenager Nov. 23, 2016, 11:56 a.m. Homefinder: Nov. 20, 2016 Nov. 21, 2016, 7:26 a.m.

For Access program at the T2 season kickoff event on Tuesday at the Garner Farm in east Fayetteville. Courtesy photo A major grant from the Walmart Foundation will support free and low-cost tickets for every TheatreSquared performance in the upcoming season, officials announced Tuesday. The $68,500 gift will fund the new Lights Up! For Access program designed to help low-income families and individuals who might otherwise face a cost barrier to attending shows. “A community member’s ability to experience arts of the highest quality should not be determined by their income bracket,” said Martin Miller, TheatreSquared’s executive director. “In Northwest Arkansas, where the cultural landscape is being reshaped before our eyes, we have an opportunity to define who can participate in the arts for generations to come.” The program’s tickets are limited only by availability with no blackout dates, and can be purchased for seats in every section throughout the entire 2016-17 season. There are three options for obtaining Lights Up! tickets: Low-income families who qualify for federal SNAP assistance can show their current EBT (Electronic Benefits Transfer) card just once in person at the Walton Arts Center box office to gain access to $5 tickets all year — online, by phone or in person. Non-profit organizations serving low-income community members will be given tickets to distribute throughout the year. Current partners include 7Hills Homeless Center, Ozark Literacy Council, LifeStyles, Inc., NWA Children’s Shelter and the Northwest Arkansas Women’s Shelter. Lights Up! also supports the 30 Under 30 $10 ticket program for school-aged students and young adults under the age of 30. Solomon Burchfield, director of operations at 7Hills, said he is excited about the new program. “Often people struggling with the demands of everyday life have a hard time affording and accessing the cultural experiences our community has to offer,” Burchfield said. “We are grateful that this opportunity helps brings our whole community together to be educated, entertained, and inspired. Great art should be a part of every person’s life.” Additional organizations serving low-income community members in Benton and Washington counties are encouraged to contact TheatreSquared for information on becoming a non-profit partner. TheatreSquared’s 2016-17 season includes productions of “All the Way,” “I and You,” “Great Expectations,” “Detroit,” “Intimate Apparel,” “The Dingdong,” as well as the two-weekend series of performances in the 2017 Arkansas New Play Festival.   Discussion Fayetteville Flyer has specific guidelines for commenting.

The Indian textiles manufacturer said it is investigating the root cause and appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target Corporation is the second largest retailer in the US after Walmart and is a major customer for Welspun. "We refer to a product specification issue with one client programme of our subsidiary WGBL. We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the Big Four) to audit our supply systems and processes," Welspun India has said in a regulatory filing. Target Corp said that after an extensive investigation, it has confirmed that Welspun, which uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. "As soon as our investigation confirmed the substitution, we pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com. We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said in a statement last week. Welspun India stock today dived 20 per cent, wiping-out Rs 2,064 crore from its market valuation to Rs 8,268.89 crore. The scrip tanked 19.98 per cent to settle at Rs 82.30 - its lower circuit limit - on BSE. On NSE, the stock dipped 19.96 per cent to end at Rs 82.60.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) By Sarah Jaffe August 22 Sarah Jaffe is a Nation Institute reporting fellow and the author of Necessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt. On July 20, as the media’s attention was focused on Cleveland and Sen. Ted Cruz’s refusal to endorse Donald Trump, a group of organizers in Chicago marched to a vacant lot at the intersection of Homan Avenue and Fillmore Street. This lot, in Chicago’s North Lawndale neighborhood, 50 years ago the site of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Chicago Freedom Summer” campaign, is across the street from a building that has been infamously revealed as a police “black site” where thousands of prisoners were held incommunicado for interrogation. The marchers, members of the Let Us Breathe collective and other groups including Black Lives Matter Chicago, built a camp in the space and have been there ever since. They built a kitchen, art and education stations, a library, and sleeping spaces, in sharp contrast to the Homan Square facility where people not convicted of crimes were kept unfree. They held the space, dubbed “Freedom Square,” as Trump accepted his party’s nomination, as the RNC drew to a close and the Democratic National Convention opened, as Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton and Clinton herself officially became the Democrats’ nominee for president. The Sanders campaign is over. But the political revolution is not. After all, the political revolution that has been rippling across the country was never about the senator from Vermont. Sanders was simply observant enough to notice that there was one already happening. While Sanders was riding a wave of discontent with the existing state of U.S. politics, inequality and injustice to over 12 million votes, activists in the Movement for Black Lives, the Fight for $15, and other struggles against injustice, racism, and inequality continued their work of trying to change the country. Most of the action has not been happening in electoral politics, so it has often flown under the radar, with too few reporters connecting the dots between the different surges of what representative and civil rights hero John Lewis calls “necessary trouble.” But in the streets and in homes, in state capitols and McDonald’s and Walmart stores around the country, Americans have rediscovered the value of direct action, of “finding a way to get in the way,” as Lewis says. While outside observers wonder where each protest movement comes from, the protesters themselves are connecting their struggles to one another, coming together to demand bigger, more structural changes than will be seen in a presidential election. Since the 2008 financial crisis, when the inequality that had been growing steadily for decades spiked and became impossible to ignore, Americans have been angry. Angry as unemployment escalated, jobs disappeared and millions lost homes to foreclosure. Angry as police officers who shoot or choke a black person to death walk away with paid leave and the people who videotape the death are themselves sent to jail. Angry as the wealthy have bounced back better than ever, with politicians still catering to their whims, while ordinary people get crumbs. Angry enough not just to support insurgent presidential candidates, but also angry enough to get out in the streets, to occupy space, to insist that they be acknowledged. We in the media have mostly told the story of Americans’ anger through the lens of Trump and Sanders’s campaigns, but in doing so we misunderstand the way change happens in this country, the way it is happening right now. These activists seek long-term radical changes — radical in the sense of “to get to the root of something,” because to make the kind of changes that these activists demand will require deep changes at the heart of political structures, while most elected officials seem content to tinker on the surface, disconnected from the pain most Americans are feeling. The Vision for Black Lives policy document released this month is perhaps the best example of this: Despite the usual description of the movement as one focused on police, the more than 50 groups involved in writing the platform have laid out a comprehensive plan for justice that focuses on the specific harms done to black people but also includes demands ranging from universal health care to divestment from fossil fuels to federal and state jobs programs. On August 1, a little less than two weeks after the founding of Freedom Square in Chicago, protesters took over City Hall Park in New York. Walking through the occupation, I saw familiar faces from Occupy Wall Street making sandwiches and new protesters chalking slogans on the sidewalk. Family members of those killed by the NYPD gave talks. Initiated by Millions March NYC, the occupation demanded the firing of Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, the disavowal of “broken windows” policing, reparations for victims of police violence, and the defunding of the police and the reinvestment of the money in public services in communities of color. The next day, Bratton announced his resignation. Apparently it had been planned, but the news conference at the same City Hall where the protesters had gathered was a site of jubilation. Yet the protesters didn’t go home. One woman held up a cardboard sign that featured check boxes next to the demands: “Fire Bratton” checked off, but “Reparations” and “Divest & Reinvest” still waiting. The demands of these movements are big, and to see them occur would mean that a true political revolution has taken place. Until that time, they’re committed to making necessary trouble to bring them about. Read more on this issue: Carlos Lozada: In “Necessary Trouble,” a guided tour of American radicalism Colbert I.

Americans waste food at frantic rates. Business reporters have much to report on. (Photo by Creative Commons Flickr User Philip Stewart, “Groceries” CC 2.0 License.) America faces a food waste crisis: The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates 30 to 40 percent of the country’s food supply goes unused. Journalists can explore the trend by looking at the business angles behind the news story, and finding ways fresh data can move the reporting forward. This blog outlines tips to achieve both goals. Seek the Corporate Response One ongoing trend is for large corporate retailers, such as Walmart and Whole Foods, to stock irregularly shaped produce instead of consigning it to the trash. While odd looking fruits and vegetables won’t win any beauty contests, they taste just as good as their perfect brethren. Companies such as Whole Foods are also positioning themselves as resources that help consumers reduce food waste at home by educating them about portion control, repurposing leftovers and rotating food items in the fridge and pantry to ensure older items are in front. Meanwhile, new businesses are emerging around the goal of reducing food waste. A company in Denmark last year launched Too Good To Go, an app allowing restaurants and other food establishments to alert consumers about the food they plan to toss at the end of the day, giving users an opportunity to purchase the food at highly reduced rates. Weave in the Data Data builds on the purpose and importance of your business reporting. So make sure you weave in numbers to show your readers what’s at stake. For instance, in writing on the irregularly shaped fruit trend, consider mentioning data from the National Resources Defense Council, which reports that 10 to 30 percent of discarded produce is thrown away because of its appearance.  In a 2012 paper, the same nonprofit found that Americans waste 40 percent of their food, the average family of four tossing away up to $2,275 in grocery expenditures each year. CNBC reported the startling fact from the National Institutes of Health that American consumers throw out 50 percent more food now than they did in the 70s. Tap the Experts Find the best sources for your data through nonprofits paying attention to food waste and how we can turn things around. The National Resources Defense Council does a reasonable job of keeping readers abreast of international trends on food waste such as France’s move toward a national policy against food waste. Feed America.org offers excellent data and ongoing coverage. The National Institutes of Health offers ongoing and compelling research on food waste including studies on household-level dynamics and reducing the problem. The United Nations Environment Programme is another helpful resource, with pivotal and timely alerts on events such as World Food Day, October 16. Pitch your editors leading up to this date. Cover the Trends In your reporting, look for industry moves to combat food waste as well. For instance, the restaurant industry banded together to create a tool kit to help restaurant owners and workers waste less food, cut down on the amount of food put in landfills and help improve restaurant profits. Tips included conducting an inventory to understand what food employees threw away or left unused, and why. The New York Times ran an intriguing piece on an Italian chef who raised funds to create a dining hall where he and other chefs would make meals for Rio’s homeless. The chef used donated leftover food from restaurants serving the masses at this year’s Olympic Games. Reporter’s Takeaway Weave in the corporate response — tell your readers what the big players are doing to reduce food waste Use good data — your readers then better understand what’s at stake Quote the experts and papers from the leading nonprofits tracking the problem Cover the trends — there’s power in numbers Photo by Creative Commons Flickr User Philip Stewart, “Groceries” CC 2.0 License.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      I try to be a long-term thinker and filter out all the short-term noise. That’s hard nowadays, because there is so much short-term noise! Any one of these four things would be big news, especially in the dog days of summer. But all four? It’s crazy out there. I can’t stay focused. I can’t resist the temptation to dive into the short-term stuff. So here we go. Put your boots on. Canada’s housing bubble Vancouver housing prices are up 32 freaking percent from last July, but sales are down 19%. I've written about Canada's housing bubble (a lot). I continue to think it is one of the best macro opportunities globally over the next 10 years. This is the classic sign of a top—prices keep going up on lower and lower volume. It’s a textbook, parabolic, blow-off move. I don’t think US housing prices ever moved that violently 10 years ago. There are also early indications that the 15% tax for foreign homebuyers that’s being applied in British Columbia is starting to work. Sales agreements are being cancelled, and deals are falling apart. They will probably reprice at lower levels. You never know, but this could be the one thing at the margin that causes all of Canadian housing to collapse. Fed has lost its street cred William Dudley, New York Fed president, said that the Fed could hike in September. Said it was a possibility. But it really isn’t, because it is right before the election. So why would he say something that is, like, totally false? The Fed likes to jawbone markets—if Dudley sounds hawkish, then financial conditions might tighten on their own, without the Fed really having to do anything. But the problem is that the Fed has jerked markets around so much over the years that nobody really pays attention anymore. Think about it: when the head of the New York Fed starts talking in concrete, specific terms about rate hikes, and the market completely ignores him—that is a problem. The Fed now has serious credibility issues. This means that monetary policy is no longer as effective as it once was. Unless… the Fed actually takes action and hikes rates. Now, I have said all along that they will hike rates (for sure) after the election, and they definitely will if the winner is Trump. And I still believe that. Regardless of what Brainard says, Yellen is in charge, and she has expressed a desire to “normalize” rates. Get the political uncertainty out of the way, and that might happen. Walmart is buying Jet.com Jet.com basically takes $20 bills and sells them for $10. That is their business model. I am not kidding. Whoever runs Jet.com has created one of the world’s best and most outrageous loss-making entities. And it just got bought by Walmart for $3 billion! This is all wrong. First of all, it shows desperation by Walmart. Of course they can’t let Bezos run away with it, they need a real online presence. But have they just demonstrated that they were unable to hire even a handful of smart people to build a website? That they had to buy the ridiculous Jet.com? Second of all, can you think of the perverse incentives behind rewarding the executives of an utterly intractable business such as Jet.com with $3 billion? I don’t mean to be glib, but it doesn’t take a lot of talent to build a money-losing business. Maybe I should be more charitable—it is downright impossible to compete with Amazon, after all, but Jet didn’t even come close. And I thought Yo was nuts. Trump is blowing himself up Don’t want to dive too deep into politics here—I already poked the tiger. But if the goal for Team Trump is to win, they’re not doing a very good job, falling far behind Hillary Clinton in national polls. I saw the other day that two Whitmans—Meg and Christie Todd, prominent women Republicans—are outright endorsing Hillary. In fact, the whole phenomenon of “Clinton Republicans” is becoming a thing (like the Reagan Democrats 30 years ago). Unlike Nate Silver and Scott Adams, I am not going to make any predictions. (I am much better at predicting markets than politics; Scott Walker was my early pick for the Republican nominee.) But I will reiterate my earlier position that either nominee will be fully engaged in a huge fiscal stimulus in 2017. Trump just said he would spend $500 billion on bridges to nowhere. Clinton will one-up him, for sure. Look out, bond market. I would rather do a swan dive into the Sarlacc Pit than buy a bond in this environment.   A master in behavioral economics, Jared Dillian probes the mind of today’s market to gauge the trends of tomorrow.

The company, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, will offer any shopper in Coventry and Warwickshire a full refund with no receipt or packaging necessary. The products are swim shorts from the chain's clothing brand George. Among the styles affected are two check designs, as well as stripe shorts and shorts displaying sharks, skulls and surfers.

Posted: July 20, 2007 0 Comments SHARE By Nancy Whelan Posted: July 20, 2007 0 Q. While visiting the Publix bakery one evening, I wondered what happens to all of the many varieties of freshly baked breads, rolls, muffins, coffee cakes, stollens, buns, donuts, pies, cakes and cookies that are not sold. I was in the store around 9 p.m. and many of the bakery items were still for sale. Is all of this food simply thrown away in a dumpster because it is merely a day old? When I asked the employee working in this department the answer to this question, she said all of the stock in the bakery was thrown out on a daily basis. I then wondered about other foods like produce, dairy and meats? Are they thrown away too? The point is not to single out Publix Supermarkets because there are many other grocery stores in Florida that toss out good food. Can something be done about this, or is something already being done? It's a subject important to consider given how many homeless and hungry people there are trying to survive every day, including many small children who go to bed — if they can find a bed — every night starving for something to eat. A. Hunger differs across the globe. We see a more severe type of hunger in Third World countries than in civilized countries. Hunger in America refers to the ability or inability of people to obtain sufficient food for themselves or for their household. Some individuals, or even entire households, may skip meals or cut back on the quality or quantity of food they buy (and then eat) because of the lack of financial means. For instance, many low-income parents will skip meals so that their children can eat. On a frequent basis, this trend can easily lead to malnutrition. Food security is a term used by the American government which is assured access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life minus the need for recourse to emergency food sources or other coping behaviors to meet basic food needs. Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to enough food to fully meet basic need at all times due to a lack of financial resources. Here are the sad facts. We waste 96 billion pounds of food each year in America, according to a study done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This staggering statistic translates into: 263,013,699 pounds of food wasted each day 10,958,904 pounds of food wasted each hour And, there are about 36 million Americans living in poverty! Louise Hubbard, executive director of Treasure Coast Homeless Services Council, a coordinating agency, says the number of homeless people as of a Jan. 27, 2007 street count was 572 in Indian River County. Of these individuals, there were 148 children under the age of 18, and 16 unaccompanied teenagers. Hubbard explains that a street count is a point-in-time survey where 50 or so volunteers comb the streets to connect with the homeless and distribute and collect a survey that then furnishes specific information about them. People struggle day in and day out, whether they are homeless or not, just to get enough food to survive. Unfortunately, almost half of these people happen to be children, when nutrition is most crucial to physical and mental development. When bakery items reach the day-old mark, Wal-Mart reduces the price of these items and they are then sold on sale racks so there is minimal waste, according to Mark Phelen, Sebastian Wal-Mart manager. "Eighty to 90 percent of these items sell," he says. Produce must be discarded when it starts aging as it is company policy, Phelen says. "We only sell quality goods," he adds. Anne Hendricks, Media and Community Relations spokesperson with Publix, says Publix does indeed donate many food items to help the hungry, which I was very happy to discover. "There is a company wide relationship with Second Harvest Food Bank," says Hendricks. The subsidiary name of the Second Harvest Food Bank (which functions at a national level) in the Miami area is Daily Bread Food Bank, she says. Non-perishables items like canned goods, jarred food and water that may have been slightly damaged in the shipping process or are missing, or partially missing labels are donated to this organization to help feed the homeless and/or hungry. In fact, Hendricks says the Publix Miami division alone, which includes 240 stores and spans from Key West to Sebastian, donates 4 1/2 million pounds of food annually. Daily Bread Food Bank picks up the donated food and then distributes the items to local food banks. Breads and non-perishables bakery items like muffins that need no refrigeration, are donated to local soup kitchens and churches and that relationship happens at the store level, Hendricks says. That food is then distributed through local soup kitchens and churches to those in need. Hendricks stated it was difficult to measure the amount of this particular food group being donated since some days there is more donated food than on other days, depending on the stock remaining in the stores. Hubbard says there are three organizations currently serving the homeless and hunger needs of Indian River County. The Source is a daily residential center that provides assistance and programs to individuals and families in crisis situations. The Samaritan Center has beds to house the homeless and does offer food. And, The Homeless Family Center offers ongoing housing to homeless or nearly homeless people. Homelessness and hunger are an ongoing problem in this nation and we cannot close our eyes to this ongoing situation. It is estimated that many people are just one paycheck away from losing a home or a current living arrangement. Information for this column was derived from The Food Research and Action Center (www.frac.org), which is the leading national nonprofit organization working to improve public policies and public-private partnerships to eradicate hunger and under-nutrition in the U.S. Suggestion: Go through your pantries or buy a few extra items the next time you go grocery shopping and please donate any food items or even donate money to help the hungry in Indian River County to the following three organizations: The Homeless Family Center is a long-term residential facility accepting Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin and Okeechobee County people and is at 715 Fourth Place, Vero Beach; (772) 567-5537. David Cooper, residential manager, says canned foods, hamburger meat, chicken, rice and beans are always needed. They currently have 16 families consisting of 70 people, of which 35 are children under 18. The Source, a daily residential facility, is at 1015 Commerce Ave., Vero Beach; (772) 564-0202. The Samaritan Center is long-term residential facility at 3650 41st St., Vero Beach; (772) 770-2900. Canned goods, hamburger meat, chicken and toiletries are always needed. The center currently has 25 people of which 15 are children under the age of 18.

A look at some interesting cases coming up for hearing on Monday. NGT to hear diesel ban case The National Green Tribunal (NGT) will hear a case regarding implementation of its April 2015 order, wherein it had banned diesel vehicles that were over 10 years old from plying on the roads of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). On 20 July, the court had held that the process of de-registration of diesel vehicles in NCR would start with scrapping of 15-year-old diesel vehicles, to be followed by less older vehicles. Read more Thereafter, Tata Motors moved the court against the ban and said that it feared a loss in revenue if the ban continued. Read more Supreme Court to hear case relating to air pollution in Delhi The Supreme Court on Monday will hear the case relating to air pollution in Delhi. The hearing gains significance as the apex court allowed luxury diesel vehicles, or those with engine capacity over 2000cc, to be registered in Delhi-NCR on the condition that they deposit 1% of the ex-showroom price of each vehicle sold. Plea on security situation in Jammu and Kashmir The apex court will also hear a plea by J&K National Panthers Party seeking court monitoring of unrest in the state and imposition of President’s rule. HC to hear Walmart India’s dispute with Central Vigilance Commission The Delhi high court will hear a dispute between Walmart India Pvt. Ltd and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The CVC had sought to initiate criminal proceedings against the company for allegedly delaying inquiry in a likely graft case. Earlier, the high court restrained the CVC from filing a criminal complaint against Walmart. Read more Plea against Novartis painkiller injection The high court will hear a plea by Gujarat-based Troikaa Pharmaceutical, questioning the licence granted to Swiss drug maker Novartis for painkiller injection Diclofenac. The court had earlier issued notice to the Centre, Novartis India and others for their response. Read more Coal scam: Rathi Steel promoters move high court against conviction The Delhi high court will also hear appeals filed by Rathi Steel Pvt. Ltd’s promoters—Pradeep Rathi and Udit Rathi—and additional general manager Kushal Agarwal against their conviction and sentencing orders in a coal scam.

Members of the Hearts of Hope organization got up early Sunday morning to start filling their trucks with supplies “We are trying to spread the message and the goodwill, you know,” said volunteer Zack Guidroz. The volunteers spent hours in front of Walmart asking for donations from shoppers at the store. “These people have truly lost everything, and every little bit helps,” said shopper Deanna Martino. The volunteers know what it’s like to go through a tragedy after a tornado damaged their community in 2014. “We’ve been in the same state they are in," said Hearts of Hope founder Carlton Thornhill. "Maybe not as bad as they are in, but when the tornado came through here and these pockets that were hit were so devastating, people had nothing and had to start over." The organization plans on filling two trailers with supplies to bring to Louisiana on Wednesday. “It gives you such a sense of hope, and that’s what we are doing when people are giving us stuff because we are jut their arms and legs and just passing this on, and it’s done out of love,” Thornhill said. The organization plans on traveling to Baton Rouge, Zachary, Walker and Woodville to drop off supplies.  If you want to make a donation you can go to their Facebook page. Copyright WDAM 2016.

Sauter August 19, 2016 7:05 am EST Print Email Tweet Tech giant Cisco Systems is expected to announce plans to lay off 14,000 employees in the coming weeks, nearly one-fifth of its total headcount, according to technology news site CRN. These layoffs may be the result of the company’s aim to move away from hardware and into wireless security and data centers. If these layoffs are announced, they would not be the first by a major company this year, nor would they be the largest. According to data compiled by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Wal-Mart has announced the most job cuts so far this year, with plans to lay off a total of 17,500 employees. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Challenger, Gray & Christmas CEO John Challenger explained that the number one cause of layoffs is poor financial performance. “Business drops, profitability drops, and [companies] have to cut costs. They don’t want to get caught with too many people and not enough business to support them.” Click here to see the 12 companies laying off the most workers. No industry has announced more job cuts in 2016 than the energy industry. U.S. oil currently trades at less than $50 a barrel, close to one-third of its price in 2008. Falling oil prices have weakened the industry in the U.S., and a number of companies have declared bankruptcy and closed refineries. The energy industry represents two of the four companies cutting the most jobs, with Halliburton and Schlumberger together cutting an estimated 25,000 jobs in 2016. Layoffs do not always indicate poor financial performance. Many companies laying off employees are restructuring as they adapt to a changing marketplace. Over the past decade, the growing ubiquity of mobile technology and cloud computing has disrupted industries most consumer-facing industries, as well as a large share of the country’s biggest tech companies. The computer and retail industries have announced 49,464 and 43,618 job cuts, respectively this year, the second and third most of any industry. As Challenger told 24/7 Wall St., “[Job] cuts in retail are signs of the fundamental change going on in the move to e-commerce.” Online retail sales accounted for 8.1% of total retail sales in the most recent fiscal quarter, roughly double the share seven years ago. As major retailers shift their focus to online sales, many employees at brick-and-mortar stores are at greater risk of losing their jobs. Macy’s is currently laying off three to four workers in each of its 770 stores, and has plans to close 100 locations in early 2017. The technology industry is also undergoing major changes. Global PC shipments declined by 5.2% in the most recent quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of decline. Meanwhile, smartphone sales have continued to grow. To keep up with shifting consumer demand, major technology companies are expanding their product lines and restructuring in the process. For example, hard drive manufacturer Seagate Technology recently acquired cloud storage company Dot Hill Systems in an attempt to diversity its business offerings. As part of a plan to restructure around the merger, Seagate recently announced it would be laying off a total of 8,100 employees by the end of 2017. Challenger, Gray & Christmas provided 24/7 Wall St. with all job cut announcements affecting at least 1,000 positions in 2016. 24/7 Wall St. combined the planned cuts by company to identify the companies that announced the most job cuts so far this year. Only announcements made in 2016 were considered, and layoffs were only counted if they occurred at least partially in 2016, or are expected to occur in the future. Job cuts announced in 2016 but which only included positions cut in 2015 were excluded from the list. Job cuts did not need to be entirely within the United States. Total headcounts are from each company’s most recent annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These are the 14 companies cutting the most jobs.

newslink News Sports Opinion Life Obituaries Classifieds Jobs Garage Sales November 23, 2016 | Today's Paper | Submit News | Subscribe Today Second critical need blood drive of summer Local News Aug 22, 2016 The Community Blood Bank needs your help. “Unfortunately, we are going on appeal again for the second time this summer,” Nicole Hornaman, communications and marketing coordinator said. That appeal signifies a second critical need this summer. “A continued combination of increased usage and low donor turnout has left the blood bank’s inventory of blood depleted, especially O Negative and A Negative blood types,” according to a release. Those in Warren County interested in donating this week will have an opportunity. “The drive is on Wednesday, August 24 at Holy Redeemer Church from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m,” Hornaman said. “All donors will be entered to win a $50 Walmart gift card.” That isn’t the only incentive that the Community Blood Bank is offering an additional incentive to residents of northwest Pennsylvania and western New York. “Everyone who signs in to donate from now through August 31 will be entered to win a 4-pack of tickets to see Jason Aldean in Pittsburgh on September 24,” she said. Hornaman talked about the importance of constantly being able to meet the need. “Our concern is having what our partner hospitals need at all times and when we’re facing the potential of not being able to do that, we rely on the community to help,” Hornaman added. “As part of the America’s Blood Centers Network, we have the ability to reach out to other blood centers throughout the country in times of critical need and try to import from the inventories. This is usually our last option, but when it’s a matter of public safety, we will coordinate to ensure we have enough blood for local patients. “We’re told today, however, that other centers are also experiencing shortages and cannot supply us with enough units to meet our current needs. This means that donors from our service region are our only viable option to increase the local blood supply.” There are several criteria for those interested in donating. “Individuals are eligible to give blood if it has been 56 days since their last donation; they are at least 17 years of age (16 with parental consent); weigh at least 110 pounds; have not received a tattoo or body piercing in the past 12 months; are in good general health and do not have a cold or the flu,” according to the release. “You must have a valid photo ID in order to donate. Prior to donating, those giving blood should eat a good, solid meal and drink at least 18 oz. of water.” Anyone looking for more information can go to the Community Blood Bank’s website, fourhearts.org, or call (877) 842-0631.

Consulting City Engineer Brad Merrell delivered his City Council report on Aug. 15. "It's kind of holding up the sewer line on Montara because in order to get the construction work to happen at Montara, they need to switch the traffic over at the intersection of East Main and Montara, which is a traffic control intersection," Merrell said. "Once that is approved, it will start with the connection with sewer into Montara. Then following that they will be starting to work on East Main for Frontier and the water company." Merrell said if Shames Construction is unable to get the traffic control plan approved by Aug. 29, it will start work on Frontier and Golden State Water. He also said Shames Construction is currently installing a median on Montara Road. Mike Lamb can be reached at 760-957-0613 or mlamb@desertdispatch.com.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 22 August 2016 Target severs ties with Welspun over Egyptian cotton dispute NEW YORK: Target Corp is ending all business with Welspun India Ltd, one of the world’s biggest textile manufacturers, after saying the supplier was sending it phony Egyptian cotton sheets. The retailer said it discovered last month that 750,000 sheets and pillowcases labelled as Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton. The retailer pulled the items from its stores, and last Friday it began notifying customers that it will give them a refund on the products, which were produced between August 2014 and July 2016 and sold for as much as US$75. Customers seeking a refund can visit Target’s help page on its website. Target is Mumbai-based Welspun’s second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc, according to Bloomberg data. The company makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Its other major clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc, J.C. Penney Co and Macy’s Inc. It also manufactures the towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” said Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman. “We value the trust that our guests place in us. The Target team will continue to work closely with all vendors to help ensure that the products we offer to our guests meet or exceed their expectations.” Target said it is phasing out all of its products from Welspun, which it has used as a supplier for more than a decade, though the process will take time since some merchandise has already been shipped or paid for. The withdrawal only includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be higher quality. Welspun India is part of Welspun Group, a conglomerate which also owns Welspun Corp Ltd, a pipe manufacturer that also supplies major oil and gas companies. Welspun India’s sales in the year through March rose 13% to 59.8 billion rupees (US$891.6mil), and net income climbed 30% to 7.03 billion rupees. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Target Group Related Stories Green Target confident of strong property demand in Nilai You May Be Interested Kossan kept at Hold by CIMB Research Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Viral video will crash your iPhone M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Sprint Cup Series drivers found different ways to spend their time during long rain delays on Saturday night and Sunday for the Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race. A Roush Fenway publicist said her team’s drivers simply watched television, played games on the computer and took naps. No one took advantage of the adverse conditions more than BK Racing driver Matt DiBenedetto, who got some rare television time and even danced on pit road during the Saturday night broadcast. Still, it wasn’t easy to be ready to race and then have to shut the car down. “It’s kind of tough mentally,” he said. “You get in the zone. You’ve worked on your hydration to make sure you’re ready. You get back in the car, back in the zone and then you hop back out.” After the race was officially postponed until Sunday, the driver had to make a late night trip to the store. “We ran out of gear and ran straight to Walmart for my wife,” he said. “She didn’t bring her stuff to stay the night so we got some things so she could stay with me. She wanted to be here since Bristol was one of my best race tracks.” CHEVY BACK ON TOP Kevin Harvick’s win in Sunday’s Bass Pro Shops Night Race gave Chevrolet a record 44th victory at Bristol Motor Speedway. It was Chevy’s first victory at BMS since Kasey Kahne won the Food City 500 in March 2013. SPEEDING, SO WHAT? Denny Hamlin was charged with a speeding penalty on a mid-race pit stop, and he further complicated matters by coming out of his pit stall too soon. It was Hamlin’s eighth speeding penalty of the year and a series-high 12th penalty overall. He fell from fifth place to 22nd after the initial pit stop, and down to 25th after losing two laps after coming back on pit road. Hamlin battled back to take the lead in the race before ultimately finishing third. END OF THE STREAK Kurt Busch had completed every lap this season coming into the Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race. That was a record 22 races to start the season. The streak ended on lap 374 when Busch spun in front of the field going for the lead and triggered an 11-car accident.

Close calls for 2 dogs amid dangerous heat Bev Greco, Cumberland County SPCA 8:42 p.m. EDT August 21, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share After Louisiana's historic flood, many dogs were left stranded. These two gentlemen were able to rescue a struggling pit bull by pulling him into a boat with them. Kiara (Photo: CCSPCA) The extreme heat that we’ve been suffering, like all severe weather events, has been challenging for our cruelty investigators and the local animal control officers as they race around to keep up with reports of animals in distress or unprotected from the elements. With temperatures in the 90s and heat indexes over 100 degrees, animals can suffer heat stroke in a very short amount of time. We’ve had two interesting cases in the past couple of weeks, one involving a puppy tied outside and the other one locked in a car. The former was an avoidable accident; the latter, well, I may as well just say it, pure stupidity. I got the first call on a hot Saturday evening from an ACO whose assistance had been requested by the state police. That afternoon, they had been called out to a shopping venue in Salem County for a tiny dog left in a parked car. The temperature was in the mid-90s and, by the time the troopers were able to get there and break into the car, the dog was unresponsive to the point where the officers at first thought that she was dead. Realizing that she did still in fact have signs of life, they got her in the air-conditioned squad car and raced her to a veterinarian. THE DAILY JOURNAL Do the math: Your pet will cost you When the ACO called me that evening, the dog was still in the ICU of the veterinary hospital and not yet out of the woods. By some miracle, the troopers had reached her just in the nick of time; a delay of even a few minutes would have resulted in her death. After spending a few days at the hospital, she is now safe in our care at the Cumberland County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, awaiting the judgment of the court as to whether she will be returned to her owners or forfeited as a result of the cruelty charges. I’d like to be able to be tactful and professional about this case, but no matter how far down I dig, I can’t seem to find anything but disgust for someone that would purposefully leave an animal in a car while they were bargain hunting. There’s no way that anyone who has ever gotten into a car that’s been in the hot sun (let alone locked in with just a crack in the windows) couldn’t know how oppressive and dangerous that heat can be. Unfortunately, although we are the impound facility, it is not our court case, so we can only hope the court sees it the way we do.

In this particular situation, it was a teenager who didn’t follow through with the responsibility bestowed upon him. Animal control responded to the report of a puppy tied out in the heat with no water and no protection from the sun. When the little dog got here, his temperature was over 104 degrees; he was lethargic and in need of fluids and a gentle cooldown. Thanks goodness for the alert citizen who called police, or this pup’s story could have ended very differently. Kids sometimes do dumb things, but then again, all too often we read about kids dying who have been left in their car seats, so we can’t blame it all on immaturity. An easy remedy to avoiding this situation is to have your dog’s outside area equipped with shade, a doghouse and access to fresh water. You also can set reminders in your cellphone to let your animals back in or for any of the other maintenance tasks that need to be done for them. Hope you’re enjoying the cooler weather while it’s here. But don’t forget that although it might not be in the 90s, it can still be dangerous for your pets.

SCOUT Troy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Sports Mike Zimmer should have just been honest in his decision to sit Teddy Bridgewater John Holler 08/20/2016 Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer got combative with the media when asked about sitting out a healthy Teddy Bridgewater Thursday night -- a move that caught many by surprise. A night later, a coaching mate of Zimmer's did the exact same thing, but a simple explanation stopped any conspiracy theorists in their tracks. Marvin Lewis lost his immediate football family in early 2014. Despite being under fire from the local media types in southern Ohio for not being able to win a playoff game after making the playoffs, the rest of the NFL was taking notice. Among them being Zygi Wilf and Daniel Snyder – two guys you’ll never see in the school supplies isle at Target or Walmart. They figured Marv’s Queen City malaise was his problem. They were eyeballing his underlings – defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Jay Gruden, who would become the head coaches of the Minnesota Vikings and Washington Redskins, respectively. Despite losing both his coordinators in one fell swoop, Lewis made the playoffs in 2015, so it was all good. So did Zimmer. So did Gruden. All hail the coaching tree. On Thursday night, in what turned out to be one of the more controversial moves (by his design) of his coaching tenure, Zimmer made the decision to inform Teddy Bridgewater he didn’t need to showcase his talents in front of the 12th Man. Sorry, Seattle, you paid to see Shaun Hill leave the game with a lead. Deal with it. http://www.scout.com/nfl/vikings/story/1697623-vikings-defenders-get-aft... On Friday night, in a bold rejoinder, Gruden shockingly told small sample-size starting QB Kirk Cousins to have a seat and watch the proceedings in front of the 53,000-and-change paying customers at home. Well played, sir. Tip your king, Zim. This particular chess game is over. Both coaches made the identical decision, but Gruden showed how the move is done properly. Zimmer did it in such a way that it seemed almost like he was picking for a fight when asked for an explanation. It was inevitable that Zimmer was going to be asked why, to the shock of just about everyone outside Winter Park, Bridgewater wasn’t going to play. Is Teddy hurt? Not according to comments after the game. There he was on the sideline. He looks fine. So why isn’t he playing? It was a question everyone watching the Shaun Hill Era begin was asking. It wasn’t so much asking why? It was more a “wait…what?” situation. The local Vikings-centric TV broadcast hinted that explanations would be forthcoming. It wasn’t. Zimmer went full-on salty when his decision was questioned. It had all the makings of a general being asked by someone with the audacity to question a decision made beyond the comprehension of those who couldn’t possibly fathom the bigger picture of his battle plan. In the world Zimmer grew up in, if a head coach dressed down a reporter to the point of asking if the questioner if he or she was “alright” with his decision, that would have been that. The next time it happened, the coach's authority or reasoning likely wouldn't be questioned. In the world Zimmer lives in now, unless you take ownership of a decision preemptively, the instantaneous backlash fueled by social-media speculation is pronounced. Left to their own devices, media types (and millions of Vikings fans) began to question that, if Teddy was healthy, was his benching disciplinary in nature? When asked what seemed to be a relatively obvious question, Zimmer got very defensive – coming close to asking, “Do you want a piece of me?” from a fighting posture. The postgame Q & A became a battle that wasn’t necessary. Just 24 hours later, Gruden did the exact same thing – making Cousins an 11th-hour healthy scratch. Yet, when the D.C. media – known for attempting to unearth coverups and conspiracies – asked Gruden why Cousins was inexplicably scratched from the lineup, he was forthcoming. His claim was that the players fighting for depth chart positioning and roster spots deserved a longer look in game action. No conspiracy. No secret reason. He came straight out and said that, while it was his decision, there was a valid reason for it. There have been times Zimmer has been at odds with media in giving out information about his players and the reasons for the coaching decisions he has made along the way. But Thursday’s spectacle was one that easily could have been avoided (and understood) if Zimmer had simply said he wanted to give Shaun Hill a chance to show what he could do with the first-unit offense. Instead, he was combative and, by his reluctance to simply give an honest answer, put himself and the media at odds and caught Bridgewater in the middle. As it turns out, Bridgewater had a sore shoulder, according to ESPN, that wouldn't have been serious enough to hold him out of a regular season game. Even that simple explanation would have sufficed. Perhaps Gruden learned from Zimmer’s mistake and came out with a rational excuse why he would bench his starting quarterback when the expectation was that he was going to play. Even in the cloak and dagger world of the NFL, sometimes honesty remains the best policy.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Updated Scout 300 Trend Meter For 2017 Key matchup: Mid-rounders vs. first-rounders Greenway’s Thanksgiving plans are tentative Newman doubtful; Diggs, others questionable Rhodes named NFC defensive player of week Viking Update Top Stories Key matchup: Mid-rounders vs. first-rounders The Minnesota Vikings have gotten a lot of production out of their mid-round defensive ends, but they will be facing a couple of first-round offensive tackles. by John Holler Viking Update10:36 AM Newman doubtful; Diggs, others questionableThe Minnesota Vikings aren’t likely to field their normal starting lineup on Thanksgiving with a short week of recovery. by Tim Yotter Viking Update10:23 AM Rhodes named NFC defensive player of weekXavier Rhodes’ first two-interception game of his career propelled him into the NFC defensive player of the week. by Tim Yotter Viking Update9:54 AM Hard-core stats: Vikings vs. Lions Where do the Minnesota Vikings have an advantage over the Detroit Lions?

This year, the event is even bigger. The Virginia Food Truck Battle and Beer Competition will feature food trucks from throughout the state and statewide craft beer vendors. All proceeds will benefit The MaDee Project, which helps families of children with pediatric cancer. "We are excited about this year's 'First Statewide Food Truck Battle,'" said Kim Metje, the event coordinator. "We are ready for large crowds this year. Last year, being our first year we were praying for 1,000 to come and 2,800 showed up. A good problem that we have made good notes on and adjusted for 2,800 and many more." The event will feature 24 food trucks from Fairfax, Winchester, Broadway, Harrisonburg, Staunton, Augusta County, Charlottesville, Roanoke, Lynchburg and Richmond, Metje said. There will also be six breweries that each have a beer entry for the competition. THE NEWS LEADER Food Truck Battle comes back for second year To accommodate the larger crowds expected, Metje said there will be multiple zones and sections for the food trucks. "The trucks are divided in to three zones with eight trucks in each zone," she said. "Each zone will represent trucks from different locations and styles of food. The zones are spread out to accommodate the crowds, but all within easy walk to each other. "We also will have plenty of parking," Metje added. Entrance into the museum will be one way off of Richmond Road and exit onto Frontier Drive, Metje said. Parking will be available at the old Dice's parking lot and the lower half of Walmart and Lowe's. "We will have trolleys to shuttle people back and forth if parking in those areas," Metje said. "(There will be) plenty of Port-a-Johns and hand washing stations too. We took good notes last year and are ready for another wonderful well planned out event that will help so many families battling pediatric cancer."  (Photo: Submitted) How it works There will be VIP tickets and general admission, just like last year. VIP tastings start at noon.  VIP ticket holders purchase their ticket in a zone and will get a tasting of the food entry from each of the eight trucks in their zone. Each VIP ticket holder will also get a 2 ounce tasting of the six beers entered. General admission ticket-holders enter at 2 p.m.   All food trucks will begin selling food items at 2 p.m.   All ticket-holders are able to check out the museum's exhibits. Event goes to 7 p.m. "We are not listing what trucks are in each zone, but they won’t be disappointed," Metje said. "We have excellent trucks coming and they are serious about the competition. So they are bringing their A-Game." Buy Photo  (Photo: Laura Peters/The News Leader) THE NEWS LEADER Pupuseria truck owner shows why tamales can’t be rushed There will be music from Kiz Carter, the V’s, The Sundried Opossums and Glass Betty and an expanded children’s area with a balloon show and magic show and games — all free. Area craft and merchant vendors and other food trucks will be in attendance to offer things like kettle corn, gourmet popsicles, funnel cakes and slushes, Metje said. Something new this year is the VIP’s vote on favorite food truck in their zone and the zone winners will then summit their tasting to a panel of three chefs, Metje said.  The chefs will then decide on the grand champion for the entire battle. The chefs are: Ian Boden – The Shack in Staunton. Isaac Coles – Jimmy Madison in Harrisonburg Chris Jacks – Wild Wolf Brewery in Nelson County "​The food truck battle draws a large and diverse audience, many of whom have never been to the Frontier Culture Museum," said Joe Herget, marketing director at the Frontier Culture Museum. "So this event creates a fantastic opportunity for us to attract a lot of first-time visitors, show them the museum, and encourage them to become regular visitors. All food truck battle tickets allow access to the entire museum, so people are free to explore the exhibits throughout the day." Buy Photo  (Photo: Laura Peters/The News Leader) The battle is set for Sept. 4, during Labor Day weekend. VIP tickets are $35 in advance and $40 at the door. General Admission is $10 in advance and $15 at the door. Tickets are available at VaFoodTruckBattle.com. Last year, first place went to Staunton's own Farm Fresh Fixins, with the runner-up going to Gaby's Delicias. With the amount of people who came last year, Metje said the money raised for The MaDee Project was able to go further. "We are expecting people from all over the state to attend this year," Metje said. "With a three-day weekend many are coming in on Saturday and Sunday to visit and attend the battle." Herget said the museum is ready for the crowds, but does advise visitors to come early — 11 a.m. for VIP ticket holders and 1:30 p.m. for general admission. "The museum staff has extensive experience hosting large events, and with about 175 working acres of land, the museum can handle large crowds — when we know they're coming," he said.

Published on Sunday, August 21, 2016 by Common Dreams Do Unions Belong in the Fight Against Corporate School Reform? by Steven Singer 0 Comments Unions "are essential to the health of public education," writes Steven Singer. (Photo: Gadfly on the Wall Blog) In the fight for public education, the forces of standardization and privatization are running scared. They’ve faced more pushback in the last few years – especially in the last few months – than in a decade. The Opt Out movement increases exponentially every year. Teach for America is having trouble getting recruits. Pearson’s stock is plummeting. The NAACP and Black Lives Matter have both come out strongly against increasing charter schools. They want you to believe that the corporate vultures preying on our public schools are really just misunderstood philanthropists.  So what’s a corporate education reformer to do? Answer: Change the narrative. They can’t control the facts, so instead they try to control the story being told about the facts. It’s a classic propaganda technique. As Malcolm X put it: “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” Their story goes like this – yes, there is a battle going on over public education. But the two sides fighting aren’t who you think they are. The fight for public schools isn’t between grassroots communities and well-funded AstroTurf organizations, they say. Despite the evidence of your eyes, the fight isn’t between charter school sycophants and standardized test companies, on the one hand, and parents, students and teachers on the other. No. It’s actually between people who really care about children and those nasty, yucky unions. It’s nonsense, of course. Pure spin.  They want you to believe that the corporate vultures preying on our public schools are really just misunderstood philanthropists. And those demanding a fair shake for their own children and communities are really just paid shills from a monolithic and uncaring bureaucracy. In essence, they want you to believe two things: 1) Despite profiting off the system and zero evidence supporting the efficacy of corporate school policies, they’re motivated purely by empathy. 2) Unions are evil by definition and they pervert everything they touch. Put simply, unions are not perfect, but they are not evil. In fact, they are essential to the health of public education. I’m not going to bother with the first claim here. There is an inherent bias from those who wish to change the laws so they can more easily profit off of schools without actually helping students learn and in fact exist at the expense of that learning. If you can’t see through the propaganda wing of the Walmart corporation, the Broad Foundation and Big Daddy Bill Gates, you probably won’t be very receptive to anything else I have to say. Instead I will focus on the second claim, because it is the more pernicious of the two. Put simply, unions are not perfect, but they are not evil. In fact, they are essential to the health of public education. Many progressives are upset with teachers unions because of the current Presidential election. Both the National Education Association (NEA) and theAmerican Federation of Teachers (AFT) endorsed Hillary Clinton in the primary election without what many would consider adequately polling rank and file members. For better or worse, the endorsements were top-down affairs reflecting the preference of union leaders. That’s not how unions are supposed to work. And it’s having consequences for the way both members and non-members view teachers unions. Critics infer from this that unions don’t represent membership. They are de factoarms of the waiting Clinton administration and the neoliberal agenda. There may be some truth to this, but it does not represent the whole picture. Not nearly.  Unions are like any other democratic organization. The larger the association, the further from the grassroots the decision making body. In the mammoth national unions, decisions are made by representatives most removed from our schools. They probably were teachers or support staff at some point in the past, but that may be ancient history. Now they are professional leaders and therefore at a remove from the grassroots. By contrast, in our local chapters, leaders are most often working classroom teachers. Decisions are made by those still meeting students’ needs on a day-to-day basis. As such, they retain an authenticity and expertise that may be more cloudy in the large bureaucracies. This isn’t to say the national unions are by definition unconcerned with the needs of teachers and students. I’m sure that most of the NEA and AFT leadership who decided to endorse Clinton did it because they honestly believe doing so will help public education. And – who knows – they may be right. But what they forgot in this case was the democratic process they were tasked with preserving. As such, they may have to pay a price for their hubris when their terms are up. In most cases, the leaders of national teachers unions are at too much of a remove to see what is best for our schools. And they usually know that. It is up to the rank and file to tell them what to do, and that’s what happens every year at representative assemblies through various caucuses made up of work-a-day members. And if leaders overstep their authority it is members’ duty to hold them accountable at election time.  So even though the national organizations are most likely to go astray, they often don’t. Usually even these giants are trying to improve the situation in our public schools. Opposition to privatization and standardization policies doesn’t come from the leadership of the NEA and AFT. It comes from the grassroots. However, it can’t be denied that the most intense and passionate activism happens a bit closer to where the rubber hits the road. It’s those local chapters that are there everyday and make the most difference. They are the heart and soul of unionism.  So when corporate education reformers sneeringly deprecate their opponents as mere unions, they’re glossing over an important distinction. Opposition to privatization and standardization policies doesn’t come from the leadership of the NEA and AFT. It comes from the grassroots. This is not a top down initiative. It is bottom up. This is how it’s always been. There is no political organization directing the fight to save public education. The Democrats certainly aren’t overly concerned with reigning in charter schools. It was grassroots Democrats – some of whom are also union members – who worked to rewrite the party platform to do so. The Clinton campaign is not directing anyone to opt out of standardized testing. However, voters are demanding that Clinton be receptive to their needs – and some of them are union members. There is no great union conspiracy to fight these policies. It’s called public opinion, and it’s changing. That’s what scares the standardizers and privatizers. They’ve had free run of the store for almost two decades and now the public is waking up. They’re desperately trying to paint this as a union movement when it’s not. Unions are involved, but they aren’t alone. And moreover, their involvement is not necessarily an impediment. The biggest lie to have resonated with the public is this notion that teachers unions are only concerned with shielding bad teachers from justice. This is demonstrably untrue. The needs of the community and the needs of teachers are the same. Both want excellent public schools. Both want the best for our students. Both want academic policies that will help students learn – not help corporations cash in. And both groups want good teachers in the classroom – not bad ones! The biggest lie to have resonated with the public is this notion that teachers unions are only concerned with shielding bad teachers from justice. This is demonstrably untrue. Unions fight to make sure teachers get due process, but they also fight to make sure bad teachers are shown the door. In fact, in districts with strong unions, MORE bad teachers are fired – not less, according to a new study by economics Prof. Eunice Han from the University of Utah. The study entitled The Myth of Unions’ Overprotection of Bad Teachers concludes that when unions are strong and successfully bargain for higher salaries, they have an incentive to help ensure ineffective teachers don’t receive tenure. In short, it costs too much to keep bad teachers on staff. It is in the interests of the collective bargaining unit to ensure those unfit to teach move along. Moreover, Han also concludes that strong unions actually help reduce the dropout rate. It just makes sense. When you treat people like the professionals they are, when you give them autonomy and respect, they’re free to concentrate more energy into their jobs than fighting to keep those jobs. But unions stand in direct opposition to the efforts of corporate vultures trying to swoop in and profit off of public education. Teachers provide a valuable service to students. If your goal is to reduce the cost of that service no matter how much that reduces its value to students, you need a weak labor force. You need the ability to reduce salary so you can claim the savings as profit.  THAT’S why corporate education reformers hate teachers and their unions. We make it nearly impossible to swipe school budgets into their own pockets. So do unions belong in the fight against corporate education reform? Answer: Heck yeah! In fact, they are essential to it.

By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO – Being in the shadow of drugstore giant Walgreens is a challenge Tupelo Drugs welcomes. The independent pharmacy opened in June on Garfield Drive in what was originally Super Sav-On-Drugs. “I think it’s just more personable being an independent and not part of a chain,” said Tupelo Drugs pharmacist Amy Cochran. “You’re not just a number. You get to actually know customers, you spend time with them, you know them by name and you’re not just pushing through things.” According to the National Community Pharmacists Association, the U.S. has some 22,000 independent pharmacies, representing an $81.4 billion market and employing 314,000 people. Walgreens, the nation’s largest drugstore chain, has some 8,200 stores alone, generating nearly $50 billion in sales. CVS has nearly 8,000 stores with just under $49 billion in sales. Competition is everywhere – big-box retailers like Wal-Mart also have pharmacies, as do discounters like Fred’s and supermarket chains like Kroger. Independents focus on their service and convenience to separate themselves from the pack. “It’s tough sometimes,” Cochran said. “The bigger chains can sell something and not make as much money, so they can sell other things like dog food, drinks, or something else in the store. “But we focus on healthcare and service …the other things take away from that.” Ironically, Walgreens operated from the Tupelo Drugs building before it opened its store next door in 2009. One of the owners of Tupelo Drugs is Scott Baker, whose father, J.K. Baker, owned Super Sav-On-Drugs. Everything has come full circle it seems. Cochran worked for the Bakers in their stores for 18 years, and is a familiar face with customers. Thomas Wells | Buy at photos.djournal.com upelo Drugs pharmacy technician Shelly Washington hands a prescription to a customer at the drive-through window. The pharmacy is located on Garfield Drive, across from the North Mississippi Medical Center. So, too, is Shelly Washington, a pharmacy technician who worked at the former Super Sav-On-Drugs location for 12 years. While the big chain pharmacies tout their $4 prescription drug lists and other supposed price advantages, independents are competitive with their pricing as well.” For example, Tupelo Drugs also has a $4 prescription list. Co-pays are the same as any other local competitors’ co-pays, and it also matches prices. Cochran began working with Super-Sav-On in 1988 after she graduated from the University of Mississippi, first in Tupelo, then in Okolona. Super Sav-On was later sold and she began working with a national retailer. “It’s a lot different working with an independent,” she said. “You get to know everyone and you become a big family. A lot of people are glad we’re here, because they don’t have to wait in line for 30 minutes or go home and come back for their medicine. Tupelo Drugs is conveniently located across from North Mississippi Medical Center, and its drive-through has been a popular option “We have a store in Winfield, Alabama, and we fill over 300 prescriptions a day, and no one waits more than five minutes,” said Heather Smith, the office manager for the company. That’s the goal Tupelo Drugs is aiming for as well. “We want to make those connections with everybody who comes here,” Cochran said. “We’ll take the time to call the doctor and get your refills, and if you can’t afford the prescription or don’t have the insurance, we’ll call to see if we can do something. We’re going to do everything we can to take care of you.” The pharmacy is open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Click here to leave a comment!

Long Island, New York (PRWEB) August 21, 2016 The Holiday Inn Westbury – Long Island is actively seeking to provide an airline with crew accommodations on a long term basis that fly in and out of JFK Airport, and their goal is to have a working relationship with one or several by late 2016 or early 2017. The Holiday Inn Westbury – Long Island has been host to several airlines over the last decade, and at one time has accommodated as many as three different airlines during the same time period. Some may wonder why a Long Island hotel located in the middle of Nassau County would seek to host an airline, or perhaps why an airline typically flying in and out of John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) would seek a hotel in Nassau County, Long Island; however, it's more common than one may think. For the most part, it has a lot to do with location, as cockpit and cabin crew members of airlines have down time between flights, especially those flying International flights, and for the most part, the last thing they want is to stay right by an airport. Noise levels are typically one of the main concerns and factors, as the crew members need to get their rest, but other factors include being able to venture out and see and explore various points of interest, which is also just very relaxing and enjoyable to many crews. In the case of the Holiday Inn Westbury, it happens to be located next to three large shopping malls, and is within walking distance to some of the more popular and large chain stores such as Walmart and Target. It's also in walking distance to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), which makes it extremely convenient for crew members to venture into Manhattan. The reason a hotel often seeks to host an airline crew is because it provides a hotel with long-term and secured revenue stream, and once a hotel becomes accustomed to the airline's schedule and arrival and departure patterns, it can set up its operations on a relatively predictable schedule. Other factors airlines often consider is whether or not a hotel is a full service property, or one of limited service. Typically airlines seek properties that can offer their crew members full amenities and services, which includes such services as a restaurant, business center, fitness room, swimming pool, outdoor areas such as courtyards, complimentary WiFi, laundry services, etc. The Holiday Inn Westbury's General Manager, Franklin Manchester stated, "There are many factors that both the hotel and the airline have to consider. About 50% of it revolves around income and expenses for all entities, but the other 50% has a lot to do with the accommodations, services and amenities a hotel property can offer, and what an airline's expectations are, which often includes an airline's executive officers, and specific members of their crew. I believe that any airline that is seeking accommodations away from an airport property should consider the Holiday Inn Westbury, as I know we have the amenities and services crews are seeking, and I honestly believe we are in the best location that one can be in, based upon my knowledge of the things they enjoy doing." Manchester added that both the Hotel and the various airlines go through what he referred to as a "Getting To Know You Process." Airlines don't just pick any hotel, and the Holiday Inn Westbury does not just accept any airline crew. He said, "There has to be a chemistry between the two," and he believes that has to do with what an airline's expectations are, and what the Hotel can deliver. He said, "Airlines want to be sure that their crew members will be well cared for, and the Hotel wants to ensure that the crew members will treat the Hotel as their home away from home." He noted that the experience the Hotel's team has in hosting crew accommodations for various airlines is something that all airlines should consider and recognize, because those that have not done so before may be faced with challenges that are difficult to overcome. The Holiday Inn Westbury has 152 rooms and suites, and is seeking to host a crew or crews of 30 – 35 rooms, which would leave approximately 120 rooms for the Hotel to offer other market segments such as their corporate, leisure and social travelers that they host on an individual and group basis. Their centralized location within Nassau County, and relatively short distance from New York's JFK Airport make them an ideal property for all guests visiting the area.

Thinkstock By Marguerita M. Cheng, CFP® | Blue Ocean Global Wealth September 2016 Contact Me With back-to-school shopping season in full swing, concerns on how to afford clothing and educational supplies increase. According to the National Retail Federation's latest Back-to-School Survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics, the average family with children in grades K-12 will spend about $674 on apparel, shoes, supplies and electronics. See Also: Sales Tax Holidays for Back-to-School Shoppers Here are some tips to save on this pricey time of year: 1. Purge the Closet Kids grow like weeds. A pair of shoes bought just a month ago might no longer fit. Rummage through clothing to see what fits and what is in good condition. Hang onto what you can to pass on to younger siblings, friends or goodwill. Everything else can be tossed or recycled for a craft project. Talk to your children to make decisions about what they could reuse. This encourages a youngster to think creatively about how to make things last and not waste. For supplies, look at what the child has from the previous school year. Do you have unused glue, paper and folders that are in good shape? Reuse them or, if there is another child in the household, give them the materials. Advertisement 2. Make a Budget Kids need limits, especially financial limits. Sit down with a child and discuss how much can be spent on clothing, supplies and miscellaneous items such as a laptop or high-tech gadget for class. Ask the child to come up with ways to stretch a buck or contribute to the fund. If the child is older and wants an expensive pair of shoes, offer to pay for half and have him or her come up with the rest. This helps a young person learn the value of a dollar and build financial planning skills for the future. An extra benefit: This gives them practice to earn that A in math. 3. Hit the Thrift Stores Kids today love a good "throwback" and enjoy finding cool retro items from goodwill stores or rummage sales. Perhaps as guardian or parent, you may have some items in storage that would appeal to the kids in the household. Grandpa's vintage jean jacket from 1960 might look awesome to a teen on the first day of school. 4. Check Online and on Social Media Surf the web with your child and see if stores such as Target, Walmart, Office Max, etc. are offering deals via their Twitter, Facebook or other social media accounts. Many stores post on upcoming sales targeting back-to-school shoppers. Also look up sites such as Amazon.com or Overstock.com for cheaper versions of higher-end items. Consider it virtual rummage sale shopping. Advertisement 5. Next Year, Start Early Back to school time is a rush of papers, book bags and clothing flying off the racks and shelves. Next year, think about starting shopping around March and buying certain items such as winter clothing ahead of time when they're on clearance. While everyone else is thinking spring, you will be a savvy shopper thinking about scoring a decent deal on boots for someone in the family.

The Global Ambassadors are students who spend time with international students to help them adjust to their new environment in the United States and at ULM. Global Ambassadors also help the International Office with campus and community events that relate to international students. Events, such as International Student Week and the annual international student banquet, are projects in which the Global Ambassadors will be involved. International students should feel welcomed on campus, and the Global Ambassadors were created to provide this welcoming atmosphere. Kelsey Bohl, the ULM International Advisor, saw the need to help international students break out of their comfort zones. “We saw that international students would stay in their own international bubble,” said Bohl.  “There really weren’t many campus activities planned for international students.” Global Ambassadors will work with international students in various ways. Aside from bridging the communication gap between American and international students, Bohl said another important goal is to provide safe and convient transportation. “Many of our international students don’t have vehicles,” said Bohl. “Some of them walk to Walmart and even tried to walk to the mall.” Bohl said utilizing students who have drivers licesnses and creating shifts to help international students run errands is one of the main reasons the  organization was created. The Global Ambassadors have American and international students in their ranks to help the new international students become comfortable with their new environment. Mattie Kinncanon, a junior marketing major and member of Global Ambassadors, said the program will not only benefit international students, but American students as well. “We’re learning about each other‘s cultures, what countries we came from and how everything works,” said Kinncanon. “I think this can actually unite us a whole lot more and make the university much stronger.” Students who wish to be a Global Ambassador must have multiple requirements including having completed at least two semesters at ULM, at least a 2.5 GPA and display professionalism when working with others. Students can benefit from volunteering as a Global Ambassador. Working with international students gives students the opportunity to develop interpersonal communication skills. The Global Ambassadors recognize the importance of working with international students to help improve communication skills. “It’s not just American students working with American students, it’s American students working with international students, and that’s something companies are looking for,” said Bohl. The Global Ambassadors have many events planned for this school year. Keep reading The Hawkeye for updates on upcoming events involving ULM’s international community.

 Asia rides Wall St. higher, buoyant crude nears six-week highs Reuters Aug. 18, 2016, 8:45 PM 70 facebook linkedin twitter email print Employees of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) work at the bourse in Tokyo, Thomson Reuters By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up on Friday as Wall Street benefited from buoyant crude oil prices and expectations U.S. borrowing costs will remain at stimulatory levels at least until year-end. Japan's Nikkei <.n225> added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi <.ks11> tacked on 0.2 percent. Australian shares <.axjo> added 0.1 percent.</.axjo></.ks11></.n225> MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.miapj0000pus> stood steady. The index was on track to rise 0.25 percent on the week, during which it reached a 1-year high.</.miapj0000pus> Global equities received a lift this week after the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting minutes showed that the U.S. central bank was in no hurry to hike interest rates. "Markets breathed a collective sigh of relief that minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting gave no clear indication the Fed is ready to raise interest rates," wrote Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets. "With central bank support, equities have been able to navigate thin summer trading and corporate reporting season with minimal volatility." U.S. stocks eked out gains on Thursday following upbeat earnings and forecasts from Wal-Mart and as higher oil lifted energy shares. In currencies, the dollar remained on the defensive after sliding to an 8-week low overnight in response to the Fed's minutes. New York Fed President William Dudley, who said earlier this week that the central bank could possibly hike rates in September, reinforced his hawkish message on Thursday but that did little to support the bruised dollar. The euro was little changed at $1.1344 after touching $1.1366 overnight, its highest since June 24. The common currency was headed to gain 1.7 percent this week. The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 100.160 yen but still within sight of an 8-week low of 99.550 hit on Tuesday. It was on track to lose 1.1 percent on the week. A weaker greenback tends to help commodities as it favors non-U.S. buyers of dollar-denominated products. In addition to a sagging dollar, crude oil has been boosted as the world's largest producers prepared to discuss a possible freeze in production levels. U.S. crude was up 0.2 percent at $48.33 a barrel, within close reach of $48.38, its highest since July 5 scaled overnight. U.S. crude was en route to rise 8.6 percent this week and Brent was poised to add 8.3 percent. Both benchmarks have risen more than 20 percent from a low in early August on news the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other key exporters may revive talks on freezing output levels when they meet in Algeria next month. The rapid rise puts oil, technically, in a bull market. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was flat at $4,8907 a ton after rising 0.7 percent overnight.

Thank you. Thank you, Mshila. Thank you (inaudible). Thank you very, very much. What are these big boards on the back of the wall here? Can you explain those to me? Mshila? Who can explain that to me, these boards? PARTICIPANT: No microphone. (Laughter.) SECRETARY KERRY: No microphone? Powerful voice, though. PARTICIPANT: I can explain one of the boards. SECRETARY KERRY: One of the boards. Is one of the boards yours? PARTICIPANT: This is ours. This is mine. It’s – the most colorful one. SECRETARY KERRY: So you guys – have you guys been in here working the whole – you’ve had a working session? PARTICIPANT: We’ve been here for three days. SECRETARY KERRY: Oh, you’ve been here for three days? (Laughter.) PARTICIPANT: Yeah. SECRETARY KERRY: Hell, I – what do you need me for then? No, but this is great. So you’ve been working through all your different – these are all the work sessions, right? STAFF: (Inaudible) who can explain it right here. STAFF: These are each of the regional leadership center graduating classes. SECRETARY KERRY: Okay. STAFF: The last eight out at the YALI Regional Leadership Center. SECRETARY KERRY: Oh, okay. STAFF: And when they graduate, they all put inspirational messages for each -- SECRETARY KERRY: Oh, everybody writes something down. STAFF: So there have been seven graduating classes, and this is today. They got together today to put this together for you, and after the question and answer we’ve left space for you to sign and participate in the event. SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I know what I’ll write. (Laughter.) What I’ll write is what I’m going to say to you. You guys are – “guys” is generic, by the way, ladies. It’s – it covers everybody. You really are the future, and I was very – how many of you were Mandela fellows? Can you raise your hands? A whole bunch of you, wow. How many of you were Mandela this year? Okay, and the others were 2014-2015? Well, congratulations to you for that, number one. And, number two, there is no question but that all of you taking part in Young African Leaders program, the initiative, are without any question – if I came back here 20 years from now, I’m going to look at success in whatever endeavor it is you undertake, and that’s because you got chosen for this program, and you got chosen for this program because you’ve already demonstrated initiative, leadership, creativity, entrepreneurship, skill, ambition – all these ingredients, which are so critical right now. We need better governance in country after country after country, including ours. We need better governance. We need people who cut through the red tape, people who aren’t prisoners of bureaucracy; people who are prepared to think about how you streamline and how you think in modern terms to harness technology, to deliver services better – I mean, there are all kinds of things that have to happen – and help stamp out corruption. And one of the best ways to stamp out corruption is with new technologies, because you have huge accountability in technology. There’s a trail: a financial trail, money trail, all these other kinds of things that help us be able to do what we need to do. So, whatever it is you want to do – and we need you in every single sector there is. We need you working with children, we need you educating people, we need you building a healthcare structure that really can deliver to people in modern health capacity, we need you on the environment, we need you on new energy, we need you on better and newer infrastructure. What kind of materials are we going to build houses with in the future? I mean, what are the new materials of building, of – I mean, all of – just wherever you look, I’m telling you there is a new possibility. One of the things I find most exciting about my job as I’ve traveled around the world is seeing this incredible pent-up energy that is waiting to release itself. And you feel it; I know you feel it, that’s why you’re in this program. So I don’t want to talk at you. I really want to hear from you. I’m willing to answer any questions about any topic, or if you have an idea and you just want to throw something out on the table that you think is worth discussing or my thinking about, taking home and making sure President Obama is aware you thought of it. (Laughter.) Whatever works for you, I’m at your disposal. And again, I apologize for being late. We just ran late. We had important meetings on South Sudan and on Somalia and AMISOM and al-Shabaab and how we’re going to continue the fight against them and so forth. So everything we were talking about that cost you time I think will inure to your benefit and help the region, so I hope you’ll forgive me for having kept you all waiting just a little bit. With that, let me throw it open to anybody who wants to ask a question, make a comment. Wow, a lot of people going at it. Yes, right here, in the back. Somebody’s going to get you a microphone right away here. STAFF: Microphone coming. SECRETARY KERRY: Can we get one in the back there? Thank you. QUESTION: Hello, my name is Beth (ph), and I live with the cerebral palsy. And one of the missions that I think people with cerebral palsy and other disabilities should take is to engage in the political field, but not only people with disabilities but also minorities. But in the recent past, helping us as how the racism is still in the U.S. despite the fact that there is a black president. I’m wondering whether getting into politics is the only way to do away with discrimination or whether it’s more about changing the systems to be more accommodating. SECRETARY KERRY: Well, it takes everything. That’s a great question. Obviously, President Obama, as the first black president of the United States of America, has had a profound impact on peoples’ consciousness and awareness of the challenges of racism. And it’s just a fact of timing – I don’t think it’s more than that – that it happens that during his time as President. I mean, we’ve had these cycles before in America where suddenly there was a spate of incidents that triggered demonstrations and a backlash to this perception of racism. I – when I was in college in the 1960’s, I became involved early on in the civil rights movement, along with most of our generation, who were one way or the other aware of it and involved in it. And I supported the efforts to try to send people down to the South to break the back of Jim Crow and create the voting registration drive that ultimately passed the Civil Rights Act of 1965. That was a period of intense racial frustration and confrontation in our country. Then I think probably 20 years later we had another round or so, and then another round. Now, recently we’ve had these incidents with the challenges of some of the shootings and arrests that have taken place in the context of police work and we have Black Lives Matter movement as a result of that. So it’s – the answer is that we’ve always made progress out of it. It’s hard, it’s very tough when it’s going on, and it’s very difficult for people to contain the passions that are elicited on any side of the issue. But in the end, America definitively, vastly, all across the board denounces discrimination. And we have always made progress coming out of the moments of confrontation where we get better, we get more sensitized, we take steps and measures that prevent something from happening. I still think we need major steps – I know President Obama agrees with this – to deal with the problem of our prisons. Our prisons are not what they ought to be and there are too many people in them and too many people for non-violent crimes. And we need a reform of our prison system. But these things – nothing happens overnight in its entirety. Every generation will face its challenge one way or the other to push the process forward. And you’re very courageous to be fighting your battle with cerebral palsy and still be thinking about these bigger issues, and I thank you for that very, very much. Change comes at the top, but it also comes from the bottom working its way up. And it has to come at it from both directions, or it’s even twice as hard to achieve. Thank you. Who else? Let me go over here. Yes, sir. QUESTION: Thank you. My name is Bilosak Hasan (ph). I come from Mandera and I’m a Mandela Washington Fellow, 2015, public management track. And my question basically is about – we know and we appreciate the effort U.S. Government is making in terms of countering violent extremism. But on the same note is yes, we are receiving as a country funding from the U.S. that is funding the security agencies who are handling the issues of extremism. My question is we have heard the allegation that Kenyan security agencies are involved in forced disappearances, they’re involved in extrajudicial killings. These are some of political grievances the extreme groups are using to recruit people. What is the take of the State Department about that concern? And secondly, just a short one, is that in 2009 in North Africa, President Obama promised the Arab world that before the end of his term, he would close down Guantanamo Bay. And up to date, that has not been done. When are we expecting that? SECRETARY KERRY: Well, his term’s not over yet. (Laughter.) Thank you for your questions. On the extrajudicial killings, I talked about that with President Kenyatta this morning and we had a very good and very frank and very constructive conversation about it. He is opposed and he has issued instructions and orders to his top people that this is not something that should occur. But he also pointed out, as others have to me, that some of the disappearances – and I’m not excusing anything here. If anybody has killed, that’s one too many, two too many, whatever. But some of the disappearances are people who are going to fight across the border in Somalia or somewhere and they get killed and they don’t come back, and then, quote, “they’ve disappeared.” It’s a good organizing tool to be able to argue that everybody who has disappeared has somehow been eliminated in an unacceptable way, but clearly, some people have been. We know that, and it’s wrong. It’s just wrong. And what we need to do, and we have committed to do, is work with the government to help do a number of things: to work with the intelligence community, to work with the police community, to make sure that procedures and mechanisms are in place that will guarantee a due process and a legal process that is instituted so that a detainee is not subject to being murdered but is going to be put into that process and held accountable for whatever it is they may or may not be doing. Now, it takes time to build that. It’s not going to happen overnight, but we agreed to have a task force come together, work on it, do a forum to try to talk about it, and he has agreed also to have our folks work with the inspector general of the police and with your intelligence chief and try to work at this. And we are committed to doing that. President Obama is deeply concerned about it, as am I, and I think anybody of conscience – that it is critical that there be a legal due process put in place and human rights be protected. So that’s very straightforward. On Guantanamo, the President is absolutely committed to try to close it. We have brought the number of prisoners who were there down from about 120; we’re getting down towards 50. We – and the 50 toughest ones to be able to move out. We’ve asked – many nations have been very helpful by taking one or two or three or five people or more and we have – the last group that gets us down to 50 is now approved for transfer, and we’re working on their transfer. In the end, we are going to have to make a hard decision about what we’re going to do with those 50 or so people who are still there. And it is inappropriate in our judgment for them to be held interminably without trial or without any basis. But if there is evidence of their having been engaged deeply in terrorism, then obviously we have to figure out how we’re going to manage it, but it shouldn’t be in the facility at Guantanamo. It has to be in a – some other kind of structure or modality, and we’re still working on it very, very intently. Okay? Who else? Back there. Yes, ma’am, in white. QUESTION: My name is Wanjiko Gishuru. I’m a medical doctor. I work with the ministry of health in the oncology department. I am an MWF fellow, 2016, in the public management track. So my question is around how – there’s a lot of drive to – for investments and multinationals investing in Africa, American and European companies coming in. And what I was wondering is – what I saw in America is there are a lot of controls – environmental controls and they are greatly enforced in terms of how multinationals do business, how they take care of their waste, how they prevent the harm to other people who are living around their factories. So I’m wondering, is there any efforts to concurrently run that – the drive for investment with a strengthening of the environmental policies in the countries that they’re investing in in terms of preventing exposure to toxic agents to the people who might be living around the areas that they’re investing in? SECRETARY KERRY: Yeah. Well, most American companies who invest abroad – not all but most – are public companies, but they’re all responsible to somebody. And in the case of those that are responsible to shareholders – the big companies that I have always asked this question of – they say they build to American standards. I know I visited companies in various countries and I have seen unbelievably clean and safe factories and people paid up at a higher standard and treated according to the standard because they are accountable to their shareholders and they don’t want to wind up with some lawsuit down the road or with some kind of problem or accusation. So I’m pretty proud of that. I think that by and large that happens. It doesn’t happen everywhere, not everybody. I’m not pretending that. But yes, there is a huge increasing awareness of environmental responsibility, and companies in America – this is after – particularly after the Paris agreement – we had major companies like Google and Walmart and General Electric and Coca-Cola and a whole bunch of companies in Paris urging the passage of the Paris agreement to deal with climate change. And these companies are helping to set the trend for corporate behavior with respect to the environment. Now, we encourage every country to try to accept those kinds of responsibilities, but in the end, countries have to make their decisions, and you all have to make it an issue that they care about. It has to become a voting issue, as we call it, so that people go to the polls and vote because they want clean water, they want clean air, they want forests that are kept intact, they want a preserve like you have right here, right near this capital. You have a beautiful preserve but it’s feeling the pressure, and I keep hearing about the pressure it’s feeling increasingly. So those are the kinds of things that you all can make a huge difference on, and that’s part of your leadership responsibility, frankly. Let me come over here to somebody. Yes, ma’am. QUESTION: Thank you. My name is Winny Obure. RLC Cohort 7 alumni, civic leadership. YALI is a very powerful program, and I hope that even after your elections in November, the incoming president will still support the program. And my question -- SECRETARY KERRY: I’m not allowed to get involved in politics, folks. (Laughter.) But I’m sure she will. (Laughter and applause.) QUESTION: She will? (Laughter.) SECRETARY KERRY: Who knows. No, I can’t – he will, she will, they will. (Laughter.) However it works. QUESTION: (Inaudible) I hope it’s going to be Hillary Clinton. Yeah. So my question is that during war, women suffer most – women and girls – because of gender-based violence and rape and so many other effects – psychological, mental, and physical. With the current violence in Burundi and South Sudan, I’m wondering – women are going through a lot of things right now, and what is the stand of the United States of America on the violence that is happening now in Burundi and South Sudan because -- SECRETARY KERRY: On the what? I’m sorry, on the -- QUESTION: On the violence that is happening now in Burundi and -- SECRETARY KERRY: In Burundi, yeah, okay. I’m happy to speak to that. Okay. QUESTION: -- in South Sudan. And also because our current president and his deputy were not convicted in The Hague, it shows really a very bad image out there. Like, you can just do anything and get away with it. SECRETARY KERRY: Yeah. Okay, let me make it clear at the outset I really was joking. (Laughter.) Because I don’t get involved in the thing, so – but it was too easy to pass up. (Laughter.) So it was fun. But whatever the American people decide, I’m confident that we’re going to move forward to uphold our international obligations. And I think we will have a Congress in the United States and a presidency that understands that as we preach rule of law, we will live by rule of law. With that said, let me say to you that Burundi has greatly challenged all of us. I’ve had personal conversations with a number of presidents in the region about them perhaps being emissaries and going to speak with the president, find out what we can do about it. We’ve tried in any number of ways to encourage dialogue and reduce the level of violence. It’s all come about, frankly, because President Nkurunziza decided that he was going to run for a third term and break the constitution, and therefore invite instability, which is very, very dangerous. So we’re now involved in discussions with others who are questioning the sort of limits of the constitution, and again, rule of law is critical. You have a constitution; it’s very, very important to live by it, and people who don’t will invite a backlash and a counter-reaction, and lack of confidence and perhaps even the violence that comes with it. We’re trying very, very hard to find a way to see that ultimately resolved. It’s still a challenge – not where we want it to be – and particularly made more difficult by the intransigence of the incumbent president to actually find a way forward that could restore confidence in the democracy and in the constitutional process. So there’s no easy solution, I’m afraid. Yes, sir. In back. MODERATOR: I believe this is the last question, sorry to say. QUESTION: Thank you so much. SECRETARY KERRY: Sorry, folks, they’ve scheduled me so tightly that we wind up -- QUESTION: My name is Collins Nakedi, 2015 fellow, the current East Africa chair for Mandela Washington Fellowship. I have a question: I wanted to know your take and the President’s take when it comes to a very key issue in regard to climate change, where in some part of the world it is actually career building, it’s political topic, but in some part of the world it’s actually affecting livelihood. It’s real. And we’re working with communities and we’re working with schools and children and women. And these are real issues. Climate change is affecting us. And so how is the President handling (inaudible) and where our – in political space it is – it’s just a topic where people engaging with us to build their careers, put their careers to other – and then secondly is, I mean, here we have our fellows who are running renewable energies companies and they’re doing really good things in regard to climate change; but when it comes to climate change funding, it’s those who are able to access the funds are just – are government agencies and – so far. So what are the steps when it comes to young organizations or companies who are starting grassroots solutions accessing those funds? Thank you. SECRETARY KERRY: Sure. How many of you actually are running a company of one kind or another? How many of you here? You’ve started your own efforts. Good for you. That’s extraordinary. Good for you. So let me answer that very quickly. On the climate change thing, the President has been terrific. President Obama has put in place a National Climate Action Plan. He has looked for every opportunity he can to try to change the way we treat our energy sources, or change the way or encourage a reduction in the burning of coal without technology attached to it, or to switch to new fuels, or any number of things. We’ve changed our automobile standards. We’ve changed our trucks’ standards for emissions. So the President has really leaned in hard to get things to happen in order to change the direction. And our hope is that the Paris agreement has sent a signal to the marketplace, where much more money is going to start moving in to alternative renewable and greater diversity and sustainable energy. We see that happening to a large degree. We think something like 17 to 30, 40, 50 trillion dollars may be spent over the next 40, 50 years on this energy transformation that is going to take place. Now, how do you access it? Well, some of the money was put together under the Paris agreement. There’s supposed to be $100 billion by the year 2020 to help countries with this transition. There’s the innovation project particular to solar, which Prime Minister Modi began with a bunch of other – with President Obama and others. We’re just trying to help people be able to access innovation funds. There are loads and loads of angel investors and venture capitalists and other entities where, if you have a good energy idea, believe me, there are people out in the marketplace looking for them. So there’s a fair amount of capital out there. There’s also money that we make available through the Millennium Challenge Corporation and other things for certain kinds of projects that people can apply for or get their countries to help apply for. And there’s some other individual funds under foundations, Pew Foundation, Gates Foundation, other people, different people who do certain things in the energy sector who are always receiving grant requests or investor requests and other things. So it’s really – I’m sure, right here even I’m confident, that you have some investors here in Kenya who are looking for energy opportunities or having new environmental ideas. I can tell you right now, if you give me your card, I’ll get people in my hometown of Boston whose livelihoods depend on finding great new ideas and investing in them and helping to make things work. So increasingly, there’s a lot of money out there chasing new ideas in the energy sector. Battery storage, for instance. You’ve got moguls – big, very wealthy people – who are putting billions of dollars of research into solving that problem, and then you’ve got other people in high school or college who are pursuing small little projects, but one of them may be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or something who are going to discover something that’s going to be different that takes off – and maybe you. But the trick is stay at it, keep knocking on the doors. And you’ve got to be willing to hear the word “no” probably not just 20 times, maybe a hundred. It happens a lot. But ultimately, you just – you break through. And that’s why you’re part of YALI, because you have the spirit and determination to go make that happen. All right? God bless you all. Thank you very, very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

The incumbent, Tricia Farley-Bouvier, while trying to act more qualified and mature than her opponent, Michael Bloomberg, was pretty condescending toward her 26-year-old challenger. Suggesting he get a job and come back later is kind of laughable. The current (retiring) state senator, Ben Downing, was but 24 years old when he ran for the seat he now occupies. Ben has done yeoman's work, and his youth has been an advantage, not a liability. As I listened further, I had a double-take moment as Ms. Farley-Bouvier suggested we need to get the Berkshire Innovation Center (BIC) started. We have $6 million in funding and bids totaling $9 million. Is starting a project we don't have all the money to complete responsible? Would you start a home renovation if you were 33 percent short on the known costs? And if you would, should we vote for you to manage our affairs? To claim the state will have to kick in the difference is not only naive, but irresponsible. The BIC, taken together with the Waterstone proposal for retail on a site we all believed would house industrial development, represents the failure of PEDA and our state rep. to move anything forward on that site. She takes credit for much in the community by telling us she is a "partner" with city government. Well if there is failure, was she a partner in that? One would think that if the BIC planning process was a quality job, the bids would have pretty much aligned with what PEDA sold to the state. That the bid was off by about 50 percent shows someone really didn't know what was going on and the contractors who bid saw the true costs as they put pencil to paper. Pittsfield taxpayers should not presume the state will come through with the additional funding. This shortfall may give the state a good reason to ask the question many of us ask: What does PEDA DO anyway? I say don't dig an inch into that polluted soil until 100 percent of the cost is in hand. If the BIC needs to be built at all, we need to wait. If Walmart is all this site can attract, and businesses in the nanotech industry are fully aware of the site, why have they not come here to build? The answer probably lies in the former use of the property on the one hand and the constant "what have we found now?" nature of the surprises which keep popping up on the other. The place is destined never to be re-used as promised. He may be young, but how could Bloomberg do any worse for our community than the folks who have brought us this hot mess?

Big Data Is Useless Without a Big Strategy By Bryan Yurcan August 22, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email 2 Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Fishing for Customers Starts Before the Ad Millennial Advice on How to Run a Bank Banks Finally Ready to Put Their Data to Use How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue All the best data analytics technology in the world isn't helpful if bankers don't know how to use it. Analytics tools that mine through data have become essential as banks look to give customers personalized, relevant communications and offers. But simply buying technology solutions isn't enough; banks need to have the right people and processes in place and know what they want the data to do for them, some experts say. "Banks of all sizes will need to use predictive analytics going forward," said Paul Schaus, president and chief executive of the consulting firm CCG Catalyst. "But there's so much data they have access to, though, so they first need to define what data they are looking for and why. Without a clear data strategy, you can get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of it. It's like trying to take a sip of water from a fire hose." What's clear is that banks are investing in analytics to enhance customer experience. According to a recent Capgemini report, while banks have traditionally invested in analytics solely for regulatory reporting, nearly a quarter of analytics initiatives were earmarked for customer experience initiatives in 2015. Additionally, chief information officers said data analytics trailed only security in where they expected to see increased spending this year, according to a 2015 report by SourceMedia Research. This means banks need to have a definite plan for what they want the data to do for them, such as trying to assist growth in a particular market or sell more of a particular financial product. Further, Schaus said, banks will need to employ more data scientists to help them use data more effectively. Most large banks are already doing this, but it is something smaller banks will need to do, too. For banks that don't have the budget for full-time data scientists, employing consultants or short-term analysts on a per-project basis will be necessary, Schaus said. The good news is that finding data scientists is becoming easier. Data science is an increasing focus of colleges and university course offerings, said Ambreesh Khanna, group vice president and general manager of Oracle Financial Services' Analytical Applications group. "All universities are offering courses in data science now," he said. "Lots of people are showing up in the market with data science degrees, which means the price of hiring a data scientist is dropping. It was very expensive five or six years ago; not so much now." Like Schaus, Khanna said banks must have a strategy around data, in particular to deepen the relationships with existing customers. "In mature markets like the U.S., [financial] products are largely commoditized and there aren't many unbanked," Khanna said. "So the focus on banks needs to be more and more on retention. That means appropriately identifying customers that are profitable and who might become profitable based on the data." The banks that are successful in the future will be those that are able to create lifelong customer relationships that are advisory based, said Emmett Cox, senior vice president of customer intelligence at BBVA Compass. "There's a huge, tremendous push from consumers to have relationship with their banks today," he said. "They want their banks to help them with the future and for different life stages plan." Cox comes to banking from the retail industry. He was previously a senior group manager of consumer insights and analytics at Walmart. Cox said banks have an advantage over retailers because consumers have a "deeper relationship" with their banks than any individual retailer. At Compass, which largely uses analytics tools from SAS, Cox said the bank triess to use data to offer helpful advisory services to customers rather than simply sending out product offers. "Consumers are constantly hit with a barrage of marketing messages all day," he said. "What we try and strive for is different: to offer help based on their life and financial situations. So things like asking if they are thinking of planning for retirement, or if they are prepared for certain household changes." Ultimately, data analytics tools combined with in-house expertise will enable banks to offer a much more personalized relationship with customers, Cox said. "It's not just about a technology, but understanding the information behind the technology and analyzing it," he said. "Today, consumers are fairly specific in what they want, so we're not simply trying to find a single 'aha' moment, but helping them throughout the relationship."

Tools are meaningless without a strategy. And without empowerment to carry out the organizational strategy. Recent research shows that businesses know what they want from their data investments -- enhanced customer relationships, improved operations and the ability to more effectively create new product and service offerings. However, many still struggle with operationalizing the insights. This is where empowerment could reap rewards. Peter Fretty, IDG blogger for SAS Big Data Forum Posted by pfretty | Friday, August 26 2016 at 9:46AM ET Great article about a trend that small banks can take advantage of. One solution that is not mentioned is purpose-built applications for digital marketing. These seem to make more sense. The morass of technology to integrate data, house it, and analyze it can be a major project smaller banks that may be tough to pull off and get value from. Starting with your digital banking platform is a great way to get started with a tool that is purpose-built for using the data collected by these tools.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global mouthwash market for 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers revenue generated from the retail outlets. The global mouthwash market is highly concentrated among few major players, including Chattem, Colgate-Palmolive, GlaxoSmithKline,Johnson Johnson, and Procter Gamble (P&G). With the rising competition, vendors are bringing in innovative products to meet changing consumer demands and to increase their customer base. "Vendors are targeting customers in the Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE with their portfolio of alcohol-free mouthwashes since alcohol consumption is prohibited in the existing culture. Also, people with dry mouth, diabetes, or systemic diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome, or those who are undergoing radiation therapies might benefit from using alcohol-free mouthwashes," says Poonam Saini, a lead analyst at Technavio, specializing in research on retail goods and services Technavio consumer and retail analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global mouthwash market: Increasing awareness of dental health and effective solution to fight germs Recommendations from doctors and approvals from dental associations Requirement-specific functionalities Increasing awareness of dental health and effective, easy, and quick solution to fight germs Even though the mouthwash category of oral care products is gaining popularity, it still remains as a secondary option with primary being toothbrushes and toothpaste or powders. However, companies are working toward increasing awareness on the importance of integrating mouthwashes as a part of primary oral care routine, i.e., before or after brushing and at different intervals during the day to maintain the pH of mouth and to fight germs that can cause different gum diseases. "Manufacturers of mouthwash market their offerings as an easy and quick solution to provide protection against germs. They have also increased their product offerings under different categories keeping the target customers in mind. For instance, Listerine, the largest mouthwash brand in the market, provides a solution for gum diseases, bad breath, teeth whitening, and cavity prevention," says Poonam. Recommendations from doctors and approvals from dental associations promoting market's growth To increase the adoption of mouthwashes among consumers, manufacturers are partnering with several dental associations to promote the advantages of using the product. For instance, the American Dental Association (ADA) has approved several mouthwash brands safe and effective for use. Some of them include ACT Anticavity Fluoride Rinse in cinnamon and mint flavor, CVS Antiseptic Mouth Rinse manufactured by CVS Pharmacy, and Equate Blue Mint Antiseptic Mouthrinse manufactured by Walmart. Similarly, Canadian Dental Association has recognized mouthwashes from Procter Gamble, Johnson Johnson, and 3M as safe for use. Approval from such dental associations encourages customers to invest in mouthwash products for their oral hygiene. Manufacturers are also taking this opportunity to market these products by adding such associations' approvals to the products' labels. Requirement-specific functionalities Close to about one in five people globally has halitosis, a medical term for bad breath. Using mouthwash daily before or after brushing can help eliminate the recurrence of halitosis. Although solely using mouthwash cannot cure the symptom and act as a replacement for brushing and flossing, it acts as a value addition to an individual's oral hygiene routine. People with diabetes are susceptible to gum inflammation and are at a higher risk of developing the advanced stage of gum disease, periodontitis. There are specific Listerine antiseptic mouthwashes that are meant specifically for this population, which can help prevent the occurrence of such diseases. Specific mouthwashes for people with oral cancer are also available nowadays. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, frequent use of gentle mouthwash may help in reducing discomfort and pain among people who have oral cancer. Biotene mouthwashes, which combine an enzyme-based protection ingredient with soothing mouth moisturizers, are available at drug stores.

Print   Email   Font Resize Rising Up to meet the needs of homeless neighbors Posted:   08/02/2016 08:54:33 AM MDT Updated:   08/02/2016 08:55:23 AM MDT Rising Up has been partnering up with many entities and agencies to serve the needs of the homeless, including the United Way of Morgan County. Executive Director Betsy Porter recently presented a $5,000 Venture Grant to Rising Up Executive Director Pam Herenandez. (Courtesy photo) Rising Up has been working on serving our homeless neighbors for the past 13 months. But they haven’t done it alone. Strategic partnerships, volunteers, community grants and individual giving have made the work that Rising Up does possible. “The community has pulled together in ways that we couldn’t have imagined when we began,” said Rising Up Executive Director Pam Hernandez. Thanks to a partnership with the United Methodist Church of Fort Morgan, Rising Up was able to open a warming center over the coldest months of the year last winter so that our homeless neighbors would have a place to come in from the dangerous cold. The Warming Center was very successful for its inaugural season. “We had a very high rate of success in finding temporary and permanent housing solutions for several of the clients that came to the Warming Center,” Hernandez noted. “However, one of the biggest services we were able to offer was connecting the dots to existing programs and agencies that could provide assistance finding housing, jobs and healthcare,” she continued. Rising Up staff and volunteers were able to develop relationships with homeless neighbors which helped alleviate fears, and opened a door for neighbors to trust Rising Up to lead them through processes of filling out paperwork, setting up appointments and being personally accountable for making progress in their lives. Advertisement As importantly, if not more, Rising Up provided hope, care and compassion; letting our homeless neighbors know that there is a place they can go, a place where people really do care about them. Continuing on the success of the Warming Center, Rising Up opened a Day Center on June 1. The Center is open Mondays and Wednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and offers a place for our homeless neighbors to get help with connecting the dots to existing agencies and services, job searching, house hunting, guidance, fellowship and a hot meal. Since June 1, Rising Up has shared 139 meals and served over 44 individuals seeking assistance. “The Day Center has been a great place for our neighbors to have consistent help with finding jobs, housing and accessing resources,” Hernandez noted. The ultimate goal, of course, is getting people to move forward and make progress in their lives. “We have been extremely successful in moving people forward, and since opening, we have been able to help 5 people get into permanent housing,” Hernandez noted. “It is very rewarding to see our neighbors move forward,” she continued. Rising Up’s volunteers make the organization successful. “We have logged over 4,200 hours of volunteer time since the beginning,” said Trish Moreno, Rising Up Co-founder and Secretary of the Board. “That shows tremendous support for what we are doing,” she continued. Volunteers have helped by bringing meals to share, staying at the shelter, serving meals, fundraising, and much more. There are several ways that people can help. “We are so thankful for all of the volunteer support we get,” Moreno noted, “there is no way we could do what we do without it.” Funding is always a challenge, but Rising Up is encouraged by the support they have received. Since receiving their 501(c)3 non-profit designation in February 2016, Rising Up received a grant from Wal-Mart for computer equipment for the Day Center. In addition, they received a $5,000 Venture Grant from United Way of Morgan County. Community support is very important when applying for grants, funders want to know that the community supports what you are doing. “We were so excited to receive the Venture Grant,” Hernandez stated. “Working with an agency like United Way helps to show that Rising Up is an organization that is supported across our community,” she continued. The organization is continuing its pursuit of grants and is always on the lookout for other funding options. To continue their work and see greater success, Rising Up needs the support of the greater community. Monetary support is, at this point, the most helpful, but they are also looking for potential ways in which they can partner to help our neighbors. Community-wide collaboration is a goal they have held onto since Rising Up began. “We know that only through collaboration have we been able to see the success we have over the last year,” noted Hernandez. Alone, Rising Up can only do so much. But together, as a community, we can accomplish even more. “The spirit of working together, is what will make our organization successful and our community a safe and healthy place to live for everyone,” stated Hernandez. If you are interested in volunteering or supporting Rising Up in its mission to help the homeless in our community, contact Pam at  970-370-8880.

While that’s worthy of a certain degree of admiration all its own, Walgreens announced today that it has rolled Android Pay support into its Balance Rewards program, meaning you can actually decrease the number of loyalty cards in your wallet for once. This news will likely be welcomed by Walgreens’ Balance Rewards members, as previously, the process of using Balance Rewards with Android Pay could be somewhat clunky. Now, once you’ve added your Balance Rewards card to Android Pay, you’ll just need to tap your phone twice at checkout: first to scan your loyalty card, and then a second time to pay. Walgreens is touting that it’s the first retailer to integrate its loyalty card into Android Pay, and though the mobile wallet has allowed users to add loyalty cards for quite some time, this is the first time that a retailer has added support for tap functionality at terminals. With that in mind, we can probably expect other companies to follow suit. That is, we can expect retailers to follow in Walgreen’s footsteps assuming they don’t already have mobile wallet apps of their own. The main offenders here are companies like Walmart and CVS, which have implemented their own mobile payment solutions without supporting the more universal wallets from Apple and Android. Whether or not Apple Pay and Android Pay integration will arrive at these retailers later on down the road remains to be seen, but for now, it seems safe to assume that won’t happen anytime soon.

Another big deal , and another payday most of Wall Street's biggest banks missed. The Pfizer -Medivation deal announced Monday, worth about $14 billion, is the latest sign that boutique banks are rising on Wall Street. In 2016, the smaller banks have been claiming a bigger portion of the profits that come from large-scale mergers and acquisitions, something they have been able to do after claiming some of the top dealmakers from big Wall Street banks. When Pfizer negotiated to buy the biopharmaceutical company, it was advised by boutiques Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners; its target, Medivation, was advised by JPMorgan Securities and Evercore . That is expected to generate a payday of up to $50 million for Pfizer's advisors, and nearly $60 million for the banks that advised Medivation, said Jeffrey Nassof, director at M&A consulting firm Freeman & Co. In the first half of 2016, boutique banks saw their wallet share of M&A (that is to say, what portion of revenue from deals that went to banks) rise to 17 percent, just shy of their all-time high on a percentage basis. It's a sign that companies engaging in M&A are less dependent on mega-banks than they once were. While boutiques — notably, Guggenheim and Centerview — have elbowed top Wall Street firms aside on health-care and pharmaceutical deals, smaller banks have also won the opportunity to work on large technology deals, including Wal-Mart 's buy of Jet.com , Microsoft 's $26.2 billion buy of LinkedIn and Verizon's deal to acquire Yahoo. There are still plenty of industries where Wall Street has maintained dominance, however, Nassof points out. They includes businesses like consumer retail and industrials, where boutique banks have done little in the way of taking more M&A business from top banks.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Harry Koujaian speaks about his daughter's struggle with a rare genetic disorder, dubbed childhood Alzheimer's, and the experimental treatment she is receiving at Rush University Medical Center. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Katie MettlerThe Washington Post Sanfilippo syndrome is the medical term, but its cruelty is captured in its nickname "childhood Alzheimer's." Privacy Policy   For two years, there was little the O'Neills could do but watch. They watched as the body of their daughter Eliza, then 4 years old, grew with each new day, and they watched as her mind slowly reversed. They watched her favorite things - like wrestling with her big brother - fade from interest. She stopped reciting the alphabet. She no longer whispered "I love you." The "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" tune she would sing aloud soon became just "star," then nothing at all. And at home, she would dash past her parents as if they weren't there, as if she saw right through them. Her personality, just budding, began to erase. This, they knew, was only the beginning. Doctors found Eliza's disease in 2013 when she was 3 1/2. Sanfilippo syndrome is the proper medical term, but its cruelty is best captured in its nickname, "childhood Alzheimer's." Like Eliza's case, children with the rare disease are often misdiagnosed at first because in its earliest stages, Sanfilippo looks like autism. That's what doctors first labeled Eliza's condition three years ago, but the girl's behavior made her parents, Cara and Glenn O'Neill, feel something more was wrong. An MRI revealed Eliza's enlarged head. Bones in her neck appeared shorter and flatter than they should be. The toddler was not getting better. They visited a geneticist, who ordered a special urine test. Next came the terminal diagnosis.   As a pediatrician, Cara had studied Sanfilippo in school. She knew it was devastating, knew what was to come in the years ahead. In the beginning, Eliza would stop talking and then stop walking. Eventually, she would no longer be able to feed herself. Her memory would vanish, and she would develop seizures and stop sleeping at night. There would be pain. She would suffer. And then Eliza would die in her teens. "At that point, the bottom falls out of your entire world," Cara told The Washington Post, "and you have to figure out where you're going to go from there." The O'Neills, who live in Columbia, S.C., turned to Google and within weeks found a researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio working on an experimental gene therapy to cure the disease. Proven successful in mice, the therapy involved injecting a virus - AAV9 - into the bloodstream. The virus would act as a vehicle, carrying inside it a gene Sanfilippo patients lack. Without that gene, sugar molecules build up in the body's cells and severely damage the brain. This treatment could reverse that process. The O'Neills had found some hope. But without more funding, the gene therapy would never make it to the clinical trial phase, and never help Eliza. The researcher had been working for 15 years, aided by funding from parents of other Sanfilippo kids. "They were the pioneers," Glenn said, and the pioneers needed a fresh financial push. With no guarantee that Eliza would be selected for the trial if it got approved, the O'Neills began furiously fundraising. They established the Cure Sanfilippo Foundation and organized 5K runs and parties, a dance-a-thon, silent auction and golf tournament. They sold bracelets and baked goods. But after nearly a year of asking for money, they had raised just $200,000, and Eliza was getting worse. They turned back to Google, and leaned on the power of video virality. Glenn asked strangers to help him create a clip that would tell their story, their cause and describe their plea. Photographer Benjamin Von Wong raised his hand. Within a year, they'd made about $2 million. It was enough to fund the clinical trial, and soon Eliza was selected to participate in a sort of pretrial study. For a year, doctors observed a group of 25 Sanfilippo children, analyzing the disease's progression so later they would be able to more accurately gauge treatment success. Even then, there was no guarantee Eliza would get the treatment, and her big brother, Beckham, started asking what was taking so long. "He keeps asking when we will get the medicine for her," Glenn told the Huffington Post in 2014. "He even asked at Christmas if Santa would bring it." And so in a fit of desperation, Cara and Glenn made a radical decision: they'd place their family of four in quarantine. Keeping themselves isolated from other humans would give Eliza's the body the best shot at qualifying for the trial. If she somehow contracted AAV9 - the virus vehicle for her missing gene - Eliza's body would develop an immunity, and the therapy would be useless. Cara quit her job and Glenn worked from home. They home-schooled Beckham, and Eliza's therapists came to the house wearing masks and gloves. They thought they'd be isolated for just 100 days. Instead, it lasted 726. For two years, Cara's mother dropped groceries by their home twice a week, wiping everything down before bringing it in the house. They held at-home dance parties and taught Eliza to hold her breath in their backyard Walmart pool. Beckham video-chatted with his classmates from school. Cara and Glenn kept fundraising. Their family hiked on unpopulated trails and explored open fields. They went to the beach, just ones without other people. The kids avoided public playgrounds.   "We were the crazy isolated family," Glenn joked. "We never thought we'd been doing it that long... it's a crazy thing what we did." They were, as Glenn puts it, "like E.T." "Of course," he added, "it worked out very well." In the spring of 2016, the doctors finally called, and on May 10, Eliza, now 6, became the first child in the world to receive this gene therapy treatment. When she left the hospital after a few days of recovery, the O'Neills broke their 2-year quarantine. Then, Glenn and Cara said, they immediately started thinking about the other Sanfilippo parents. "These other parents should be feeling what we're feeling," Glenn said. "Every moment there is something working against you. Every moment they're fading away from you, every moment, before your eyes."   They've set a new goal: to raise $4 million more dollars for research. And they've once again tapped the Internet for support. This week, the O'Neills and Von Wong, the photographer, released another video with Eliza's recent treatment update. But the rest focuses on raising more money for other children, and building support for the parents who, unlike Glen and Cara, cannot slip into hiding for two years, awaiting a cure. "We cheer our children on for every little milestone, every gain," Cara says in the video. "How does a parent respond when it's going in the other direction?" For now, the O'Neills emphasize that their future is uncertain. The have no idea if the gene therapy is working. Medically, that will take time. But as parents, they already see a calmness in Eliza, a spark that had gone missing. They treasure her occasional hugs, and revel in each new word she speaks. On Thursday, as they turned to leave the house, they prompted her with a question: "Eliza, what do we say?" Her response, simple but strong: "Open door." --- Videos: https://youtu.be/G0IY8qG7J-I http://wapo.st/2b5PH7x Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 81°

Jon Marino | @JonMarino Monday, 22 Aug 2016 | 10:50 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES Another big deal, and another payday most of Wall Street's biggest banks missed. The Pfizer-Medivation deal announced Monday, worth about $14 billion, is the latest sign that boutique banks are rising on Wall Street. In 2016, the smaller banks have been claiming a bigger portion of the profits that come from large-scale mergers and acquisitions, something they have been able to do after claiming some of the top dealmakers from big Wall Street banks. When Pfizer negotiated to buy the biopharmaceutical company, it was advised by boutiques Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners; its target, Medivation, was advised by JPMorgan Securities and Evercore. That is expected to generate a payday of up to $50 million for Pfizer's advisors, and nearly $60 million for the banks that advised Medivation, said Jeffrey Nassof, director at M&A consulting firm Freeman & Co. Ben Welsh | Design Pics | Getty Images In the first half of 2016, boutique banks saw their wallet share of M&A (that is to say, what portion of revenue from deals that went to banks) rise to 17 percent, just shy of their all-time high on a percentage basis. It's a sign that companies engaging in M&A are less dependent on mega-banks than they once were. While boutiques — notably, Guggenheim and Centerview — have elbowed top Wall Street firms aside on health-care and pharmaceutical deals, smaller banks have also won the opportunity to work on large technology deals, including Wal-Mart's buy of Jet.com, Microsoft's $26.2 billion buy of LinkedIn and Verizon's deal to acquire Yahoo. There are still plenty of industries where Wall Street has maintained dominance, however, Nassof points out. They includes businesses like consumer retail and industrials, where boutique banks have done little in the way of taking more M&A business from top banks.

Home Back to School Article Back to School: Local school gardens help kids School garden teaches students part one School garden teaches students part one By Stephanie Buffamonte |  Posted: Mon 7:50 AM, Aug 22, 2016 HATLEY, Wis. (WSAW) There are several school gardens in the Marathon County area and it could be helping your kids more than you think. The National Gardening Association found that school gardens will help students eat more fruits and vegetables and improve their social skills by working with others. The Hatley Elementary School and Community Garden has expanded over past couple of years and more recently the school received a grant to purchase a green house helping kids like Caleb Breyton even more. "I like to pull weeds and I like to pick the plants," said Caleb Breyton in the garden. The fifth grader works hard as he gets his knees and hands dirty while picking green beans and other veggies. Caleb not only likes to garden, but enjoys eating the growing plants too. Since being in the garden he says he has eaten more veggies and found a new produce he loves, which is kale. The 4th graders start by growing seeds in the green house and then in June students will move what they've grown into the garden. All grades K-5 will work with the produce. It's something Fischer says helps them learn even more than staying in the classroom. "When you can plant something from a seed and you can see it from little plant to a producing plant that is more valuable than a picture in a textbook showing you the life cycle of a bean plant," said Fischer. The teacher believes that especially in a state with many agriculture workers, it's important to teach the students where their food comes from. "I want kids to know that tomatoes don't come from a little container in Walmart," Fischer said. "I think it comes from my passion to get kids actively involved in their education and when you can do that you make those learning experiences more memorable and more valuable for them," she continues. According to the National Gardening Association, school gardens help reduce childhood obesity and give students more confidence. They've also found that kids who garden have a greater appreciation for nature and agriculture as adults. "I think that every elementary school should have a garden," exclaimed Caleb. The school grows things from kale, to peppers, to strawberries, apple trees, squash, green beans pumpkins and more. Over the summer, community members have been taking care of the garden.

But the international tourists haven’t come to Yulin, once a coal, oil and natural gas boom town in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, and in their absence she has forgotten her English. “Sure, there’s lots of talk about developing our tourism industry but walking the talk is a different matter,” said Gao, who’s been a tour guide there for 10 years. “There’s an immediate return on investment if you invest in energy. But you may need to wait 10, or even 100 years, if you want to see a return on investment in tourism.” The experience of Yulin carries a lesson for other Chinese cities trying to re-tool their economies – establishing a vibrant services sector takes time, and in the meantime you cannot afford to abandon your industrial strengths. As its economy matures, China is trying to steer away from the export and investment-led model that fuelled its dizzy rise towards a more sustainable base built on domestic consumption. Yulin has been a poster child for that attempt to move up the value chain, singled out by the national media as an example of economic transformation worthy of study by other regions. Aside from gushing news articles about Yulin’s success in diversifying its economy away from natural resources, the provincial government is notable for releasing a 27-step plan in 2013 about how this economic transformation should occur. But since then things have not gone precisely to plan. A slowing economy has dragged down industries such as tourism and renewable energy, handpicked by the provincial government as new drivers of Yulin’s economy. “At the peak of the coal boom we were already thinking about how to transform our economy, move it up the value chain, but it hasn’t been the success we’d hoped it would be,” said Zhang Changqing, Yulin investment bureau’s party secretary. Growth lessons The goal was for Yulin to shift into services, move away from an economy dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOE) towards one with private businesses at its core, and produce higher value coal, oil and natural gas. Services made up just over 30 percent of Yulin’s economy in 2015, and the government has set an ambitious target of raising that to nearly 40 percent by 2020. With a population of 3.4 million, Yulin is a smaller city by Chinese standards, and its fluctuating fortunes highlight the challenges facing similar lower-tier centres. Yulin’s published GDP growth rate plummeted to 4.3 percent in 2015, from a high of 23 percent in 2008, although, as at the national level, there are some who doubt that official figures reflect the true state of the real economy. “It’s meaningless to look at the official statistics as an indicator of growth,” a government official at the local bureau of commerce told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the press. A retired official from a state owned enterprise (SOE) was also sceptical about GDP data. “I look at tax revenue instead, it’s been dropping rapidly these past few years,” he said. “The problem is there aren’t enough people here for us to rely on the services industry to spur economic growth.” In the first half of 2016, Yulin’s total fiscal revenue dropped 21.2 percent from the previous year, according to official statistics, and investment in services plummeted 36.6 percent in 2015. Can’t all have terracotta army Exacerbating Yulin’s difficulties, nearby cities that were similarly reliant on traditional industries, such as Ordos and Baotou in Inner Mongolia, are trying to attract comparable kinds of investment projects and develop industries such as tourism. “It’s hard for us to develop a tourism industry. We don’t have the same history as Xi’an,” the retired SOE official said, referring to the ancient home of China’s terracotta warriors. “You come to Yulin maybe once in your life and you’re finished seeing the whole city in half a day.” The government is also trying to boost consumption, both through e-commerce and bricks and mortar stores, but locals have been hesitant to spend in the downturn, with Walmart Stores Inc pulling out of Yulin early last year, Zhang from the investment bureau told Reuters. Meanwhile real estate projects, a favourite growth stimulant for local governments in China, have dried up, meaning fewer jobs for migrant worker and less demand for raw materials. Sprinkled around the city are empty or half-completed apartment buildings, a far cry from the days locals planted their excess cash made from the resources boom in property. “Most of these projects are from years ago and many of them stopped mid-way, when the developers and construction companies ran out of money,” said the official at the commerce bureau. Blessed with abundant sunshine and wind, the government is hoping to develop the region’s renewables industry, but demand for energy and electricity has shrunk as the property sector has tanked. To be sure, Yulin hasn’t abandoned the industries that fuelled its economic boom – indeed, some of its efforts to make its oil and coal companies more competitive are starting to pay off. The Yulin Coal Trade Center has shifted from logistics and quality control to providing clients with a full supply chain, from procurement to financing options, according to Luo Wenjie, from the company’s operations department. Their clients are scattered around the country, and mostly find the company on popular online platforms such as WeChat. “Unlike smaller companies that may swap out Yulin’s high-quality coal for lower-quality coal, we’re big enough to provide clients with peace of mind that we won’t do that,” said Luo, adding that the company has 100,000 employees. “Our competitive advantage is that we aren’t going to run off with our client’s money.” (Reuters) Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags China development Great Wall growth services Previous Bertoglio set to sign for APOEL Next Uncoordinated efforts muddy the waters Related Articles UK budget pledges money for smart cars November 23, 2016 Pilots at Germany’s Lufthansa launch 2-day strike November 23, 2016 Thomas Cook on track for 2017 after “encouraging” summer November 23, 2016 EU proposes U.S.-style rules to give failing firms second chance November 23, 2016 Rolls-Royce named best company in Britain to work for November 23, 2016 Morrisons revives Safeway brand with wholesale plan November 22, 2016 Britain sells a further 1 percent of Lloyds shares November 22, 2016 New yuan fix ‘encourages capital flight’ from China November 22, 2016 Panama needs new anti-corruption laws November 22, 2016 Check Also Oil prices hit highest since October on hopes of OPEC-led output cut Oil prices rose to their highest level since late October on Tuesday as the market priced in an expected output cut led by producer cartel OPEC, but analysts warned that a failure to agree a cut could lead to a deepening supply glut by early 2017.

Mobile first. Mobile only… Whatever approach you take to your m-commerce project, one thing is certain: if you want it to deliver the results you’re expecting, context should be front and centre of your design. Across all industries, mobile traffic is eating into PC web traffic in a big way, even in economies which have a large installed base of consumer PCs. But ecommerce sites aren’t seeing mobile web visitors, particularly those who use smartphones, converting to mobile web shoppers with the same success as PC shoppers. “It is fair to conclude that conversions would be higher if the m-commerce experience on the web was better designed with smartphone users in mind,” writes Andy Favell in ClickZ Intelligence’s new report, ‘The DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site Part 2: The 12 Pillars of Mobile Design’. “M-commerce sites that crack this will sell more.” One of the most consistent mistakes made with mobile site design is a failure to take into account the differing circumstances, needs and intentions of smartphone users; in other words, their unique context. The difference between smartphone and PC users isn’t just a smaller screen size – it’s a whole new set of variables. Google’s guidelines for its search quality evaluators emphasise the importance of taking context into account for mobile users. So how does context impact the way you cater for m-commerce customers, and what can you do to tailor your design to their needs? Why design for context? A customer using a PC to access your website is likely to be doing so in a limited number of settings. Most often they’ll be at home or at work, possibly in an internet café, or using a laptop somewhere like an airport or coffee shop. Even if you imagine that they might be out and about, there are still relatively few plausible scenarios in which they could be logging in, and they don’t differ from one another that wildly. But with mobile, and particularly smartphones, the number of possible scenarios suddenly increases exponentially. Your customer could be travelling, working, moving around the house and multi-tasking, walking to your location, walking to a rival’s location… In each case, the context drastically alters the way in which this customer might be approaching and interacting with your site. Andy Favell explained in a recent article for ClickZ, ‘When will responsive websites respond to user context?’ why cross-platform homogeneity – taking the same approach to design across differing platforms – doesn’t make sense. “Cross platform homogeneity forgets two massive things: The requirements of the desktop and mobile user are often different The requirements of the same mobile user (more importantly) vary depending on whether they are at home, at work, commuting, on route to the location, on site, in a rival’s location and so on. And that’s just the start of it. Now consider: How context varies by time of day, day of week, time of year. What about the trigger that causes the visit to the site e.g. something on TV, snapping QR code in a print ad, tapping through from an email, social media etc.?” Taking a user’s context into account is considered to be a no-brainer for targeted advertising, and the conversions it delivers prove that targeting works. Facebook has achieved great success from advertising thanks to its ability to fine-tune its adverts according to who a user is and what they might be doing. Image by Bablu bit, available via CC BY-SA 4.0 Google is increasingly using the data it collects on users and their search histories to contextualise the results it provides them and make them more relevant. And programmatic advertising is currently making waves with the promise of being able to determine at high speed who to target based on digital cues received about the user. The online world is increasingly trending towards high levels of personalisation as our ability to gather and interpret data about users improves. And for m-commerce, this also seems like the logical next step. As Favell writes in ‘The DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site Part 2’: “If adtech has the ability to target ads on mobile websites at visitors, surely m-commerce sites should use the same types of technology and listen to the same digital signals in order to prioritise the most appropriate content, offers and services, and make the user journey as easy and frictionless as possible?” How to design for context in m-commerce In part two of the ‘DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site’ report, Andy Favell gives a series of tips on how to personalise your mobile offering to users whilst not over-targeting to the point that users find it irritating. He advises: Prioritising content, rather than selecting which content to show to the exclusion of others Suggesting entries in search or form fields, such as postcode or ZIP code in a search box If your website defaults to departments based on previous behaviour – for example, ASOS will open the men’s or women’s store homepage based on what the user has browsed previously – make sure it is clear how to return to the general homepage Facilitating the buying process with options to save for later, save a favourite address, save a favourite meal Encouraging a trust relationship by explaining how personalisation works and how it benefits the user Making it easy to opt in or out of personalisation The epitome of a personalised m-commerce experience is a site that adapts fully to user context, based on signals such as who a person is, where they are, what device they are using, what they like and what they are doing. While there are very few examples of websites who are doing this well at the moment, the concept isn’t too far-fetched. A handful of retailers in the US have already invested in developing native apps which deliver a different experience to the user when they are away from a store versus when they are in-store. The most innovative of these will switch to “Store mode” as the shopper enters a store location, activated by geotechnologies like bluetooth beacons. A number of US retailers have personalised their m-commerce offerings with a dedicated “store mode”, which includes features such as scanning products to check pricing and availability | Image by Intel Free Press, available via CC BY-SA 2.0 DMI’s 2015 ‘In-store Mobile Experiences’ report sets out why a properly personalised in-store mobile experience can be so beneficial to retailers. According to the report, 82% of high-income shoppers said that an improved mobile in-store experience would make the shopping experience better. And 74% of young people aged 18-35 said that they would spend more money at a store that provided an improved in-store mobile experience. Standout performers in the US – which included Walgreens, Home Depot, Nordstrom, Walmart, Target and American Eagle among other brands – offered in-store features such as scanning products to unlock information on pricing and product availability; integrating loyalty programs into the in-store experience; in-store mapping; product recommendations; and reserving a dressing room. These are all location-dependent personalisation features, but there are other mobile signals you can use to divine information about your user’s context and tailor your m-commerce site to them in subtle ways. In ‘The DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site Part 2’, Ronan Cremin, CTO of DeviceAtlas, writes: “Apart from the really obvious one (location) there are other possibilities like detecting if a user is literally on the move or not (accelerometer), is the battery low etc. etc. One important point about all of these contextual cues is to use them as hints rather than hard deciding factors because the cost of getting things wrong based on an incorrect assumption is high. It’s really dangerous to make assumptions about what a user wants, so I think that the best thing to do is make prioritization decisions over ordering of features rather than adding/removing features entirely.” Subtle cues about a user’s state like battery level can be used to personalise your m-commerce site | Image by Martin Abegglen, available via CC BY-SA 2.0 As both Favell and Cremin point out, it’s important not to go overboard with personalisation, as too much can risk alienating the user, especially if wrong assumptions are made. But don’t let this put you off trying altogether. Context is everything in mobile design, and even small adjustments can go a long way towards creating a frictionless user experience and improving your m-commerce sales and conversions.

Consumer Confidential With David Lazarus BUSINESS Consumer Confidential Newsletter California Inc.: Apple reality show features coding for dollars Programmer Getty Images Friday is the deadline if you want to be part of Apple’s first crack at original programming, a reality series called "Planet of the Apps." Friday is the deadline if you want to be part of Apple’s first crack at original programming, a reality series called "Planet of the Apps." (Getty Images) David Lazarus Welcome to California Inc., the weekly newsletter of the L.A. Times Business Section. I’m Business columnist David Lazarus, and here’s a rundown of upcoming stories this week and the highlights of last week. Some good news Friday on the home front: California again put up solid employment numbers in July, adding 36,400 new positions. In fact, payrolls in the state are expanding faster than in the U.S. overall. California has added 374,600 jobs in the past 12 months, posting a growth rate of 2.3%. Payrolls nationwide grew just 1.7% since July 2015. However, the state’s unemployment rate went up for the second month in a row, rising a tenth of a point to 5.5% in July. LOOKING AHEAD Brexit: Leaders of three of Europe’s largest nations will meet Monday to discuss easing Britain out of the European Union without shaking up the continent’s economy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet with French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Ventotene Island off Italy’s west coast. Britain voted in June to leave the EU, but the exact timetable for doing so has remained cloudy. Some have suggested that Britain might not leave the EU until well into next year, but other leaders have pressed for more immediate action.

VW hearing: Attorneys for Volkswagen return to court Thursday in San Francisco to report to U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer on plans to fix roughly 90,000 3-liter-engine diesel cars, which had software that allowed the vehicles to cheat on air-pollution tests. The 3-liter vehicles are not included in a $14.7-billion settlement, announced previously, to repair or buy back roughly 475,000 polluting Volkswagen vehicles with 2-liter diesel engines. VW in April took an $18.2-billion charge to cover the cost of the global scandal, which includes a total of 11 million vehicles worldwide. Economy watch: Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will speak Friday at a central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Her first public comments in two months will be followed closely by analysts and investors for hints about whether the Fed will raise a key interest rate in September. Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting in July showed members were divided on whether an increase was needed soon. A key barometer, being released Friday, will be the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ release of the estimated second-quarter gross domestic product. Winter heat: The California Energy Commission will hold a workshop in Diamond Bar on Friday to discuss possible winter power and natural gas shortages because of the temporary shutdown of the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility. Aliso Canyon’s 114 wells are going through a series of tests following a massive leak that forced the evacuation of some 8,000 households from the nearby Porter Ranch neighborhood. The workshop begins at 10 a.m. at the South Coast Air Quality Management District offices and is open to the public. Be a star: Friday is the deadline to apply if you want to be part of Apple’s first crack at original programming — a reality series called "Planet of the Apps.” The unscripted show, co-produced by Propagate, is to be filmed in Los Angeles later this year. It will feature developers competing for more than $10 million in venture capital funding, guidance from experts in the tech community and a place for their app in the featured section of Apple’s App Store. The show will be available on Apple’s own platforms, including iTunes and Apple TV. THE AGENDA Monday’s Business section buckles up and checks out the looming revolution in personal transportation. It’s visible in everything from ride-hailing services to cars that steer themselves and change lanes automatically with a flick of the turn signal. “The world is changing,” one expert says. “In the next few years, there will be a significant injection of technology” in new cars. Newcomers like Google, Apple and Uber want into the game, and “the incumbents of the past are trying to change as much as they can.” STORY LINES Here are some of the other stories that ran in the Times Business section in recent days that we’re continuing to follow: Viacom control: Media mogul Sumner Redstone’s boardroom war for control of Viacom has ended in victory with the resignation of Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and the installation of new members to the company’s board. Viacom’s board elected Thomas Dooley as CEO. Dooley, 59, is expected to serve at least through the end of September and could stay on longer. Dauman exits with a $72-million severance package. New stock exchange: At mutual fund giant Capital Group, investment managers buy stocks when they’re underpriced and sell when they’re overpriced. But over the past few years, the L.A. firm has been looking toward something else to help boost returns: a new stock exchange that disrupts the advantages of high-speed traders. Founder Brad Katsuyama and his IEX exchange were lauded in the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys” by author Michael Lewis. Driverless cars: Uber says it will deploy a fleet of driverless Fords and Volvos on the streets of Pittsburgh within weeks. Meanwhile, the two car companies separately announced they will manufacture completely autonomous cars by 2021. In Uber’s case, an employee will be at the wheel in case things go wrong. But, eventually, Uber intends to render human drivers unnecessary. Gawker purchase: Univision Holdings is buying Gawker Media, the online media and blog network in bankruptcy for $135 million. The leading Spanish-language TV broadcaster is assembling a portfolio of online properties and apparently has eyes for several of Gawker’s separately branded sites, including the tech-oriented Gizmodo. It plans to shut down the main Gawker.com site, which has been damaged by the Hulk Hogan sex-tape lawsuit and judgment that drove it into bankruptcy. Olympic payday: Now that the Summer Olympics is over, the clock starts ticking for medal winners hoping to cash in on their glory. Other than established multimillionaire stars such as U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympians have a brief window of opportunity — most likely a few weeks — to sign potentially lucrative endorsement deals once the Games end. Most medalists won’t get rich from their efforts.  WHAT WE’RE READING And some recent stories from other publications that caught our eye: Rough retail: Bloomberg looks at the dark side of Wal-Mart. “More than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings and multiple stabbings, shootings and murders, have occurred at the nation’s 4,500 Walmarts this year, or about one a day.” Haters be hatin’: Twitter, says BuzzFeed, “has not just tolerated abuse and hate speech, it’s virtually been optimized to accommodate it” (Warning: The site uses explicit language). So what is Twitter doing to change that perception? As one former employee says, “What was once lauded as a virtue has now become the company’s Achilles’ heel.” Future food: Fast Company explores ways that so-called machine learning will change what we eat. “Still, some environmental advocates are skeptical, warning that tools primarily designed to boost crop yields and farm profits won’t automatically undo all the environmental harm wrought by large-scale, industrial farming.” Camper Mode: OK, this is just plain weird: Tesla “Camper Mode.” As Bloomberg tells it, “A community of drivers is devoted to the practice. There are forums and YouTube videos that praise the virtues of Tesla camping and explore the hacks you’ll need to make it work.” Cheaper chicken? A burning question from Priceonomics: After a hard day’s work, rotisserie chickens look so cheap and easy, but are they really a bargain? “In most stores, the cooked chickens aren’t any cheaper. They just look cheaper. The per-chicken price favors the deli counter, but the per-pound price favors the refrigerator case.” SPARE CHANGE For a good time, do a YouTube search for “chicken dance.” Beyonce does it (sort of). So does Zooey Deschanel. But this offering from the Lawrence Welk Show sets a high-water mark for poultry-related terpsichorean fun. For the latest money news, go to www.latimes.com/business.

The Daily Texan does not guarantee their accuracy. Published on August 22, 2016 at 2:09 am Last update on August 22, 2016 at 2:24 am By Lisette Oler It’s that time again. The summer sun is fading and the lecture hall lights are flickering to life. Classes begin Aug. 24 and that can be a bit daunting for incoming freshman. The University of Texas is a big place with new classes, new people and of course, lots of chaos. Here are some tips from returning Longhorns to get through the first week and the first semester. 1. The University has a free app where you can access an interactive map with searchable building abbreviations, traffic conditions, eateries and libraries. The app is available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Market for Android. Search “University of Texas at Austin.” 2. If you’re not rooming on campus, you’ll likely be commuting to class. Parking on or near campus can be a hassle, but the buses are free for faculty and students with a valid ID. This will help you get to class and around Austin on the cheap. Bus numbers 1, 3, 5, 801 and 803 are your best friends. They take you up and down campus, stopping at the University Co-op, Texas Union, Kerbey Lane Cafe and at the corner of Guadalupe and Fourth streets if you need to go downtown. 3. Shower shoes are a must in the dorms. Imagine the number of people who have lived there. Actually, don’t — you may regret it. 4. Buy a caddy for your toiletries. That way you won’t end up with an armful of soap in case you run into Matthew McConaughey. 5. Mattress pads are a must and memory foam pads are best. Splurging on this may save you from terrible back pain in the future.  6. When your parents want to give you that extra $20, ask for it in rolls of quarters. You’ll have clean laundry for a month, which means you can focus on studying for differential calculus instead. 7. If you have a car, make sure you have a “go bag” in the back seat complete with a fresh change of clothes, hygiene kit and phone charger. You never know when you will need them.  8. Finding new friends is highly encouraged for all freshman, but absolutely necessary for out-of-state students. Even the small connections on campus will build your support network in Texas. 9. Soft serve ice cream after every meal will only serve to soften your midsection. To avoid gaining the infamous “Freshman 15,” check out Gregory Gym on those stressful days instead. 10. Jester City Limits is conveniently located on Jester’s first floor, but you’ll get more bang for your buck if you eat at J2, the buffet on the second floor. But the Krispy Kreme donuts in JCL are worth it. 11. The little markets in the dorms are nice but expensive. Stock up on canned soups and veggies from H-E-B or Wal-Mart and you’ll be everybody’s best friend when you still have Dine-in Dollars at the end of the semester. 12. If you don’t have a car, make sure to check out the UT Rideshare Facebook page  for carpool opportunities. Chances are, there is someone else traveling from Austin to San Antonio on a Friday night.  During your first semester, don’t stress out. It is easy to get overwhelmed, so take breaks from studying and extracurriculars. Go visit the Turtle Pond. Know that every student has similar fears — and we’ve all survived. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and do yourself a favor — don’t put your student ID on a lanyard. View the discussion thread.

AMZN stock has performed respectably this year, but more could be in store Source: via Amazon By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Aug 19, 2016, 6:00 am EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World Don’t Worry About Facebook Inc’s (FB) Awful Month 3 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for REAL Virtual Reality Profits Recent Posts: Why Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Needs to Catch Up Sooner Than Later 3 Worries About Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Committing Corporate Hari-Kari View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the pioneers of the Internet Age, with Jeff Bezos launching the ecommerce operator in July 1994. Yet the company has continued to act like a scrappy startup. It certainly helps that Bezos has continued to focus on innovation and customer service. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr And yes, shareholders have made a bundle. Consider that — since the IPO — Amazon stock has gained a whopping 44,000%! But when it comes to investing, the future is what counts. So is there still opportunity here for Amazon stock? Well, I think so. Granted, Amazon stock has not necessarily had a standout performance for the year so far. The gain is about 13%. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of But this may change soon. For example, Bernstein’s Carlos Kirjner just put out a research note indicating that there will be an acceleration in the top-line in the coming months (this is based on the latest quarterly results from AMZN). For Q4, the call is for revenues to hit $45.1 billion, which would be a 26% year-over-year gain. As should be no surprise, a key driver is likely to be the continued traction in the cloud business. Kirjner predicts sizzling 51% increase in revenues to $3.6 billion. Oh, and he has maintained his aggressive price target on AMZN stock at about $1,000, which implies about 31% potential upside for investors. Wider Bullishness on Amazon Stock But Kirjner is certainly not the only bull. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have a $915 price target on Amazon stock and both Susquehanna and Deutsche Bank have it at $900. Then again, the company has multiple levers to propel growth. Besides the cloud business, there are other segments like streaming video and music, as well as devices like the Kindle, Echo and Dash buttons. All these allow for enormous market opportunities that can move the needle for AMZN stock. Although, the bulk of the business for the company is still ecommerce. And the good news is that there is lots of room for growth. According to research from Forrester, the market in the U.S. is forecasted to jump from $334 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. This represents the tidal shift in consumer habits that has adversely impacted many brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M). OK, the big knock against Amazon stock is the valuation, which is definitely far from cheap. Keep in mind that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 74X! However, it is important to note that Wall Street will generally pay a premium for sustained top-line growth, especially when a company is a dominant player in markets that have tremendous long-term potential. After all, this is what happened with companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which rewarded shareholders for many years. The GEO Group Inc (GEO), Corrections Corp of America (CXW) Crumble on DoJ Crackdown Now with Amazon stock, there should also be near-term momentum because of the upcoming holiday season. According to a recent report from eMarketer, about 42.7% of internet users are already thinking about having the ecommerce giant as the primary source for holiday shopping (the main reason is the “ease of use” of the site and app). In other words, the dog days of August may be a good point to pick up some AMZN stock. Tom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook.

High Point police said three businesses were recently robbed: The Pop Shoppe at 3512 E. MLK Drive, the Speedway at 3010 N. Main St. and the Pop Shoppe at 2406 Hickswood Road. Police said they believe the crimes are committed by the same person, who is armed with a rifle. Surveillance photos of the suspect have been provided. The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with any information can call Crime Stoppers of High Point at (336) 889-4000 or text “Cashtips” to 274637. Callers can remain anonymous and may be eligible for a reward. WGHP/Fox 8 U.S., sheriff settle rights suit GRAHAM — The U.S. Justice Department is dropping efforts to appeal a ruling clearing a North Carolina sheriff of civil-rights allegations that he ordered deputies to target Hispanic residents for enforcement. The U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond dismissed the government’s appeal after government attorneys said Thursday that they’ve reached a settlement with Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson. The Justice Department’s decision comes a year after a federal judge in Winston-Salem ruled the government failed to prove Johnson’s deputies routinely targeted Latinos for traffic stops. Johnson says his officers have always served in a respectful, professional way and it bothered him to think they had been labeled as villains and racists. The Republican was elected to a new four-year term last November. The Associated Press City to expand red-light camera use FAYETTEVILLE — One of the few North Carolina cities using red-light cameras plans to expand their use after local schools collected $1.3 million in 13 months from thousands of ticketed drivers. The Fayetteville Observer reported that city officials plan to install the cameras at five new intersections by early next year. The cameras capture offenders and generate tickets costing $100 each. Nearly 17,000 citations were issued since the first batch went up in July 2015. Almost 11,000 have been paid. Two-thirds of the fine goes to the Cumberland County school system and the rest to the vendor running the program. Fayetteville dismantled its red-light program in 2007 following North Carolina court rulings that made them too costly. The state Legislature reauthorized the cameras for Fayetteville in 2014. The Associated Press Man charged in deaths from car crash RALEIGH — Raleigh police have charged a man with the death of three people riding inside his vehicle when it crashed and flipped. Police say two passengers were ejected from the vehicle early Sunday. Officers say 22-year-old Jaciel Espino-Montes of Goldsboro was charged with three counts of aggravated felony death by motor vehicle, three counts of aggravated serious injury by motor vehicle and driving while impaired. A police report says Espino-Montes’s vehicle was carrying six passengers in their teens and 20s when it slammed into a light pole and overturned. The Associated Press Officer justified in shooting, DA says LENOIR — A Lenoir police officer was justified in fatally shooting an armed man at a northwest North Carolina Walmart store, the local district attorney said. District Attorney David Learner reached his conclusion after reviewing videos captured by the store and police body cameras, multiple media organizations reported. Learner said preliminary toxicology tests found amphetamines and methamphetamine in the bloodstream of 32-year-old Carl Marcus Nivens, who was killed. The Lenoir resident was a suspect in a vehicle break-in outside the store and was shooting at police Sgt. Brett Ingram, who returned fire and killed Nivens, Learner said. Ingram and another police officer who had been on the scene of Tuesday’s shooting had been placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice. They returned to duty on Friday. “The officers’ decisions to use deadly force were fully justified and undoubtedly avoided injury to the officers and innocent bystanders,” Learner said in a statement Friday. “Nivens was actively shooting at Sgt. Ingram who returned fire, killing the suspect.” Both Nivens and Ingram were white. Two others who were with Nivens were arrested on outstanding warrants for unrelated charges. The Associated Press Rabies confirmed in Cary fox attack CARY — Cary animal control officials have confirmed the town’s first case of rabies this year after a fox attacked a jogger and two dogs. Officials told local media outlets that the attack happened at around 7 a.m. Wednesday. Police euthanized the animal and took it to the State Laboratory of Public Health, where testing confirmed the fox was rabid. The jogger is receiving medical care, and both dogs had current rabies vaccinations and received booster shots. The town’s last reported case of rabies was in October 2014.

But the international tourists haven't come to Yulin, once a coal, oil and natural gas boom town in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, and in their absence she has forgotten her English. "Sure, there's lots of talk about developing our tourism industry but walking the talk is a different matter," said Gao, who's been a tour guide there for 10 years. "There's an immediate return on investment if you invest in energy. But you may need to wait 10, or even 100 years, if you want to see a return on investment in tourism." The experience of Yulin carries a lesson for other Chinese cities trying to re-tool their economies – establishing a vibrant services sector takes time, and in the meantime you cannot afford to abandon your industrial strengths. As its economy matures, China is trying to steer away from the export and investment-led model that fuelled its dizzy rise towards a more sustainable base built on domestic consumption. Yulin has been a poster child for that attempt to move up the value chain, singled out by the national media as an example of economic transformation worthy of study by other regions. Aside from gushing news articles about Yulin's success in diversifying its economy away from natural resources, the provincial government is notable for releasing a 27-step plan in 2013 about how this economic transformation should occur. But since then things have not gone precisely to plan. A slowing economy has dragged down industries such as tourism and renewable energy, handpicked by the provincial government as new drivers of Yulin's economy. "At the peak of the coal boom we were already thinking about how to transform our economy, move it up the value chain, but it hasn't been the success we'd hoped it would be," said Zhang Changqing, Yulin investment bureau's party secretary. GROWTH LESSONS The goal was for Yulin to shift into services, move away from an economy dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOE) towards one with private businesses at its core, and produce higher value coal, oil and natural gas. Services made up just over 30 percent of Yulin's economy in 2015, and the government has set an ambitious target of raising that to nearly 40 percent by 2020. With a population of 3.4 million, Yulin is a smaller city by Chinese standards, and its fluctuating fortunes highlight the challenges facing similar lower-tier centres. Yulin's published GDP growth rate plummeted to 4.3 percent in 2015, from a high of 23 percent in 2008, although, as at the national level, there are some who doubt that official figures reflect the true state of the real economy. "It's meaningless to look at the official statistics as an indicator of growth," a government official at the local bureau of commerce told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the press. A retired official from a state owned enterprise (SOE) was also sceptical about GDP data. "I look at tax revenue instead, it's been dropping rapidly these past few years," he said. "The problem is there aren't enough people here for us to rely on the services industry to spur economic growth." In the first half of 2016, Yulin's total fiscal revenue dropped 21.2 percent from the previous year, according to official statistics, and investment in services plummeted 36.6 percent in 2015. CAN'T ALL HAVE A TERRACOTTA ARMY Exacerbating Yulin's difficulties, nearby cities that were similarly reliant on traditional industries, such as Ordos and Baotou in Inner Mongolia, are trying to attract comparable kinds of investment projects and develop industries such as tourism. "It's hard for us to develop a tourism industry. We don't have the same history as Xi'an," the retired SOE official said, referring to the ancient home of China's terracotta warriors. "You come to Yulin maybe once in your life and you're finished seeing the whole city in half a day." The government is also trying to boost consumption, both through e-commerce and bricks and mortar stores, but locals have been hesitant to spend in the downturn, with Walmart Stores Inc pulling out of Yulin early last year, Zhang from the investment bureau told Reuters. Meanwhile real estate projects, a favourite growth stimulant for local governments in China, have dried up, meaning fewer jobs for migrant worker and less demand for raw materials. Sprinkled around the city are empty or half-completed apartment buildings, a far cry from the days locals planted their excess cash made from the resources boom in property. "Most of these projects are from years ago and many of them stopped mid-way, when the developers and construction companies ran out of money," said the official at the commerce bureau. Blessed with abundant sunshine and wind, the government is hoping to develop the region's renewables industry, but demand for energy and electricity has shrunk as the property sector has tanked. To be sure, Yulin hasn't abandoned the industries that fuelled its economic boom - indeed, some of its efforts to make its oil and coal companies more competitive are starting to pay off. The Yulin Coal Trade Center has shifted from logistics and quality control to providing clients with a full supply chain, from procurement to financing options, according to Luo Wenjie, from the company's operations department. Their clients are scattered around the country, and mostly find the company on popular online platforms such as WeChat. "Unlike smaller companies that may swap out Yulin's high-quality coal for lower-quality coal, we're big enough to provide clients with peace of mind that we won't do that," said Luo, adding that the company has 100,000 employees. "Our competitive advantage is that we aren't going to run off with our client's money."

Their clients are scattered around the country and mostly find the company on popular online platforms such as WeChat. “Unlike smaller companies that may swap out Yulin’s high-quality coal for lower-quality coal, we’re big enough to provide clients with peace of mind that we won’t do that,” said Luo, adding that the company has 100,000 employees. “Our competitive advantage is that we aren’t going to run off with our client’s money.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Japan earthquake sparks contamination risk after tsunami waves strike near Fukushima nuclear plant 2 Trump vows to withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership ‘on day one’ 3 Hong Kong debt levels double in a decade as property boom takes its toll 4 One million flats needed to meet growing demand in Hong Kong by 2046 5 Malaysia’s economy just got a US$33 billion boost from China... so why the unhappiness?

The Company has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Fashion Apparels LLC which will employ the school leavers on successful completion of a six-month course at its factory in the Salalah Free Zone. The garments firm has opened a new $20 million production unit on the site and plans to export around 12 million clothing items a year. At its full capacity by 2018, it aims to employ 500  Omanis. Under the terms of the MoU, PDO is committed to sponsor the women through the tailoring training programme, which will include sewing machine techniques and English communication and computer skills. It is the latest move by the Company to extend its job creation efforts beyond the oil and gas industry to other sectors of the economy. PDO External Affairs and Communication Manager Suleiman al Mantheri signed the agreement with Fashion Apparels LLC Executive Director Harinder B S Lamba at an official ceremony at PDO’s Knowledge World centre in Al Qurum. PDO Managing Director Raoul Restucci said: “PDO is pleased to partner with Fashion Apparels LLC on this vocational training programme which will provide hundreds of Omani women with jobs in the clothing industry. “PDO is dedicated to supporting the Sultanate’s economy by expanding work opportunities for both Omani men and women so that they can create a sustainable future for themselves. This means we will be supporting more vocational training for nationals beyond our natural boundaries in the oil and gas industry to aid economic development and diversification in other sectors.” The women will work on items for leading brands such as Walmart, Macy’s, J C Penney. Fashion Apparels LLC Human Resources Manager Hassan Khashoub said: “We are committed to developing young Omanis who have the right attitude to work. As the required skills are not available in Salalah, we are designing our own training programme in collaboration with PDO. “The programme will have a combination of technical and soft skills aimed at grooming youngsters to take up management position in the due course of time.” The tailoring course, which will include technical and on-the-job training, is being run by the Arabian Training Institute in Salalah. It is being run as part of PDO’s National Objectives programme, which was launched in 2011 and has so far created more than 20,000 employment, redeployment and training opportunities for jobseekers with its oil and gas contracting community. Al Mantheri said: “We are now also committed to diversifying our support outside our core business to help the development and employment of Omanis in other economic sectors. For example, as well as partnering with Fashion Apparels LLC, PDO also recently signed an agreement with Oman Air to support the training of the jobseekers in a variety of cabin and ground staff positions, along with the upskilling of a further 100 existing Oman Air customer service staff. “This approach underlines the central role that PDO plays across the nation’s entire economy and we will do all we can to support His Majesty’s aim of greater Omanisation and extending the professional capacity and capability of Omanis.” PDO has also championed female economic empowerment through its Banat Oman project which has so far trained 300 women from low-income backgrounds in traditional Omani crafts and skills so they can earn a living and set up their own businesses.

But the international tourists haven't come to Yulin, once a coal, oil and natural gas boom town in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, and in their absence she has forgotten her English. "Sure, there's lots of talk about developing our tourism industry but walking the talk is a different matter," said Gao, who's been a tour guide there for 10 years. "There's an immediate return on investment if you invest in energy. But you may need to wait 10, or even 100 years, if you want to see a return on investment in tourism." The experience of Yulin carries a lesson for other Chinese cities trying to re-tool their economies – establishing a vibrant services sector takes time, and in the meantime you cannot afford to abandon your industrial strengths. As its economy matures, China is trying to steer away from the export and investment-led model that fuelled its dizzy rise towards a more sustainable base built on domestic consumption. Yulin has been a poster child for that attempt to move up the value chain, singled out by the national media as an example of economic transformation worthy of study by other regions. Aside from gushing news articles about Yulin's success in diversifying its economy away from natural resources, the provincial government is notable for releasing a 27-step plan in 2013 about how this economic transformation should occur. But since then things have not gone precisely to plan. A slowing economy has dragged down industries such as tourism and renewable energy, handpicked by the provincial government as new drivers of Yulin's economy. "At the peak of the coal boom we were already thinking about how to transform our economy, move it up the value chain, but it hasn't been the success we'd hoped it would be," said Zhang Changqing, Yulin investment bureau's party secretary. GROWTH LESSONS The goal was for Yulin to shift into services, move away from an economy dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOE) towards one with private businesses at its core, and produce higher value coal, oil and natural gas. Services made up just over 30 percent of Yulin's economy in 2015, and the government has set an ambitious target of raising that to nearly 40 percent by 2020. With a population of 3.4 million, Yulin is a smaller city by Chinese standards, and its fluctuating fortunes highlight the challenges facing similar lower-tier centres. Yulin's published GDP growth rate plummeted to 4.3 percent in 2015, from a high of 23 percent in 2008, although, as at the national level, there are some who doubt that official figures reflect the true state of the real economy. "It's meaningless to look at the official statistics as an indicator of growth," a government official at the local bureau of commerce told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the press. A retired official from a state owned enterprise (SOE) was also sceptical about GDP data. "I look at tax revenue instead, it's been dropping rapidly these past few years," he said. "The problem is there aren't enough people here for us to rely on the services industry to spur economic growth." In the first half of 2016, Yulin's total fiscal revenue dropped 21.2 percent from the previous year, according to official statistics, and investment in services plummeted 36.6 percent in 2015. CAN'T ALL HAVE A TERRACOTTA ARMY Exacerbating Yulin's difficulties, nearby cities that were similarly reliant on traditional industries, such as Ordos and Baotou in Inner Mongolia, are trying to attract comparable kinds of investment projects and develop industries such as tourism. "It's hard for us to develop a tourism industry. We don't have the same history as Xi'an," the retired SOE official said, referring to the ancient home of China's terracotta warriors. "You come to Yulin maybe once in your life and you're finished seeing the whole city in half a day." The government is also trying to boost consumption, both through e-commerce and bricks and mortar stores, but locals have been hesitant to spend in the downturn, with Walmart Stores Inc pulling out of Yulin early last year, Zhang from the investment bureau told Reuters. Meanwhile real estate projects, a favourite growth stimulant for local governments in China, have dried up, meaning fewer jobs for migrant worker and less demand for raw materials. Sprinkled around the city are empty or half-completed apartment buildings, a far cry from the days locals planted their excess cash made from the resources boom in property. "Most of these projects are from years ago and many of them stopped mid-way, when the developers and construction companies ran out of money," said the official at the commerce bureau. Blessed with abundant sunshine and wind, the government is hoping to develop the region's renewables industry, but demand for energy and electricity has shrunk as the property sector has tanked. To be sure, Yulin hasn't abandoned the industries that fuelled its economic boom - indeed, some of its efforts to make its oil and coal companies more competitive are starting to pay off. The Yulin Coal Trade Center has shifted from logistics and quality control to providing clients with a full supply chain, from procurement to financing options, according to Luo Wenjie, from the company's operations department.

The grant, provided by the Michigan Center for Rural Health through its Rural Automated External Defibrillator Grant Program, will allow the devices to be located at the Ironwood Public Safety Department building, Ontonagon County Sheriff’s Department, Watersmeet Fire and Rescue, Ironwood Area Schools, Ironwood Walmart and the ABR Ski Trails. “The goal of program is to place AEDs in the most appropriate and useful locations as determined by the local Medical Control Authority and the local EMS systems,” a center representative said. “By strategically placing AEDs, notifying members of the community of the placement of the AEDs, and training appropriate personnel in CPR and on the AEDs, the objective is to save lives in rural area.” Last year 113 AEDs were purchased and distributed to more than 100 locations in the last two years. A total of 46 rural communities have participated in the grant’s first two cycles. GOMCA provides oversight and direction to the EMS agencies in the two counties, as well as Iron County, Wis.

She just received a retirement check from the people who manage the retirement for her old job, and now she doesn't know how to cash it. The check is around 1800 dollars and made out to my mom. My mom finally received a retirement check, which is basically just a check for 1800 dollars. She was operating under the assumption that she could just sign the check over to me and that I (her son) could deposit it into my bank account where we could use it to help pay some of her bills. She recalls doing this with other checks, but honestly that was a long time ago and the checks were much smaller. I called my bank and asked about this and they were extremely unhelpful. I was told that if I wanted to cash that check, I would have to bring my mom down to the local bank branch to sign paperwork stating that she understood that she was signing the money over to someone else. When I told them she was homebound and had difficulty leaving her house they basically got even more unhelpful, basically telling me to get her to the bank that originated the check. That is definitely not a possibility, because that isn't even a local bank. I got the distinct impression that either they didn't want to deal with this situation, or, even though they looked up my account info and could see I've been banking with them for 15 years, they were suspicious that I was trying to do something funny. I've basically ruled my bank out as an option, and the other places around that I've been suggested to try are the local Walmart, which will cash checks, and another local to my area store that is well known for check cashing, with a fee structure similar to Walmart. I've also got the usual assortment of check cashing joints but was treating them as a last resort. Does anyone have any recommendations for what I should do in this situation? Should I try again with my bank or can I do this elsewhere? Thanks in advance. posted by FireballForever to Work & Money (12 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite   Some banks allow you to open a checking account entirely online - I think that Chase is one of them, for instance. Try calling them and ask about how to open the account without going to a branch, then have her open the account online, then you can deposit the check into it (through their mobile app, if you use Chase), have her write out a check to you, and close the account. Annoying, and you might have to wait a week or so for the check to clear into her account, but it should work. posted by the agents of KAOS at 1:08 PM on August 21 [6 favorites] Seconding the suggestion from the agents of KAOS. Schwab does this as well and the limit for deposits via the mobile app is $10000. posted by asphericalcow at 1:12 PM on August 21 I did this earlier this year. On the top of the endorsement section in the back, I wrote "Pay to the Order of:" then added the full third party name on the second line, and signed the third line. It went through fine to the third party. Banks involved were PNC and Wells Fargo. I would call the originating bank and ask if they allow third-party endorsements of their checks. Or call your bank again and see if you get someone else on the phone, someone who has some empathy... Otherwise, I would do what the agents of KAOS suggested and open a free online account for her, deposit the check, and then send you the money for bills. Might be worthwhile for her to have an account in her name anyway, and there are online only accounts that don't have annual fees. posted by gemmy at 1:13 PM on August 21 [2 favorites] Yes, open a no fees account for her in her name-there is a good chance future situations will arise that can be handled more simply if she has one. posted by koahiatamadl at 1:24 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] I (very recently) used to be a teller, and the bank I worked for was fairly liberal with these kinds of things. With third-party checks over $1000 the general requirement was: "Pay to the order of _____", both parties' endorsements, and we either needed to have a very trusting relationship with the customer and/or needed to verify the original payees endorsement. Usually this can be handled with a clear photo or a photocopy of their ID card that has a genuine endorsement. These checks also needed to be approved by a supervisor or lead teller in order to get a second verification and make sure the account holder's account won't get charged-off if the check charges back. and to see if there's any suspicious history with the account holder's account. Simple as pie. Good luck. posted by omgkinky at 1:38 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] Another option is to open a new account with a local credit union. Have it opened as a joint account with you and her as co-owners. She is not receiving any disability payments or social security payments? The SSA requires that the recipient have a bank account for direct deposit, unless she elects to have the funds deposited to a debit card for her use. posted by yclipse at 2:32 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] She could open an online-only bank account. Ally (formerly GMAC) doesn't have physical branches at all. You don't need to talk to a human to open an account, even. You can deposit checks by mail and online. Online is super easy and the limit is $50,000/day, so you're well under. From there, she can do what she wants with the money. You can order checks from Ally online, which would let her write checks to whoever. posted by BungaDunga at 2:34 PM on August 21 [2 favorites] You don't mention whether your mom has an ATM card, or if her bank has an ATM. If the answer is 2 yeses there, you can deposit the check that way for her after she's endorsed it. If the bank has a smart-phone app you could use that to deposit the check. This would require some set-up steps, of course, on your phone (or hers, although this sounds unlikely) and maybe some set-up for her account. but it's really easy. This would be easier, I think, than creating a whole new account for her. posted by qurlyjoe at 5:15 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] A joint account with online access is probably a good idea, especially if you're helping her out with other expenses on an on-going basis. Was this check a one-time deal, or will it be a regular thing (monthly?) If it's ongoing, can you set up direct deposit (into, hopefully, an account that you share with your Mother)? You should also consider asking your mother to give you Power of Attorney. There are free forms, but you'll probably need to have it notarized, and you'd be better off working with an elder care lawyer in your jurisdiction (the Bar association in your state may be able to hook you up with pro/low bono resources, if cost is a concern). POA's are an easy route to financial abuse, so it's not a decision that your mother should take lightly, but if she is disabled and homebound it might be best for someone she trusts to be able to act in her stead. If you had POA from your mother, your bank would probably be quite a bit more receptive to you cashing her checks. posted by sparklemotion at 8:21 AM on August 22 Is your mother on disability or receiving state benefits? If so I would ABSOLUTELY NOT open an account in her name, as that would require her SSN and any income she receives could affect her benefits. I was a bank teller many moons ago. We saw third party endorsed checks all the time. Worst case scenario is there is a 3- 5- or 10-day hold on the funds depending on the bank, but otherwise it shouldn't be a problem. If this is going to be a regular disbursement (monthly) she will probably need a bank account as she will need to report taxes so if she gets benefits they are going to be affected anyway. If the disbursement is less regular perhaps you can work with the company to find a different way to pay out. posted by vignettist at 9:16 AM on August 22 [1 favorite] This check is a one time only thing. I called my local branch and they told me that I would have to bring her there (even after I told them she was homebound) to sign paperwork stating that she understood she was signing the check over. I called the corporate office above the branch and they said that they would do it. So it sounds to me like the branch is adding extra steps to cover themselves against fraud. I called the corporate office after talking to my local branch and they told me to just have her sign it on the back and I would also sign it and deposit it, the way I always understood that it was done. posted by FireballForever at 11:06 AM on August 22 [2 favorites] Traveling Notaries are a thing and they exist for precisely this situation. If the bank continues to give you a problem after you've followed their steps that you outlined in your update, tell them to give you the paper and you will have it notarized. I can't believe they didn't suggest it to you. posted by vignettist at 8:42 PM on August 22 [1 favorite] « Older My kippot are the best, believe me   |   Washing machine drain pump help!

Follow us on Home Oman Region World Opinion Sports Business Features Videos About us Archives Blogs PDO supports training of 300 Omani women August 21, 2016 Muscat -  The Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is supporting the training of 300 Omani women job seekers. The company has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Fashion Apparels which will employ the school leavers on successful completion of a six-month course at its factory in the Salalah Free Zone, stated a press release. The garments firm has opened a new US$20mn production unit on the site and plans to export around 12mn goods a year. At its full capacity by 2018, it aims to employ 500 Omanis. Under the terms of the pact, PDO is committed to sponsor the women through the tailoring training programme, which will include teaching them sewing machine techniques, English communication and computer skills. The company aims to extend its job creation efforts beyond the oil and gas industry to other sectors of the economy. The agreement was signed by Suleiman al Mantheri, external affairs and communications manager, PDO and Harinder B S Lamba, executive director, Fashion Apparels at PDO’s Knowledge World centre in Qurm. Raoul Restucci, managing director, PDO said, “PDO is pleased to partner with Fashion Apparels on this vocational training programme which will provide hundreds of Omani women with jobs in the clothing industry. “PDO is dedicated to supporting the sultanate’s economy by expanding work opportunities for both Omani men and women so that they can create a sustainable future for themselves. “This means we will be supporting more vocational training for nationals beyond our natural boundaries in the oil and gas industry to aid economic development and diversification in other sectors.” They will work on items for leading brands such as Walmart, Macy’s and J C Penney. Hassan Khashoub, human resources manager, Fashion Apparels said, “We are committed to developing young Omanis who have the right attitude to work. As the required skills are not available in Salalah, we are designing our own training programme in collaboration with PDO. The programme will have a combination of technical and soft skills aimed at grooming youngsters to take up management position in the due course of time.” The tailoring course, which will include technical and on-the-job training, is being run by the Arabian Training Institute in Salalah. Mantheri said, “We are now also committed to diversifying our support outside our core business to help the development and employment of Omanis in other economic sectors. “Besides partnering with Fashion Apparels, PDO also recently signed an agreement with Oman Air to support the training of job seekers in a variety of cabin and ground staff positions, along with the upskilling of a further 100 existing Oman Air customer service staff. This approach underlines the central role that PDO plays to support His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said’s aim of greater Omanisation and extending professional capacity and capability of Omanis.” Similar content PDO supports training of 300 Omani women PDO partners with Salalah Port on social investment project Daleel Petroleum enters into three-year partnership with Outward Bound Oman Daleel, Injaz sign MoU for Sharikati programme ITA signs pacts to train for job seekers, entrepreneurs Contact us  Privacy policy Sitemap  RSS feeds  To subscribe Ⓒ​  2014   Apex Press and Publishing ,  PO Box 2616,  Ruwi 112, Muscat,  Sultanate of Oman   Telephone: +968-24799388, Fax : 24787573

Banana Wave, from Fresh Start Beverage Co., is sold in Whole Foods Markets in Florida. kobe4l 1 of 4 i By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Company name: Fresh Start Beverage Co. (Banana Wave) Headquarters: Palm Beach Gardens Concept: Fresh Start Beverage Co. is creating a new category in the milk-alternative industry. “We are the first company to actually make milk from a universally loved fruit — bananas. We call it Banana Wave,” said H.E. Neter Kush Ben Alkebulan, co-founder and chief beverage officer. Story: Entrepreneurial passion can take you to places you never thought you’d go. For these co-founders, getting their business off the ground meant living in a car for a while — and success still means donning a banana suit. Fresh Start Beverage Co.’s mission is to make humanity healthy, happy and strong one refrigerator at a time, said Neter, who founded the Palm Beach County startup along with his fiancée Trendolyn Hopkins and his mother Claudette Patron. Their first product is a nondairy beverage called Banana Wave banana milk. Neter says the delicious superfood originated in Africa’s Nile Valley around 3000 B.C., and has been his family’s specialty for generations. While attending Florida Memorial University and working three jobs in 2012, he and Hopkins went to the Nova Southeastern University library every night to learn everything they could about business plans and running a company. Saving money by living in a car for six months, they went all-in working on their business full time in 2014; their first break came that year, when they won the People’s Choice award in Florida Atlantic University’s business plan competition and a couple of others. The winnings, plus about $727,300 raised from family, friends and angel investors after the contests, allowed them to spend most of 2014 and 2015 testing out the product in farmers markets across South Florida, including ones run by Whole Foods, gathering feedback and making tweaks, testing price points and making sales. By January of this year they had the product made commercially and began selling it. In May, their big break came: Banana Wave is now in Whole Foods throughout the state. The couple have done demonstrations (Neter wears a banana suit) at stores throughout the summer. The banana milk is a first for Whole Foods, Neter said. “They sell a lot of products but they have never seen anything like Banana Wave.” He has had meetings with Wal-Mart and Kroger over the summer. Wal-Mart has already said yes, Neter said, and they are discussing 2017 launch plans. “I really want to get into Publix; Publix is on my radar.” Launched: March 19, 2013 Management team: Co-founders H.E. Neter Kush Ben Alkebulan, chief beverage officer; Trendolyn Hopkins, chief brand officer; Claudette Patron, chairman of the board. No. of employees: 9 Website: bananawave.com, www.facebook.com/drinkbananawave Financing: $727,300 raised from family, friends and angel investors. Recent milestones reached: Expanded distribution into the Northeast, through Market Basket, into the Southwest, through HEB, and into the West Coast, through Unified Grocers. Won the Category Pioneer Award in Beverage World Magazine in July. Currently working on a chocolate version of Banana Wave. Biggest startup challenge and why: “Our biggest startup challenge was obtaining distribution for Banana Wave. We created the new category so food & beverage distributors had no historical data to rely on to determine sales volume,” Neter said. Next steps: Obtain a national presence within Whole Foods Market. Give back to the community by sponsoring sporting events and local festivals. Provide impeccable service to distributors and retailers, while creating healthy beverage products that add value to consumers’ lives.

District Attorney David Learner reached his conclusion after reviewing videos captured by the store and police body cameras, multiple media organizations reported. Learner said preliminary toxicology tests also found amphetamines and methamphetamine in the bloodstream of 32-year-old Carl Marcus Nivens, who was killed. The Lenoir resident was a suspect in a vehicle break-in outside the store and was shooting at police Sgt. Brett Ingram, who returned fire and killed Nivens, Learner said. Ingram and another police officer who had been on the scene of Tuesday's shooting had been placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice. They returned to duty on Friday. "The officers' decisions to use deadly force were fully justified and undoubtedly avoided injury to the officers and innocent bystanders," Learner said in in a statement Friday. "Nivens was actively shooting at Sgt. Ingram who returned fire, killing the suspect." Both Nivens and Ingram were white. Two others who were with Nivens were arrested on outstanding warrants for unrelated charges. Officers responded to the Walmart after employees reported suspicious activity. Nivens tried to flee from the store as officers tried to question him about the possible vehicle break-in, Police Chief Scott Brown said last week. Nivens pulled a .38 caliber revolver from his waist band and fired at least one shot at police, Brown said. Other than minor injuries from struggling with Nivens, no officers were hurt and no other injuries were reported, Brown said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
