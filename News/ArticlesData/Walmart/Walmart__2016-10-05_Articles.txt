And I must admit that I can’t blame them. Analysts expect the S&P 500 as a whole to see profits contract 2.1% compared with last year. So now more than ever, it’s crucial to keep track of earnings. But considering that upwards of 50 companies will report operating results each and every trading day over the next several weeks, I don’t expect you to spend hours of your day combing through the data. Instead, I’ll do that for you and hit the highlights in this daily blog. However, before I do, let me say that Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT) made headlines Thursday with its lackluster earnings outlook for the next two fiscal years. WMT shares fell after the company announced that it would open fewer stores, and focus more on its online business. Walmart will release its Q3 results in mid-November, and it will be interesting to see how this report shakes out. In the meantime, I consider WMT a B-rated (cautious) buy. Today, I’ll preview the biggest names to keep on your radar over the next several trading days: There are only five names scheduled to report today, including Oil-Dri Corporation of America (ODC), Straight Path Communications Inc (STRP) and TSR Inc (TSRI). Respectively, these stocks are rated A, C and B in Portfolio Grader. Monday: This Monday will also be a relatively quiet day for earnings. You can click here to see the full lineup. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Tuesday: Before Tuesday’s open, Alcoa Inc (AA) kicks off the official start to earnings season by announcing its third-quarter operating results. Now, Alcoa’s earnings are expected to improve from 7 cents per share a year ago to 13 cents per share. However, if you currently hold shares of the world’s leading aluminum producer, you may want to brace yourself: AA fails in Portfolio Grader (it currently is a D-rated Sell). This is due to a combination of anemic buying pressure and mixed fundamentals. For the rest of next week, we’ll have several more high-profile earnings reports. On Wednesday, October 12, CSX Corporaton (CSX) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) will release their quarterly results. On Thursday, we’ll hear from Progressive Corp (PGR) and Wynn Resorts, Ltd (WYNN). Friday will be a big day for the banking industry, with Citigroup Inc (C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) all reporting before the market opens. As a whole, this earnings season is going to be very challenging, especially for energy and financial stocks. There are exceptions to the rule. In Wednesday’s blog, I featured Constellation Brands, Inc.’s (STZ) Q2 earnings report. The stock is still rising after its 7% earnings surprise and its 3% sales surprise. 5 Stocks to Sell Now or Short Into the Ground I currently recommend STZ in Blue Chip Growth and it is a B-rated Buy in Portfolio Grader. Make no mistake—the next several weeks will shake up the market as earnings take center stage. So be sure to check in on this blog from time to time to help you locate the best profit opportunities in this shifting market.

(from left) Marc Lore, Rosalind Brewer, Brett Biggs, Doug McMillon, David Cheesewright and Greg Foran fielded questions from the press at the close of its Annual Investor Conference. by Kim Souza. Published Oct 6th, 2016 5:31 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart investors are again backing off the retail giant after the retailer’s top executives tempered earning projections for next year at somewhere between $4.29 and $4.49 per share, flat against the adjusted earnings per share predicted for this year. Hosting analysts Thursday (Oct. 6) at the home office in Bentonville, Wal-Mart executives were short on details around specifics into the metamorphosis it plans to make in the short term. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said internally the company will in the near future look more like a Silicon Valley tech company than a traditional retailer. He said key differences will be in how capital is deployed, faster decision making, and using technology to increase efficiencies and enhance customer experiences. He said the changes have to happen if the company is going to survive another 50 years. Wal-Mart declined to give specifics of its ongoing price investment numbered into the billions, except to say it will be “controlled and thoughtful.” Wal-Mart said it would not break out its level of investment, nor disclose the markets or categories where it’s being deployed. Analysts who watch the retailer on behalf of banks, investment firms and other financial sector companies say “controlled and thoughtful” would be hard to model. Avoiding margin pressure and leveraging costs will be “no slam dunk” next year, said Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs. He said Wal-Mart gave a flat guidance in part because they want to remain fluid enough to ratchet up investment if they need to do so. The retailer said nothing about upcoming holiday sales projections but focused more on updating analysts on the three year plan it laid out a year ago. One year into the plan Wal-Mart has already lowered the expectations with respect to next year’s earnings and gave very little clarity for next two year period. Wall Street has largely been supportive of the investments Wal-Mart is making in its people, including $2.7 billion over two years, e-commerce investments now at more than $5 billion, the $3.3 billion Jet.com deal, and increased stake in JD.com. When asked if this hefty investment level at e-commerce will be a recurring element or an outlier, McMillon said it’s an outlier. Wall Street is mixed on the retailer’s two-year sacrifice of profits. Mark Martiak, strategist with Premier First Allied Securities, said Wal-Mart has to invest and the ramp up made in e-commerce is the right step if they are going to gain market share against Amazon. He said Wal-Mart may have to look more closely at real estate holdings and closing underperforming stores because it’s important for the company to keep the focus on e-commerce and developing segments like pickup that drive people to the stores. Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran spoke to analysts about the focus on store performance. He said at anytime he can see the “Fast, Clean, Friendly” scores of the store fleet on a phone app. He said he can check on other store metrics as well. He and Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright said they evaluate the low store performers routinely. Cheesewright said they try and rehabilitate the low performers but if there are better places to spend money they do not hesitate to close underperforming operations. More cautious analysts say Wal-Mart investors now selling their shares are likely not happy about having to do so, and are getting out because of flat earnings and a lack of detail as to how the company will grow revenue when it reduces the number of new stores and faces growing online competition. Wal-Mart executives squelched the recent rumors and headlines about widely reported play for Indian-e-tailer Flipkart. Cheesewright said the Indian market is very complex and different from anywhere else in the world. “We are in a stage of learning about that market. We talk to lots of people there trying to learn and do better. For now we like the cash and carry business. India is not a focus for us right now,” Cheesewright told analysts on Thursday. Analysts asked Wal-Mart execs if the grocery pickup play is offensive or defensive. McMillon quickly said Wal-Mart was playing more offense with its new strategies. There’s no silver bullet approach, however, McMillon said, adding that “running great stores is important,” but no more so than offering shoppers a convenient online option. McMillon said Wal-Mart will continue to look for ways to reduce costs because that’s the foundation for its Everyday Low Prices. When asked about margin erosion he said margins across the globe have been driven lower because of internet transparency of price. He said Walmart is and has to remain prepared for lower margins in the future across the world of retail. Part of the reasoning behind the retailer’s planned transformation to a tech-like company is that more nimble and leaner operations provide for faster cycles and are cheaper than the traditional, more isolated models that dominated retail for decades. Analysts also pressed Wal-Mart on getting higher store comps given the U.S. store fleet is running more efficiently with eight quarters of positive comps and seven quarters of positive traffic. Also, e-commerce is beginning to gain positive traction. Wall Street believes 2% comps should be reasonable expectations in the future. The retailer did not provide any indication comps will soon rise to 2% or higher. McMillon did say that Jet.com and that business is growing for certain. He said Walmart.com will benefit as Lore finds synergies in the two businesses. The ongoing Federal Corruption Practices Act probe into Wal-Mart’s international businesses in at least five markets still looms over the retail giant. Some experts say the case could reach a settlement within the next few months. A settlement could cost the retailer anywhere from $600 million to more than a $1 billion according to some estimates. That cost would be in addition to the $858 million Wal-Mart has already spent on legal and internal compliance actions taken during the investigation. Cheesewright did tell analysts that compliance safeguards the retailer has put in place over the past two years are without equal in the industry and will be difficult for others to quickly replicate. He said this could be an advantage for the retailer once the matter is settled.

In this article I take a retrospective look at South Africa’s economy since 1994. It’s an article of faith for me, backed by economic evidence, that the ANC government and left don’t understand the western economic system. Yes, the National Democratic Revolution and patronage and populism have distracted them. But I’m convinced SA’s poor economic performance since 1994, while peer nations reaped the commodities and agriculture booms, is because they lack economic nous. There has been a preponderance of communists and unionists in economic portfolios – Alec Erwin, Rob Davies, Pravin Gordhan, Ebrahim Patel. What do they understand about modern, industrialised economies? (Doctrinaire SACP members may dismiss China, which has a capitalist centre, as a sell-out.) Except for Chris Liebenberg, not one professional economist or finance specialist occupied the primary economics portfolio – Treasury (see Nhlanhla Nene and Des van Rooyen below). Trevor Manuel and Pravin Gordhan were technicians at best, lacking insight for professional analysis only a specialist can bring to the job. They’ve had medical doctors in the health minister job – even the late, oft-inebriated Manto Tshabalala-Msimang knew medicine – but no economists in inarguably the most important cabinet post bar the president. Doesn’t the ANC think it deserves it? Perhaps this is a good reason why the country has not performed well economically. Manuel and Gordhan are not oracles I don’t understand why business, media and others are so enamoured of SA’s post-1994 finance ministers. They hang onto their every word as if they were the Oracle of Delphi. They are “heroes”, and we should “go down on our knees and thank them” they say. In fact, Manuel was an engineering technician diplomate from his alma mater, Peninsula Technikon (where I too studied engineering). I’m all for on-the-job training, but the finance minister job requires specialised, technical knowledge. Remember his “amorphous markets” comment that started a run on the rand? After a couple of years in trade and industry he should have known better. But his comment revealed how naive and unprepared he was for the portfolio. After this I always thought he was a dilettante and poseur. His Xhosa bon mots during his budget speeches were twee and cringe-inducing. His fans in Parliament and media lapped it up, though. But today he’s considered the Obi-Wan/Yoda of finance. His rare missives from his redoubt in his corporate HQ office are pored over by media cognoscenti like nuggets of gold in the shit that passes for SA’s political economy. Gordhan is similar. Nhlanhla Nene was not in the job long enough for me to form an opinion, but he appeared to be headed in the right direction before he paid the price. The difference between Nene and the other two, though, is he served an apprenticeship as deputy finance minister, which they didn’t, and he has an economics degree. Now, before someone says a minister is the political head of a department and has a team of specialists, then why the fuss after “unknown backbencher” Des van Rooyen was appointed in December 2015? He holds two master’s degrees including a master’s in finance specialising in economic policy from the University of London. Academically, he is the most qualified of the Zuma administration’s finance ministers. Yes, yes, I know all about the Zupta contagion, but that’s not my point. Like Manuel and Gordhan, he too could have learned on the job. In fact, his academic background may have made him a quicker study than they, but we shall never know. I know there are many things at play in the fields of macroeconomics that determine growth. But growth is a good indicator of the performance/success of a country’s economic policy and its chief financial officer, i.e. finance minister. Post-1994 growth has averaged 3%, half that of SA’s peer nations’ 5-6%-plus (not including China) for the same period. If we assume 6% is the benchmark for growth, development and job creation – government’s “achievable” target SA should have obtained, at least before the 2008 crash – Manuel and Gordhan performed poorly, far less than 8 or 9 out of 10 the media and DA regularly gave them. Manuel (and Maria Ramos, an economist, his director-general) gets credit for steering SA out of apartheid’s bankruptcy and through a necessary structural adjustment programme, GEAR. (Typical of government’s confusion, it conflicted with the RDP.) But numerous points are deducted for approving and defending the arms deal that was the trigger for the subsequent toxic brew of greed and corruption that has doomed the ANC and almost the country with it. Today he is still unrepentant. And his lapdogs quote him as the voice of reason and probity? Gordhan has muddled along, overseeing public debt that during his tenure from 2009 to 2014 rose from about 30% GDP to 50%. Points are deducted for failing to do what he promised – reduce public spending. Under his watch Nkandla occurred and SAA, SABC and other state enterprises continued their implosion. He also allowed banks to get away with their cartel-like practice of near usurious charges, another promise he broke. His promised firm hand is all talk. And under his management South Africa is facing possible downgrades. I wrote before that Gordhan is not our last hero at the bridge, defending us from economic ruin. In my book his score is a lower than Manuel’s, pushing him to mediocre. Somehow his urbaneness and newly acquired status of victimhood (“Leave Gordhan alone!”; “Let me do my job”) has overshadowed and made some forget his failures. It’s only in SA, where mediocrity is a virtue, that he’s considered “excellent”. As a former accountant myself, albeit for a very small concern, and a lay economics analyst, I think Gordhan (and less so Manuel) has adequate skills for a bookkeeper, but not the tough and ruthless perseverance a chief financial officer must have. I’m not underestimating the impact of party ideology – the ANC’s obeisance to the Party of the Broad Church and their bible’s commandments, the National Democratic Revolution – on SA’s growth path. The disastrous evidence is before us. But if Treasury is hostage to ANC ideology, why has its fan club in media and business frequently and loudly proclaimed its “independence must be upheld”? Even I have done so. Independence from what, though? The economy’s key failures I don’t know about them, but my view is Treasury must guide the economy to growth, development and prosperity based on sound social democratic and economic principles and not in the manner they have done over the past 20 years. The path has not been pro-growth and development. In Africa’s Third Liberation Greg Mills and Jeffrey Herbst summarise the SA economy’s key failures: - Balance of payments problems due to shrinking exports and increasing imports, including industrial technology. - Low labour productivity despite spending 20% of budget, or 7% GDP, on education. Due to protected industries, from 1990 to 2009 productivity rose only 2% while labour costs almost 6%. Between 2006 and 2009 public sector wages rose 23% compared to 10% in the private sector. - Government spending is crowding out private investment at a higher rate than comparable developing nations. High public debt is associated with low growth, and acts as a disinvestment to work and savings. - Investment promotion is constrained by political and economic interests. Included are unions resisting deregulating the labour market and lowering wages (and wanting a minimum wage), leading to the lack of job creation. - During the commodities boom to 2008, when peer nations reaped the rewards and grew 5% pa and above, SA’s mining output fell 1% pa, and investment in mining shrank just under a third between 2003 and 2005. In 2009 mining output was at its lowest level since 2000. The result of policy and political failures is a stagnant economy – a “stalled state” – and lack of jobs. Essentially the failures are laid equally at the doors of the president and economic minister of the day. Economic policy blunders Here’s a review of some of government’s industrial policy blunders. I don’t know if it could have been prohibited, but government should have discouraged – we know SA’s corporations are very afraid of defying government – Old Mutual, mining and other companies moving headquarters to London, despite them having no significant operations abroad. This contributed to the loss of confidence in the country as an investment destination and devaluation of the rand. Why should foreign companies invest when South African are leaving? A rookie finance minister’s (Trevor Manuel) mistake many at the time (including me) thought a bad idea.  Manuel also approved Barclays’ majority stake in Absa, Africa’s largest retail bank. This concentrated the banking sector rather than opening it to competition. (His wife, Maria Ramos, later became group chief executive of Absa.) Similarly, Walmart should not have been permitted to buy a majority stake in Massmart. Now both have regretted their investment, but are having difficulty divesting their shareholding. On the basis of antitrust principles and encouraging competition, Barclays’ and Walmart’s investments should have been permitted on condition they added diversity, infrastructure and competition and new jobs to their sectors – the bricks and mortar of investment that’s harder to divest, not volatile, “hot” money. Instead, from Walmart government extracted conditions and R100m for a “supply chain programme to improve competitiveness in the industry”. The programme reveals both government’s fatuousness and ignorance of economics. Both Barclays’ and Walmart’s investments concentrated their industries and diminished competition. But government believes increasing the number of oligarchies improves competition? Has the programme had any impact, or was it simply extortion as I thought it was? Had Walmart wanted to enter SA it could have acquired – government could have insisted – Massmart’s successful Builder’s Warehouse chain or a similar, promising green field enterprise. Similarly for Barclays, play the long game of building the brand from scratch – like successful, fast growing Capitec – rather than opportunistic, hot money in Absa. Other blunders include semi-privatising Telkom without another fixed-line operator in place, or Telkom should have been unbundled, and selling Iscor outright to Mittal Steel, which turned both into private monopolies overnight. Once they were privatised both engaged in unrelenting price-gouging causing huge damage to consumers and industry. It set back access to reasonably priced telecommunications and steel for years and economic growth immeasurably. Fining Telkom and ArcelorMittal years later could not undo the damage. Ironically, ArcelorMittal has now sought government protection from cheap Chinese imports. Allegedly they and government have “learned their lesson”. Recently director-general of trade and industry Lionel October admitted they were “naive” about Mittal. I read an honours degree in economics. I could call myself an economist but I’m not. I know enough to read the signposts, though. For the advanced international economics course in 1993 I wrote an essay on competition in oligarchic and monopolistic economies. Even with some of the technical material above my head, I understood the limitations and dangers to competition and growth in an economy that’s not free. This is standard economic theory, so why did October, whose résumé lists a master’s in economics from University of London, and his political masters, not understand it? It’s not that they’re naive, which is used as a weak defence. Instead, they don’t appear to understand the functioning of the western economic system and importance of political risk, stable institutions and a free economy on investor confidence. An example is the ANC’s complaints the markets – Manuel’s amorphous markets – “overreacted” to Nene’s firing in 2015. This is unsurprising given they are socialist-trained and leaning apparatchiks who are determined to take SA along the low road of patronage and low growth. Big business is complicit I must make something very clear, though. While government deserves most of the responsibility for the state of the economy, it’s convenient in some quarters to blame them for everything that’s gone wrong. But big business and unions must share a portion of the blame. South Africa’s economy is small and concentrated, and big business extracts as much revenue as they can squeeze from it. While there is nothing wrong with an acceptable rate of return, in SA they are like the commission-seeker or briber who demands a higher and higher percentage – in our case, from already embattled consumers – from transactions (e.g. banks, cell phone networks, etc). In a speech at the University of Witwatersand on 19 July 2016, the IMF’s David Lipton noted some of the problems that are already known: high barriers to entry for new entrants, which favour existing companies; few retail banks and high bank charges; SA companies have high profit margins, often 50 percent higher than in other countries; barriers to entry, protected industries and labour and protective subsidies harm consumers and competition, and widespread anti-competitive behaviour in industries. Collective bargaining serves big business’ and unions’ interest and is a big obstacle to small and medium enterprises – traditional job creators – that in turn suppresses competition. And apologists for SA’s big business and their model of almost unfettered capitalism choose to ignore, or excuse, the fact the questionable and rent-seeking black economic empowerment model is their creation. For 20 years big business made huge profits from a protected, uncompetitive and inefficient economy that was their love-child from a political marriage of convenience with “naive” and complicit ANC. Now that the happy, boom years are over and economy is stagnating at near 0% growth, like a delinquent, estranged spouse, they sit on their cash or invest it abroad, trying to distance themselves from the gunshot wedding and its bastard. Rather than be active, responsible citizens, as we all should be, and take a united stand against the “toxic combination of disastrous policy, incompetence and corruption that resulted in declining economic outcomes” they helped create, big business cowardly and dishonestly hides behind statements like Christo Wiese’s pretend-ignorance, “As a businessmen rather than a politician, [I] would like to stay out of politics”. The failures of the past 22 years indicate the government’s, left’s and big business’ lack of understanding of a competitive, free economic system and the requirements essential for growth and development. It’s a result of the ANC’s socialist-cum-nationalist black empowerment model married to apartheid-era’s over-protected, uncompetitive corporate/industrial model in which the elite benefit – a strange, two-headed beast that, yet, feeds off each other. This symbiosis, and ANC-business-unions (pro-growth) policy stalemate, is why the IMF’s and others’ repeated warnings for complete structural economic reforms to improve growth and job creation have been ignored. And so, SA’s development decline will continue. Sign up to our free daily headline newsletter Related Articles Twenty lost years Do we have the intellectuals we deserve? Skills and growth.

The world's largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. ___ Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT World finance leaders seek to address anti-trade backlash WASHINGTON (AP) — World finance leaders say they must do more to deal with a growing anti-trade backlash, which they fear could worsen already sluggish global growth prospects. How to deal with the attacks on globalization, featured in the Donald Trump's U.S. presidential campaign and in the vote in Britain to leave the European Union, is a top agenda item at the fall meetings of the 189-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters Thursday that IMF officials "see growth as too low for too long and benefiting too few." ___ Stocks end mixed after clawing back from broad losses NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks recovered from a broad decline to end mixed on Thursday, a day ahead of a key jobs report. The market fell from the start, then drifted between gains and losses for much of the afternoon. Yields on Treasury bonds rose again, and the price of oil climbed past $50 a barrel for the first time since June. By the end of trading, seven of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor's 500 index rose, led by suppliers of basic materials. Health care companies and phone companies led the decliners. ___ US claims for jobless aid drop to lowest since mid-April WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week felt to the lowest level since mid-April, another sign that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid slid by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000. The less volatile four-week average dropped 2,500 to 253,500, lowest since December 1973. Overall, 2.06 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, down more than 7 percent from a year ago. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate unchanged at 3.42 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn't move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 percent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, stayed at 2.72 percent. ___ US farmers make foray into quinoa as demand for grain grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) — A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters' growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totaled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa's nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn't show on an agricultural census. ___ Federal government: Mylan has been overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug's maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government's complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties. ___ UN agreement reached on aircraft climate-change emissions WASHINGTON (AP) — The United Nations' aviation arm overwhelmingly ratified an agreement Thursday to control global warming emissions from international airline flights, the first climate-change pact to set worldwide limits on a single industry. The agreement, adopted overwhelmingly by the 191-nation International Civil Aviation Organization at a meeting in Montreal, sets airlines' carbon emissions in the year 2020 as the upper limit of what carriers are allowed to discharge. Airlines that exceed that limit in future years, as most are expected to do, will have to offset their emissions growth by buying credits from other industries and projects that limit greenhouse gas emissions. ___ Airlines cancel hundreds of flights as hurricane hits US Airlines canceled hundreds of flights for Thursday and planned more cancelations for Friday as Hurricane Matthew hit the Florida coast with high winds and heavy rain. The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and the Orlando airport expected to do the same by nighttime. Before 2 p.m. Eastern time, flight-tracking service FlightAware.com reported that 1,500 Thursday flights within the U.S. had been scrapped. FlightAware said airlines had already canceled 1,300 more flights scheduled for Friday. ___ Norway to spend record $28 billion oil money to boost growth HELSINKI (AP) — Norway says it plans to spend 225 billion kroner ($28 billion) of its oil fund — the largest in the world — to further stimulate the economy next year in the Scandinavian country that has shown signs of a gradual economic recovery. The Finance Ministry says in its budget proposals that the record amount is equivalent to 0.4 percent of the country's GDP. It will be 20 billion kroner more than this year, amounting to 3 percent of the value of the sovereign wealth fund. The ministry said Thursday the market value of the fund, known as the Government Pension Fund Global, is expected to peak at 7,671 billion kroner at the end of 2017 — up from an estimated 7,420 billion kroner at the end of this year ___ Theranos closing labs, laying off 340 following sanctions PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) — Embattled blood testing company Theranos says it will shut down its clinical labs and wellness centers and lay off more than 40 percent of its full-time employees. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes says the shutdowns will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania. The move comes nearly three months after federal regulators banned Holmes from owning or running a medical laboratory for two years. Theranos is appealing the ban, which stems from an investigation of the California facility. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.53 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,268.50. The S&P 500 inched up 1.04 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,160.77. The Nasdaq composite slipped 9.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,306.85. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 61 cents to close at $50.44 a barrel in the New York, its first close above $50 a barrel since June 23. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 65 cents to close at $52.51 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline edged up less than 1 cent to $1.50 a gallon, heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.60 a gallon and natural gas rose less than 1 cent to $3.05 per 1,000 cubic feet.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Ahead of Matthew, many stores out of water, bread, batteries Thursday Oct 6, 2016 at 5:34 PM Oct 6, 2016 at 6:10 PM Shoppers find mix of empty shelves or good supply. Fred Hiers @Hiersnews “It’s about bread and water,” said a customer at Wal-Mart on Thursday as she stared at empty shelves that typically held hundreds of loaves of bread. The white metal shelves at the big box retailer on Southwest 19th Avenue Road, also known as Easy Street, had been picked clean of all but half a dozen loaves of bread by mid-morning, but it was a sure bet those soon would be scooped up by the last wave of shoppers getting ready for Hurricane Matthew. “And they’re out of water too,” said Cathy Mason, to no one in particular as she contemplated which loaf of bread to take. “They’re out at the other Wal-Mart and the Publix.” The Wal-Mart on Easy Street had run out of most of its bottled water supply on Wednesday but then got another shipment at 3 a.m. Thursday, enough to fill the shelves. But, according to an employee, by 8 a.m. Thursday the shelves were empty again, except for a few cases of high-end flavored carbonated water.  The worker was taking advantage of the situation and was painting the empty expanses.  The store also was out of D batteries, the most common size for flashlights. The sporting goods section was nearly out of flashlights. Some shoppers settled for a couple of flashlights powered by AA batteries. “I got everything I needed, but there was no water and I’ve been trying to find water since last night,” said Grace Blackwater, 52, as she loaded her car at the Wal-Mart parking lot. “I’ve been to every gas station, CVS and every Walgreens, and there’s no water. And then I came all the way here and I still didn’t find what I was looking for.” Blackwater said Ocala is usually far enough away from the coast to be buffered from hurricane force winds. That’s why people don’t make a run on the essentials, she said, but now it is different. Sandy McClain bought one of the last flashlights in the store. “I’ve got one at home but I wanted an extra one,” she said. “I wanted a different kind but this is all they have, but they don’t have batteries, at least not the kind I want.” “No one expects a hurricane and when it comes everybody rushes to get what they need. I got water the other day but nothing is left now,” she added. Kim Smith settled on buying an expensive energy drink as there was no bottled water. “That’s all I saw in there,” she said looking at the sports drink in her trunk. “And I went to the Wal-Mart on State Road 40 but they didn’t have any water either.” She said at least she was lucky by way of gasoline. “I got gas the other day,” she said, getting into her Honda CRV. Md Islam owns the Shell gasoline station on South Pine Avenue. “There was a line yesterday of people buying gasoline. And yesterday we ran out,” Islam said. “What could we do? Nothing.” By 9 a.m. Thursday, fuel trucks has loaded his underground tanks again. Another two loads of fuel were scheduled for later in the day. Gov. Rick Scott said in a press release that Florida has enough fuel, but getting delivery trucks to stations later this week might be difficult. Frank Carroll was filling his wife’s Chevy Equinox SUV at the service station. “She tried yesterday but there was no gas. She also tried this morning,” he said, pumping the tank full of gasoline. “So she sent me out because I’m a full-time student (with no more classes today). Now I have to pick up sandbags and her mother in a minute.” The city of Ocala gave away 3,800 sand bags on Wednesday. City officials did not have a count early Thursday, but the line was continuous.  Martin Garcia was filling his pickup truck at the BP station at State Road 200 and Interstate 75. “I couldn’t find any gas yesterday,” said the 32-year-old mechanic. “Every place I went had a plastic bag over the (pump) handles. Either that or the lines were way too long. So I came out this morning and they had gasoline again. I won’t wait until the last minute the next time.” At the Heathbrook Publix, Jackie Davis bought one case of water. She said she could have used more but only saw three cases left and wanted to leave some for someone else who might need it. She said she had gone to the Wal-Mart store on State Road 200 near County Road 484, but there was no water. Assistant manager Drew Olawos said the Publix store was working hard to keep supplies on the shelves, calling on vendors to deliver the items customers wanted most: water and bread. He said the store was dependent on what his suppliers could bring him. The lines at each register were two-to-four people deep. “We had Christmas Eve business yesterday and Christmas Eve business today,” he said of the crowds. Shoppers agreed that finding supplies was a crapshoot. Lowes on State Road 200 had pallets of water and batteries. So did Aldi on Easy Street. McClain said the shortages were leading to shoppers sharing information about stores that might be getting restocked, “But you never know what’s really there until you get there.” Reach Fred Hiers at fred.hiers@starbanner.com and 352-397-5914.

Home Industry Companies Wal-Mart rejects settlement with US over alleged bribery Wal-Mart rejects settlement with US over alleged bribery Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. By: Reuters | Published: October 7, 2016 3:10 AM Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company’s alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company’s practices in markets including Mexico, India and China, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company’s alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. Some of Wal-Mart’s actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Officials are working to strike a deal with the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company before a new U.S. administration takes over in January, according to the Bloomberg report. Wal-Mart is cooperating fully with the government and compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws is a key priority, company spokesman Greg Hitt said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of FCPA, in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed by its shareholders including a Michigan pension fund, accusing it of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico.

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totalled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. ___ World finance leaders seek to address anti-trade backlash WASHINGTON (AP) — World finance leaders say they must do more to deal with a growing anti-trade backlash, which they fear could worsen already sluggish global growth prospects. How to deal with the attacks on globalization, featured in the Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential campaign and in the vote in Britain to leave the European Union, is a top agenda item at the fall meetings of the 189-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters Thursday that IMF officials “see growth as too low for too long and benefiting too few.” ___ Stocks end mixed after clawing back from broad losses NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks recovered from a broad decline to end mixed on Thursday, a day ahead of a key jobs report. The market fell from the start, then drifted between gains and losses for much of the afternoon. Yields on Treasury bonds rose again, and the price of oil climbed past $50 a barrel for the first time since June. By the end of trading, seven of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor’s 500 index rose, led by suppliers of basic materials. Health care companies and phone companies led the decliners. ___ US claims for jobless aid drop to lowest since mid-April WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week felt to the lowest level since mid-April, another sign that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid slid by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000. The less volatile four-week average dropped 2,500 to 253,500, lowest since December 1973. Overall, 2.06 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, down more than 7 per cent from a year ago. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate unchanged at 3.42 per cent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn’t move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 per cent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 per cent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 per cent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, stayed at 2.72 per cent. ___ US farmers make foray into quinoa as demand for grain grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) — A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters’ growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totalled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa’s nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn’t show on an agricultural census. ___ Federal government: Mylan has been overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J.

(AP) — Embattled blood testing company Theranos says it will shut down its clinical labs and wellness centres and lay off more than 40 per cent of its full-time employees. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes says the shutdowns will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania. The move comes nearly three months after federal regulators banned Holmes from owning or running a medical laboratory for two years.

IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters Thursday that IMF officials "see growth as too low for too long and benefiting too few." ___ Stocks end mixed after clawing back from broad losses NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks recovered from a broad decline to end mixed on Thursday, a day ahead of a key jobs report. The market fell from the start, then drifted between gains and losses for much of the afternoon. Yields on Treasury bonds rose again, and the price of oil climbed past $50 a barrel for the first time since June. By the end of trading, seven of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor's 500 index rose, led by suppliers of basic materials. Health care companies and phone companies led the decliners. ___ US claims for jobless aid drop to lowest since mid-April WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week felt to the lowest level since mid-April, another sign that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid slid by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000. The less volatile four-week average dropped 2,500 to 253,500, lowest since December 1973. Overall, 2.06 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, down more than 7 percent from a year ago. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate unchanged at 3.42 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn't move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 percent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, stayed at 2.72 percent. ___ US farmers make foray into quinoa as demand for grain grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) — A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters' growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totaled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa's nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn't show on an agricultural census. ___ Federal government: Mylan has been overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug's maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government's complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties. ___ UN agreement reached on aircraft climate-change emissions WASHINGTON (AP) — The United Nations' aviation arm overwhelmingly ratified an agreement Thursday to control global warming emissions from international airline flights, the first climate-change pact to set worldwide limits on a single industry. The agreement, adopted overwhelmingly by the 191-nation International Civil Aviation Organization at a meeting in Montreal, sets airlines' carbon emissions in the year 2020 as the upper limit of what carriers are allowed to discharge. Airlines that exceed that limit in future years, as most are expected to do, will have to offset their emissions growth by buying credits from other industries and projects that limit greenhouse gas emissions. ___ Airlines cancel hundreds of flights as hurricane hits US Airlines canceled hundreds of flights for Thursday and planned more cancelations for Friday as Hurricane Matthew hit the Florida coast with high winds and heavy rain. The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and the Orlando airport expected to do the same by nighttime. Before 2 p.m. Eastern time, flight-tracking service FlightAware.com reported that 1,500 Thursday flights within the U.S. had been scrapped. FlightAware said airlines had already canceled 1,300 more flights scheduled for Friday. ___ Norway to spend record $28 billion oil money to boost growth HELSINKI (AP) — Norway says it plans to spend 225 billion kroner ($28 billion) of its oil fund — the largest in the world — to further stimulate the economy next year in the Scandinavian country that has shown signs of a gradual economic recovery. The Finance Ministry says in its budget proposals that the record amount is equivalent to 0.4 percent of the country's GDP. It will be 20 billion kroner more than this year, amounting to 3 percent of the value of the sovereign wealth fund. The ministry said Thursday the market value of the fund, known as the Government Pension Fund Global, is expected to peak at 7,671 billion kroner at the end of 2017 — up from an estimated 7,420 billion kroner at the end of this year ___ Theranos closing labs, laying off 340 following sanctions PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) — Embattled blood testing company Theranos says it will shut down its clinical labs and wellness centers and lay off more than 40 percent of its full-time employees. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes says the shutdowns will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania. The move comes nearly three months after federal regulators banned Holmes from owning or running a medical laboratory for two years. Theranos is appealing the ban, which stems from an investigation of the California facility. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.53 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,268.50. The S&P 500 inched up 1.04 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,160.77. The Nasdaq composite slipped 9.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,306.85. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 61 cents to close at $50.44 a barrel in the New York, its first close above $50 a barrel since June 23. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 65 cents to close at $52.51 a barrel in London.

But as the world's largest retailer pumps the brakes on its physical expansion, opting to shift its capital expenditures toward digital and store remodels, it will need to rely more heavily on its existing assets to drive future growth. At its annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas, Wal-Mart on Thursday said it would open fewer stores in the U.S. this year than originally expected. By year's end, the company will have cut the ribbon on 130 new domestic stores, down from the 135 to 155 it originally projected. This growth will slow more abruptly next year, when Wal-Mart said it will open just 55 stores in the U.S. The pullback applies to both its supercenters and smaller Neighborhood Market shops, which will open 35 and 20 locations, respectively. Of the company's $11 billion in capital expenditures next year, 20 percent will be funneled toward new stores; that's a dramatic change from just four years earlier, when they accounted for almost half of Wal-Mart's $13.1 billion budget. "This is a different Wal-Mart," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. The timing is right for Wal-Mart to make this shift, Cowen and Company analyst Oliver Chen said. Wal-Mart's U.S. division has been building momentum over the past few quarters, including its biggest quarterly same-store sales gain in four years during the period ended July 31. This strength has been fueled by a $2.7 billion investment in wages, which has better equipped its workers to make stores clean and more pleasant to shop. The company has also begun a multiyear project that involves spending billions of its own dollars to lower prices for consumers. Growth in its online grocery business has likewise brought new customers into the fold, who tend to grab additional items when they pick up their orders. This capability has been rolled out to 80 markets and 500 stores, and will be in 100 markets and 600 stores by year's end, Chen said. Because of these initiatives, the potential lift from its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and plans to give 500 of its stores a face-lift, Wal-Mart should be able to make up the revenues it forfeits by opening fewer stores, Chen said. "There's so many physical customers that come to a Wal-Mart," he said, noting that 90 percent of the U.S. population lives within 15 minutes of a store. The company said last year that it's targeting sales growth of 3 percent to 4 percent annually, excluding the impact of currency, which it's on track to achieve this year. Wal-Mart's decision makes even more sense in the scope of its Jet deal, which closed last month, O'Shea said. Wal-Mart's digital sales growth accelerated in the fiscal second quarter, rising 11.8 percent, making this the first quarter that metric had picked up in more than a year. Analysts view Jet as a critical piece of Wal-Mart's digital future. Wal-Mart has set its sights on 20 percent to 30 percent online sales growth in the second half and beyond, which O'Shea and Chen called achievable. "You just spent $3.3 billion accruing this asset. You've got to maximize it ... and that's what they're doing," O'Shea said. Wal-Mart on Thursday maintained its forecast for adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.35 this year. But its shares fell 3 percent as it walked back its estimates for fiscal 2018 and 2019. Wal-Mart predicts fiscal 2018 earnings will be relatively flat with this year's adjusted figure. And in fiscal 2019, it expects earnings per share growth of 5 percent. Wal-Mart previously said it expected earnings per share in fiscal 2018 to increase modestly and then grow 5 to 10 percent in fiscal 2019. "It's good that they've set a reasonable bar, and I think there's some upside potential," Chen said. Both Chen and O'Shea agreed that while Wal-Mart's investments are expensive, they're necessary for the future.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wal-Mart, Twitter slide Margreet Dietz Friday October 7, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street was mixed as investors awaited Friday's nonfarm payrolls report to gauge the timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike. A Labor Department report showed US initial jobless claims fell to 249,000 last week, the second-lowest level since 1973, underpinning bets the Fed will raise rates soon. Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls to increase by 175,000. "There's no question about it, these are good numbers," David Sloan, senior economist at 4Cast in New York, told Bloomberg. "The implication here is that the payrolls trend will remain healthy. The big picture is consistent with the Fed raising rates at some point this year, most likely in December." At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12.53 points, or less than 0.1%, to 18,268.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.17% lower to 5306.85 while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index eked out a one-point (0.05%) gain to 2106.77. "At the moment, what is driving the US market is a repricing around expectations of near-term Fed action," Bill Merz, investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota, told Reuters. In the Dow slides in shares of American Express and those of Wal-Mart, down 3.8% and 2.6% respectively, outweighed advances in shares of Home Depot and those of Apple, up 1.4% and 1.1% respectively. Wal-Mart sees little growth Shares of Wal-Mart Stores dropped after the retailer said it expects "relatively flat" earnings in its next fiscal year as it slows new-store openings to bolster its online business. For the year ending January 31, 2018, Wal-Mart expects earnings per share to be "relatively flat" from the previous fiscal year's estimated adjusted EPS of between $US4.15 to $US4.35 a share, it said in a statement. "The company will rely more on comp sales and e-commerce growth to drive the top line and plans to slow new-store openings while increasing investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives," Wal-Mart said in the statement. Meanwhile, shares of Twitter sank 20% as concern mounted no one wants to buy the social media company after it put itself up for sale last month. Alphabet's Google does not plan to bid for Twitter, according to technology website Recode. Walt Disney won't make a bid either, Recode reported, while Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. However, Salesforce.com might be interested. "I'm not saying I'm buying it, but I'm not saying I'm not buying it," Salesforce chief executive Mark Benioff told the New York Times. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a slide of 0.4%. Germany's DAX Index fell 0.2%, as did France's CAC 40 Index, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index declined 0.5%.

By David Iaconangelo, Staff October 6, 2016 Save for later Saved Wal-Mart chief executive officer Doug McMillon speaks at the company's shareholder meeting in Fayetteville, Ark., in June 2015. Danny Johnston/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Ahead of a meeting with investors on Thursday, Wal-Mart said it planned to scale back plans to open up new stores in favor of investing more in e-commerce, as the retail giant tries to fend off online competition from Amazon. Wal-Mart has installed mobile payment systems for checkouts and established new online pickup and grocery services, according to the Associated Press. And it has paired them with a round of investments in e-commerce companies and a planned expansion of warehouses for online sales, in what many market analysts describe as a model geared toward "the consumer of the future." Last month, the company closed the deal on its $3 billion acquisition of online retailer Jet.com, and on Wednesday, it announced that it had increased its stake in Chinese e-retailer JD.com, from 5.9 percent to 10.8 percent. In late September, Wal-Mart was reportedly in advanced talks with Indian e-retailer Flipkart over a potential $1 billion investment. Recommended: Can you match the CEO with the company?

Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly – so that's what we're doing," he said.  Over the past four years, Wal-Mart has gone from investing $300 million (in 2013) to $1.1 billion this year, according to public filings and earnings transcripts reviewed by Reuters. The push responds to Amazon’s encroachment on brick-and-mortar sales, and to broader industry trends. In a report this year, London analysis firm Ovum wrote that in 10 years, consumers would expect 24-hour “"instant access and fast turnaround" – especially Millennials and the tech-savvy "Generation Z," those born between 1996 and 2010. "These generations are constantly connected and inhabit an online environment where events happen in real time without them having to wait, and where social media enables them to dictate terms,"  the firm wrote. "However, by 2026, instant gratification … will have evolved into expectations of a seamless shopping experience across an increasing range of connected devices, in which immediacy and convenience are paramount." "Instant access and fast turnaround will still be a key part of the equation, but other expectations will have come to the fore: proactive customer service and support, and free or very low-cost delivery anytime, anywhere. Consumers will expect goods advertised online to live up to the promise in every way.... This places great pressure on retailers, and those that fail to meet expectations will fall by the wayside." In the meantime, Wal-Mart isn’t stopping its opening of new brick-and-mortar locations entirely. This year it will cut the ribbon on 130 new stores in the United States this year, and another 55 will open next year – 20 of which will be the particularly successful small-scale stores that the corporation calls "neighborhood markets." The company's website has become the nation’s second-largest online retailer by traffic, boasted Mr. McMillon in a September blog post, with the number of items sold online expanding from 7 million to 15 million. "Within a year," he wrote then, "we've created one of the largest online grocery businesses in the country." Next up Test your knowledge Can you match the CEO with the company? Take the quiz!

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sarah Halzack October 6 Follow @sarahhalzack A Walmart store in North Kingstown, R.I. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) Walmart said Thursday that it plans to significantly slow its efforts to open new U.S. stores, a strategic shift by the world’s largest retailer as it works to claim more of the shopping dollars that are rapidly moving online. At a meeting with investors, Walmart executives said the chain will open about 35 supercenters next year, sharply lower than the 60 it expects to open by the end of the current fiscal year. It aims to open just 20 of its smaller, grocery-oriented Neighborhood Markets, a pullback from the 70 it is to open this year. Instead, Walmart said it would work to increase sales by ramping up growth in its online division and squeezing more business out of its roughly 4,600 U.S. stores. The goals executives laid out for its digital business were ambitious: They say they expect to deliver 20 to 30 percent annualized growth in a segment that lately has not shown nearly that level of momentum. For example, last quarter, Walmart’s global e-commerce sales were up 11.8 percent over the previous year. In the last full fiscal year, the company’s online sales were up 8 percent. [Is the retail industry ‘overstored’?] “This company, over time, is going to look like more of an e-commerce company,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, said at an event at corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.  The big-box chain recently moved to boost its e-commerce firepower by acquiring upstart shopping site Jet.com and by installing that company’s founder, Marc Lore, as the head of Walmart’s online shopping strategy. Lore and McMillon spoke repeatedly of a focus on “basket economics.” This means that they want to find ways to incentivize customers to bundle their online orders, scooping up several items at a time. This behavior would slash shipping and fulfillment costs for the retailer, thus allowing sales in this channel to be more profitable. This tack would be different from the one that e-commerce leader Amazon.com has taken: That company has instead focused on getting shoppers to pay $99 a year for Prime memberships. Because shipping is free for members, these shoppers sometimes place several orders a day, one item at a time. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Investors sent Walmart’s stock down about 2.5 percent in afternoon trading, apparently disappointed by the financial forecast the retailer offered for the year ahead. Walmart said it expects earnings per share in the next fiscal year of between $4.29 and $4.49, about flat compared to what it anticipates for the current year. In the year after that, it expects 5 percent growth in earnings per share. Walmart expects to put $11 billion toward capital investments in the coming year. The company plans to remodel about 500 stores, and will add its grocery pickup capabilities to 500 additional locations. As it aims to boost sales in its existing stable of stores, the retailer will continue efforts to spiff up its fresh food offering and to lower prices on certain merchandise. It is also trying to build a healthier business by moving its inventory more efficiently. “Our goal is pretty simple,” said Greg Foran, chief executive of Walmart’s U.S. business. “We only want to touch an item once from when it hits the backroom to getting into a customers’ basket.” [How Walmart plans to transform the way you buy groceries] Walmart’s plan to ease up on new store openings comes in the same year that it moved to close 154 locations and to do away with its small-format Express stores. Taken together, these moves suggest the retailer is thinking hard about just what kind of bricks-and-mortar presence it needs in the digital era, especially given that about 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. Similar re-evaluations are happening across the wider retail industry, with Macy’s, for example, working to close 100 of its 675 stores after determining it had too many stores at a time when many of its customers are shopping on smartphones and laptops. business business true Please provide a valid email address.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | October 6, 2016 -- 16:30 GMT (09:30 PDT) | Topic: E-Commerce Image: Walmart Walmart said Thursday it plans to reduce the number of new store openings and shift more resources into building up its e-commerce business and digital technology stack. What's Hot on ZDNet Edward Snowden: Don't fear Trump, fear the surveillance state Why MacBook Pros don't need 32GB of RAM Windows 10 supremacy? Eve V comes gunning for Microsoft's mighty Surface Pro 4 How Linux can save small businesses (and old hardware) Part of the strategy shift stems from Walmart's $3 billion buyout of online retailer Jet.com this past August. During a meeting with Wall Street analysts, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and Jet.com founder Marc Lore outlined how they plan to reshape Walmart's position as an e-commerce brand while maintaining the existing strengths of each company. For Walmart, the strong point is its size and scale. There are currently more than 4,500 Walmart stores in the US, and each of those stores can be used in some capacity to service online orders. For Jet, the big money maker is what it refers to as "basket economics," which is basically an e-commerce ops strategy that stresses logistics and supply chain to reduce costs. The idea is to figure out the optimal way to ship a basket of goods to a consumer and to make that process transparent to the consumer as they're shopping. "So in real time we show the savings of buying one product over another," Lore said. "The idea is to encourage consumers to buy things that will ship together and in close proximity to where they live. And as a result, consumers are building bigger baskets." And that's the ticket right there -- bigger baskets. Walmart will apply Jet's 'basket economics" strategy to convince shoppers that big baskets are more efficient and akin to the digital version of supercenter shopping. And it will use its massive brick-and-mortar infrastructure to make all the pieces fit together. "The plan is to implement Jet philosophies across Walmart to grow business faster," McMillon said. Beyond basket size, McMillon also hopes Jet will attract a younger generation of brands and shoppers both in-store and online. The Jet brand indexes more strongly with Millennials than the Walmart brand does, McMillon said. Therefore Jet will focus on attracting the urban, Millennial customer and the youth-oriented brands that don't want to sell on marketplaces. "But we are more alike than people would guess, even though Jet is younger and cooler," McMillon quipped. Looking ahead, Walmart expects e-commerce sales to grow significantly in the second half of the 2018 fiscal year, jumping somewhere between 20 percent to 30 percent above previous measures. Last quarter Walmart said its e-commerce sales increased 11.8 percent primarily due to the continued rollout of its online grocery option and growth of pick-up in stores and clubs. It marked the first time in nine quarters that the retailer's online sales growth increased quarter-over-quarter. In terms of infrastructure, Walmart said it plans to add just 35 new supercenters (about half as many as last fiscal year) and 20 new neighborhood markets to its fleet of stores. This is a noteworthy point, because for the past four years, the bulk of Walmart's growth has come from new stores, said CFO Brett Biggs. Instead of opening additional stores, Walmart will remodel around 500 current stores and bring just as many on board as new online grocery locations. Still, Walmart said its fiscal 2018 earnings will be flat compared with fiscal 2017, with earnings in the range of $4.29 to $4.49 per share. "As retail changes, and Walmart changes with it, we can drive strong, efficient growth by continuing to operate with discipline," McMillon said in a blog post. "So we will be thoughtful about expense control and be more productive across the business. We'll win the basket business in stores and in e-commerce. And one other benefit from taking this approach is that shipping larger baskets is more sustainable from an environmental point of view."

Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2e5W54p) Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The retailer (WMT) said Thursday that it would open 130 stores in the 2017 fiscal year ending in February and 55 in the 2018 fiscal year ending in February 2018. For a company with nearly 4,600 stores nationwide, those projections reflect relatively inconsequential growth. In the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, the company added 198 and 316 stores, respectively, according to a securities filing. The planned small-format openings in the U.S. include 70 in 2017 and 20 in 2018, reflecting a sharp decline after opening 161 in 2016. Though Walmart's reputation for low prices and its massive size give the company a significant foothold in the market for everyday items, it is coming under assault from Amazon.com and other digital forces. Walmart projected that profit would be flat from 2017 to 2018 before growing 5% in 2019. Any signs of a slowdown may prove unnerving to investors who look to the company for steady earnings. The company's stock fell 3.2% to close at $69.36. USA TODAY Why Walmart is spending $3B for online seller Jet.com The projections include an additional $45 billion to $60 billion in revenue over the next three years, which would put the company above the half-trillion mark in annual sales. Still, Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told investors that the company must crack down on costs by "being tougher on third-party expenses, travel and things like that" and must improve store productivity and reduce excess inventory. "We're not where we want to be, from an overall expense standpoint," he said Thursday. Walmart also reiterated its 2017 earnings-per-share expectations of $4.29 to $4.49 and projected that capital expenditures would decline from $11.5 billion in 2016 to $11 billion in 2017 and 2018. The company recently sought to bolster its online presence with the $3 billion acquisition of Internet retailing start-up and would-be Amazon.com competitor Jet.com. That deal, along with an increased investment in Chinese online retailer JD.com, will bolster Walmart's online acumen. The company projected annual online sales growth of 20% to 30% from the 2017 through 2019 fiscal years. Online sales represent only about $14 billion to $16 billion of Walmart's approximately $355 billion in annual U.S. revenue, according to Moody's Investor Service. Despite the small percentage, Moody's hailed the retailer's efforts. "Walmart's forecasts announced this morning are in line with our expectations, especially when the costs involved in building out its online capability are considered," Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said in a note. "It will take awhile for the company to become a true multi-channel retailer, which occurs when cost efficiencies begin to generate and duplication reduces dramatically as physical assets and personnel are optimized." Walmart also said it is seeking "a sharpened focus in China," where competitors have taken a savvier approach, and "solid growth" in foreign markets such as Mexico and Canada. "We're seeing traction, and the company is moving faster," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) JEFF CHIU , Wal-Mart said Thursday it plans to slow new store openings as it looks to pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) JEFF CHIU , By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.52, or 2 percent, to $70.15 in afternoon trading. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they’ll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

Wal-Mart said earnings for the next fiscal year that begins February 1 will be essentially unchanged from those of fiscal 2017, which are expected to come in at $4.15 to $4.35 a share. That was below analysts' forecast of $4.47 earnings per share. Shares of Dow member Wal-Mart tumbled 2.4 percent to $69.95 in late-morning trade. The world's biggest retailer said it would slow investment in new stores and steer funds to e-commerce, technology and store remodels. The moves come as retailers scramble to do more to beef up e-commerce and integrate mobile technology into operations, such as letting customers order groceries online and pick them up in the store. "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," said Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. Faced with surging growth at Amazon and other online retailers, Wal-Mart's response in the online sector has included a $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and taking a 10.8 percent stake in Chinese firm JD.com. The US giant is reportedly in talks to invest $1 billion in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart. Wal-Mart forecasted an overall capital budget of $11 billion in both fiscal 2017 and 2018, down from $11.5 billion in 2016. It will open 130 new stores in the United States in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135-155 stores. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company expects to build 55 new stores in the US in fiscal 2018.

Officials have proposed that the world’s biggest retailer pay at least $600 million to resolve probes by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission into whether it bribed government officials in markets from Mexico to India and China, according to three people familiar with the matter. The retailer has rebuffed the government’s request, two of them said.  Such a settlement would rank among the largest in four decades under a U.S. law against bribing foreign officials to obtain business.  With the impasse, prosecutors have gone back to elicit more evidence from witnesses about alleged bribe-paying in Mexico, the people said. That will put additional pressure on the company to settle. Some of the people familiar with the matter said the U.S. could propose a penalty well above $600 million. The government has some challenges as well. Some of the behavior it’s been investigating in Mexico, where the bulk of Wal-Mart’s non-U.S. stores are located, may be too old to prosecute, people familiar with the matter have said. Officials are working to wrap up an agreement with Wal-Mart before a new administration takes over in January, the people said. That would add to the wave of enforcement actions already announced this year, including last week’s agreement by Och-Ziff Capital Management LP to pay $415 million in penalties and fines to settle an U.S. investigation into bribe-paying across Africa. "As we’ve said from the beginning, we are cooperating fully with the government in this matter and have no further comment on that process," Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt said in an e-mail. He added that the company’s compliance with anti-corruption laws is a priority and that the retailer was recognized this year by a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary for best governance program among large-cap companies.  Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. Wal-Mart said Thursday that net income for the year through January 2018 will be "relatively flat" as the company invests in its website and mobile app. The outlook sent shares sliding and signals that the retailer sees more work ahead as it attempts to compete with Amazon.com Inc. Shares dropped 2.8 percent to $69.66 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. Long-Running Investigation The Justice Department and the SEC have spent half a decade investigating allegations that Wal-Mart representatives paid government officials over the course of 10 years to fast-track store openings. The U.S.’s proposed penalty accounts for the profits Wal-Mart reaped from stores it was able to open quickly after allegedly paying officials to speed zoning and building permits, said the people, who asked to not be named because the matter is confidential. Calculating a fine based only on the amount of the alleged bribes, as the department has done in some cases, would yield a lower penalty, they said. Even as the sides are grappling over the size of a penalty, they are also discussing whether there will be any criminal charges against any part of the company, the people said. Management Turnover Wal-Mart has already spent $791 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world, it said. The retailer has had major turnover in management since the investigations began, including a new chief executive officer, chief financial officer and heads of U.S. and international operations. Wal-Mart has warned investors that it may face additional costs and a possible loss because of the investigation. It hasn’t said what those costs may be. "Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future," the company said in a regulatory filing in March. While settlement of $600 million or more would be substantial for a company that has gained attention and a competitive edge for its focus on counting pennies to hold down costs, it’s modest relative to the company’s recent global results. The company posted more than $14 billion in profits last year on $482 billion in sales. U.S. Focus Under Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, who took over in 2014, most of the company’s focus has been on improving its U.S. stores and online operations, rather than faster international expansion. Those efforts are starting to pay off, and the company’s shares have gained 13.6 percent this year. The Justice Department is wrapping up several of the marquee investigations started under President Barack Obama, including into financial-crisis-era behavior and benchmark manipulation. Several European banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, are negotiating settlements over their mortgage practices that officials are trying to close in the administration’s final months, people familiar with the situation have said. High Settlements The Wal-Mart settlement, as described, would rank among the highest levied under 1977’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans companies from bribing officials to win business overseas. Earlier this year, VimpelCom Ltd. paid $795 million to settle U.S. and Dutch claims that it bribed officials in Uzbekistan to win business. Siemens AG paid a record $800 million in a combined SEC-Justice Department penalty in 2008. Wal-Mart disclosed possible violations in Mexico to the Justice Department and SEC in November 2011. The following year, the New York Times outlined details of allegations that the retailer paid some $24 million to Mexican officials to win quick zoning changes, sidestep licenses and environmental permits and deflect opposition to open stores, turning Wal-Mart into the country’s largest private-sector employer. The Wal-Mart case has posed challenges for investigators, Bloomberg News reported in March. With much of the conduct in Mexico too old to be used as evidence, the government tried to build stronger cases around conduct found in Brazil and India, two people familiar with the matter have said. The probe into the company’s China operations, which represented the final phase of the investigation, didn’t uncover widespread bribes to government officials there, the people said. Prosecutors are also likely to charge the company for not having sufficient controls to detect and prevent corruption, two of the people said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Walmart Slowing Store Openings, Accelerating Distribution Centers Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Slowing Store Openings, Accelerating Distribution Centers Image courtesy of Will October 6, 2016 10:33 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler changing pace walmart SHIPPING amazon e-commerce online sales fewer stores slowing growth It’s no secret that Walmart is gunning for some of Amazon’s customer base: gobbling up e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion, mulling the idea of investing in Amazon competitor Flipkart, launching the $50/year Prime-rival Shipping Pass, and increasing distribution channels. As an indicator of the retailer’s online-focused future, Walmart has announced it is slowing the growth of its bricks-and-mortar stores while building more warehouses to expedite deliveries. The company said Thursday that it would begin to scale back the number of stores it plans to open in the U.S. over the next two years, with 130 stores opening in the next fiscal year (ending in Feb. 2017) and 55 in the 2018 fiscal year, USA Today reports. While the decrease in new stores — which will represent just 1% growth in 2018 — may come as a surprise, it probably shouldn’t. For starters, the company announced earlier this year it would actually close about 150 stores (though most of them were smaller-footprint Walmart Express locations), and it recently put many of its eggs in one basket: online sales. To that end, vice president of e-commerce supply chain Justen Traweek tells Reuters that Walmart is on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016. Previously, industry consultants had estimated Walmart would have just eight distribution centers by the end of 2017. The company also relies on more than 100 smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders, and 160 stores that serve as distribution centers, Reuters reports. Still, the large warehouses are perhaps the biggest cog in Walmart’s e-commerce strategy: the large buildings, with their abundance of products, allow the retailer to ship items in one package, rather than multiple packages from different stores around the country. In turn, this cuts down on the time it takes to ship products, putting the company and its $50 Shipping Pass more in line with Amazon’s two-day Prime membership shipping. “We have doubled our capacity in the last 12 months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,” Traweek tells Reuters, noting that the company could eventually offer one-day shipping. Online sales represent about $14 to $16 billion of Walmart’s approximate $355 billion in annual revenue, USA Today reports, citing Moody’s Investor Service. While online sales are just a small portion of Walmart’s bottomline, executives with the company expect that to change in the future as the retailer combines all of its services. “We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement to USA Today. “Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly — so that’s what we’re doing.” Wal-Mart’s next move against Amazon: More warehouses, faster shipping [Reuters] Walmart to slow U.S. store openings [USA Today] October 6, 2016 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler changing pace walmart SHIPPING amazon e-commerce online sales fewer stores slowing growth Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related Invading The Great White North Walmart Spending $270M On Canadian Expansion; Plans To Build 29 Supercenters In The Frozen North where's my stuff?

At Wal-Mart's annual meeting with investors in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Thursday, McMillon said he's fielded many questions over why a start-up entrepreneur such as Lore would want to partner with the corporate behemoth. "We're really more alike than people would guess, even though Jet's 'younger and cooler,' some might say," McMillon said. He likened Lore's focus on finding new ways to deliver savings to customers to the mindset of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, who built Wal-Mart's business by promising the lowest prices. Lore, who has been on the job 17 days, chimed in that he founded his e-commerce company on three core values: trust, transparency and fairness. Jet uses a pricing algorithm that allows customers to save money by adding more items to their basket, or paying with a credit card over a debit card. It also reduces the price shoppers pay if more of their items are shipped from the same distribution center. "We did live those values in a way that no company ever has," Lore said. "We are changing consumer behavior," he said, adding that he's "incredibly excited" about the assets he now has at his disposal through the Wal-Mart tie-up. Those include a network of fulfillment centers and sourcing capabilities that are "not even close" to what it had previously. Wal-Mart completed the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet last month. As of August, Jet.com had a run rate of $1.2 billion. It has acquired 5 million customers who average 6.9 units per order. In the first half of the year, Wal-Mart fell well behind its previous goal to grow online sales between 20 percent and 30 percent over three years. CFO Brett Biggs told investors that excluding the impact of its sale of Yihaodian, an online grocery business in China, earlier this year, Wal-Mart's digital sales should come in near that range in the back half. It could potentially top that level in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, Biggs said. "If Marc can be Marc within this company, then great things are going to happen," McMillon said.

CDT October 06, 2016 Walmart is cutting some back-office jobs (Photo: Custom) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Walmart expects to reduce its rate of new U.S. store openings to a trickle within the next two years as the big-box chain seeks to bolster its online business and improve its foreign operations. The retailer (WMT) said Thursday that it would open 130 stores in the 2017 fiscal year ending in February and 55 in the fiscal year ending in February 2018. For a giant company with nearly 4,600 stores nationwide, those projections reflect growth of only 1.1% in 2018 — a far cry from the retailer's 5.1% store growth rate in the 2016 fiscal year, when it added 161 small-format locations and 69 supercenters. In the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years, the company opened 52, 70, 141, 198 and 316 stores, respectively. The planned small-format openings in the U.S. include 70 in 2017 and 20 in 2018. Though Walmart's reputation for low prices and its massive size give the company a significant foothold in the market for everyday items, it is coming under assault from Amazon.com and other digital forces. Walmart projected that profit would be flat from 2017 to 2018 before growing 5% in 2019. Any signs of a slowdown may prove unnerving to investors who look to the company for steady earnings. “We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," Walmart CEODoug McMillon said in a statement. "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly — so that’s what we’re doing." Walmart also reiterated its 2017 earnings-per-share expectations of $4.29 to $4.49 and projected that capital expenditures would decline from $11.5 billion in 2016 to $11 billion in 2017 and 2018. The company recently sought to bolster its online presence with the $3 billion acquisition of Internet retailing start-up and would-be Amazon.com competitor Jet.com. That deal, along with other "incremental U.S. e-commerce operating investments" will "accelerate e-commerce growth," Walmart said in the filing. Online sales represent about $14 billion to $16 billion of Walmart's approximately $355 billion in annual U.S. revenue, according to Moody's Investor Service. Despite the small percentage, Moody's hailed the retailer's efforts. "While we think it’s still early yet, we believe that Walmart’s big upfront spend to grow online, among other steps in recent months, is showing early signs of promise," Moody's said in a research note. Walmart also said it is seeking "a sharpened focus in China," where competitors have taken a savvier approach, and "solid growth" in foreign markets such as Mexico and Canada.

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Wal-Mart plans to slow new store openings, invest in online Thursday Oct 6, 2016 at 10:43 AM Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The Associated Press Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $2.16, or 3 percent, to $69.51 in morning trading Thursday. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of other changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It's melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn't push the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. _____ ANNE D'INNOCENZIO, AP Retail Writer AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.

By Anthony Caskey The Brownsville Herald Four days of freedom ended Wednesday for one escaped Cameron County inmate when sheriffs depu-ties and members of an FBI task force captured him in a San Benito trailer. Benjamin Leal III was arrested without incident from a trailer near Stokely Park at about 12:45 p.m., Ca-meron County Chief Deputy Juan Mendoza said. Leal escaped from the maximum-security detention center in Olmito late Saturday. The 18-year-old Harlingen resident was being held at the jail on aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault charges. Investigators believe he spent most of his time since the breakout in a wooded area. He reportedly was spotted Tuesday at the San Benito Boys & Girls Club and sheriffs deputies were tipped off, Mendoza said, adding, We figured he had to be close. A trailer near the club is believed to be inhabited by a relative of Leals, and depu-ties watched it after receiving the tip, Mendoza said. When Leal returned to the trailer, a group of deputies and members of an FBI task force apprehended him, Mendoza said. Cantu said Leal was with three men who were also arrested and will be charged with hindering an apprehension, a third-degree felony. They knew he was an escapee and they didnt tell anyone, the sheriff said. Now theyre facing charges too. Brownsville resident Jose Luis Mendoza, 29, charged with auto theft and misdemeanor drug charges, also fled the jail Saturday and is still on the loose, Cantu said. But, Were real close to capturing him, Cantu said. The sheriffs department is not going to stop until we arrest the other one too. The two men are believed to have used plastic spoons to pick a lock to a broom closet in their cell and make their way through a crawl space to the roof of the jail and jump to freedom. It is the first escape from the $20 million maximum-security jail, which began holding inmates about three months ago. The incident prompted county officials to call for an examination of soft spots at the jail and call for more secure locks on doors. Mendoza said Leal would be monitored closely, and would not be going back to the pod from which he escaped. Discuss Print Posted in Local News on Friday, July 5, 2002 12:00 am.

Walmart pulls back, slows U.S. store openings Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY Thursday, 06-Oct-16 12:42:16 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Walmart expects to reduce its rate of new U.S. store openings to a trickle within the next two years as the big-box chain seeks to bolster its online business and improve its foreign operations. The retailer (WMT) said Thursday that it would open 130 stores in the 2017 fiscal year ending in February and 55 in the 2018 fiscal year ending in February 2018. For a giant company with nearly 4,600 stores nationwide, those projections reflect relatively inconsequential growth. In the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, the company added 198 and 316 stores, respectively, according to a securities filing. The planned small-format openings in the U.S. include 70 in 2017 and 20 in 2018, reflecting a sharp decline after opening 161 in 2016. Though Walmart's reputation for low prices and its massive size give the company a significant foothold in the market for everyday items, it is coming under assault from Amazon.com and other digital forces. Walmart projected that profit would be flat from 2017 to 2018 before growing 5% in 2019. Any signs of a slowdown may prove unnerving to investors who look to the company for steady earnings. The company's stock fell 2.1% in pre-market trading to $70.20. The projections include an additional $45 billion to $60 billion in revenue over the next three years, which would put the company above the half-trillion mark in annual sales. Still, Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told investors that the company must crack down on costs by "being tougher on third-party expenses, travel and things like that" and must improve store productivity and reduce excess inventory. "We're not where we want to be from an overall expense standpoint," he said Thursday. Walmart also reiterated its 2017 earnings-per-share expectations of $4.29 to $4.49 and projected that capital expenditures would decline from $11.5 billion in 2016 to $11 billion in 2017 and 2018. The company recently sought to bolster its online presence with the $3 billion acquisition of Internet retailing start-up and would-be Amazon.com competitor Jet.com. That deal, along with an increased investment in Chinese online retailer JD.com, will bolster Walmart's online acumen. The company projected annual online sales growth of 20% to 30% from the 2017 through 2019 fiscal years. Online sales represent only about $14 billion to $16 billion of Walmart's approximately $355 billion in annual U.S. revenue, according to Moody's Investor Service. Despite the small percentage, Moody's hailed the retailer's efforts. "Walmart's forecasts announced this morning are in line with our expectations, especially when the costs involved in building out its online capability are considered," Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said in a note. "It will take a while for the company to become a true multi-channel retailer, which occurs when cost efficiencies begin to generate and duplication reduces dramatically as physical assets and personnel are optimized." Walmart also said it is seeking "a sharpened focus in China," where competitors have taken a savvier approach, and "solid growth" in foreign markets such as Mexico and Canada. "We're seeing traction and the company is moving faster," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors. Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

 Walmart's CEO just signaled a massive change to its business model Hayley Peterson Oct. 6, 2016, 10:33 AM 20,407 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart CEO Doug McMillon says Walmart is transforming into an ecommerce company. AP Walmart is shifting its business model. Going forward, the nation's largest retailer doesn't want to be defined by its stores. "This company, over time, is going to look like more of an ecommerce company," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday at Walmart's annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas. He said stores will remain vital to Walmart's future. But the company will be cutting back on new store growth, focusing more on same-store sales — or sales at stores open at least a year — and growing investments in ecommerce. Walmart will open 130 US stores this year, down slightly from the 135 to 155 stores it had originally projected, and also down from the 230 stores that were opened last year.  Next year, it will open just 55 US stores, half of which will be its smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores.  In the meantime, Walmart has doubled its online fulfillment warehouses in the last year to 10, Reuters reports. Industry experts had expected Walmart to have just eight warehouses by the end of 2018. Walmart is trying to transform into an ecommerce company to better compete with Amazon, which had $107 billion in online sales last year, compared to Walmart's $13.7 billion in online sales in the period. But the majority of Walmart's business still comes from its stores.  The company's total revenue last year was $482 billion, meaning more than 97% of its business came from stores.  SEE ALSO: Walmart has a secret weapon that could one-up Amazon — but it hasn’t released it yet NOW WATCH: These are the best watches at every price point Loading video...

By: Reuters | Chicago | Updated: October 6, 2016 8:19 PM Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. (Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc is accelerating its investment in e-commerce in a bid to narrow the gap with Amazon.com Inc and to give it an even more dominant position against the rest of the field in retail. The world’s largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon’s robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. “We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,” Traweek said. Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. “These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon,” said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target and others. “Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them.” Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart’s overall sales. Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet’s founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart’s e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. “This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart’s speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience,” said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with Wal-Mart’s new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart’s $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP Inside Wal-Mart’s 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio’s from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That’s why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. “Anything that crimps Wal-Mart’s profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach,” he said. Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Walmart closed on its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest as it tries to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of the company’s annual revenue. The world’s biggest retailer also said Thursday that it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat versus its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. Walmart foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., outlined its plans for the next several years ahead of its meeting with investors Thursday. Executives are expected to offer more updates on how it will integrate its Jet.com business with its online operations and offer more insight into how it will compete against online leader Amazon.com. Related Articles September 19, 2016 Walmart completes $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com August 31, 2016 Colorado asks Walmart to sell “ugly” produce in local stores August 8, 2016 Walmart buys Jet.com for $3 billion “We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail,” said CEO Doug McMillon in a statement. “Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly – so that’s what we’re doing.” Like its direct store rivals, Walmart is reinventing itself to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Walmart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. Walmart has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It’s melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. It’s in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Walmart raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its Walmart U.S. namesake business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Walmart shares fell $2.16, or 3 percent, to $69.51 in morning trading Thursday. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. Target’s shares are down 6 percent for the year and are hovering at about $67. Last month, Walmart closed the deal to buy Jet.com. It believes that it will help it grab higher-income and younger customers and will be incorporating some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. But Walmart still has plenty of challenges. The company faces challenges in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. The company has been making some changes to bolster its business overseas. The company announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The move comes nearly four months after Walmart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. In the release issued Thursday, Walmart said it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the last fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Walmart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year that ended in January, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Walmart plans to open 60 supercenter stores and 70 small-format stores or what it calls its Neighborhood Market stores this year. And for next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller format stores. Walmart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

Twitter dived 17.9 percent after technology news site Recode said Google had no plans to bid for the social media company. Apple and Disney also are not interested in making a takeover offer, the article said. Dow member Wal-Mart Stores lost 2.5 percent after it projected that fiscal 2018 earnings would be flat amid a period of heavy investments in e-commerce and increased staff pay in the US. About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 18,188.79, down 0.5 percent. The broad-based S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent at 2,153.47, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.4 percent at 5,292.41. Analysts expect caution among investors ahead of Friday's US jobs report for September. Analysts have projected the economy added 176,000 jobs last month. Declines in Twitter and Wal-Mart were offset somewhat by gains in petroleum-linked equities after US oil prices shot above $50 a barrel in intraday trade for the first time since June. Dow member American Express lost 3.3 percent following a downgrade by Nomura. Lam Research advanced 2.4 percent while KLA-Tencor lost 0.1 percent as they announced they were shelving a plan to merge due to opposition from antitrust regulators. The two companies provide process control technology for the semiconductor industry. - AFP Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Tsunami hit New Zealand after quake...

Derek Russell in Entertainment, Lifestyle W. DEREK RUSSELL Do you ever try out one of those blood pressure cuff machines at Walmart or Fred’s? You know, the ones they put right out in front of the pharmacy so everyone can take a look at you and judge you for your numbers, like they’re copying off you for an upcoming test. I assure you, nobody would want to receive my grade. Up until about two years ago, I was pulling in numbers like 170 over 90 whenever I would stop off for a reading. To be fair, that was in a place like Walmart. Everyone’s blood pressure is higher in Walmart and if it’s not, then something is wrong with you. That’s why you shop local: Your blood pressure isn’t as high when you stay away from chain stores and shop local. But, for the sake of this piece, I actually was in Walmart one day on one of those machines that was trying to eat away my arm slowly, when I realized I had a problem. Now, to be fair, I’d been told I’d had a problem many times before. The first time I remember a doctor telling me I had ridiculously high blood pressure was when I was 19, so it took nearly a decade for me to do something about it. More often than not, that’s when I see people make a change in their lives – when they’re the ones behind the wheel of it. Convincing someone to change rarely makes them want to do so. In fact, it usually has the opposite impact in my experience. I finally got on medication in 2014 which helped considerably. During our recent health screenings at the Daily Journal, I had one of the lowest blood pressure readings I’ve ever had, probably since the days of me eating cereal in my pajamas and watching “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” on TV. Though, again, to be fair, that was just last Saturday. High blood pressure isn’t one of the things Saturday morning cartoons prepared me for as a child; they caution you on the dangers of quicksand and falling Acme anvils. I never saw He-Man stop off for a blood pressure test or Fred Flinstone drink a vial of Brontosaurus Barium to get ready for his colonoscopy. Yabba Dabba Do I have to drink the whole thing? I think cartoons should have been available for older age groups to deal with what you’re going through at that point in your life. Sure, when we were kids you could watch George Jetson trip and fall on the treadmill and call for Jane to get him off that crazy thing, but I would have appreciated an episode of “The Jetsons” later in life that helped you cope with death or Elroy overeating. Though, by the time we get to the future of “The Jetsons,” colonoscopies and death might be a thing of the past. Though, I am glad we never had to see Scooby-Doo or Garfield get put down by the vet or an aged-Speed Racer have his license taken away by his kids after one too many infractions. Later installments of “Inspector Gadget” might have revealed an episode where he shot an unarmed man, “Duck Tales” probably would have been impacted by the BP Oil spill, “Fat Albert” definitely had a foot amputated and Ms. Frizzle most likely got locked up for child endangerment against the “Magic School Bus” kids. It might be time for my medication. W. Derek Russell is the Daily Journal’s arts and entertainment reporter. Contact him @wderekrussell on Twitter or email him at derek.russell@journalinc.com.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 6, 2016 at 9:05AM A Wal-Mart store in India. Image Source: Wal-Mart. Months after making the biggest U.S. acquisition of an e-commerce company in history with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is back at it again. According to Bloomberg, the world's largest retailer "is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into Flipkart Online Services," India's largest online retailer. When rumors arose that Wal-Mart was in talks to buy Jet.com, the company announced a deal just days later, so it wouldn't be surprising to see yet another announcement in the coming days. The news comes at a time when India is becoming an increasingly important focus of companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which see tremendous growth in the world's largest democracy. With more than a billion consumers and a fast-growing economy, India may one day become a growth engine in the way that China is today. What is Flipkart? Founded in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart has grown to a valuation of $16 billion, making it India's most valuable start-up. Its homegrown talent has helped the company master a difficult country to do business in, one where hundreds of languages are spoken, few people have credit cards, and the infrastructure is unreliable. The founders surprised many by proving that e-commerce could work in India, but after several years of strong growth, sales are slowing, not least because of Amazon's efforts on the subcontinent. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has pledged to invest $5 billion into the Indian market, and the voracious e-commerce giant has a no-holds barred way of competing, promising to open a network of warehouses and do more last-mile deliveries. Now enter Wal-Mart. My enemy's enemy is my friend Just as Jet.com and Wal-Mart are teaming up to take on Amazon at home, so it seems that Wal-Mart is making a similar play with Flipkart in India. The retail giant has had mixed results in its adventures abroad. It has become a dominant retailer in Mexico and in other parts of Latin America but has struggled at times in Europe, and its performance in China has also been underwhelming. The company recently sold its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian for a 5% stake in JD.com, the No. 2 e-commerce site in China.    Wal-Mart India owns and operates 21 Best Price stores and previously partnered on a joint retail venture with Bharti Group, the country's largest telecom operator. That business was unsuccessful, however, and Wal-Mart sold its stake in the venture. A deal with Flipkart could be significant for both companies. Flipkart could use a $1 billion cash infusion from Wal-Mart to further expand and fend off Amazon, and both companies could benefit from each other's expertise. Wal-Mart has years of experience with things like marketing and building complex logistical systems, and Flipkart has come up with creative solutions for tackling operations in developing countries. An investment in Flipkart would also give Wal-Mart a strong horse in what will be one of the biggest e-commerce markets, while it's still developing. Wal-Mart seems to have learned its lesson from the U.S., as it waited much too long to take on Amazon directly in the domestic market, where it now has a near-insurmountable lead. A playbook for taking on Amazon Following the Jet.com acquisition, it's becoming clear that Wal-Mart is hoping to become a force in e-commerce in part by swallowing other companies. There's nothing wrong with its strategy, and in fact, it shows some wisdom -- Wal-Mart's biggest advantage may be its deep pockets and the fact that it isn't Amazon, as nearly every other online retailer is feeling the heat from the undisputed leader in the space. Amazon itself has employed a similar strategy throughout its history. Acquisitions like Zappos.com, Diapers.com-parent Quidisi, which shares a founder with Jet.com, and Kiva Technologies have helped establish Amazon in various markets. Since taking the helm in 2014, CEO Doug McMillon has promised to devote more attention to e-commerce, and Wal-Mart finally seems to be following through on that promise. It has scaled back on new store openings to save on capital expenditures, and it has rapidly expanded its online grocery pickup program, which has been well received. Its acquisition of Jet.com and potential partnership with Flipkart will add momentum to those efforts. Challenging Amazon won't be easy, but Wal-Mart is taking the right steps to establish itself in markets with the biggest opportunities. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The world's largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon's robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. "We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day," Traweek said. Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. "These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon," said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target and others. "Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them." Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart's overall sales. Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. "This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience," said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. "Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach," he said. Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000.

 Walmart has a secret weapon that could one-up Amazon — but it hasn’t released it yet Hayley Peterson Oct. 6, 2016, 9:16 AM 12,303 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joe Raedle/Getty Images Walmart has been aggressively investing in ecommerce to catch up to rival Amazon.  The retailer is cutting back on store growth over the next several years as it invests in digital, the company said Thursday. "This company over time is going to look like more of an ecommerce company," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at the company's annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas. Walmart will open 130 US stores this year, down slightly from the 135 to 155 stores it had originally projected, and also down from the 230 stores that were opened last year.  Next year, it will open just 55 US stores, half of which will be its smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores.  In the meantime, Walmart has doubled its online fulfillment warehouses in the last year to 10, Reuters reports. Industry experts had expected Walmart to have just eight warehouses by the end of 2018.  The company says it's now capable of shipping packages to 70% of America within one day, according to Reuters. But it can't do so profitably, so it hasn't rolled out the service or advertised it to customers just yet. Amazon currently offers two-day delivery to members of its Prime program, who pay $99 annually for the service.  Walmart has been ramping up investments in ecommerce as it tries to catch up to Amazon, which had $107 billion in online sales last year, compared to Walmart's $13.7 billion in online sales in the period. As part of its bid to take on Amazon, Walmart recently purchased online retailer Jet.com. The company has said it expects Jet.com to accelerate its ecommerce growth. "We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement Thursday. "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly - so that’s what we’re doing."

Belvedere | @Matt_Belvedere Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 8:53 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters <p>Election offers clear economic choice: David Malpass</p> <p>David Malpass, Trump economic advisor, talks about Donald Trump&#039;s plan for economic change and how it will work.</p> Election offers clear economic choice: David Malpass    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 7:32 AM ET | 02:41 From Wal-Mart to the Federal Reserve to the International Monetary Fund, there are new signs the U.S. economy is on the wrong track, a senior economic advisor to the Donald Trump campaign told CNBC on Thursday. To make his point, David Malpass cited conservative news from Wal-Mart that broke just before his appearance on "Squawk Box." The giant retailer on Thursday morning reiterated its guidance for the current fiscal year, and said there would be fewer store openings than originally planned and a significantly slower store-opening pace in fiscal 2018. It also predicted flat earnings next year. "The election presents a choice. Do you want the current policies, which Wal-Mart has given us a very clear forecast [of] ... or do you want some different for the U.S.?" asked Malpass, president of economic and market research firm Encima Global. Malpass accuses Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton of advocating the status quo from the failed years of President Barack Obama that's produced just 2 percent economic growth. "Trump is saying that's 'definitely not good enough for workers in America, for small business, for minorities. This system that they're doing is simply failing.' We have to have massive change," Malpass said. As more ammunition for his argument, Malpass pointed to the Fed's reduction in projected full-year gross domestic product to 1.8 percent, following its September policy meeting, at which central bankers held interest rates steady. Malpass said the IMF's new forecast for growth this week add to the urgent need for the GOP presidential nominee's ideas to boost the economy. "That's the whole point of the campaign — to change taxes [and] regulatory policy." On Tuesday, the IMF said advanced economies, including the U.S., will slow this year to 1.6 percent growth, compared with 2.1 percent last year and the group's July forecast of 1.8 percent. "Think of all the benefits that come from faster growth," Malpass said. "As you grow faster, Wal-Mart does better, everyone does better."

Justin Daniel Sturm, 28, of Ubly, was sentenced Monday to seven to 40 years for conducting a criminal enterprise; two to 20 years for breaking and entering a building with intent to commit larceny therein; and one year for heroin possession. Each sentence was enhanced by Sturm’s status as a third-offense habitual offender, which doubles the maximum sentence. Derrick Nicholas Grifka, 23, of Ubly, was sentenced in August to five to 25 years for a conviction of conducting a criminal enterprise and for being a fourth-offense habitual offender. Due to his prior criminal history, he had faced up to life in prison. Brad Allen Galloway, 33, of Caseville, pleaded guilty on Aug. 29 to a charge of conducting a criminal enterprise and to being a third-offense habitual offender. Combined, the convictions carry a possible maximum prison sentence of 40 years. He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 24. Sturm and his two associates took the televisions by loading them onto carts and walking out with them through the store’s front doors. They then transported the stolen items to Flint, where they traded the items for heroin. In total, the televisions were valued at $18,985. Grifka and Sturm were both ordered to pay their share of the cost in restitution to Walmart, and the same order is expected when Galloway is sentenced. Huron County Prosecutor Timothy J. Rutkowski said the men typically worked in two-man teams while stealing the televisions. Sturm and Grifka were present during seven of the 11 incidents, and Galloway took part in nine of the thefts. Sturm’s breaking and entering conviction was for a theft from Thumb Pawn, which was unrelated to the Walmart case. Co-defendant William John Messing said he was unaware Sturm was stealing items from the store until Sturm returned to the vehicle Messing was driving. Since Messing assisted Sturm by helping him leave the site with the stolen goods, he was also charged with breaking and entering with intent. On Monday, Sept. 26, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 60 days held in abeyance, and 18 months probation. Before his sentence was read, Sturm apologized to the court and stated his crimes were linked to his drug addiction. In a letter Sturm submitted to the court, he said he was doing well following his release from prison approximately five years ago. Then, he was injured in an automobile accident, which also nearly killed his best friend. “Even though I had a really good job, I couldn’t keep up, and that’s when everything spiraled out of control. I was scared to ask for help until it was pretty much too late,” Sturm wrote. On the date of his arrest, May 20, he was scheduled to begin treatment at a rehabilitation facility. Rutkowski said he requested a sentence of 12 to 14 years, which fell within the guideline range. Defense attorney Dallas Rooney asked for leniency, arguing that all Sturm’s crimes involved property, not violence against people. Rutkowski said just because Sturm did not directly attack a person doesn’t mean people were not injured by his crimes. “People are affected,” Rutkowski said. “Business owners are losing money, and they have to try to get that money back by charging honest customers more. It affects the rest of society.” He said a lengthy prison sentence will serve to protect the community. “Sturm’s not going to change. His history is littered with thefts,” Rutkowski said. Sturm received 136 days credit for time served. He was ordered to pay $594 fines and costs.

The world's largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. FILE - This Sept. 19, 2013, file photo, shows the sign of a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. Wal-Mart said Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, it plans to slow new store openings as it looks to pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Wal-Mart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company's shares fell $2.12, or 3 percent, to $69.55 in afternoon trading. Still, the outlook wasn't as bad as a year ago, when executives said earnings per share could fall 6 percent to 12 percent this year because of investments in higher salaries and e-commerce. That day, Wal-Mart shares plunged 10 percent. But Wal-Mart's flurry of moves — online and in the stores — have been gaining traction, and its shares were up 17 percent this year ahead of the meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. Wal-Mart launched a number of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. The company is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart's U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year. In contrast, rival Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Wal-Mart's online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter — up from 7 percent in the first quarter but still trailing the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Officials said Thursday they believe its global online sales will be up 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year. Wal-Mart also reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. McMillon stressed to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help the company attract higher-income and younger customers. Wal-Mart plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges. Analysts questioned whether the price cuts that Wal-Mart is taking will be sustainable as rivals respond. And they asked executives how much profit they would be willing to risk. Wal-Mart had said it is spending several billion dollars in its plans to lower prices, but haven't given any specific details. McMillon declined to talk about how much farther they would be willing to go. Wal-Mart did say Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. ___ AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report. ___ Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

(NYSE: WMT) fell in pre-market trading after the company guided flat EPS for the fiscal year 2018. The company, however, reaffirmed its forecast for the fiscal year 2017. The retailer will also be outlining its strategic framework during the investment community meeting on Thursday. The company indicated the following four key focus areas for continuing its success: Make shopping easier for buy families Disciplined operation with a focus on cost management Most trust retailer Place the company to win to deliver results Wal-Mart reaffirmed its adjusted EPS guidance of $4.15-$4.35 and GAAP EPS of $4.29-$4.49 for the fiscal year 2017. While projecting GAAP EPS to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2018, the company expects to deliver about 5 percent growth in EPS in fiscal year 2019. The company expects to spend on e-commerce to accelerate growth in the sector. President and CEO, Doug McMillon, commented, "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail. Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly - so that's what we're doing." The stock fell $1.54, or 2.15 percent, to $70.00 in the pre-market trading.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Wal-Mart plans bigger e-commerce shift, tempers profit view By Reuters Published: 14:22 EST, 6 October 2016 | Updated: 14:22 EST, 6 October 2016 e-mail By Nandita Bose CHICAGO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it plans to focus heavily on its e-commerce operations on Thursday and warned investors that the cost of the long-term plan would weigh on earnings over the next two years. The strategy by the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which includes slowing the pace of new store openings, is centered on cracking the dominance of Amazon.com Inc in online retailing and face off against other rivals like Target. Wal-Mart's shares were down 2.9 percent in afternoon trading at $69.59. "This company over time will look like an e-commerce company," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Wal-Mart's plan includes doubling the number of its large warehouses focused on e-commerce sales to 10 in 2016, Reuters reported. It now has the ability to ship to most of the United States in one day. The company spent more than $3 billion in August to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com, which attracts millennial shoppers, and could help boost sales. Wal-Mart is looking for online sales growth of 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, and for even faster growth in the next few years. Online sales currently account for about 3 percent of total sales. Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenses at about $11 billion, similar to this year. Fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth is now likely to be at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent. While the investments in online growth will be a challenge to margins, they are "essential for future-proofing the business for the long run", Cowen & Co analysts said in a research note. The company has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 percent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added. In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart plans to build 35 supercenters compared to 69 last year. It will only open 20 neighborhood markets from 161 last year.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Twitter — Alphabet's Google unit will not move ahead with a bid to acquire Twitter, and that Walt Disney and Apple were also unlikely to be suitors, according to Recode. Wal-Mart — The retailer reiterated its prior financial guidance for this year, and said it expected earnings to be flat next year compared with this year and then up 5 percent the following year. The retailer plans to slow new store growth, and added that it is very strong financially and has flexibility and options that competitors do not have. Wal-Mart executives will discuss these matters in detail at today's Investor Day. Mylan — The drugmaker overcharged Medicaid for its EpiPen over two decades, according to Democratic Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Frank Pallone of New Jersey. They say a letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services backs their view that the product was incorrectly classified as a generic drug since the fourth quarter of 1997. Mylan said the product has been classified correctly. Yum Brands — Yum reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.09 per share, missing estimates by a penny a share. The restaurant operator's revenue also was below forecasts. The parent of KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza hut also reported a one percent drop in China same-store sales, compared to estimates of a 4.5 percent increase. L Brands — The Victoria's Secret parent reported a three percent increase in September same-store sales, well above the 0.1 percent increase estimated by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals — The drug company will stop development of a drug designed to treat a genetic condition that can cause heart failure. The action follows negative results from a late-stage study. Tesla — Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla to "neutral" from "buy," and lowered its six-month price target to $185 from $240 per share. Goldman sees increased risk for the automaker owing to its deployment of capital for the takeover of SolarCity, and a potential further delay in the launch of the Model 3. Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health — UBS began coverage on both drugstore operators with "buy" ratings, praising the "integrated approach to care management" practiced by CVS, and the broadness of Walgreens product offerings. Abercrombie & Fitch — The apparel retailer was downgraded to "sector weight" from "overweight" at KeyBanc, citing a heavier promotional environment. AT&T — AT&T has struck a multi-year strategic deal with Amazon Web Services, with the two companies collaborating on cloud and networking capabilities. MetLife — MetLife plans to spin off its U.S. life insurance business to existing shareholders. It had announced earlier this year that it would separate that unit and rename it Brighthouse Financial, but had not yet chosen the method of separation at that time. The news came in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, and does not necessarily preclude a change to a different option such as an initial public offering. JD.com — The shares are getting a boost on news that Wal-Mart is nearly doubling its investment in the China-based online retailer to about 10.8 percent. The Wall Street Journal reports that the move also gives Wal-Mart observer status at JD.com's board meetings. KLA-Tencor, Lam Research — The companies have canceled their planned $10.6 billion merger. The two semiconductor companies pointed to Justice Department opposition to the deal on antitrust grounds. Deutsche Bank — The German lender has not been in violation of money laundering rules in Russia, according to a Reuters report, which said a German financial watchdog has found no evidence of wrongdoing. Costco — The warehouse retailer reported a September same-store sales increase of one percent, doubling the Thomson Reuters estimate of a 0.5 percent rise. BlackBerry — BlackBerry sales executive Alex Thurber told the BBC that a new keyboard-based BlackBerry device will be on the market within six months. —By CNBC's Peter Schacknow Questions? Comments?

While cross-dressing on Halloween can be harmless, it's the term 'tranny' being used to market a men's costume that goes too far for many transgender people.  Scroll down for video  An offensive 'Tranny Granny' costume has been pulled from the websites of Walmart, Amazon and Target The costume was being sold by a third-party vendor called Rasta Imposta. We’re appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with,' a Walmart spokesman said 'The word "tranny" and the stigma associated with it is often used to humiliate, dehumanize and degrade transgender women in a way that challenges and discredits our womanhood,' Ashlee Marie Preston, a transgender activist, told Mic. 'When society refuses to view us as women, we are instantly filed away under the "it" category and stripped of our humanity.' After complaints, both Amazon and Walmart pulled the product from their website on Tuesday, and Target - which had been selling the costume under the name 'Women's Granny Costume' - followed suit on Wednesday.  All three retailers had the costume listed by a third-party vendor called Rasta Imposta.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Insta-famous fashion designers you NEED to know: The top... First THAT dress divided the internet, now The Bag has... Share this article Share Walmart told LGBTQNation that the costume 'obviously' violated its terms of service for third-party retailers. It's unclear how the team dedicated to reviewing these products let it slip through the cracks.   'While it’s listed on other sites, it clearly violates our policy and was quickly removed once we were notified. We’re appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with,' a spokesman said.   The 'Tranny Granny' costume was produced to be sold at $64, but was discounted to around $25 on most sites.   The costume is somewhat remniscent of the 'Call Me Caitlyn' costume which surfaced last year, parodying Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover. The costume was met with widespread criticism and was eventually pulled from several retailers.    Read more: The year's first transphobic Halloween costume, the "Tranny Granny," has arrived | Mic UPDATED: Walmart yanks ‘tranny granny’ Halloween costume from website / LGBTQ Nation Share or comment on this article e-mail 373 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A        Remember the old TV commercials promoting cotton? “The Fabric of Our Lives,” went the sentimental-sounding jingle. Many Americans still prefer cotton clothing and bedding. We’ll even pay extra for it. The world’s best cotton comes from Egypt. Sheets made from Egyptian cotton can cost three times as much as other varieties. Which raises a question: When the package says your sheets are Egyptian cotton, how do you know that’s true? We assume that big retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) buy from trustworthy sources and would not sell mislabeled products. That turns out to not always be true. Both Target and Wal-Mart recently cut ties with Welspun, an Indian textile company that sold them millions of fake cotton sheets. This apparently went on for years. It did not occur to them that Egypt doesn’t produce nearly enough cotton to account for all the products labeled as such. In any case, the companies have now stopped selling Welspun products, offered refunds to customers who bought them and are investigating their supply chains. All good moves, but it gives me another question. What other fake products are these big chain stores selling? I can give you one example. My wife owns a hair salon and sells Paul Mitchell hair products. Paul Mitchell sells only through professional hair stylists. All their distributors are under contract not to sell the products to anyone else. Yet you can still find Paul Mitchell bottles on grocery and drug store shelves. All of them are counterfeit, old or stolen. If you bought your Paul Mitchell shampoo at Target, you are applying unknown and possibly toxic substances to your head every day. Good luck with that. The retailers refund anyone who complains, but are otherwise unconcerned. Today’s far-flung global supply chains bring lower prices, but they have another cost. We can never be sure that we are really getting what we expect. As one cotton expert told Bloomberg News: “Customers want a better and better price, and the retailer applies that same pressure all the way through the supply chain. So what do the suppliers do? They cheat.” I feel sure this Egyptian cotton episode is the tip of the iceberg. Does Wal-Mart really know the origin of everything it sells? I’m sure they try, but it can’t be easy. Their stores must have all kinds of fake products. Ditto for Target and many others. Is this really a big deal? If you like your sheets and you thought the price was fair, maybe no harm done. The problem is that people and companies who get away with small deceptions often move on to larger ones. Then we end up buying products that aren’t just overpriced, but also dangerous and unsafe. Why did Target and Wal-Mart suddenly take interest in cotton sheets when they sell so many other thinly-sourced products? I don’t know, but it will be a giant problem if they start applying the new cotton-sourcing standard to everything in their stores.

(NYSE:WMT) is taking aggressive measures to try to bolster its e-commerce business and better compete with its main foe, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In its biggest move, Wal-Mart is scaling up its number of warehouses to cut down on shipping times for online orders. From Bloomberg: The world’s largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. The company has also invested a great deal of time and money in upgrading its technological infrastructure, including state-of-the art robotic facilities: Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon’s robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. “We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,” Traweek said. According to Bloomberg, Wal-Mart has spent about $3 billion over the past four years alone to boost its e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company has also been busy with M&A, recently acquiring Jet.com and installing its CEO, Marc Lore, as the new head of its online business. These initiatives should help the company reach more shoppers and deliver goods faster. And while it may never catch Amazon on the e-commerce side, it can certainly widen the gap between its online business and those of other competitors. WMT shares rose $0.61 (+0.85%) to $72.28 in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, WMT has gained 16.92%, versus a 5.76% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

Thursday, the world's largest retailer will hold its annual investor day -- and it should have a vastly different tone than the last two. The past two meetings were almost held with a dark cloud overhead in the form of Walmart's U.S sales growth continuing to be tepid, online sales growth being mixed at best, and a sense that Amazon AMZN would wipe the company out in the lifetimes of broke millennials. Moreover, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon was still getting his sea legs - which was to be expected any time someone of such youth (despite his immense experience) assumes a position atop an enormous global organization. In all honesty, the last two events mostly involved Walmart playing defense against long-time retail stock analysts with buy ratings who were growing concerned about the future outlook for Sam Walton's creation. Now the narrative around Walmart has noticeably shifted. It could win against Amazon even as the tech giant rolls out digital assistants that could order toothpaste from Target (TGT) if needed. It could continue to open up profitable stores across the country, especially smaller ones that target grocery stores such as Kroger (K) . Walmart does have the right mix of executives, which now includes Jet.com founder Marc Lore. It could regain the trust of consumers who were for years let down by poor customer service and too high a price for a tomato in some cases. And it could see a solid return on massive investments being made in people, processes and technology. Hence, Walmart's shares have turned in a good year while Target's have lagged (due to the company's operational hiccups). Here is what to be watching for during this year's event: Long-term guidance: Gut instinct and having followed Walmart for so long tell me the company may not bump up its long-term sales guidance or its 2016 earnings per share outlook. This management team seems to enjoy surprising skeptics to the upside and watching the stock act accordingly. At its last investor day, Walmart projected sales growth over the next three years of between 3% and 4%. If Walmart reiterates the long-term sales outlook, it may upset some new entrants into the stock but should leave longer-term holders feeling OK that Walmart is still positioned to beat and raise Wall Street estimates (which has been a key driver of the stock). The wildcard in terms of estimates is what Walmart outlines for earnings in 2017. Last year, Walmart noted it sees EPS really starting to re-accelerate in 2018 to the tune of 5% to 10%. Next year, theoretically, is an unknown as Walmart will likely guide to another year of heavy investment in people and e-commerce (Jet.com notably). I wouldn't expect a shocking EPS outlook (the initial 2016 outlook for as much as a 12% drop came as a surprise to Wall Street) as Walmart doesn't want to destroy the goodwill it has built up. But there is a real chance it forecasts a year of pressured earnings before a possible stronger-than-guided pick-up in 2018. New store growth: Walmart has drastically slowed down the number of store openings for this year as compared to 2015. That was divulged at least year's meeting, and reflected the company's need to ramp up investments in people and e-commerce. Believe it or not, if Walmart signaled another year of slower store growth -- which is highly likely -- the market may view it favorably. It would show that the company is taking expense management seriously, which is important considering how much it's investing to slash prices and bulk up in other areas. Fewer Walmart store openings are a good thing, letting the company get the processes down in order to drive better productivity from existing boxes. All in all, the day should be neutral if not modestly positive for Walmart. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money. Click the "+Follow" next to my byline to this article.

The world's largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon's robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. "We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day," Traweek said. Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. "These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon," said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target and others. "Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them." Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart's overall sales. Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. "This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience," said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. "Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach," he said. Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000.

"The market was quiet and calm today with price action seen on JD's notes," said a Hong Kong-based investment-grade trader. He noted that JD's 2016s were 7bp tighter this morning after a report on Walmart's investment, but profit taking came into play in the afternoon. In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Walmart said it held a 10.8% passive stake in JD.com as of October 5. It had earlier reported a 5.9% stake in the company as of June 20. "With mainland investors still on holiday and Hong Kong off next Monday, we will not see much activity until new deals come out later next week," said the trader.

In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Wal-Mart said that it has upped its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent.

Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, aims to boost global online growth. It recently closed on a deal to buy fast-growing US online retailer Jet.com for a purchase price of $3 billion.

In a filing with the US regulator Securities and Exchange Commission, the American retailer—which does business as Walmart—has said it owns more than 9% of shares in JD. This is up from the 5% stake Walmart obtained after selling its Chinese online division to JD in June this year. Walmart’s ambitions in Asia, especially in the online retail segment, is becoming evident day by day. Media reports previously said Walmart is planning to invest $1 billion in India’s largest etailer Flipkart. The Economic Times had reported last month, citing sources it didn’t name, that “the companies are engaged in early talks and a meeting is scheduled soon”. These discussions, reportedly, include the world’s largest retailer picking up a minority stake in Flipkart. A Walmart India spokesperson had told Techcircle.in that “as a policy we don’t comment on speculative reports”. Flipkart too didn’t verify the news saying that “it is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” Techcircle.in had written in August about a possible deal between Walmart and Flipkart when the American retail giant bought US web retailer Jet.com. Walmart had bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion in the largest ever buyout of a US e-commerce startup. Walmart acquired minority stake in JD for about $1.5 billion. According to the report in The Economic Times, the ongoing discussions may lead to a similar deal with India’s Flipkart. A Bloomberg report pegged the likely investment amount at $1 billion. Earlier this month, Walmart India CEO Krish Iyer had said at an event that the company was evaluating the policy guidelines of 100% foreign direct investment in food retail. Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. The company had formed an equal joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises. However, in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. Walmart operates 21 Best Price wholesale offline stores in nine states in India. E-commerce sales in the US in 2015 totalled $340 billion, a 14.6% increase over $298.3 billion in 2014, according to non-adjusted estimates released by the US Department of Commerce. India, according to industry body Assocham, is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world and is likely to touch $38-billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year, a 67% jump over the $23 billion it clocked last year. Still, it is tiny in comparison with the US. Clearly, the online markets of India and China cannot be ignored by Walmart if it has to have a stronghold in Asia. Like this report?

New York: Walmart Stores Inc. has increased its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site. In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, WalMart said that it has upped its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The move comes nearly four months after Walmart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is trying to improve its business in China, which is lucrative but increasingly challenging. In China, Walmart faces a business that has been slow and uneven. It operates more than 400 stores despite entering the country 20 years ago. It sees bolstering its online business as the future in China. Walmart said at the time that it announced its initial stake that it could see a tremendous amount of traffic from JD.com's huge customer base and its same-day delivery network. Getting China right is key to strengthening Wal-Mart's global online business. In September, it completed its deal to buy fast-growing U.S. online retailer Jet.com for a purchase price of $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Wal-Mart's global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago.

But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Walmart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Walmart is America’s largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Walmart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school — and hardest to replicate — asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Walmart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. “We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, told investors last year. “The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner.” And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Walmart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. Walmart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. “I physically have no room in the cart,” said Brummel, 33. “It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over.” Walmart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Walmart. “They’ve historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat,” said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Walmart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Walmart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > Walmart has allocated parking spaces for online grocery-pickup customers so that they may get in and out of the lot quickly. © Sarah Halzack/The Washington Post ‘The trust fall’ At the Walmart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Walmart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. “We teach them how to tell the firmness — this one actually feels really good,” Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable’s brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Walmart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they’re selecting for customers. There’s a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Walmart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is “the trust fall,” the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it’s because “I like to select fresh products for myself,” according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn’t quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. Personal shopper April Styers gathers the orders, making her way through the store pushing a wheeled cart outfitted with four rows of blue bins that allow her to keep each order separate. As she stops in front of the Honeycrisp apples, she spins each one in her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze before bagging it and placing it in the cart. “If I’m not going to eat it,” Styers said, “then I’m not going to give it to anybody else.” The value of the store In Walmart’s version of pickup, which is not yet available in the greater Washington area, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store’s grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Walmart Grocery app. It’s a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Walmart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer’s front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Walmart doesn’t have to reinvent its supply chain — it is already getting these goods to its stores. “That is the opportunity. They’re redeploying an asset they already have,” said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it’s extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. “The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves,” said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Walmart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, “being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible.” At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. “I have two little ones in the back,” said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. “To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour.” The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Walmart customer, and that they are often people who weren’t buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Walmart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Walmart store. “That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers,” said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. “Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked — I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I’m on my way,” Mishev said.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Caption Stronger than the Storm: Central Florida survives two days of Hurricane Matthew On October 6 and 7, 2016, Orlando Sentinel reporters and photographers covered Hurricane Matthew's impact on Central Florida with the goal of keeping locals and visitors alike safe and informed with all the current storm information. On October 6 and 7, 2016, Orlando Sentinel reporters and photographers covered Hurricane Matthew's impact on Central Florida with the goal of keeping locals and visitors alike safe and informed with all the current storm information. Kyle ArnoldContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Hurricane Matthew: Stores run out of essential foods, gas as storm approaches Water, bread and other emergency preparation essentials are running low at many area supermarkets as people get ready for Hurricane Matthew. Wal-Mart and Publix stores throughout the region Wednesday were down to the last varieties of bread, water had disappeared from store shelves, and canned food was going fast. Publix, Winn-Dixie and Wal-Mart are all bringing extra trucks to accommodate the rush demand, which is only expected to increase as Hurricane Matthew makes its anticipated pass by Central Florida early Friday. Some gas stations ran out of fuel and had a tough time keeping up with anxious drivers topping off vehicles. "It looks like there have been shortages at a few stations, but it's not because of an overall supply problem. Some stations are just getting a lot of demand all at once," AAA spokesman Mark Jenkins said. PICTURE GALLERY: Check out photos of Hurricane Matthew as the storm affects Orlando and the rest of Central Florida. A spokeswoman for RaceTrac confirmed that. "A few stations have run out of gas here and there, but it's not a widespread thing. We are getting stations refueled pretty quickly," said Karissa Bursch at RaceTrac. Trucks were resupplying stations from tanks at Port Canaveral, but that facility was being closed at 3 p.m., port officials said. Propane has also run out at most retailers, and new shipments aren't expected at some stores until after the storm. Winter Park resident Leon Greenwood waited in line for nearly 30 minutes to get a full propane tank at Costco. "I've never seen a line so long," he said. After that, he headed to a Wawa gas station in eastern Orlando to fill up two 5-gallon gas cans. Lowe's manager Candace Hartley said only stores on the coasts would get new shipments before the storm. "We are out of batteries, flashlights and tarps," Hartley said. "But they are sending all new shipments to Titusville and the coast, the areas with the greatest need." Home improvement stores saw a rush of customers Wednesday looking for generators, fans, plywood and tools. Zach Rowe loaded up a cart at The Home Depot in east Orlando with a first-aid kit, tarps and plywood, hoping that he won't need them ahead of the storm. Rowe is helping organize the Orlando Come Out With Pride parade scheduled for Friday. "I've been through this so many times myself that I'm not really doing much at my house," Rowe said Wednesday. "Maybe if things still look bad tomorrow, I'll get myself prepared." karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; on Twitter @kylelarnold Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel AAA Hurricane Matthew: What to expect where you live Hurricane Matthew sandbag and shelter locations in Central Florida Preparing for Hurricane Matthew - Orlando News Now All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 70°

In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Wal-Mart said that it has upped its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The move comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is trying to improve its business in China, which is lucrative but increasingly challenging. In China, Wal-Mart faces a business that has been slow and uneven. It operates more than 400 stores despite entering the country 20 years ago. It sees bolstering its online business as the future in China. Wal-Mart said at the time that it announced its initial stake that it could see a tremendous amount of traffic from JD.com's huge customer base and its same-day delivery network. Getting China right is key to strengthening Wal-Mart's global online business. In September, it completed its deal to buy fast-growing U.S. online retailer Jet.com for a purchase price of $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Wal-Mart's global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Wal-Mart Stores paid $300 million in stock in addition to $3 billion in cash for Jet.com.

Dalton Police Department are asking for help identifying this woman they suspect of assisting in shoplifting a laptop from the Shugart Road Walmart on Sunday, Oct. 2. Dalton Police Department are asking for help identifying... Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. The Dalton Police Department is looking for help identifying two people who they say shoplifted a laptop from Walmart by jamming it down the pants of one of the suspects while the other served as a lookout. The alleged theft happened at the Shugart Road Walmart at approximately 3 p.m. on October 2. Two suspects were caught on camera and arrived together in a dark-colored Dodge Durango, according to a release from Dalton police. The pair went directly to the electronics section at the back of the store and the woman looked out for witnesses while the man unclipped a display laptop from its base. He then shoved the laptop down the front of his pants and left through the grocery store exit while she left through the pharmacy exit. The stolen laptop is a silver HP computer, model number 15AU018WM with the serial number 5CD61953JY and is valued at $799. The man wore a red and white striped v-neck t-shirt with blue jeans and a dark baseball cap and he appears to have facial hair in surveillance images. The woman is described as heavyset and wore glasses with dark hair and she wore a dark t-shirt and jeans. Anyone with information about the suspects or the alleged crime should contact Detective Jacob Burger at 706-278-9085, dial 9 and enter extension 325.

For $24.99, here’s what you get, according to an ad for the item on a web retailer still displaying the costume: INCLUDES: Includes Dress, Head Scarf, Butt and Boobs Broom, Stockings, Slippers, Cigarette and Glasses Not Included Neither Walmart nor Amazon were selling the costume directly. Instead, a third party vendor posted the item on the store’s websites. In response, Walmart told Browning, “While it’s listed on other sites, it clearly violates our policy and was quickly removed once we were notified. We’re appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with.” Walmart added gender identity protection for employees in 2011. Its LGBT employee resource group marched in this year’s Alan Ross Texas Freedom Parade. And like Target, it doesn’t care which bathroom its transgender customers choose to pee in. — David Taffet | Follow Me on Twitter Comments (powered by FaceBook) Related posts: GLAD to file suit against Walmart for same-sex marriage discrimination Anti-gay Walmart to add 12 stores in Dallas WalMart Selling LDS Anti-Gay Children’s Book Labor Day, Walmart and me Advocates urge Amazon to stop funding Boy Scouts This entry was posted in Instant Tea, news.

Gina Northrop was shopping with her husband and eight year old daughter Monday night at the Walmart store on Route 3 in the town of Watertown. She said she took a pair of children's boots off a hanger, pulled paper out of one of them and reached into the other to pull out more paper. That's when she felt pain. "And then I looked and I was bleeding so I turned the boot upside down and a razor fell out," she said. Northrop said she left her daughter with her husband and immediately went to wash the wound. She said she reported the incident to store management, who assured her they would inspect all footwear. Northrop said Walmart's asset protection manager reviewed security camera video, which records the previous 24 hours, and saw no suspicious activity. She said she plans to file a report with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. Northrop decided against seeking medical attention for the injury, which she described as a "small puncture." She took a photo of the razor blade, which she says looks identical to one found in a new pair of shoes a woman bought at a Walmart in Texas. "They need to find out if this is some disgruntled factory worker who's putting razors in shoes. They need to find out where the distribution center is and I don't fell like they're doing that," she said. Northrop said she has empathy for Walmart and its employees, but will likely not shop at the retail chain in the future. "I'm not going to open shoes anymore and not check inside for razors. I'll be checking my merchandise before I use it for sure," she said. When asked for comment, the Watertown Walmart store referred 7 News to the retailer's media relations department. Erica Jones, senior manager of corporate communications, issued the following statement: "We are dumbfounded that someone would do this in our store; this is appalling. We immediately checked all of our shoes and have also done follow-up checks. Additionally, we are working (with) police and encourage anyone with information to share it with them," said Next Article One Killed in Waddington Fire Most Popular A Fond Farewell: Thompson Park Playground To Be Torn Down Next Week Watch the video Watch: Christmas Comes Early In Carthage Watch the video Federal Team Awarded For Work On SLC Amish Kidnapping Case Fire Destroys Barn In Town Of Morristown Watch the video Watertown CSD To Offer Full Day Pre-K To 3-Year-Olds Watch the video Sunday, November 13, 2016 , Watertown, NY On Demand Videos RSS Mobile Twitter Facebook Pinterest CBS Video Player Fox This content requires the latest Adobe Flash Player and a browser with JavaScript enabled.

Tim Gordon / KGW of Autoplay Pause Show Thumbnails Show Captions Clark County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Fred Neiman said some employees hid and locked their doors, while others ran outside once the gunman started firing. Neiman said workers "did the right thing" by evacuating or taking refuge and calling police. He says the gunman did fire rounds inside the store, but he did not immediately know what was struck or how many rounds were fired. He also did not know a possible motive, or how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting. An employee told KGW that the shooting took place near the Subway restaurant inside the store. Steve Gallas is a new employee who says he just had emergency training on Tuesday.  But nothing prepared him for how he felt about showing up to work shortly after the shots were fired. "Scared, nervous, not knowing what went on and then finding out there was a shooting in Subway.  I mean, that’s where I ate yesterday and I thought about that happening in there, I thought that was kind of scary," said Gallas.   Gayle Yoshizawa, an associate who answered the phone at the store, told The Associated Press that no one was injured and that "everybody is fine and the situation is under control." The store has reopened, with an area roped off where while detectives from the Clark County Major Crimes Unit investigate the shooting.

Bread aisle at Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market on Semoran Boulevard in Orlando on Wednesday, Oct. 5. (Kyle Arnold) Kyle ArnoldContact Reporter Water, bread and other emergency preparation essentials are running low at many area supermarkets prepare for the worst ahead of the threat of Hurricane Matthew. Wal-Mart and Publix stores throughout the region were down to the last varieties of bread, water had disappeared from store shelves and canned food is going fast. Shoppers such as Apopka's Danny Davenport went to Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market Wednesday with hopes of restocking his cupboards before the storm. What he found was aisles full of shoppers but short on the kinds of food he needs. "They don't have anything for bread," said Davenport. "My wife is coming home from the hospital with our new baby today, so I wanted to get things taken care of. That didn't work very well." He did manage to find snack foods and juice for his two other children, as well as pet food.  But customers began snatching up water early Tuesday, despite the efforts of store employees to keep up with demand. Lines were long too. Publix, Winn-Dixie and Wal-Mart are all bringing extra trucks to accommodate the rush demand, which is only expected to increase as Hurricane Matthew makes its anticipated pass by Central Florida early Friday. Home improvement stores saw a rush of customers Wednesday looking for generators, fans, plywood and tools. Zach Rowe loaded up a cart at Home Depot in eastern Orlando with a first aid kit, tarps and plywood, hoping that he won't need them ahead of the storm. Rowe is helping to organize the Orlando Come Out With Pride parade scheduled for Friday.  "I've been through this so many times myself that I'm not really doing much at my house," Rowe said. "Maybe if things still look bad tomorrow I'll get myself prepared." karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; Twitter @kylelarnold Caption Canaveral National Seashore handles brush with Hurricane Matthew Laura Henning, a park ranger at Canaveral National Seashore, surveys the impact of high winds and storm surge from Hurricane Matthew's brush along Florida’s east coast, Wednesday, October 12, 2016.

Kim LaCapria Oct 05, 2016 Share - - Claim: Amidst "clown sightings" rumors, Walmart shoppers attacked or killed a woman "wearing too much makeup." false Example: [Collected via e-mail, October 2016] Origin:Amidst a national rumor frenzy over clown sightings across the U.S., several fake news sites published versions of stories reporting that a woman wearing "too much makeup" was shot and killed (or otherwise) attacked in the parking lot of a Walmart store. On version from 5 October 2016 stated: A 34 year-old woman identified as Kelly Perez was shot dead early Tuesday in the parking lot of a Walmart in Oklahoma City, according to police. She was shot by frightened David Brownie who felt Patricia Perez was a mischievous clown breaking into cars. Police say the victim was walking to her car after grocery shopping at her local Walmart when she was shot. David Brownie pulled out a handgun, shot the victim whom he believed was breaking into cars, police said. After the media frenzy over crazy clowns in his city David seemed very paranoid and family member of Mr. Brownie say he has always had a fear for clowns. A similar item claimed: A 26 year old woman named Melissa Reyes, resident of the Englewood neighborhood was walking home at around 7PM when she was reportedly attacked by a mob of angry black teenagers upset over the mysterious clown apparitions around the country. Reportedly, after she was beaten the perpetrators realized she wasn’t a clown she was only wearing an excessive amount of makeup. Melissa Reyes told authorities she could not identify any of her attackers but she did recall what one of the attackers had said: “Kill this f*cking clown, n*gga think sh*t sweet, this chicago n*gga, I merch that.” But all of these articles were published by fake news sites such as TheNoChill, who carry the following disclaimer: TheNoChill.com is the most notorious entertainment website in the world founded by Pancho Villa in 1922. Shared by trillions around the world. TheNoChill has previously advanced hoax news stories claiming Angelina Jolie sought to "return" her adopted children after breaking up with Brad Pitt, and that a teen was killed while trespassing during a game of Pokemon Go.

Both Target and Wal-Mart see their growth coming from pint-sized versions of their traditional cavernous stores. But they're each taking a unique approach to get there. As Target on Wednesday opens a 45,000-square-foot store in downtown Manhattan, it's cutting the ribbon on its latest effort to dive deeper into dense, more affluent markets. Fourteen of these tiny shops are slated to open by year's end, giving the bull's eye retailer a total of 32. Target CEO Brian Cornell has said he can eventually envision hundreds of these stores opening. Yet the retailer remains far behind Wal-Mart, which is likewise shedding the notion that its stores only work at more than 100,000 square feet. After scrapping its smallest-store concept earlier this year, meant to compete with the dollar store chains, the world's largest retailer is focused on building out its Neighborhood Market footprint. These nearly 700 stores average closer to 40,000 square feet. Unlike Target's small shops, Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market stores tend to be located in more rural destinations. However, they're still closer to population centers than its superstores to appeal to shoppers who don't want to drive all the way out to those locations for a gallon of milk. Neighborhood Market stores allow Wal-Mart to capture additional, midweek spending from existing shoppers, and potentially steal share from local grocery stores. Target, in contrast, is using its small shops to gain entry into cities that didn't have the available real estate to house its 100,000-plus-square-foot stores. By doing so, it's exposing its brand to a new group of shoppers. Whereas the average Target store has historically counted 60,000 households with a median income of $74,000 in a three-mile radius, those numbers are edging higher as it opens more small shops, according to CoStar. Over the last three years, the average Target store has expanded its reach to 172,000 households in a three-mile radius, with a median household income in the range of $79,000. Yet no matter how they get there, it's crucial that each retailer looks beyond their traditional formats, analysts said. Not only do these smaller stores provide more touch points for them to connect with shoppers, they enable these brands to more efficiently connect their physical and digital capabilities, such as their in-store pickup service. "You're able to get to places where you normally might not get," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. "You extend the brand and you deepen the relationship with consumers." Bring on the traffic Despite their differences, Wal-Mart's and Target's small shops share a few similar goals, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. One of those is the desire to draw frequent, repeat visits from shoppers. Because these shops tend to be located in costlier markets — and lean more heavily on low-margin products such as grocery — they'll need that volume to churn a profit. To bring in repeat shoppers, both small-store chains sell a mix of grocery, alcohol and high-velocity general merchandise, which needs to be replenished often, Johnson said. Most also feature pharmacies and a food and beverage component, which also drum up frequent visits. Target's Tribeca store, for example, includes a Chobani-branded yogurt cafe. "They're each trying to address the small-basket shopping mission," Johnson said. Both Wal-Mart and Target are likewise using their small shops to tie together their bricks-and-mortar presence with their online services. That includes marketing them as pickup points for digital orders. "I don't think any retailer that is savvy and gets it is building new stores and not having at least almost a full one eye on where it fits in a multichannel strategy," O'Shea told CNBC. "Everybody's probably thinking that way and if not, they probably should be." "It's additive overall and that's what I think you have to focus on." -Charlie O'Shea, Moody's analyst Even though these stores' small size will prohibit them from churning out the same volume as their larger counterparts — and in turn, generate a smaller return on invested capital — they can still be quite profitable, Johnson said. Though neither retailer has shared details regarding the profitability of their respective small stores, comparable sales growth at Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market stores has been easily outpacing its overall figures. During the fiscal second quarter, same-store sales at Neighborhood Markets increased 6.5 percent, compared with 1.6 percent overall growth at Wal-Mart's U.S. fleet. Target does not break out the financials for its small stores, though it has said they generate higher sales per square foot and more frequent footfall. Yet investors shouldn't spend too much time comparing the performance at the company's various store formats, O'Shea cautioned. Similar to how digital sales work in tandem with bricks-and-mortar, both of these formats serve their own role in each company's ecosystem, he said. In Wal-Mart's case, if a Neighborhood Market store steals $20 million in revenue from a $100 million a year supercenter, but brings in an additional $40 million, it's nonetheless grabbing share from a competitor. "It's additive overall and that's what I think you have to focus on," he said. Playing to their strengths Both Target and Wal-Mart are playing to their traditional strengths to grow their small-store footprint. Target's "tarjay" image resonates well with urban shoppers, whereas Wal-Mart built its brand catering to deal-seeking rural customers, O'Shea said. By locating its shops in dense, urban markets, Target has the opportunity to attract a broader swath of shoppers — in some cases with a higher income, CoStar's senior real estate economist, Ryan McCullough, said. "Generally speaking, urban areas are growing faster with respect to populations," he said, adding that these communities are "really the only place that we've seen household incomes rise over the past 15 years on a real basis." Yet with that opportunity comes challenges. City space is hard to come by, thanks to limited building and supply. It's also pricey. Though Target declined to share details on the terms of its rent, ground floor space in lower Manhattan cost an average $294 per square foot as of the second quarter, according to CBRE. "Rents are in large part a function of store productivity," McCullough said. "They're able to charge higher rents because in general their tenants are doing more in sales." Indeed, Target's Tribeca location is just a short walk from the reimagined World Trade Center area. Roughly 60,000 residents live in downtown Manhattan, and have a median household income of $134,756, according to the latest data from the Alliance for Downtown New York. show chapters <p>Target opens small NYC shop to attract big city shoppers</p> <p>The new downtown Manhattan location is much smaller compared to the size of a regular Target store.</p> Target opens small NYC shop to attract big city shoppers    Wednesday, 5 Oct 2016 | 7:04 AM ET | 00:38 For Wal-Mart, the economics of large cities have so far kept it at bay, executives said at its shareholders meeting this summer. Because Wal-Mart's value proposition hinges on offering shoppers the lowest price, it would be difficult to churn a profit in such an expensive market. As such, it has no intentions of bringing a Neighborhood Market to Manhattan anytime soon, the company said. The world's largest retailer has already scrapped one of its small-store concepts, Wal-Mart Express. At around 15,000 square feet, these shops were designed to compete against the rapidly expanding dollar store players. Customer Growth Partners' Johnson said the logistics of these small stores proved too difficult to match with the retailer's existing supply chain, which was built upon unloading the contents of 18-wheel trucks into large stores. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon told reporters in June that the company abandoned the roughly 100-store concept, which it started piloting in 2011, to focus on its larger supercenters. "We can't do everything," McMillon said. For both retailers, the idea of small stores is relatively nascent. At Wal-Mart, supercenters still outnumber Neighborhood Markets 5 to 1. And for Target, its small stores represent less than 2 percent of its overall base. Analysts, however, have no doubt these stores will play a more crucial role in each retailers' financials moving forward — and eventually, cause them to compete head-to-head in multiple markets. Yet the growth of these formats won't spell the demise of the companies' big-box stores, Johnson said. "I don't think there'll be any extraordinary closures of the large-format stores," he said. But with new store growth skewing toward these shops, "there will be a higher representation from the smaller-format stores with each passing year."

MUST CREDIT: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post. The Washington Post, The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........FRANKLIN, TENN. — On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries. But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America’s largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping – one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Advertisement Continue reading Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Wal-Mart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school – and hardest to replicate – asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. “We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery,” Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, told investors last year. “The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner.” And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. Advertisement Continue reading Wal-Mart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. “I physically have no room in the cart,” said Brummel, 33. “It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over.” Wal-Mart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Wal-Mart. “They’ve historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat,” said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. — At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Wal-Mart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Advertisement Continue reading Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. “We teach them how to tell the firmness – this one actually feels really good,” Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable’s brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they’re selecting for customers. There’s a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is “the trust fall,” the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it’s because “I like to select fresh products for myself,” according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn’t quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. Personal shopper April Styers gathers the orders, making her way through the store pushing a wheeled cart outfitted with four rows of blue bins that allow her to keep each order separate. As she stops in front of the Honeycrisp apples, she spins each one in her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze before bagging it and placing it in the cart. Advertisement Continue reading “If I’m not going to eat it,” Styers said, “then I’m not going to give it to anybody else.” — In Wal-Mart’s version of pickup, which is not yet available in the greater Washington area, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from – mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store’s grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It’s a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer’s front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Wal-Mart doesn’t have to reinvent its supply chain – it is already getting these goods to its stores. “That is the opportunity. They’re redeploying an asset they already have,” said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it’s extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. Advertisement Continue reading “The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves,” said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, “being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible.” At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. “I have two little ones in the back,” said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. “To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour.” The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Wal-Mart customer, and that they are often people who weren’t buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Wal-Mart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Wal-Mart store. “That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers,” said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. “Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked – I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I’m on my way,” Mishev said. walmart Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Wal-Mart's new tool gives competitors prices – Mar 21, 2014 Wal-Mart to expand online savings tool nationwide – Jun 4, 2014 Wal-Mart faces scrutiny at annual meeting – Jun 6, 2014 Wal-Mart's shutdown creates new food deserts – Jan 27, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

(Ariane Kunze/The Columbian) Employees leave the Hazel Dell Wal-Mart after a shooting about 7 a.m. Wednesday morning. No one was injured and the suspect is in custody. (Ariane Kunze/The Columbian) By Emily Gillespie, Columbian Breaking News Reporter Published: October 5, 2016, 12:30 PM A   A Clark County sheriff’s deputies quickly detained a Wyoming man who they say opened fire inside the Hazel Dell Wal-Mart early Wednesday morning. No one was shot or injured during the incident. Law enforcement swarmed the Wal-Mart, 9000 N.E. Highway 99, just before 7 a.m. when a 911 caller reported an active shooter at the store, Clark County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Fred Neiman said. The man was reportedly firing shots near the Subway restaurant, which is inside the store near the front entrance, Neiman said. Arriving deputies entered the store and quickly detained the accused gunman, Shaun Michael Sprague, 35, of Gillette, Wyo., without further incident, Neiman said. He was arrested on suspicion of first-degree assault and booked into the Clark County Jail. After they had Sprague in custody, law enforcement searched the store for potential victims and possible accomplices, but none were located, Neiman said. The store had been open for about an hour when the shooting occurred; employees and shoppers either evacuated the store or sheltered in place by hiding and locking themselves inside, Neiman said. “It sounds like they did the right thing,” he said. Jake Bodle, a Subway employee working at the Hazel Dell location Wednesday, said that he spoke with Sprague prior to the shooting. While Bodle was outside smoking, Sprague approached him and asked him for a cigarette. Bodle declined. Sprague then came into the store and told Bodle he wanted a sandwich. Bodle said they weren’t open yet, but said he’d make him one when they got up and running. Bodle then heard Sprague ask “if there was a cop shop nearby,” which he said he found odd. “I went back in the back … when I came back out, I saw him pull out the gun, and he started shooting,” said Bodle, who said he was about 40 feet away. “He was not aiming at anybody in particular, just firing randomly out in the aisles.” He said that Sprague didn’t seem upset, but that it appeared to him that he may have had some mental health issues. Bodle ran to the back area again as he heard six or seven gunshots ring out. “At first, I just thought, ‘Is this happening?’ ” he said. “He could come back and kill me at any point.” He said he tried to call 911 but couldn’t get through. A manager at Wal-Mart, Bodle said, did get through though. He said deputies arrived within five to 10 minutes. “They took him down pretty quickly,” Bodle said. “They told him to get on the ground, and he put the gun down like he expected to be arrested.” Bodle said that his boss let him take the rest of the day off, which he spent with his 4-year-old daughter. “We’re just really fortunate that this just wasn’t a worst situation,” he said. James Kancewick, 28, was in the store shopping when he heard what sounded like a pallet drop. Then he heard several more in quick succession and peeked around the corner. “There were two employees hunkered down moving toward, I guess, the safe room,” he said. “I don’t really know the store that well, so I went to back away from where I heard the gunfire and followed the employees into the back room.” Kancewick said he thought it might be a drill, but he didn’t want to risk it and remained in the room full of nervous people while he tried to stay calm. When police secured the scene and Kancewick left the store, he said he saw a revolver and a knife on the ground near the Subway restaurant. The shooting created a tense morning for shoppers, employees working inside and their loved ones. Colby Bell was awake and at home when he got a text message from his wife, Wal-Mart employee Sierra Bell, 19, about the shooting. He tried to call, but she didn’t answer. Colby Bell said that all he could think was, “please be OK and answer my damn calls,” he said. “I need to make sure everything’s OK, that’s my wife. I love this woman and there could be something wrong with her.” His wife then responded with another text that said she couldn’t talk and that she was supposed to be silent. Colby Bell said the texts he got from his wife read: “I heard three shots and we are in lockdown, cops are here and caught the guy … I am OK though,” he said. Colby Bell put some clothes on and drove straight to the Wal-Mart. He said he’s happy his wife was OK and added that it put him at ease to see so many officers on the scene, searching cars and making sure everything was safe. “There’s a plethora of good cops here that are doing their job, working really hard and doing exactly what they’re supposed to do,” he said. “I really appreciate that.” When Sierra Bell finally exited the store, she was met with a big hug from her husband. The Hazel Dell store re-opened following the incident, and corporate communications for Wal-Mart issued the following statement: “This is an awful situation. Thankfully, our associates and customers are safe and no one was injured. We are grateful to our management team for their quick thinking in getting customers and associates out of harm’s way, and to the police for their swift action in stopping the suspect.” Detectives with the Clark County Major Crimes Unit remained on scene throughout the morning and into the early afternoon, collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses. Neiman said that law enforcement have a plan in place for an active-shooter situation and that Wednesday’s incident went as well as it could. “It’s something we train for and prepare for but that we hope never actually happens,” he said.   Emily Gillespie Columbian Breaking News Reporter  360-735-4522  @col_cops  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

And the fishermen end up serving as crew on their own boats." One of the nation's largest environmental groups -- bankrolled with $50 million from the heirs to the Walmart fortune -- has spent millions of dollars pushing a wholesale change in how the U.S. manages its fisheries, an AL.com investigation reveals. Critics blame the Environmental Defense Fund effort for hurting fishing communities on every coast, from Kake, Alaska, and Gloucester, Mass., to Bayou La Batre, Alabama. The group has pushed a system that turns the right to catch a pound of fish into a private commodity that can be bought and sold like a share of stock on Wall Street. The government then gives these shares to individual commercial fishermen, granting them the right to catch that fish, or lease or sell the right to catch it to another fisherman. EDF has been profoundly successful at persuading regulators that commercial fisheries should be managed through these so called "catch share" systems. Now the organization is turning its sights on recreational fishermen, particularly when it comes to red snapper.  The environmental group likes catch shares because they put hard limits on the number of fishermen in a given fishery, and on the number of fish caught. Instead of an open season for commercial harvest, fishermen in a catch share system are allowed to fish anytime they like, for instance when the weather is nice, until they use up their shares.  And the system provides a steady supply of red snapper for market year round, instead of just during a finite fishing season. But catch share systems are also blamed for knocking thousands of fishermen out of the industry, usually because of inequities in how the shares were originally distributed by the government. In the Gulf of Mexico's red snapper fishery for instance, some fishermen were granted the right to catch six percent of the annual harvest, worth millions of dollars a year, while others were granted as little as 0.006 percent of the harvest, or a few hundred pounds a year, meaning they could no longer earn a living from fishing. Because all other fishermen are locked out of the fishery unless they buy or lease catch shares, critics say the system has turned those who were granted the largest portion of the harvest into Sea Lords who lease the right to fish to those who received the least. Many of these lords are able to earn millions of dollars a year without ever leaving the dock, simply by bartering the right to fish. The Sea Lord problem has affected fisheries all over the country, creating haves and have-nots when it comes to the basic right to fish, and forcing hundreds of crews out of the industry. Now, with 15 of the largest commercial fisheries in the United States managed this way, EDF is working to spread catch shares to recreational fishermen. A pilot program supported by EDF in the Gulf of Mexico let about 20 charter boats – known as "head boats" that typically carry 30 to 60 anglers per day -- operate under a catch share system for two years. Those boats were allowed to fish year round, which caused a lot of friction with the rest of the charter fleet of about 1,300 boats. The bulk of the charter fleet was only allowed to fish for 46 days in the year. But the EDF's most controversial proposal has been for a system that would require private recreational anglers to have a harvest tag for each fish they catch. EDF documents examined by AL.com make plain that the organization has envisioned spreading catch shares to people fishing for pleasure since at least 2009. That year, internal reports touting EDF's accomplishments state that the organization's work in the Gulf "will form the foundation for a for-hire IFQ and harvest tags for private anglers."  This notion of requiring tags for families headed out in their boats to catch a few fish for the dinner table has proven highly contentious. Especially so when a fleet of just 400 commercial vessels is allowed to catch 5 million pounds of snapper a year while recreational anglers have suffered under annual snapper seasons as short as 10 days in recent years. While EDF officials tried to distance themselves from the idea of recreational harvest tags in a recent interview, state officials in Alabama say the group actively lobbied for such tags in private meetings with regulators. When pressed, EDF officials said harvest tags are one of several options for the recreational fishery, which they described as "out of control and very poorly known and very poorly managed." The levers of power EDF gained unprecedented access to the levers of power in 2008 when President Obama appointed the vice-chair of EDF's board – Jane Lubchenco -- as the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which manages the nation's fish stocks. Once in power, Lubchenco, a respected but little known fisheries professor at Oregon State University, enacted a national catch share policy that mirrored EDF's longtime goals. Sea Lords and Red Snapper Sharecroppers As Lubchenco pushed for catch shares from the top, EDF staff members simultaneously organized and funded the creation of several non-profit activist groups made up of small numbers of commercial fishermen on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Critics say the move was intended to create the impression of grass roots support for catch shares that didn't actually exist. The leadership of these non-profits often consists of the fishermen who control the largest portion of a given fishery, who are also the folks who benefitted most from the switch to catch shares. Buddy Guindon is one of the true kingpins of the Gulf, with his seafood business responsible for about 30 percent of all red snapper landed annually. He is a strong supporter of the catch share system used to manage the fishery, and says it has been good for most fishermen. Ben Raines | braines@al.com  For instance, Buddy Guindon, the founder and executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders' Alliance, controls at least 4.7 percent of the red snapper harvest, one of the largest shares held. In addition, his seafood business, Katie's Seafood, handles about 30 percent of all the snapper, grouper and tilefish brought to market His group, the Shareholders' Alliance, received $623,000 from EDF between 2010 and 2014, the most recent years that records are available, according to the federal 990 tax forms filed by the organizations. Likewise with another group tied to the EDF called the Charter Fishermen's Alliance, which purports to represent charter boat captains. The charter boat group was funded entirely in its first year from a $48,000 donation from the Shareholders' Alliance, using money that came from EDF. "They work hard to make the public and politicians believe they are representing the majority of charter for hire boats when in reality they represent maybe 200 of 1,300 federally permitted owners," said Bob Zales, president of the National Association of Charterboat Operators. "Through EDF and their puppet associations such as the Charter Fishermen's Association, there is much political lobbying and at least yearly, sometimes more often, trips to D.C. to garner support for catch shares in all fisheries, commercial, charter, and private recreational with stamps." The EDF allied groups are regular fixtures at the quarterly meetings of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, and always speak during the public testimony sessions. The groups routinely hold strategy meetings with EDF leaders at the meetings. Bob Shipp, retired head of marine sciences at the University of South Alabama, was a longtime member of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. He remembers when EDF began exerting an outsized influence on fisheries policy. Ben Raines | braines@al.com  "We always hear from them at the Council meetings," said Bob Shipp, a former president and longtime member of the Council, which sets regulations for the commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf. "They don't explain how their groups are linked, but EDF and the fishermen with these non-profits are always on the same page." The intimate connection between EDF and the non-profits they helped start was on display on national television this year on the National Geographic TV show "Big Fish, Texas," which starred Buddy Guindon and his family. On that show, the top EDF official in the Gulf was shown in a private meeting coaching Guindon on what to say moments before he spoke to the Texas Legislature. "They pay for all of the travel, meals, everything for anyone who goes on one of these trips to Washington or the council meetings. They talk to the fishermen about what to say. And they tell the fishermen to just give them all their receipts and they'd cover everything," said Wayne Warner, who was a founding member of the Shareholder's Alliance but quit the first year because he disapproved of the environmental group's involvement. Wayne Warner Ben Raines | braines@al.com  He rejoined the group just this year. "I still always pay my own way for the trips. I don't want to owe them anything. I just think the fishermen should be looking out for themselves. Our interests and the EDF's many not always match." Going Rogue "What you are seeing is a conservation group that has gone rogue... What EDF really wants is to privatize the entire resource," said Daniel Pauly, a professor at the University of British Columbia and one of the world's preeminent fisheries scientists. Pauly is responsible for developing the concept of fishing down aquatic food webs and popularizing the notion that the world's fish stocks are much worse off than most scientists believe. He disputes the EDF position that catch shares improve fisheries. Instead, he said, they cause "economic redistribution." "Everywhere you have a catch share, a small group of people end up controlling the fishery. We have in British Columbia, one person controls 50 percent of our fishery. This is what is happening in the Gulf," Pauly said. "EDF has no business favoring the concentration of capital and ownership, but that is what it is doing." Indeed, one of the key benefits of switching to catch shares, according to Lubchenco's national catch share policy, is "consolidation" of the fleet. In other words, when catch shares are put in place, the number of people in a fishery shrinks, often dramatically, as the larger harvesters buy up shares from the smaller fishing boats. For instance, in the snapper fishery, there were 546 permits before the catch share. Today, there are 350, but just 55 fishermen catch 77 percent of the total harvest. Older catch shares around the country have experienced even more intense consolidation, according to federal statistics. In Alaska, the halibut fleet shrank from 3,450 boats before the catch share to 1,156 today. The Pacific sablefish fleet dropped from 328 boats to 87 boats in eight years under a catch share. And the Atlantic wreckfish fleet dropped from 91 boats in 1990 to fewer than five boats by 2009, according to federal records. EDF officials describe such concentration as one of several "unintended consequences." Others say it created an age of the sea lords and sharecroppers that began in earnest with Lubchenco's appointment. Lubchenco, who left NOAA in 2013 and resumed her position on the EDF board, did not respond to requests for comment. Lubchenco met fierce resistance in Massachusetts, when catch shares were enacted for the fisheries in the north Atlantic.  John Kerry, then a senator, along with Gov. Deval Patrick and most of the state's congressional delegation, bitterly opposed the introduction of catch shares, saying they would cost hundreds to thousands of jobs and devastate coastal communities. "A lot of our fishermen have been put out of business or pushed to the brink," because of catch shares, Kerry said at the time.  "Normally environmental groups and NGOs are for the little guy, but here, the EDF people are siding with the big guys, the corporate interests that want to own and privatize our fisheries," Pauly said. "It makes EDF very strange in the world of environmental groups. But then they are being funded by Walmart." Sam Rawlings Walton, grandson of the founder of Walmart, sits on the EDF board. The Walton Family Foundation, the family's non-profit arm, donated more than $50 million to EDF between 2009 and 2014. The foundation's IRS 990 forms describe that money as dedicated to "catch shares." Pauly noted that the EDF board includes "so many CEOs. Take a look. All these CEOs and investment bankers, and the major funding from Walmart," Pauly said, suggesting the EDF board, heavy on corporate influence, "has imposed on the organization, or convinced them, to go for this privatization." To Pauly, the catch share saga and EDF's involvement with one of the world's biggest corporation's has an "element of George Orwell." George Orwell, 1984  "In 1984, you have the Ministry of Peace that wages war and the Ministry of Truth that is in charge of propaganda. And the catch share? The point about catch shares is that you don't share," Pauly said. "People have bought this from EDF hook, line, and sinker. They don't think about what it means. A catch share means you can't get access to the resource because it is not shared anymore." Catch shares versus catch limits A trio of EDF officials maintained in a recent interview that the snapper catch share system was responsible for rebuilding the red snapper population in the Gulf of Mexico. They dismissed the notion that strict limits on recreational anglers -- including cutting the federal season from six months with a four fish per person limit to as short as 10 days with a two fish per day limit – played a role in the recovery.  "The snapper fishery was in almost complete collapse before the IFQ (or catch share). Without the IFQ, there really wouldn't be a red snapper fishery, and we wouldn't have fish to argue over without the IFQ," said Robert Jones, director of EDF's Gulf of Mexico operations. Asked about the ever-shorter federal seasons imposed on recreational anglers, Doug Rader, the senior scientist in EDF's Oceans Program, noted that Texas allows year-round snapper fishing, and the other Gulf states have created state seasons in protest of federal attempts to manage the fishery. "I think the recreational fishery in the Gulf is out of control and very poorly known and very poorly managed... The recreational fishery always exceeds its quota," Rader said, adding that thanks to the IFQ, "the commercial fishery is well known and managed and the catch is known down to 95 percent." And that, he said, caused the recovery. In addition, said Jones, the snapper IFQ has benefits that go beyond simply limiting the harvest of that one species. "I would hope we could have a talk about the positive job of leasing (the right to fish) and the IFQ, and the job it does especially in controlling bycatch and dead discards," Jones said, explaining that the ability to lease the right to catch snapper to fishermen targeting other species, such as grouper, has been crucial to helping stocks recover. For instance, grouper fishermen off of Florida were given shares of the grouper fishery by federal officials when the grouper IFQ was put in place. But they were not given any shares of the snapper harvest, because they did not have landings records showing a history of catching snapper. With red snapper now widespread off of Florida, the grouper fishermen are able to lease the right to catch snapper from people with a share of the snapper harvest. Jones said the IFQ program means that the grouper fishermen are able to lease the right to keep the snapper they catch instead of throwing them back, sometimes dead, which he called "double fishing." "Without the IFQ, there wouldn't be a red snapper fishery to argue over," Jones said. But many fishery scientists and regulators say that Jones is simply wrong. They argue that the rebounds in fish stocks are the result of much more robust federal management of commercial and recreational anglers that began in 2006. The law that governs U.S. fisheries, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, was beefed up during the Bush administration, requiring an end to "overfishing" for all species, which in scientific terms means catching a species faster than it can reproduce. The new version of the law also required strict catch limits in every fishery by 2011, setting a cap on how many fish could be killed each year. Those changes were the primary factor behind much lower annual quotas for both recreational and commercial snapper fishermen, which scientists say kickstarted the recovery. "Better management overall improved fish populations, not the switch to catch shares. The move to catch shares was simply coincidental," said Bob Shipp, the retired chair of marine fisheries at the University of South Alabama, and a longtime member of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. "I voted for catch shares, and they have their benefits, but they didn't save red snapper." Indeed the record for catch shares versus simple catch limits is inconclusive at best. There were 98 fisheries classed as "overfished" in 1999, and five fisheries approaching "an overfishing condition" according to the fishery service's report to congress that year. In the 2015 report to congress,  just 38 fisheries are considered overfished. Of the 60 fisheries no longer listed as overfished, 16 were managed under catch shares. The rest recovered due to limits on how many fish could be caught each year, or were removed from the list because scientists were unsure of the status of the stock. "The catch share definitely did not save the snapper fishery. The fishery had already rebounded thanks to catch limits before they started the catch share program. They were fishing the first ten days of the month and were staying within their quota," said Chris Blankenship, head of the Alabama Division of Marine Resources. "What the IFQ really did was make it safer for the fishermen, and helped them stretch their harvest out all year. It was good for the commercial guys, unless of course you were one of the people the IFQ removed from the fishery!" Owning a fishery Pauly said there is a predictable pattern with every catch share program he has studied. "There is in France a saying, 'even little steps lead to hell.' This is what happens with catch shares. You start with a very reasonable statement, 'You have to have a quota in the fishery.' Nobody would argue with that. Then, there is a series of reasonable steps, one after another, on this slippery slope and at the end of it, you are in hell," Pauly said. "Everything gets concentrated in the hands of a very small group of investors, people like dentists. And the fishermen end up serving as crew on their own boats.  To prevent this, the trick is that you must stop somewhere on the slippery slope." In presentations, Pauly calls catch shares, "a good idea people are turning into a bad idea." The problem, again and again, is the issue of ownership. With the catch shares supported by EDF, the fishermen are granted ownership of shares in the fishery, which they can sell, trade, lease, or pass on to their heirs. Making the catch shares transferable and permanent, that's where most regulators go wrong, Pauly said. "That's how the fishery gets taken away from the fishermen." He pointed to the experience in New Zealand's rock lobster fishery, where corporations ended up owning 85 percent of the shares in the fishery just a few years after catch shares were introduced. Pauly said the solution is to require the owner of shares in a fishery to actually captain the boat that is doing the fishing. In most U.S. catch shares, such as the red snapper IFQ, there is no such requirement. In fact, any U.S. citizen is allowed to buy, sell, or trade shares in the fishery, whether he or she has a boat, or has ever been fishing in their life. Such a requirement is bitterly opposed by the nonprofit groups established by EDF. Guindon said requiring the people who own the shares of the fishery to actually do the fishing would end up destroying the fishery. On the Big Fish, Texas show, Guindon is only shown fishing on a single episode, though he owns multiple boats and personally holds the right to catch 4.7 percent of the overall snapper quota. In addition, Guindon said he leases as many shares of the quota as he can every year from other fishermen. He said that he sends out postcards to all the other fishermen in the catch share program offering to lease their shares for the year, so he can harvest even more fish. "If you make a requirement that I go fishing, you are going to drive a lot of people out of business and you are going to hurt the fishery. People who are not in the fishery need to let those of us who are fishing, who see the fishery working, they need to let us work," Guindon said. "If they say ok, you have to use at least 30 percent of your fish on your boat, or 50 percent, well, I'm already out there with the liability of the risk of having a boat, of storing a boat, of repairing a boat. I'm going to catch 100 percent of my fish. Then that new entrant guy, the guy who is leasing fish, he's not going to be around because no one will lease him fish. All these things that take place create economic inefficiencies in an economic engine and cause it to choke, sputter, and die. That's where the real rubber meets the road." An ownership requirement such as Pauly proposes, where the owner of the quota must fish, would mean that Guindon could not harvest more than six percent of the fishery. He would no longer be able to lease extra quota in excess of the six percent cap. "Catch shares set up for owner/operator boats, this blocks this concentration. It sounds crazy, but actually exists in many countries. One of them is Denmark. Only the owner of the boat can be the captain. The boat may not be run by employees," Pauly said. The owner/operator requirement "guarantees a stopping point on the slippery slope," because it prevents holding companies from owning the fleet or the right to fish. Guindon's business model, for instance – where he owns or leases shares in the fishery that he provides to fishermen who sell him their fish -- would have to change. Guindon and others argue that such a rule amounts to socialism. Compromise or Communism "You're talking like a communist, and it's just because you don't understand," said Chris Niquet. "I am the original Sea Lord. I went out and I invested in the red snapper shares when they started the IFQ. People said to me, 'Chris, you're crazy. You're going to lose everything.' I just said, 'maybe so, do you want to sell me your fish? I'll take them all!'" Chris Niquet says he is the "original sea lord." He bought shares in the red snapper fishery as an investment and says it doesn't matter who is catching the fish. Here, he addresses the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. Ben Raines | braines@al.com  Today, he is one of the largest quota holders in the snapper fishery, though he does not fish. He said that EDF's involvement in pushing for catch shares had made his business possible. "I bought my shares as an investment, just like a man who bought a hotel, or a shoe store, or an apartment complex, not because I'm a fisherman," Niquet said. "But this is America. We don't tell the man who bought a shoe store that he has to be the one to sell the shoes. He's allowed to have employees, operate a business. We don't tell the man who owns an apartment complex that he has to live there. Saying I have to fish if I own shares is plain Communism." Pauly disagrees.  "This requirement is not a socialist requirement, because it recognizes ownership. In fact, you cannot fish unless you are an owner. The people on the right cannot argue that you are limiting ownership, because only owners can fish," Pauly said. "You are actually encouraging more ownership, more captains and more boats." The course chosen in most U.S. catch shares has been to limit the amount of a fishery a single entity is allowed to control. For instance, in the snapper IFQ, no single individual or company is allowed to own more than 6 percent of the harvest. But in effect, that only limits the size of the corporations that control most of the fishery. It does not prevent non-fishing companies from owning the harvest, and making money off of the people doing the actual fishing. At present, about half of the snapper fishery is owned by non-fishing entities, meaning brokers and investors who earn their livings by renting the right to catch snapper to hardworking fishermen. Even Lubchenco's national catch share policy notes that ownership by investors should be discouraged. In a section about such investors controlling a fishery, the policy states that the purpose of federal fisheries law "is the conservation and management of the nation's fishery resources, not the development of speculative financial instruments or investment opportunities for individuals or businesses not substantially participating in the fishery." To Pauly, the policy itself speaks in favor of his suggestion that only fishermen be allowed to own shares of the fishery. "As I said, even little steps lead to hell on this slippery slope. The regulators, can never see where they should stop, because every step they make seems reasonable, can be justified," Pauly said. "But at the end, you end up at the opposite of where you wanted. The last step is that one person owns the fishery. Or fifty. You end up in hell, with the fishermen working as crew on their own boats. This is happening in your fishery in the Gulf of Mexico." And, he said, the folks who are protesting mostly loudly against changing the current system are the ones making the most money off the status quo.   Updated at 2:10 p.m., Oct. 19 to correct the number of fish species listed as overfished, the number of species that have recovered, and the number of those species managed under catch shares.     Updated at 3:48 p.m., Oct. 7 to clarify that Buddy Guindon's seafood business, Katie's Seafood, handles about 30 percent of the snapper, deepwater grouper and tilefish caught annually, while Guindon personally holds the right to harvest about 4.7 percent of the annual snapper quota.  You can read the first story in this series, about the Snapper Kingpins making millions without going fishing, here.

(Danny Johnston/Associated Press/Canadian Press) Lois Corbett - Walmart charging for plastic bags 7:28 Walmart will start charging five cents for each plastic bag in Maritime stores starting Oct. 17.  "We began informing customers in the Maritimes last week that we will stop giving out free single-use plastic shopping bags," said Alex Roberton, senior director of corporate affairs for Walmart Canada in an email statement.  Roberton said the hope is that people will stop using plastic bags all together and that they switch to reusable bags instead.  That's not the only bag change Walmart will be implementing. The plastic bags they do use will be larger and stronger, in an attempt to use fewer bags that way.  Robertson said that in 2015, New Brunswickers used more than 32 million plastic bags.  A welcome change for some Lois Corbett, the executive director of Conservation Council of New Brunswick, said she feels this is a good move for Walmart. She said a big corporation, such as Walmart, should always be looking to find ways it can help the environment. "Customers are ready for it," said Corbett.  "I think that New Brunswickers in particular understand the impact of wastefulness. We tend to be a quite thrifty type of people." Corbett said she hopes Walmart's change will extend to other big corporations and start a snowball effect. "What Walmart does, other retailers may have to do as well just to remain competitive," said Corbett. But not everyone is happy about Walmart's decision, such as Jaci Kay.  "I think it's the stupidest thing ever," said Kay. "It's literally a bag. We can't carry 50 groceries in our hands 20 miles."

(read more) BY PETER CAMERON, STAFF WRITER / Published: October 5, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A Taylor police officer who also worked briefly at his local Wal-Mart has sued the company for what he calls wrongful termination. Officer Michael Zuby had been employed by both the Taylor Police Department and Wal-Mart as a security guard. The flashpoint of the dispute occurred approximately two weeks after Wal-Mart hired Officer Zuby in July 2015. While the officer was on duty with the Police Department, he stopped at the Wal-Mart store in Taylor for lunch in full uniform. His security guard boss saw him and told him he could not be armed on store property. Officer Zuby responded he was a police officer and had to be armed in his jurisdiction of Taylor. The lawsuit states the store then twice requested a letter from the borough of Taylor prohibiting Officer Zuby from entering Wal-Mart property while on duty as a police officer. According to the lawsuit, which calls the request “illegal,” the police chief refused this request both times, noting the officer may have to respond to a call there as the business is in the Police Department’s jurisdiction. Wal-Mart policy bans employees from carrying weapons of any kind while on company property, but that was not the issue here, said Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for the company. The conflict of interest of Officer Zuby serving as both a police officer and a store security guard in his police jurisdiction concerned the company, Mr. Hargrove said. Wal-Mart tried to find a remedy, Mr. Hargrove said, by offering Officer Zuby a different position at the Taylor store at the same pay rate, or another security guard job at the Pittston or Dickson City stores. He refused, Mr. Hargrove said. Wal-Mart terminated Officer Zuby on Sept. 19, 2015. He filed a lawsuit last month.

About Masthead Editorial Policy Advertising Subscriptions Contact The Williams Record Front Page News Opinions Features Arts Sports RSS Facebook Twitter BRTA considering new and more efficient bus route for North Adams October 5, 2016 by Neena Patel, News Editor The Berkshire Regional Transit Authority (BRTA) is considering creating a new bus route in North Adams that would get bus riders to their destination in a quicker and less costly fashion. This route is currently called “Route 65” and would originate and finish at the Walmart Supercenter closest to the College in North Adams on Curran Highway. The proposed route would include the following stops: Ocean State Job Lots Plaza, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Main Street, Mohawk Forest and Berkshire Medical Center North Adams. It would connect with the Route 1 bus route that goes from North Adams to Pittsfield and Route 3 bus route which goes from Williamstown to North Adams. The route would function as an express route and Walmart would be the transfer point. A smaller bus would take passengers through the North Adams portion of the route and they would also have the option board a larger bus to reach Pittsfield. There have been several requests for evening and weekend bus services over the years. “If we had that extra money, this is how we would spend it,” Administrator Robert Malnati said in an iBerkshires article. “We would implement later evening services, we would try out a few different routes, see how they go how that would be received and eventually morph into a Sunday service, maybe Saturday.” The current budget that BRTA has is the same that it was given two years ago. The entire state is given $82 million dollars for transportation funding and, in the past two fiscal years, the state has been given a little bit more for its budgent; however, this year that was not the case. We’re stuck at an $82 million pot for us,” Malnati said in an iBerkshires article. “That translates to about $2.5 million for us. Fixed route service alone costs us over $4 million to put on the street as it is … what we’re trying to do is tweak it and make it more user-friendly, to go where we need to go without incurring additional costs because we know it’s not coming from the state.” The lack of funding could impact students at the College. The Route 7 bus route, which is subsidized partially by the College, could be discontinued because of lack of use. This route was created in 2013 as a request from the College so that students could reach Pittsfield faster. It runs from Stop & Shop to the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield and has several stops along the way, including Wild Oats, the Clark Art Institute, Mount Greylock Re-gional High school and the College. This project was praised by President Adam Falk who believed that this would further connect the College to Williamstown and the Berkshires. The College stated the importance of this bus route by citing its vital role in allowing students to reach jobs, internships and the Berkshire community as a whole. This topic will be discussed when the ridership data for the month of September becomes available. As for the Route 65 bus, there was no one in the meeting opposed to this addition, although some people cited potential problems. This would switch to a smaller bus, which Kenneth Brick, a regular bus rider, thought would cause congestion during the beginning of the month when people are shopping at Walmart.  Another problem brought up was that sometimes people have small amounts of money left on Charlie Cards and bus drivers won’t accept them. Malnati stated that BRTA cannot administer the cards and that riders must go to the Intermodal Center in Pittsfield to add money or combine cards. Another person in attendance brought up a third problem: there is not enough space on the bus or in bike racks to accommodate the number of bikers who often use the transportation. Despite these potential issues, many riders are complementary of the daily riders and drivers of BRTA. “There’s a genuine caring there,” Yesmine Sarkis, a regular rider, said. “They care about what’s going on in our life.” Share this: Tweet Email Print { 0 comments… add one now } Cancel reply Leave a Comment Name * E-mail * Website Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Login Search Target Hopes Smaller Stores Will Bring In More Millennials -- WSJ October 05, 2016, 02:48:00 AM EDT By Dow Jones Business News Shutterstock photo By Khadeeja Safdar Target Corp. is the latest big-box store to try small boxes. The chain is opening several smaller stores in urban areas and college towns from New York City to State College, Pa., as it battles declining traffic and sales at its nearly 1,800-strong fleet of largely suburban stores. "We could see hundreds of these," Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. "It could be a huge part of future growth outlook over time." The retail chain recently reported its first decline in existing store sales in two years and its stock has lost 13% over the past year. Mr. Cornell is trying to reinvigorate sales and better appeal to younger shoppers who are increasingly buying essentials online. Amazon.com Inc., which targets citydwellers for its Prime membership, has recently increased efforts to attract college students. But Target is attempting to succeed where others have struggled, a sign of the limited options for brick-and-mortar retailers competing with e-commerce. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. retreated from a similar experiment earlier this year, closing more than 100 of its smaller Wal-Mart Express locations to focus on its massive SuperCenters and grocery-store-style Neighborhood Market formats. Unlike Wal-Mart, which opened its Express stores largely in suburban and rural locations, Target is focusing on densely populated urban areas and customizing the assortment in each store to cater to local tastes. Target executives say the retailer is ready to move away from its traditional store model to enter new markets. "We had become really good at stamping out the same store in different markets," said Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan. "For these formats, we are rethinking everything." The new stores -- typically less than 50,000 square feet compared with the average Target store of 145,000 square feet -- are in spaces once occupied by grocery stores and neighborhood retailers. Target also wants customers to use the new stores as pickup locations for online orders, "as opposed to getting that ugly sticker from UPS or FedEx that says 'oops I missed you,' " said Mr. Cornell. One is slated to open in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood on Oct. 5 in a space once leased out to a Fairway Market grocery store that never opened. It will sell a larger selection of baby items to target the families living in the area. The store will also have a Chobani Cafe and feature a mural by a local artist. Mr. Cornell said the new stores are expected to start moving the needle in the company's overall performance in 2017 and 2018. "It brings us into neighborhoods where we don't exist today and where there is demand for our brand," he said. Some analysts say Target, which has a younger, wealthier consumer base, may have more success than Wal-Mart, while others say the strategy has limited growth potential. "A store in downtown Manhattan is interesting, but is it scalable?" said Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock. "Wal- Mart couldn't make it work with a better logistical network. It makes you wonder how Target is going to succeed." Target began trying out urban formats in 2012. The company opened 14 CityTarget and TargetExpress stores over three years and then later rebranded them as Target. As part of its deal last year to sell its pharmacies to CVS Health, it also announced plans with CVS to develop five to 10 small stores over a two-year period. Mr. Cornell, who became CEO in 2014, has doubled down on "flexible-format" stores, with plans to increase the total number to about 60 by next year. The smallest one so far, near University of California, Berkeley's campus, is less than 10% the size of a typical Target store. But downsizing can be challenging. With limited space in backrooms and on the floor, small stores require more frequent deliveries to keep items in stock. Big-box retailers also rely on a certain mix of everyday essentials and high-margin merchandise to turn a profit and draw customers to the edited selection. Wal-Mart, for example, carried fewer grocery items in its smallest format and often placed them in the same region as its Supercenters, giving shoppers less re ason to visit. Analysts also say Wal-Mart didn't sell enough high-margin products such as clothing to make the model as profitable as its larger stores. "We believe the full-sized Neighborhood Markets are better for our customers and leverage our entire infrastructure more efficiently and effectively," said a Wal-Mart spokesman. To maximize shelf space, Target has been selecting smaller package sizes and fewer brands for many of the same items offered in bulk at its larger stores. The company has also been tweaking the assortment in each store based on sales performance and customer feedback. Anne Stanchfield, Target's executive in charge of merchandising for the new stores, said figuring out the right mix of merchandise is like a "giant game of Tetris."

But academic research suggests that 70 percent to 90 percent of mergers don’t succeed, owing to a wide variety of factors. Buyers overvalue the synergies they’ll derive, or they underestimate the impact of the associated costs, or they rely too heavily on assumptions about where a market is heading. Of course, another reason acquisitions don’t always go as planned is that founders often leave a year or two after their company has been gobbled up. That’s changing in today’s challenging market for exits, where a growing number of well-funded companies and their investors are hoping that if an IPO isn’t in the cards, an acquisition might be. And in addition to other changing deal terms, acquiring companies are seemingly thinking long and hard about locking up talent longer than they have in the recent past. You saw it happen when the e-commerce company Jet sold to Walmart for a whopping $3.3 billion in August. According to Recode, cofounder and CEO Marc Lore agreed to stay on with Walmart for an atypically long five years as part of the acquisition agreement. In fact, according to that same August report, if Lore leaves before the summer of 2021, he’ll forfeit a sizable amount of both cash and stock that could otherwise earn him up to an estimated $1 billion. Lore may be exceptional in many ways, including his understanding of e-commerce and how to compete specifically with Amazon, which acquired his previous company. It’s easy to understand why Walmart wants him around. He probably won’t be alone, though. Steve Fletcher, a managing director at the global investment bank GCA, notes that it’s “hard to say” whether it’s universally the case that management teams are getting locked into longer contracts with acquirers in this market. “I don’t think anyone has a large enough sample size to say that,” he notes. But he adds that of the deals he is seeing, there is a move to sign on incoming talent for a longer period, sometimes “three or four years as opposed to [the previous standard of] 18 to 24 months.” Vas Natarajan — an investor at the venture firm Accel Partners who focuses on products and services that target developers, designers and media creators — makes a similar observation. “In the last four or five years, there’s been a rash of these acquir-hires, where the founders have left after 18 to 24 months,” Natarajan says. “But I know from talking with heads of product and corp dev teams [that they are now asking], ‘How can we do it in a way that’s much more retentive than in the past?’ M&A teams are starting to think more about structuring things in a way that you retain what you buy.” How big a trend this becomes is far from clear. As a baseline, SRS Acquiom, a San Francisco-based outfit that provides M&A post-closing services to companies, says that 21 percent of the 735 private M&A transactions it saw between 2012 and 2015 featured an earn-out period of four to five years. Meanwhile, 47 percent of those deals featured earn-out periods of 1 to 2 years. Founders who are more driven to start companies than reap their full reward from an acquirer will surely leave no matter the earn-out period anyway. Still, there’s reason for corporates to believe that longer agreements make sense. In 2013, PayPal, then a division of eBay, acquired the Chicago-based payments gateway Braintree in an all-cash deal worth $800 million. As part of that deal, the incentives of Braintree CEO Bill Ready were structured over a long period of time. In retrospect, that decision looks to be paying off for Ready and PayPal — which spun off into its own public company last year. As of September of last year, Ready was already running all product and engineering at PayPal. Just this week, he became the first person since it became an independent concern to be named to the role of chief operating officer. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories The Down Round [Entire Series] VIDEO | 30:01 | The Down Round Zuckerberg claims 99% of Facebook posts “authentic,” denies fake news there influenced election 7 hours ago | Lora Kolodny How Facebook can escape the echo chamber 12 hours ago | Anna Escher Secret is coming back 22 hours ago | Sarah Buhr I refuse to review Snapchat Spectacles — but I’m glad to have my hands back yesterday | Matthew Panzarino Latest From TechCrunch Naver to launch $43M fund to seek out investments for its Snow and Webtoon services 46 minutes ago | Jon Russell How President Trump could abuse big data and the surveillance state 1 hour ago | Jon Stokes How drones will reshape the enterprise 1 hour ago | Alexander Niehenke Defining our relationship with early AI 6 hours ago | Andrew Heikkila Comment moderation powered by Up Next Toppling democracy one byte at a time Posted Oct 6, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Developer Events Content Manager (Contract Role) at Google (Mountain View, CA, United States) Director of Marketing and Communications (Position #4782) at Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL, United States) Digital Marketing Analyst at Stony Brook University (Stony Brook, NY, United States) Advanced TV Product Manager - Media at Time Warner Cable/Spectrum (New York, NY, United States) Technical Product Manager @ PANTHEON at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2e5W54p) Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Officials are working to strike a deal with the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company before a new U.S. administration takes over in January, according to the Bloomberg report. Wal-Mart is cooperating fully with the government and compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws is a key priority, company spokesman Greg Hitt said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of FCPA, in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed by its shareholders including a Michigan pension fund, accusing it of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico.

An officer pulled over Johnson's vehicle about 11:30 p.m. Sept. 30 after he saw it traveling on the wrong side of the roadway, police said. Johnson was later released on his own recognizance. • The owner of a tree service reported two chain saws and a pole saw stolen out of a truck while he and his employees were trimming trees about 12:30 p.m. Sept. 30 on the 200 block of North Lord Avenue.

Published Oct 6th, 2016 3:26 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street analysts gathered in Bentonville Thursday (Oct. 6) the company is going through a transformation period, the most he’s witnessed in his 32 years with the retailer. The world’s largest retailer, according to McMillon, is investing for the future as it slows new store growth which has been the basis for much of its revenue growth historically. Capital can then be redirected to e-commerce, with talent like Jet.com founder Marc Lore – who came with Wal-Mart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com – leading the ecommerce push. And while Wal-Mart management is excited about the change, the moves are somewhat scary to Wall Street as investors sold off shares Thursday (Oct. 6) in response to the retailers’ flat growth forecast for next year. Wal-Mart shares (NYSE: WMT) slid to $69.36, down $2.28 per share as the retailer tempered its profit forecast over the next two years. The retail giant expects flat earnings for fiscal 2018 that will begin Jan. 31, 2017, while capital expenditures will be trimmed to $11 billion. For the back half of this year Wal-Mart reiterated earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.35 per share, and said it’s gaining momentum in e-commerce as the giant U.S. store business is in a stronger position than a year ago. “We have to make sure this company is here 50 years from now,” McMillon said of the myriad changes the company is making to grow its business and respond to online retail growth. STORE REDUCTION PLAN Last year Wal-Mart opened 69 supercenters, with just 60 planned for this year and 35 the following fiscal year. Neighborhood Market expansion is being trimmed from 161 new stores in the previous fiscal year to just 20 new stores next year. Overall. the new store count is down from 230 last year to just 55 next year. This is a concern for suppliers and investors because roughly 70% of Wal-Mart’s revenue growth has come from new stores. McMillon said comp sales and e-commerce sales which now comprise the other 30% will grow. Wal-Mart is betting heavily on its investments in e-commerce including the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and the increased stake in JD.com in China to be catalyst for the this change. McMillon said China holds huge growth potential and the best way to tap that market was to partner with JD.com because it would have been too expensive to scale Yihaodian. In the U.S., McMillon said the play to acquire Jet.com made perfect sense. He said a mutual friend introduced Jet.com founder Marc Lore to him a few months ago and the two immediately began to talk about the possibilities of scaling e-commerce in the U.S. and what a marriage of the two companies might look like. Jet.com ships 100,000 packages a week with more than 5 million users, up from zero users just 14 months ago. REDUCING SHIPPING COSTS McMillon said Lore and his team cracked the code on how to win in e-commerce by giving the customer transparency into the costs of an online transaction and building baskets online, versus shipping individual items. The average basket on Jet.com includes 7.9 items, which they believe is a more effective way to ship product. Lore, who was in Bentonville for the analyst meetings, said a customer who wants to buy dog food online has the choice of paying for shipping, getting a better price if they use debit pay versus credit, and if they add a dog leash to the basket they find more value. The choices and push for a consumer to add more to an online order improves the margin. Lore said Wal-Mart has a good foundation with new distribution network and its vast store fleet which gives them an advantage in lowering shipping costs to roughly $1 per order if all the distribution nodes are efficiently used. McMillon said sharing knowledge and infrastructure with Jet should net exciting growth. Jet appeals to the urban shopper and Wal-Mart has the suburbs covered. Together the two retailers have 35 million items they will sell in their online platforms. Lore, CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce, has been on the job for 27 days and McMillon said he’s learned what a great item merchant Lore is at heart as the two recently walked Walmart stores and Lore kept being distracted by items he wanted to sell online. “If Marc can be Marc with this company then great things are going to happen,” McMillon said.

At an investor meeting Thursday, executives said the world's largest retailer will open about half as many supercenters next year as it did last fiscal year. Instead, Wal-Mart will direct more of its $11 billion in annual capital spending to boosting e-commerce sales, technology used in stores and service. Wal-Mart has already invested billions in online efforts, as well as higher wages for store workers -- efforts executives have previously said will depress profits for years. Last month, Wal-Mart spent $3.3 billion to buy unprofitable online retailer Jet.com Inc., and on Wednesday it disclosed it had nearly doubled its investment in Chinese online retailer JD.com Inc. "I don't think it's an exaggeration to say we are going through a transformative period," CEO Doug McMillon told investors and analysts at the meeting. As previously expected, Wal-Mart said its fiscal 2018 earnings will be flat compared with fiscal 2017, which ends in January. Wal-Mart maintained its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017 at $4.29 to $4.49 a share. But the company said per-share earnings in fiscal 2019 will fall at the low end of a previously forecast 5% to 10% growth target, in part because of its purchase of Jet.com. "We have more visibility on how that is going to shake out," a spokesman said. Shares of Wal-Mart slipped 3.1% to $69.46 in morning trading. The shares have risen about 13% on the year. New store growth will slow significantly. The retailer expects to build 35 new supercenters in fiscal 2018, down from 69 last year. Even growth of the company's smaller format Neighborhood Markets will slow, down to 20 new stores in fiscal 2018 from 161 built last year. Over the past four years, the majority of Wal-Mart's growth has come from new stores, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said Thursday. Same-store sales and e-commerce "are starting to play a much bigger role than they have in the past," he said. Wal-Mart's same-store sales have risen for eight straight quarters, in part because of investments to improve service and efficiency and to cut inventory. While its spending priorities are shifting, Wal-Mart maintained its outlook for capital expenditures at $11 billion this fiscal year and next. The company reported revenue of $482 billion last fiscal year, with about $14 billion coming from e-commerce. Wal-Mart is "investing in the right places, and slowing store growth is the right strategy," said Peter Benedict, retail analyst for Baird. However those investments will continue to weigh on company profits for years, he said. Executives speaking to investors from the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters also said e-commerce sales will grow significantly in the second half of the year, reversing years of underwhelming online sales. E-commerce sales will jump around 20% to 30% in the second half of the year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, Mr. Biggs said. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales growth slowed for nine straight quarters until last quarter, when they rose 11.8%. Mr. Biggs said e-commerce growth will come from efforts to rapidly add third-party sellers to Walmart.com, millions more products, and the acquisition of Jet.com. Wal-Mart also will market Walmart.com more aggressively, he said. Wal-Mart, which has $11.7 billion remaining on its $20 billion share buyback, said it anticipates completing the program around the end of fiscal 2018.

The group was almost entirely opposed to a new apartment complex off U.S. 98 in Fairhope, Ala. The council, with a 3-2 vote, endorsed the zoning needed for the complex to move forward. The vote led to a recent voter backlash against some of the incumbents, including Mayor Tim Kant. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com). Print Email John Sharp | jsharp@al.com By John Sharp | jsharp@al.com Press-Register Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 06, 2016 at 2:16 PM, updated October 06, 2016 at 2:45 PM comments "I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back." - Lynn Maser of the 98 Committee Diana Brewer, marketing and public relations director at the GulfQuest Maritime Museum in Mobile, Ala., lost her Fairhope City Council seat to James "Jimmy" Conyers during the Oct. 4, 2016, municipal runoff election. (file photo) The construction of a Walmart Supercenter angered plenty of Fairhope residents less than a decade ago. A Hampton Inn, built downtown with a parking deck, also stirred friction. And a worker-housing development next to the high school sparked fierce resistance. But none of those projects caused political upheaval like the 240-unit apartment complex proposal that surfaced a year ago and received the City Council's initial OK in April on a thin 3-2 vote. The apartment proposal arrived on the scene as booming Fairhope was struggling to chart its future under the pressure of relentless growth, overcrowded schools, limited downtown parking and congested roads.  Now, Fairhope's city government is experiencing something of an earthquake. Last month, voters ousted four-term Mayor Tim Kant, who had expressed support for the apartments, choosing political novice and bookstore owner Karin Wilson as the city's new chief executive. Also booted from office was Councilman Rich Mueller, a "Yes" vote for the apartments. Then on Tuesday, during a runoff election, Councilwoman Diana Brewer – another "Yes" vote -- was overwhelmingly defeated by James "Jimmy" Conyers Jr., an opponent of the apartment project. Only Councilman Kevin Boone, the third "Yes" vote who faced opposition from a newcomer to the city, was able to hold on to his seat. "I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Lynn Maser, chairwoman of the Fairhope 98 committee, which was formed one year ago to take a closer look at the city's growth after the apartment project was first introduced. "North Fairhope wasn't going to re-elect anyone who voted for the apartments." Said City Council President Jack Burrell, one of the "No" votes on the apartment complex: "It's probably been the hottest (issue) I've ever seen in the last 17 years living in Fairhope. I've seen some hotly debated developments and this one, I believe, may have cost the mayor his job." Meanwhile, the apartment complex's prospects may have dimmed. The city Planning Commission, which backed the project in February, voted on Monday – the day before the runoff – to not support the project's latest site plan based on drainage concerns. The project's developer now has to wait another six months before bringing it back up for consideration. Moratorium on growth The new city leadership, which takes office next month, could quickly take up a moratorium on new developments. The council, last month, opted to postpone a moratorium vote until Wilson and the new council members were sworn in. Burrell said the initial moratorium ordinance "was fairly generic" and needed to be more "well thought out" with specific recommendations on what the city wants to accomplish. Kant also is urging caution: "It's good as long as you're trying to accomplish something. If you put it in there and say you want 'no growth' then you are opening yourself to a lot of criticism." Burrell said the moratorium push last month came from Wilson. "The mayor-elect wants to see it enacted," said Burrell. "She would rather have it passed prior to her taking office so it's expedited. But it's a council decision and I think since we have such high turnover on the council, the new council should make decisions as to what the moratorium should look like and they should be the ones who adopt it." Karin Wilson, a Fairhope independent bookstore owner, speaks to reporters following her victory in the Aug. 23, 2016, mayoral election in Fairhope, Ala. (file photo) Wilson, who agrees with Burrell on holding off to await the new administration, said: "The pressure and sense of urgency is coming not from me but rather a community who voted in new leadership that campaigned on the shared belief that Fairhope's future growth is our No. 1 priority." She said, "I intend to deliver what our citizens expect and the only way to accomplish this is by taking the time to perform the comprehensive studies needed and to put a new plan in action for development. I feel confident our new administration will agree." Apartment opposition It's unclear what a moratorium might mean for the Retreat at Fairhope Village, the apartment complex pushed by Mississippi-based Leaf River Group. The company is also developing a 264-unit complex in downtown Mobile, a project which faced no controversy by Mobile city officials. But in Fairhope, a chorus of boos rang out within the council chambers on April 11, when the council voted 3-2 to support zoning changes to allow the complex to be built off of U.S. 98. Brewer repeatedly had to defend her vote, and wrote an extensive opinion piece at AL.com describing why high-end apartments were needed in Fairhope. The issue also followed Kant around. Maser and other critics of the project say the sprawling complex would rise near a sensitive watershed that feeds Mobile Bay, and they do not trust the drainage or stormwater management plans associated with the work. Others, such as attorney Adam Milam, maintain that the city is violating its own ordinances and past comprehensive plan in allowing the multi-family dwelling to proceed. A lawsuit, filed on behalf of project opponents, is awaiting a Baldwin County judge's opinion. "It's such an environmentally sensitive area," said Milam, noting that a Publix grocery store – developed nearby – was faced local opposition because of its potential impacts on important habitat. "The people who live around the area ... are proud of their homes and their community and want to protect it." Brewer believes there is more to the story, however. She said a "fear factor" was being spread that would harm the city. "It's an elitist concept and an elitist way of looking at things and one that I'm very much in disagreement with," she said. 'Huge factor' Kant downplays the effect of the apartment uproar on the city elections, saying it had "some impact," but no more than previous development controversies. "If you look at the issues important to Fairhope, it's the growth and the parking downtown and the school growth ... it funnels right back to growth and people are real concerned about that," Kant said. But Milam calls the apartment complex an example of "bad development decisions" that weighed heavy on voter's minds. "That was a huge driving force in the elections and one reason why I think Karin Wilson is so intent in making smart development ... a major part of her tenure," he said. "I think Kant was strong. I didn't think he would ever be beaten. But he made some major decisions that affected a lot of people and it motivated a big voter turnout." In an interview, Stewart Speed of Leaf River Group expressed confidence that things would work out for the apartment project. He said that the city's engineers had previously "signed off" on the engineering design. Referring to Monday's Planning Commission action, he said, "It's not like we had a faulty plan or anything. I just didn't technically meet the language of the letter in the ordinance." Speed declined to say whether the Planning Commission's vote was more political than substantive. Speed, himself, was not allowed to speak during the meeting in defense of the project or its drainage plan. He did acknowledge that, in his experience, the brush back in Fairhope is unusual.  "I've been doing this a long time in a lot of municipalities and that's the first time I've ever seen this occur," Speed said.

Wal-Mart said Thursday it plans to slow new store openings as it looks to pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. (AP file photo) Wal-Mart plans to slow new store openings By: The Associated Press October 6, 2016 2:26 pm 0 NEW YORK — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they’ll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores.

While you were sleeping: Wal-Mart, Twitter slide Oct. 7 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street was mixed as investors awaited Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report to gauge the timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike. A Labor Department report showed US initial jobless claims fell to 249,000 last week, the second-lowest level since 1973, underpinning bets the Fed will raise rates soon. Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls to increase by 175,000. “There’s no question about it, these are good numbers,” David Sloan, senior economist at 4Cast in New York, told Bloomberg. “The implication here is that the payrolls trend will remain healthy. The big picture is consistent with the Fed raising rates at some point this year, most likely in December.” In 2.08pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also inched 0.1 percent lower. In 1.53pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index eked out a 0.07 percent gain. “At the moment, what is driving the US market is a repricing around expectations of near-term Fed action,” Bill Merz, investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota, told Reuters. The Dow fell as slides in shares of American Express and those of Wal-Mart, recently down 3.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively, outweighed advances in shares of Home Depot and those of Apple, recently up 1.4 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores dropped after the retailer said it expects “relatively flat” earnings in its next fiscal year as it slows new-store openings to bolster its online business. For the year ending January 31, 2018, Wal-Mart expects earnings per share to be “relatively flat” from the previous fiscal year’s estimated adjusted EPS of between US$4.15 to US$4.35 a share, it said in a statement. “The company will rely more on comp sales and e-commerce growth to drive the top line and plans to slow new-store openings, while increasing investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives,” Wal-Mart said in the statement. Meanwhile, shares of Twitter sank, trading 20.2 percent lower as of 2.03pm in New York, as concern mounted no one wants to buy the social media company after it put itself up for sale last month. Alphabet’s Google does not plan to bid for Twitter, according to technology website Recode. Walt Disney won’t make a bid either, Recode reported, while Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. Meanwhile Salesforce.com might be interested. “I’m not saying I’m buying it, but I’m not saying I’m not buying it,” Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff told the New York Times. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a slide of 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX Index fell 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC 40 Index, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index declined 0.5 percent.

"It's just utter devastation" ... read more Hurricane Matthew downgraded as it moves north over US, death toll still rising Last updated 06:05, October 8 2016 AFP As Hurricane Matthew moves away from northern Florida, residents of Jacksonville leave their homes to fill gas tanks and buy groceries in the few open shops. A weakening Hurricane Matthew continued its march along the Atlantic coast of the United States early Saturday, lashing two of the south's most historic cities, flooding towns and gouging out roads. Are you a New Zealander living in southeast US and preparing for Hurricane Matthew? Email us at newstips@stuff.co.nz The storm was blamed for at least four deaths in Florida and knocked out power to more than one million homes and businesses as it made is way northward. In its long wake, it left nearly 900 people dead in Haiti. PHELAN EBENHACK/REUTERS A wall lies on the pavement after it was blown out at the LaPlaya Resort & Suites after the eye of Hurricane Matthew passed Daytona Beach, Florida. Early on Saturday, Matthew raked the Georgia and South Carolina coasts with torrential rain, staying just far enough offshore that coastal communities did not feel the force of its winds.

At 8am local time (1am NZ Time), Matthew was centred about 32km southeast of Charleston, its winds having dropped to 136kmh, a Category 1 storm. That was down from 233kmh when the storm roared into Haiti. Matthew brought heavy rain and some of the highest tides on record along the South Carolina coast. Streets and intersections in historic Charleston were flooded. At least one wind gust of 140kmh was recorded at Hilton Head, South Carolina. AFP US President Barack Obama says southern Florida's population centres had dodged the worst of Hurricane Matthew, although it remained "dangerous" with storm surges further up the coast a real concern. The storm also lashed Savannah, Georgia, another historic town of moss-draped squares and antebellum mansions. Ad Feedback More than 150,000 electric customers in South Carolina were without power, and 250,000 were in the dark in coastal Georgia. Matthew was expected to near North Carolina's southern coast by Saturday night. "Now is the time we ask for prayer," Governor Nikki Haley said, bowing her head. PHELAN EBENHACK/REUTERS A motorist drives around a downed tree blocking a road after the eye of Hurricane Matthew passed Ormond Beach, Florida. Matthew - the most powerful hurricane to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in more than a decade - set off alarms as it closed in on the US. But in the end, it skirted Florida's heavily populated Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area, and sideswiped the cities farther north, including Daytona Beach, Vero Beach, Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, without its centre ever actually coming ashore. From there, it scraped the Georgia coast, including the resort islands of St. Simons and Tybee. LOGAN ABASSI/UN/MINUSTAH Damage from Hurricane Matthew is seen from the air along the west coast of Haiti. RESIDENTS HUNKER DOWN Resident Steve Todd defied orders to evacuate Tybee even after the mayor called and pleaded with him to leave. As conditions rapidly deteriorated Friday night, Todd wasn't sounding quite so bold. "I'm not regretting staying," Todd said by telephone. "But I'm not going to lie: There's a little bit of nervous tension right now." PHELAN EBENHACK Rain batters homes as the eye of Hurricane Matthew passes Daytona Beach, Florida. Todd said he was staying with friends at a third-story condo, which had lost electricity. "It's throwing down right now," Todd said. "The trees are bending over. We saw a bush fly by. It's raining sideways now." FLOODS EXPECTED The National Hurricane Center (NHC) predicted the storm would possibly strike the US coast on Saturday morning or afternoon. "Regardless of whether or not the centre makes landfall, hurricane-force winds in the northern eyewall will lash much of the coast of South Carolina," an NHC advisory said. Matthew sideswiped Florida's coast with winds of up to 195 kph but did not make landfall. Governors in several states held news conferences on Saturday morning, including Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory warned storm surges and high winds could cause serious problems and was "extremely concerned" that the hurricane downgrade would cause residents not to take warnings seriously. Forecasters warned of flooding as 40 cm of rain were expected to fall in parts of the region along with massive storm surges and high tides. Some 20 cm of rain had fallen in the Savannah, Georgia area where Matthew downed trees and caused flooding. Though gradually weakening, Matthew - which triggered mass evacuations along the southeast US coast - was forecast to remain a hurricane until it begins moving away on Sunday, the NHC said. President Barack Obama and officials urged people to heed safety instructions. AFTER THE STORM In Florida, the storm gouged out several large sections of the coastal A1A highway north of Daytona Beach and had nearly completely washed out the northbound lane for about a mile at Flagler Beach. Florida officials urged residents not to rush back to homes that still lacked power on streets clogged with debris. "You are going to continue to see some flooding, damage and power outages," Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry told reporters on Saturday, adding that the roads into the beach area would be reopened to residents around midday. "It's pretty bad; it's jagged all over the place," said Oliver Shields, whose two-storey house is within sight of the highway. The deaths in Florida included an elderly St Lucie County couple who died from carbon monoxide fumes while running a generator in their garage and two women who were killed when trees fell on a home and a camper. As the storm tracks north, more than a million people have been told to flee. About 500,000 people were under evacuation orders in the Jacksonville area, along with another half-million on the Georgia coast. More than 300,000 fled their homes in South Carolina. St. Augustine, which is the nation's oldest permanently occupied European settlement and includes a 17th-century Spanish fortress and many historic homes turned into bed-and-breakfasts, was left awash in rain and gray seawater. "We have been very fortunate that Matthew's strongest winds have remained a short distance offshore of the Florida and Georgia coasts thus far, but this should not be a reason to let down our guard," the Hurricane Center said in a forecast discussion. Airlines cancelled at least 5000 flights earlier in the week, including many in and out of Orlando, Florida, where all three of the resort city's world-famous theme parks - Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld - closed because of the storm. But things have begun getting back to normal, with flights resuming in Miami and other South Florida airports. And power companies in Florida promised that electricity would be almost fully restored by the end of the weekend. In areas the storm had already passed, residents and officials began to assess the damage. Robert Tyler had feared the storm surge would flood his street two blocks from the Cape Canaveral beach. Tree branches fell, he could hear transformers exploding overnight, and the windows seemed as if they were about to blow in, despite the plywood over them. Hope all my friends are safe. Homage to the victims of Hurricane #Matthew— Arif Hussain (@arifhussaintm) October 8, 2016 Rain blowing in Hurricane Matthew. Berkeley County South Carolina #SouthCarolina #Matthew #HurricaneMatthew pic.twitter.com/qUYBvg2upD— Derek Baker (@RobotSynergy) October 8, 2016 But in the morning, there wasn't much water, his home didn't appear to be damaged on first inspection, and his vehicles were unharmed. "Overnight, it was scary as heck," Tyler said. "That description of a freight train is pretty accurate." 'WE GOT LUCKY' While northern Florida saw the brunt of the storm, residents of Palm Beach County to the south were taking down shutters, raking up leaves and cleaning up the effects of the storm. "We got lucky," David Pinciss. He noted that the state's governor had been dramatic in news conferences, but also said he was glad he evacuated. "Whatever the governor said was going to happen didn't happen, and that's good," he said. At the Breakers Hotel on Palm Beach, Mark Reid, director of golf and grounds, was treating his team of 30 workers to lunch Friday. "They all left their homes this morning before they even had a chance to take their shutters down to come into work, and I'm grateful for that," Reid said. He added that the oceanfront hotel's grounds suffered no damage. "Just a few palm fronds to clean up," Reid said.

(AFP/Leon Neal) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LONDON: US oil rose above US$50 a barrel in New York on Thursday (Oct 6) for the first time since June, lifting energy shares, but sharp falls in Twitter and Wal-Mart spoiled the party for Wall Street. Overshadowing strength in the key commodity was anticipation ahead of Friday's US jobs report, likely to give clues as to the Federal Reserves next rate move. Dealers attributed oil's success in smashing the key US$50 resistance point to a lingering reaction to a surprising drawdown in US oil stocks, reported on Wednesday, as well as a cautious belief that the OPEC cartel will come through on a promised supply cut. "Oil prices continued to gain strength with WTI crude gaining a foothold above US$50 per barrel after this week's surprise US inventory drawdown added to bullish sentiment built up after last week's OPEC decision to cut output," said Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets. The US$50 mark is crucial as it makes drilling cost-effective for many companies. Shares in oil companies Halliburton, BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron all rose. 'RUNNING ON EMPTY' But some analysts doubted the oil rally's staying power. "These gains now appear to be running on empty," said Craig Erlam, an analyst at Oanda, warning that OPEC may never harden up its "loose deal", and that the oil market remains oversupplied. European equities meanwhile pulled back slightly, extending Wednesday's losses seen on talk that the European Central Bank may rein in its massive stimulation programme, known as quantitative easing. However, minutes from the latest ECB meeting, published on Thursday, failed to point to any such policy change. Analysts also poured cold water on the idea, saying that no 'tapering' should be expected until next year at the earliest. In fact, said Capital Economics, the ECB is "more likely to extend, than taper, its asset purchases". Still, equity markets failed to recoup their losses, instead "treading cautiously ahead of tomorrow's key non-farm payroll report", analysts at Schwab observed. In London, an EasyJet profit warning caused the stock to slump and weighed on the entire travel sector. DOLLAR SINKS POUND Another round of positive data out of Washington, this time an unexpected drop in first-time unemployment benefit claims, reinforced views that the world's top economy is back on track and able to deal with the impact of tighter borrowing costs. The dollar rose again on rate hike expectations, in turn pushing the British pound to a fresh 31-year low. Meanwhile, shares in Twitter tanked on a report that Google and other tech giants Apple and Disney will not bid for the company. Wal-Mart Stores stock lost ground after the company projected that fiscal 2018 earnings would be flat amid a period of heavy investments in e-commerce and increased staff pay in the US.  - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Posted 06 Oct 2016 19:50 Updated 07 Oct 2016 02:45 A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California April 13, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it plans to focus heavily on its e-commerce operations on Thursday and warned investors that the cost of the long-term plan would weigh on earnings over the next two years. The strategy by the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which includes slowing the pace of new store openings, is centered on cracking the dominance of Amazon.com Inc in online retailing and face off against other rivals like Target . Wal-Mart's shares were down 2.9 percent in afternoon trading at US$69.59. "This company over time will look like an e-commerce company," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Wal-Mart's plan includes doubling the number of its large warehouses focused on e-commerce sales to 10 in 2016, Reuters reported. It now has the ability to ship to most of the United States in one day. The company spent more than US$3 billion in August to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com, which attracts millennial shoppers, and could help boost sales. Wal-Mart is looking for online sales growth of 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, and for even faster growth in the next few years. Online sales currently account for about 3 percent of total sales. Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenses at about US$11 billion, similar to this year. Fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth is now likely to be at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent. While the investments in online growth will be a challenge to margins, they are "essential for future-proofing the business for the long run", Cowen & Co analysts said in a research note. The company has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital from about US$300 million in 2013 to US$1.1 billion this year for a total of about US$3 billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 percent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added. In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart plans to build 35 supercenters compared to 69 last year. It will only open 20 neighborhood markets from 161 last year.

Wal-Mart said Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, it plans to slow new store openings as it looks to pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.52, or 2 percent, to $70.15 in afternoon trading. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they’ll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.   Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

No one was injured. (Ariane Kunze/The Columbian) By Jessica Prokop, Columbian Courts Reporter Published: October 6, 2016, 10:39 AM A   A A Wyoming man who allegedly opened fire inside the Hazel Dell Wal-Mart on Wednesday morning told authorities that he had taken “speed” a couple days prior and planned to kill himself but changed his mind, court documents show. Shaun Michael Sprague, 35, of Sheridan, Wyo., appeared Thursday in Clark County Superior Court on suspicion of second-degree assault stemming from the shooting and first-degree arson in an unrelated residential fire in Hazel Dell on Tuesday. Sprague wore a suicide-prevention smock — given to prisoners who may try to harm themselves with standard jail clothing — and appeared to be a bit dazed during the proceeding. Judge Gregory Gonzales asked Sprague several times if he understood his rights and repeated them one at a time. Sprague told jail officials that he suffers from mental health problems, according to court documents. His court-appointed attorney, Gerry Wear, said he may raise competency issues at a later date. Deputy Prosecutor Randy St. Clair asked Gonzales to find probable cause for second-degree assault in the shooting, rather than the three counts of first-degree assault referred by law enforcement. Gonzales found probable cause exists in both cases. Clark County sheriff’s deputies detained Sprague just before 7 a.m. inside the Wal-Mart at 9000 N.E. Highway 99 after a 911 caller reported an active shooter at the store, according to the sheriff’s office. No one was shot or injured during the incident. Sprague had a revolver pistol on him and reportedly fired shots near the Subway restaurant inside the store near the front entrance, according to a probable cause affidavit filed in Superior Court. The store had been open for about an hour when the shooting occurred. Employees and shoppers either evacuated or sheltered in place, sheriff’s office spokesman Sgt. Fred Neiman said. Officers searched the store for potential victims and accomplices, but none were located. Assault case Jake Bodle, a Subway manager, told The Columbian on Wednesday that he spoke with Sprague earlier in the morning. He said he was outside smoking when Sprague approached him and asked for a cigarette. Bodle declined. Sprague then came into the store and told Bodle he wanted a sandwich. Bodle said the restaurant wasn’t open yet but that he’d make him a sandwich once he was done preparing for the day, the affidavit states. Bodle told detectives that he was in and out of the back room setting up the restaurant, and when he walked back to the front counter, he saw Sprague point a gun toward merchandise in the store. Sprague fired six shots and then placed the revolver on a nearby table, according to court documents. Bodle fled to the back area and saw Sprague fire two more shots in the same direction, before placing the gun on the table again, court records said. A manager at Wal-Mart called 911, and deputies arrived within five to 10 minutes and detained Sprague. During an interview with police, Sprague said he’s owned the revolver for about five years, according to the affidavit. He went into the Wal-Mart because he was cold and wet, he said, and planned to kill himself but changed his mind, court documents said. While at the Clark County Jail, he told officers that he had used “speed” — a term for amphetamines — a couple days before the shooting and said, “none of this would have happened before I used that (expletive),” court records show. Arson case In the arson case, Sprague allegedly set a kitchen fire Tuesday at the home he was staying at in the 3000 block of Northeast 75th Street. He dipped a pair of fuzzy dice in gasoline, lit them on fire and placed them inside a kitchen cabinet, a separate probable cause affidavit states. A roommate, Artem Popov, told officers that he went to bed at about 11 p.m. the night before and awoke to the sound of the smoke detector and smell of smoke. He went downstairs and found a fire in a kitchen cabinet and extinguished it, court records said. He then smelled rotten eggs and found that the gas line had been disconnected to the water heater in the garage. Sprague was the only other person at the house when Popov went to bed, he said, and there were no signs of forced entry, according to court documents. During his court appearance, St. Clair said it appears that Sprague is a transient and has some criminal history in Wyoming, mostly convictions for driving while under the influence and criminal trespassing. Gonzales set his bail at $80,000 between the two cases. Sprague will be arraigned Oct. 20.   Jessica Prokop Columbian Courts Reporter  360-735-4551  @jprokop16  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

The S&P 500 traded just above the flatline, with materials leading advancers and health care the top decliner. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.17 percent, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell more than 2 percent. The three major indexes had traded further below the flatline earlier in the session, with the Dow falling 118.06 points at session lows. The Labor Department is scheduled to release its September jobs report on Friday, with economists polled by Reuters expecting the U.S. economy to have added 175,000 jobs and unemployment holding steady at 4.9 percent. "The market is processing the likelihood of a Fed rate hike. If you look at the yield curve, it's higher. I think investors looking for yield are reconsidering some of their holdings," said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. "We expect jobs growth to continue in health care, tech and finance," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, adding he expects the U.S. economy to have added 176,000 jobs last month. "The labor market is very strong. This is pretty unusual heading into an election." "Such low unemployment numbers are talking some of the most pessimistic talking points off the table." The jobs report will come on the back of upbeat U.S. data released Wednesday, including the strongest print on the ISM non-manufacturing index for the year. On Thursday, weekly jobless claims fell to 249,000. "A weak Jobs Report on Friday would erase any of the positive sentiment gained with yesterday's strong number," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. "Using ADP's estimate of Private Payrolls as a guide, employers apparently added +158K workers in September albeit the government's official release could differ greatly. While the FOMC would prefer a bigger boost to hiring, such a print would clear the hurdle necessary to add restrictive measures for only the second time in a decade given that the Core PCE has risen to its most elevated point in twenty-three months," he said. Investors and traders have been keeping a close eye on economic data as they gauge the likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates later this year. "The jobless claims were pretty good, and that reinforces the case for the Fed to raise interest rates," said Adrian Day, CEO of Adrian Day Asset Management. "I can't see them raising rates in November, but I do think they will go in December." Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors, said regarding the jobs report: "In the great scheme of things, it's not that important. We've gotten to such a low level of unemployment that you're going to need something big to bring back more people into the workforce." "What's going to be important is earnings. You've got pretty easy comparisons from last year, when oil was plummeting and fear was rampant," she said. Earnings season kicks off next week, when Alcoa releases its quarterly results. "Right now, the blended S&P 500 3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 expected EPS growth rate is -1.20%, an expected deceleration from last earnings season when 2Q 2016 earnings grew by +2.0%. This is wrong," Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, said in a note to clients. "Our research indicates a high likelihood 3Q 2016 year-over-year growth will be superior to 2Q 2016. Take that to the bank too." On tap this week: *Planner subject to change.

Posted 07 Oct 2016 01:34 Wal-Mart will open 130 new stores in the United States in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135-155 stores. (AFP/Joe Raedle) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores projected on Thursday (Oct 6) earnings would be flat in fiscal year 2018 as it pumps up investment in e-commerce initiatives. Wal-Mart said earnings for the next fiscal year that begins Feb 1 will be essentially unchanged from those of fiscal 2017, which are expected to come in at US$4.15 to US$4.35 a share. That was below analysts' forecast of US$4.47 earnings per share. Shares of Dow member Wal-Mart tumbled 2.4 per cent to US$69.95 in late-morning trade. The world's biggest retailer said it would slow investment in new stores and steer funds to e-commerce, technology and store remodels. The moves come as retailers scramble to do more to beef up e-commerce and integrate mobile technology into operations, such as letting customers order groceries online and pick them up in the store. "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," said Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. Faced with surging growth at Amazon and other online retailers, Wal-Mart's response in the online sector has included a US$3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and taking a 10.8 per cent stake in Chinese firm JD.com. The US giant is reportedly in talks to invest US$1 billion in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart. Wal-Mart forecasted an overall capital budget of US$11 billion in both fiscal 2017 and 2018, down from US$11.5 billion in 2016. It will open 130 new stores in the United States in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135-155 stores. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company expects to build 55 new stores in the US in fiscal 2018. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

(WMT) Stock Is a Prize (If You’re Patient) A lackluster forecast for 2017 shouldn't really be a surprise given WMT's long-term goals By Dan Burrows, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Oct 6, 2016, 12:16 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Gaining Too Much Momentum to Ignore Bank of America Corp (BAC) Is an Even ‘Biglier’ Buy Under Trump Recent Posts: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock’s “Trump Threat” Is Overblown The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 Bank of America Corp (BAC) Is an Even ‘Biglier’ Buy Under Trump View All Posts Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) issued a downbeat outlook on Thursday, and Walmart stock sold off as a result. But WMT bulls know patience is a virtue as the company implements its turnaround plans. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr WMT is curbing its capital spending plan while making investments in e-commerce and employee wages. It’s not a new strategy, and it was expected to be a drag on earnings for a number of years. Sure enough, Walmart predicts that next year’s earnings per share will be flat compared with the current year. For fiscal 2017, WMT earnings are pegged at $4.29 to $4.49 per share on a net basis. Adjusted earnings (which is what Wall Street cares about) are targeted at $4.15 to $4.35 per share. Analysts were looking for adjusted earnings of $4.34 a share this year and $4.48 a share next year. If a company issues an outlook below Street forecasts, it’s going to sell off. Fair enough. But Walmart is looking farther out than just 2018. Walmart Has to Adapt to Survive Walmart is coming under increasing pressure from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and is responding by pouring money into its own segment. Indeed, it recently committed $3 billion in cash to acquire Jet.com. At the same time, it’s investing in sprucing up stores and the customer experience to compete with Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). Walmart also is raising wages, and apparently the market didn’t account for the totality of those expenses in its earnings estimates. Capital expenditures are projected to be $11 billion next year as Walmart slows the rate of new stores and invests in making the extant store base more attractive. WMT is trying to rely more on margin expansion and less on driving growth by adding new locations. The idea is that same-store sales growth and gains in e-commerce can boost the top line more profitably in place of additional bricks and mortar. It’s a credible strategy, but risky. It’s also going to be a while before Walmart stock holders figure out whether it’s working or not. Staying Frosty With Walmart Stock The market isn’t dismissing the possibility of success, but it’s not giving Walmart the benefit of the doubt, either. Just look at Walmart stock, which flattened out in July following a multi-month rally. That’s not really a shock with WMT gaining 17% for the year-to-date. At their peak, shares were up more than 20% in 2016. A pause after such a run isn’t abnormal. It’s also probably the case that WMT’s valuation needs to cool off a bit to lure in patient value investors. By Walmart’s new earnings forecast, it trades at about 16 times forward earnings. That’s much cheaper than the S&P 500, but still above its own longer-term average. It’s worth noting that the last half decade mostly precedes ongoing turnaround efforts. At any rate, WMT stock has an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.5 for the past five years. Based on that, shares may have to lose a few more percentage points to make the valuation compelling. That wouldn’t be a disaster. As Walmart’s lackluster forecast shows, this is a story that extends beyond next year. And we always knew this was going to be a long game. If it weren’t obvious enough, WMT told us so itself. We’re talking years. If Walmart can pull it off — and so far the results are promising — you can bet that a more optimistic market will be happy to give shares a little multiple expansion. For now, they’re likely to trade sideways. But it’s reasonable to assume that down the road, Walmart stock will be trading at a higher price than it is today. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Wal-Mart said earnings for the next fiscal year that begins February 1 will be essentially unchanged from those of fiscal 2017, which are expected to come in at $4.15 to $4.35 a share. That was below analysts' forecast of $4.47 earnings per share. Shares of Dow member Wal-Mart tumbled 2.4 percent to $69.95 in late-morning trade. The world's biggest retailer said it would slow investment in new stores and steer funds to e-commerce, technology and store remodels. The moves come as retailers scramble to do more to beef up e-commerce and integrate mobile technology into operations, such as letting customers order groceries online and pick them up in the store. "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," said Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. Faced with surging growth at Amazon and other online retailers, Wal-Mart's response in the online sector has included a $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and taking a 10.8 percent stake in Chinese firm JD.com. The US giant is reportedly in talks to invest $1 billion in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart. Wal-Mart forecasted an overall capital budget of $11 billion in both fiscal 2017 and 2018, down from $11.5 billion in 2016. It will open 130 new stores in the United States in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135-155 stores. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company expects to build 55 new stores in the US in fiscal 2018.

(Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $2.16, or 3 percent, to $69.51 in morning trading Thursday. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. STATESMAN JOURNAL Embattled Theranos founder announces layoffs, strategic shift But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of other changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It's melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn't push the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. STATESMAN JOURNAL Jackson Family Wines buys WillaKenzie Estate "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/2dNI8Uv TOP VIDEOS Bill Cosby: Hopes of resuming illustrious career 0:26 Closing Bell: Emerging markets decline on Trump Win 1:08 Procter & Gamble merges beauty business with Coty 3:19 Gadget Makers Target Health At CES Unveiled 1:41 Chinese spend billions on singles day 0:55 McDonald's Workers Share Birthday and Last Name 1:44 Try out Google's Daydream View 1:47 UAW President would welcome meeting with Trump 0:46 Chinese company launches Single's Day shopping festival 0:48 Maldonado thinks diversity in Hollywood is on track 2:23

Hong, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $2.16, or 3 percent, to $69.51 in morning trading Thursday. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of other changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It’s melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Oct 6, 2016 at 10:09AM If you have any of these paints, do not use them and do dispose of them safely. Image source: Sargent Art. When people worry about bacteria, those concerns usually revolve around food. That makes sense because, in general, getting sick from a tainted product involves ingestion, and aside from the rare kid in elementary school who eats paste, generally non-edible items are not an infection concern. That makes it all the more surprising that Sargent Art has had to recall 2.8 million units of craft paint sold at retailers including Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Hobby Lobby, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) after finding that the tubes, bottles, and other containers may be contaminated with bacteria. "This recall involves 13 types of Sargent Art tempera and finger paints," according to a recall notice posted on the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) website. What is the risk? According to the CPSC, Sargent Art's tempera and finger paints in different colors and sizes sold from May 2015 to June 2016 "can contain harmful bacteria." Exposure to that bacteria "can have adverse health effects in immunocompromised individuals, posing a risk of serious illness including a bacterial infection," the federal agency wrote. Consumers are warned to stop using those paints immediately and contact Sargent Art at at 800-827-8081or online at sargentart.com to arrange for a refund. It's worth noting that even though the CPSC says that consumers with healthy immune systems are not generally affected by the bacteria, it's still recommended that anyone with these paints stop using them. The elevated bacteria levels were discovered by Sargent Art during routine quality control inspections, according to an FAQ posted by the company. People do not need to send the paint back to the company in order to receive a refund, but they must take photos to document that it has been destroyed in order to get their money back. "The product can be disposed of by simply pouring it down your sink drain," the company wrote. "Please be sure to rinse any area clean that the paint has touched. The packaging or bottle that your paint was in can be disposed of by utilizing your normal trash disposal." How does this impact Wal-Mart and Amazon? If nobody gets sick, a recall for a fairly obscure product line should not have a negative impact on business for Wal-Mart, Amazon, or any other retailer selling these paints. This will only become a problem for those companies if a child with a compromised immune system falls ill in a way that can be attributed to the tainted product. In this case, Wal-Mart and Amazon have to pull these products from their shelves and hope that nobody gets sick. Children's art paint is not a core part of their business, but any illness caused by these items could lead to bad publicity. Public reaction to bacteria-related recalls can be unpredictable. This case will almost certainly blow over without any major problem, but until the danger has passed, any retailer that sold the paints should be vigilant while hoping that nobody gets sick.

Posted 06 Oct 2016 19:50 Updated 07 Oct 2016 02:45 A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California April 13, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it plans to focus heavily on its e-commerce operations on Thursday and warned investors that the cost of the long-term plan would weigh on earnings over the next two years. The strategy by the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which includes slowing the pace of new store openings, is centered on cracking the dominance of Amazon.com Inc in online retailing and face off against other rivals like Target . Wal-Mart's shares were down 2.9 percent in afternoon trading at US$69.59. "This company over time will look like an e-commerce company," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Wal-Mart's plan includes doubling the number of its large warehouses focused on e-commerce sales to 10 in 2016, Reuters reported. It now has the ability to ship to most of the United States in one day. The company spent more than US$3 billion in August to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com, which attracts millennial shoppers, and could help boost sales. Wal-Mart is looking for online sales growth of 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, and for even faster growth in the next few years. Online sales currently account for about 3 percent of total sales. Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenses at about US$11 billion, similar to this year. Fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth is now likely to be at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent. While the investments in online growth will be a challenge to margins, they are "essential for future-proofing the business for the long run", Cowen & Co analysts said in a research note. The company has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital from about US$300 million in 2013 to US$1.1 billion this year for a total of about US$3 billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 percent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added. In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart plans to build 35 supercenters compared to 69 last year. It will only open 20 neighborhood markets from 161 last year.

(Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press) Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is accelerating its investment in e-commerce in a bid to narrow the gap with Amazon.com Inc. and to give it an even more dominant position against the rest of the field in retail. The world's largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon's robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. Walmart's quest to become Canada's No. 1 grocery store "We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day," Traweek said. Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. "These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon," said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target and others. "Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them." Expanded online offerings Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 per cent of Wal-Mart's overall sales. Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. Amazon expansion could be just what Canadian e-commerce needs The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. "This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience," said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Amazon to develop groceries under private label: report Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. Trying to narrow the gap Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pa., two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 per cent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. Amazon passes Walmart in terms of market value The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 per cent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. "Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach," he said. Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000. © Thomson Reuters, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines $25 basic TV can't stop customers from cutting their cable in record numbers November 13, 5:00 AM ET read comments Trudeau set to woo big-money foreign, domestic investors November 13, 4:17 PM ET read comments More exploding phones and tackling telemarketers: The Marketplace cheat sheet November 13, 5:00 AM ET read comments Labatt employees mourn the end of beer-for-life era November 13, 5:10 PM ET video Act quickly to OK Keystone XL pipeline, Mitch McConnell tells Donald Trump November 11, 3:28 PM ET read comments Must Watch Video Debt piling up 1:44 Jacqueline Hansen reports on Canadians' rising load of non-mortgage debt Video Approving pipeline 6:02 Joseph McMonigle of The Abraham Group on what it might take to get Donald Trump to approve Keystone XL Video Trump's tax holiday 5:39 Charles St-Arnaud on Trump's tax plan that could see corporations divert billions out of Canada and other countries Video Trump's unexpected election win 4:40 Ramona Pringle on how pollsters misjudged the election result, and the role social media played Watch The Exchange here Watch Recent shows and interviews Recent discussions about business news and newsmakers Markets TSX COMPOSITE   Rotate stock indices Pause stock rotation Show previous stock PLAY Nov 13, 2016 12:00 AM ET Nov 13, 2016 12:00 AM ET Nov 13, 2016 12:00 AM ET Nov 13, 2016 12:00 AM ET Nov 13, 2016 12:00 AM ET Index Last Trade Change TSX COMPOSITE 14555.41 -188.84 DOW 18847.66 39.78 NASDAQ 5237.11 28.31 SP 500 2164.45 -3.03 TSX-VENTURE 727.91 -15.72 The data on this site is informational only and may be delayed; it is not intended as trading or investment advice and you should not rely on it as such.

Life Buy/Sell Business Wal-Mart plans to slow new store openings, invest in online By Anne D'Innocenzio • Associated Press Oct 6, 2016 (…) Updated at 9:45 a.m. NEW YORK  • Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $2.16, or 3 percent, to $69.51 in morning trading Thursday. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of other changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It's melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn't push the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan. How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

Nandita Bose CHICAGO and CHICAGO — Reuters Published Thursday, Oct. 06, 2016 6:38AM EDT Last updated Thursday, Oct. 06, 2016 12:01PM EDT Comments AA Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday tempered its profit forecast for the next two fiscal years and said it would slow new store openings as it spends heavily on a long-term plan to transform itself into an e-commerce company. Shares of Wal-Mart, which backed this year’s earnings outlook, were down 2.3 per cent in midday trading. The company said it expected online sales, which now account for about 3 per cent of its total, to show a 20 per cent to 30 per cent increase in the second half of this year and rise even faster in the next few years. “This company over time will look like an e-commerce company,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. New e-commerce chief Marc Lore said the company was relying on its logistics and supply chain network to win in online sales. Reuters reported Wal-Mart would double its number of large warehouses in 2016 and could ship to most of the United States in one day. Wal-Mart said it expected flat earnings for the year ending on Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenditures at about $11-billion, similar to this year. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 per cent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added. The company will moderate the roll-out of its Neighborhood Market grocery stores, he said. Wal-Mart has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital efforts from about $300-million in 2013 to $1.1-billion this year for a total of about $3-billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports. The company also spent more than $3-billion to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com. Wal-Mart said it expected fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 per cent to 10 per cent.

Brittney McNamaraOct 6, 2016 8:53AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestWholesale Halloween Costumes It's that time again! The air is turning cold, the leaves are changing, and stores are putting their most offensive Halloween costumes out on the racks. That's right. It's 2016 and we've already found a fresh new Halloween trend that's actual trash. According to Mic, Walmart recently pulled a costume from its website after complaints flooded in. Amazon pulled the same costume down from their website as well. The costume itself is called "tranny granny." "The costume includes a white tank dress with pink collar and colorful flowers all over as well as curvaceous butt and boob pads to complete the look," the Walmart.com description read, according to the Huffington Post. "This granny wouldn't go anywhere without her pink babushka with flower design headband to keep her hair perfectly in place. Slap on some makeup and get ready for your granny walk and you will have the room roaring with laughter!" Not only is the costume itself a mockery of trans identity, making it both offensive and potentially damaging, but the name is awful as well. "Tranny" is a slur that is used to dehumanize transgender women. Not only is it degrading, but by mocking trans identity, this costume provides even more space for the transphobia that already exists in our society. What's more is that this costume caused an uproar last year too. The same year, one company pushed a Caitlyn Jenner costume, encouraging people to dress up as Caitlyn. Again, the message here ends up being that transgender identity is somehow a costume, reducing it to a caricature. This both very incorrect and very disturbing. Transgender identity is real, trans people have feelings, their identities are valid and they are just people. What is there to make fun of? The more we accept costumes that mock an identity, race, or culture, the more we perpetuate the idea that certain identities matter less or not at all. Though Walmart and Amazon pulled the costume from their websites, it still exists elsewhere. If you're an ally of the LGBTQ community, and you see this costume when you're out shopping, then make a complaint if you you feel comfortable. We've got some great costume ideas for you instead.
