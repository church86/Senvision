Idaho Falls 0  Updated at 4:17 pm, November 7th, 2016 By: Natalia Hepworth, EastIdahoNews.com Share This Story We Matched Construction in front of the Idaho Falls Walmart. IDAHO FALLS — A lot of residents have noticed construction in front of the Ammon and Idaho Falls Walmart stores, but store management says the inconvenience will soon be coming to an end. Managers at both locations have confirmed gas stations are being built on their parking lots. Groundbreaking for these stations began at the end of September for both the Ammon and Idaho Falls stores. Construction is expected to be complete by the beginning of the new year. Management for the Ammon Walmart confirmed that the gas station will be owned and operated by Walmart and will included a convenience store. EastIdahoNews.com reached out to the Idaho Falls Walmart and they confirmed that there will be a gas station, but did not confirm if it would be Walmart owned and operated. Store officials say Walmart gas stations are part of a new Walmart standard. CSP Daily News reports that Walmart is moving forward with its plan to build and operate its own gas stations across the nation. The Rexburg Walmart, which opened at the beginning of this year, was the first in east Idaho to have a Walmart gas station. It includes a convenience store run by Walmart employees as well.

Target co-created content on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter most often than other networks.   Instagram pros—All eight brands used Instagram for visual storytelling, with North Face, Nike and Sephora being the strongest.   The top performers on Twitter and Facebook are below.   Ranking of average response times (Twitter):      1. Sephora – 62 minutes 2. Lululemon – 132 minutes 3. Target – 212 minutes 4. Amazon – 220 minutes 5. Walmart –  1,710 minutes 6. REI – 1,655 minutes        Ranking of average response times (Facebook):   1. Amazon – 76 minutes 2. Sephora – 87 minutes 3. Lululemon – 87 minutes 4. Target – 333 minutes 5. Walmart –  496 minutes 6. REI – 1,132 minutes   More specifically, the State of Social Engagement unveiled the tactics retail brands are successfully using on social media:       Amazon and Sephora were at the top of the rankings with the highest engagement on online communities, strong visual storytelling, appropriate use of each social channel and content integration across channels.     Target performed well in co-creating content with influencers.     All eight brands surveyed leveraged Instagram for visual storytelling, with The North Face and Sephora doing so most successfully.     The majority of the eight retail brands surveyed focused their content on converting, persuading and support. Sephora and Target both had the most "convert" content – defined as linking to a microsite where the consumer can make a purchase or learn where to buy.   The State of Social Engagement uncovered the areas of social media where retail brands succeed over the other surveyed industries (telecommunications, consumer products, travel & hospitality, financial services, media, technology and pharmaceuticals):       Engagement: Of the industries surveyed, the retail industry ranked at the top when it came to engaging consumers. In fact, the top five most engaging brands in the study were all from the retail industry. The brands with the highest engagement scores also tended to have the highest Klout scores. As a top performer, the retail industry also had the highest average scores for Facebook and Twitter engagement.     Influencer Collaboration: Very few brands in the survey used influencer collaboration well, but those in the retail industry performed best, with Target being a standout. Influencer co-creation helps "amp up" sharing and opens the brand to exposure among the influencers' followings. Retail was the only industry that used all six major social channels studied (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and online communities).     Online communities: Retail brands were among the most adept at using online communities to drive deeper understanding about their products and provide answers to consumers' product questions.

Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said on Thursday. Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card. Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964. "The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind," Eckert said. U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc's Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores. Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 U.S. stores. Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register. An e-receipt is sent to the app. Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month. He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay. Wal-Mart leads a consortium of U.S. retailers developing a mobile wallet app called CurrentC. The group, which includes Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc, said earlier this year it would delay launching the app after the project hit several roadblocks.

Trinity planned to have a Walmart anchor its massive retail and commercial project in Lakeview, but now won't say if those plans have changed What's the plan? Trinity planned to have a Walmart anchor its massive retail and commercial project in Lakeview, but now won't say if those plans have changed next play/pause pre Mississauga News By Louie Rosella Walmart is no longer coming to Lakeview. The North American retail giant revealed the news Monday, Nov. 7 in an email to Ward 1 Coun. Jim Tovey, saying it will not be erecting a store in Trinity Development’s massive commercial and retail project on Lakeshore Road. "Since 2006 we have opened more than 320 Walmart Supercentres, which have proven very popular with customers and are present in almost every market in the Canadian market,” according to an email that Tovey said was sent to him by Christine Bome, senior director of public affairs for Walmart. “We are redirecting our focus and investment to improve our existing network of stores, distribution centres and e-commerce offer.  As a result we will not proceed with plans to open the store at Lakeshore and Cawthra.” Tovey told The News he is disappointed, but not surprised with the decision. He said he believes Walmart didn’t want to “cannibalize” their marketplace by opening a store not far from the popular Dundas Street and Dixie Road location. Walmart has yet to reply to a request for comment. Tovey said Walmart is still leasing the space and, in a meeting Friday with the councillor, executives said they would be willing to explore “community uses” for the giant office space in a potential sub-leasing arrangement. Tovey said this is “good news” for Lakeview, a community undergoing a plethora of revitalization. There will likely be a public meeting soon to discuss possible options for the now-vacant space. “We don’t want 84,000 square feet of office space sitting there empty,” Tovey said. Trinity Development reported earlier this year that Walmart would be opening a location on the Lakeview property just west of Cawthra Road — information that was confirmed by Mike Bottigoni, senior vice-president of construction for Trinity. However, the large development firm wouldn’t make the same affirmation a few months ago, fuelling speculation there were issues in negotiations. The idea of a Walmart in Lakeview has been met with mixed public opinion. Tovey and other Lakeview residents have long been opposed to "large format" retail stores anywhere within the Lakeshore corridor, particularly when Trinity first made its initial proposals for 501 Lakeshore Road public. Dorothy Tomiuk, vice-president of the Town of Port Credit Association, remains opposed to a Walmart in Lakeview. Tomiuk said Port Credit should retain its distinct village character and Lakeview should be allowed to develop its own unique village character according to the vision of the community. The plan by Trinity Developments, which owns 14.5 acres of land, is to open an anchor store as part of a phased, mixed-use development that also includes residential buildings, office space, shopping and cafes on the prime piece of land at Lakeshore Road East and Enola Avenue. Stores planning to open include a Coffee Culture, a Bank of Montreal and other shops. The project will create 1,500 jobs and generate $3 million in annual taxes, Trinity said back in 2013. Walmart is set to open a 136,000-square-foot Supercentre at Erin Mills Town Centre on Dec. 8.. Louie Rosella is a reporter with The Mississauga News and Brampton Guardian.

 Management shakeups hit Walmart and Target BI Intelligence Nov. 7, 2016, 12:50 PM 6,617 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also E-Commerce & Online Payment Technologies Overview & Trends Amazon rules ecommerce and everybody else is fighting for its scraps RETAIL FORECAST: U.S. consumers will spend $632 billion online by 2020 This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Traditional retailers are scrambling to catch up in the e-commerce space, particularly with Amazon, and as a result, management roles are being shaken up. Top executives from both Walmart and Target are exiting the respective companies as the retailers look to adjust their business models and better meet consumer needs. Both Walmart and Target are losing multiple executives: Walmart: After acquiring Jet.com for $3 billion in August, former Jet CEO Marc Lore has taken over Walmart's e-commerce operations, which includes operating both sites' digital platforms. This month, Walmart is losing some of its core e-commerce team members, including Fernando Madeira, head of Walmart.com, Dianne Mills, SVP of global e-commerce human resources, and Brent Beabout, SVP of e-commerce supply chain, reports The Wall Street Journal. Target: Target likewise has been experiencing a fundamental shakeup in its management. Last week it was announced that Target's grocery chief Anne Dament would be stepping down after just 18 months, reports Retail Dive. This follows the exit of Target's chief digital officer Jason Goldberger in September, and chief marketing officer Jeff Jones' departure in August. The firm reported a a 7% year-over-year (YoY) decline in total sales during Q2 2016. Walmart's confidence in Lore to grow its overall digital business could signal a lack of success the company has with its own e-commerce division. While acquiring Jet.com could add to Walmart's overall online sales, simply onboarding the company does not address internal issues that remain, according to Columbia University professor Mark Cohen. Leaning on Jet.com's assets could help propel Walmart's online business, but the company should remain committed to enhancing its current e-commerce operations outside of Jet.com as well in order to become a stronger player in the online market. Target has faced numerous hurdles in the e-commerce market. It has struggled to find success with grocery — a product line that lends itself well to click and collect — and overall, digital still only accounts for 3.3% of total sales. Goldberger's exit after only four months in the role, along with other recent departures, highlights an instability within Target that could further push the company behind its competitors.

The big-box super chains Wal-Mart and Target appear to be imitating each other this holiday season. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times; Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Associated Press Privacy Policy Wal-Mart and Target are each taking a cue from the other this holiday season.  After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target Corp., which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals.  The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise.  Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Ark.-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell.  Stores hustle to get their holiday goods as fallout from the Hanjin shipping mess continues Natalie Kitroeff The last Hanjin Shipping vessel dropping off goods in California has set sail from the Port of Long Beach, finally clearing the many ships left stranded by the company’s sudden collapse two months ago. But in its wake, the giant shipping line has left a mess that retailers across the country will... The last Hanjin Shipping vessel dropping off goods in California has set sail from the Port of Long Beach, finally clearing the many ships left stranded by the company’s sudden collapse two months ago. But in its wake, the giant shipping line has left a mess that retailers across the country will... (Natalie Kitroeff) “Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. “I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle.”  Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped.  For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot.  It’s adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week.  “We want to serve the customer as they want to be served,” Wal-Mart Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna said.  Target also is focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it had 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the previous number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores.  Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices and to offer more consistent pricing, instead of short-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88.  Target, which has acknowledged that it failed to deliver on the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan, says about 60% of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20% from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year’s promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store.  “Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop,” said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice president of marketing.  Target is also extending its free shipping promotion by a week, waiving the shipping fee for all digital orders until Jan. 1.  Both Target and Wal-Mart are offering even more exclusive products.  Wal-Martis offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It’s also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup.  Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15% more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of “Friends in Low Places.” The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere.  Wal-Mart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss LAPD will not help deport immigrants under Trump, nearly 4,000 students from L.A.

The five sisters—Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney Kardashian, and Kylie and Kendall Jenner—spend so much time in hair and makeup, some of them actually have a room in their house devoted to the cause. Khloé’s glam room is the stuff of legend, and Kylie has called hers “my favorite room in the house.” Yes, that is correct: Kylie would rather be chilling in her glam room than be snuggled up in bed or kicking it in the living room. To be fair, the room sounds sort of like a boudoir, living room, and bathroom all rolled into one, but—keep in mind that she has a lot of rooms to choose from. MORE: Everything You’ve Ever Wanted to Know About the Kardashians’ Glam Rooms Thing is, most of the makeup jammed into those drawers—or, more likely, neatly organized within them—is not the cheapest. Nor are the hair products they favor, nor the skin care serums and lotions they gravitate toward. But every so often, the Kardashian women divulge their favorite drugstore beauty products, and we are never disappointed. (As an aside, it seems as though Kourtney is too into all-natural and high-end beauty to pay a visit to the drugstore; we didn’t find any bargain product recs from her at all. Most of our pics came from Kim and Khloé, who love talking beauty on their apps.) First off, they definitely favor certain brands: As we combed the internet, determined to shine a light on all of their top faves, we found products of every stripe, but especially picks from Rimmel, L’Oréal, and Maybelline. We also discovered that the Kardashians definitely like a nude lipstick, which should not come as a surprise; but if you’re in the market for one and would prefer not to break the bank, you’re in luck. Ahead, find 45 beauty products that you can find at the nearest drugstore—all, of course, Kardashian-approved.

If that’s not for you, though, there’s another strategy I highly recommend as an alternative to just buying stocks. And that’s buying deep-in-the-money (DITM), long-dated, call option contracts. You see, option contracts are the greatest financial products ever created, since leverage lets many investors participate in trades that would otherwise be out of reach. Now, many investors think that leverage is too risky. And they have a point. Leverage’s ability to magnify your gains can have the reverse effect, as well. But here’s a way you can participate in the massive upside potential options offer, while reducing risk at the same time. Buying Shares At a 73% Discount Let’s use Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) as our prime example. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of Wal-Mart today, it would cost you roughly $7,475. But by using DITM options, those same 100 shares would cost you roughly $2,020. That’s a solid $5,455 cheaper – or a 73% discount.  So what does deep-in-the-money mean? Basically, DITM options have strike prices that are set much lower than the current price of the stock. The options chain to the right shows a partial listing of available call option contracts to trade on Wal-Mart (at its current price of $74.75). Let’s focus on the January 2014 $55 strike price, which is around $19.75 below the stock price. The cost to buy the option is roughly $2,020 per contract. Remember, each contract represents 100 shares of stock. The benefits of buying the option instead of the stock are two-fold: First, you’re only spending $2,020 instead of $7,475 to control the same 100 shares, but you’re benefiting from similar movement (more on that below). Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020. Wal-Mart shareholders have $7,475 at risk. That’s a big difference. However, DITM isn’t the only thing you need to focus on to make sure you’re getting the best deal possible. High Delta is Key It’s also crucial that you pinpoint the options with at least a 90% or higher “delta.” Delta refers to how closely the option price moves in relation to the underlying stock. In other words, the higher the delta, the more the option moves in lockstep with the stock. Since the whole point of buying options is to pocket massive gains when the stock moves in your favor, the best way to do that is to choose options with a high delta. Have you ever bought a call or put-option contract and its value didn’t increase – even though the stock price moved a good distance in your favor? Depressing, wasn’t it? Most likely it was because you didn’t own an option with a high enough delta. As I said, a good delta to go with is at least 90%. Just to clarify, that means the option price should move 90% in the same direction of the stock’s movement. As you can see, the $55 strike price option boasts a 96% delta. The screenshots of an options calculator below show this principle working in real-time. The calculator on top shows what the options trade for at Wal-Mart’s current price of $74.75. The one on the bottom shows what the option would likely trade for if shares hit $75.75. As you can see, the option price went up almost a dollar, just like the stock. That’s the kind of movement you need. What novice option traders usually do is pick the cheapest option contracts based on the actual dollar value. It makes them feel like they’re getting a better deal. But what they don’t realize is that the cheaper the option price, the lower the delta will be, which means they’ll see less cash in the end. So what happens when the options expire in January 2014? Well, if Wal-Mart increased like you hoped it would, you can sell the options and bank the gain. Or you can “exercise” the option and turn it into actual shares of stock. If you choose the latter, you’ll have to pay for the stock in full at that time. Usually, the first scenario is the best bet, since you could just sell the option and use the profits to buy another position. And you’re still participating in the move higher like you would if you actually owned shares. Only this way, you’re keeping your cost and risk low at the same time. So do yourself a favor… If you’re ever going to buy a stock, consider buying DITM options with a high delta instead. You’ll be glad you did.

White House Prepares for Rise of the Machines Comments (6) richard goodrick says: November 11, 2013 at 8:03 pm Thanks so much for your thorough, and easy to understand explanation of DITM calls. [Reply] Joseph says: April 26, 2015 at 3:00 pm You say “Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020.” This is only partly true. Yes, the amount of money that’s on the line is smaller; but on the other hand, there is a much greater chance that you will lose all your money when buying the option than buying the actual stock. This is because if the stock price drops below your strike price you lose your entire investment whereas when you buy the actual stock the only way you lose all your money is if the company’s share price goes down to zero, a much less likely scenario than the price falling below the strike price. [Reply] Max Baer Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:27 am Excellent point, Joseph! Even deep-in-the-money options pose a high risk if a stock goes into an unexpected, yet temporary, free fall. If the option expires before the stock recovers, you could lose all your money on the position, whereas the underlying stock may well appreciate nicely after the expiration of the option, but too late for you to benefit from it. [Reply] Dominic says: July 11, 2015 at 4:15 am So I should find a DITM call with a high delta, right? As opposed to what? A DITM call with a low delta? (If your broker offers you a DITM call with a low delta you should find another brokerage.) [Reply] 56 says: August 9, 2016 at 10:11 am Deep in money have deep premiums in addition to another deep premium cost factor for options (time, and its your forgiving friend if you buy enough of it) . Less contracts for that $2000. What’s wrong with at the money/slightly out of the money. Lower premiums, more contracts, and time if you choose to pay for it. Delta of .6-7 isn’t as nice as .9 for sure but considering you can ramp up the number of contracts the $ buys and/or get more time I mean really the thing that matters is being proved right on strike+premium anytime before expiration. I would recommend the hell out of put options vs shorting. More gains, no obligations,no sneaky dividends. Time is against shorts anyways, not such a big swallow for a put.

Chase Pay QR codes will be among the mobile payments options available at Walmart locations in the U.S. next year. This mobile wallet will be worked into Wamart’s own app. Customers will be able to use it to make in-store purchases with Chase Visa and debit cards. Instead of relying on NFC technology, this mobile wallet uses QR codes shown at the checkout counter. To pay for a purchase, users display Chase Pay QR codes at the checkout counter. The cashier can then scan the quick response codes as a part of the authentication process. The Chase Pay service will also be added to the official Walmart website in 2017. In this way, consumers will be able to make purchases through mobile commerce or on the desktop site using those credit and debit cards. This will also allow them to earn rewards and obtain offers. Those transactions are secured with token technology. The complex Chase Pay QR codes are unique and are used only one time for each transaction. The goal is to make sure that consumer card information is kept secure. Chase Pay appears to have wooed Walmart in a way that Apple was never able to accomplish. Apple Pay currently uses NFC technology with Touch ID security added to its tokenization. So far, Walmart has held firm in its decision not to allow consumers to use that technology to pay for purchases in-store. Instead, Walmart has chosen to use services based on QR codes such as Chase Pay and its own Walmart Pay. The retailer has stated that it will still be willing to consider additional digital wallets in the future. Chase Pay was first developed in partnership with MCX. That mobile payments service was created by a consortium that also launched CurrentC. The CurrentC service has been postponed indefinitely. Within the MCX consortium, Walmart was a leading member from 2012 through 2015. After that point was the expiration of the three-year exclusivity portion of the contract. Walmart has been directly stating that it would not accept Apple Pay since 2014.

Flipkart is trying to raise $1 billion in the next round of funding, The Hindu BusinessLine reported on Sunday. In a reply to an email seeking comment, sent by Techcircle to Flipkart, a company spokesperson said that, “It is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” The report, quoting two unnamed sources, said that if this deal goes through, it would be Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s (CPPIB) first investment in an internet company in India. The report also said that Flipkart is also talking to Wal-Mart for a minority stake sale. There have been several media reports, in the past three months, surfacing on the same lines. Flipkart’s outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja, in an interview to Techcircle, had said that, “There is no absolute aggressive fundraise programme. As of now, we are not doing anything. There is enough runway available. Funds are available for more than two years. That is one aspect. But yes, one or two transactions will continue to happen.” He also added, “If there are investors who want to talk to us, whether strategic or financial, we will continue those (talks). But are we aggressively pursuing or running a process? That is not true.” While it is undeniable that Wal-Mart is a global giant that employs around 2.3 million people in its 11,527 stores across 28 countries and churned $482 billion in total revenue last year, it is definitely worried about its declining online sales in the US while Amazon continues to grow impressively, both in the US and India. Also, Wal-Mart’s online sales were a mere $13.6 billion in 2015 against Amazon’s $107 billion. The retail giant has been looking to expand its e-commerce play both in the US and international markets. Baweja had stepped down from Flipkart last month, but he will continue working till the end of this year. In the meanwhile, Flipkart had made interim changes in its finance management vertical. As a part of the interim organisational change, commercial, taxation, accounting and treasury functions will be consolidated under Rajnish Baweja, the group finance controller of Flipkart. Business finance has been reporting to Nitin Seth, who is currently the chief administrative officer, as part of the “strategy to execution” function. Corporate affairs and campus functions will also report to Seth. Presently, Flipkart stands strong in India but arch rival Amazon is close at its heels. Citing comScore data a few months ago, the Indian arm of the US-based e-tailer claimed to have overtaken Flipkart as the most visited e-commerce site in India. Earlier, citing data from an unnamed logistics company that services online retailers, The Economic Times had reported that the market share of Flipkart and Snapdeal fell to 37% and 15% from 43% and 19%, respectively while Amazon’s market share grew between 21% and 24% from 14% in 2015.

Would Sanjay Baweja have left if Walmart was going to pump in a billion. We are not so foolish that we cannot co-relate two atories.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 6, 2016 at 1:34PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been doing some soul-searching. After years of operating as a bare-bones retailer, paying employees the minimum wage or as little as possible, the company seems to have turned over a new leaf. CEO Doug McMillon, who took the helm in 2014, has invested billions in higher wages and training in order to bring stores up to modern standards and improve customer satisfaction. McMillon lifted the base wage to $9/hour in 2015 and again to $10/hour in February of this year. The moves seem to have paid off as same-store sales reached their fastest clip in years in the company's most recent report, increasing 1.6% in the second quarter. It's been a long time coming for Wal-Mart critics. For years, advocacy, worker, and union-backed groups like OUR Walmart have called on the retail giant to hike wages and improve workers' rights, eyeing a minimum of $15/hour. The United Food and Commercial Workers, a 1.3 million-strong union, has repeatedly tried to unionize the company's workers. However, Wal-Mart's recent efforts are causing some to see it in a different light.  This new strategy of paying workers better to improve company performance instead of minimizing all costs has caused some to draw comparisons with Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), the membership-based warehouse retailer that has outgrown Wal-Mart for several years.  When it comes to labor relations, Costco may be the diametric opposite of Wal-Mart. It's a veritable darling of labor advocates, and has avoided all of the union fights that have sullied Wal-Mart's brand. The warehouse giant pays a minimum of $13/hour and many of its store-level employees make upwards of $20/hour. It regularly ranks as one of the best places to work, and it has an exceptionally low turnover rate for a retail business.  Costco's philosophy is pretty simple -- treat people well and they'll return the favor. The company believes it's more profitable in the long-term to pay people a decent wage because it minimizes turnover and maximizes productivity, commitment, and loyalty. Borrowing from Costco Paying its employees better and giving them more opportunities seems to be paying off for Wal-Mart, but those decisions didn't come cheap. Those two years of wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, which is the primary reason why earnings per share are down this year and expected to remain flat next year. Wal-Mart and Costco have very different operating models. As a no-frills warehouse operation, Costco displays its goods on pallets, meaning it does not need employees to stock shelves as Wal-Mart does. The buy-in-bulk nature of Costco also means it needs fewer cashiers as a percentage of sales as the average amount its customers spend is much higher, and the help-yourself nature of shopping there means there are hardly employees on the floor to assist you.  As a result, Costco is much more efficient with its use of labor, meaning it can afford to pay its employees less.  Costco's revenue per employee, a popular way of measuring labor efficiency, is nearly three times that of Wal-Mart, as the chart below shows. WMT Revenue Per Employee (Annual) data by YCharts That explains why it can pay its hourly workers about 50% more than Wal-Mart, since even with that gap its overall labor costs are still less. According to a study by the UC Berkley Center for Labor Research, if Wal-Mart were to accede to labor activists' demands and pay a base wage of $15/hour, it would cost the company an additional $4.95 billion a year. That study was performed at the request of advocacy group OUR Walmart, so the actual number could be even higher, but a $5 billion increase in expenses would cut more than a third off of Wal-Mart's profit, a sacrifice shareholders would be unlikely to tolerate. Wal-Mart and other retailers have raised wages as the labor market has tightened, making hiring good employees more competitive. But continuing wage hikes would have diminishing marginal returns, as there is little need for the company to offer a starting wage that's at least 50% better than that of the average retailer. On the question of higher wages, Wal-Mart simply doesn't have the leverage that Costco does through its warehouse business model to pay average employees around $20/hour. The two companies' diverging pay scales may be due in part to strategic choices, but mostly they're a reflection of their much different business models.

Wal-Mart and other retailers have raised wages as the labor market has tightened, making hiring good employees more competitive. But continuing wage hikes would have diminishing marginal returns, as there is little need for the company to offer a starting wage that's at least 50% better than that of the average retailer. On the question of higher wages, Wal-Mart simply doesn't have the leverage that Costco does through its warehouse business model to pay average employees around $20/hour. The two companies' diverging pay scales may be due in part to strategic choices, but mostly they're a reflection of their much different business models.

According to two sources, the Bengaluru-based company is exploring the option of seeking funds from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores. CPPIB, which opened an office in India last year, has been quite active in the Indian market and has invested as much as $2 billion since 2010 in companies such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, L&T Infrastructure Development Projects, Piramal Enterprises and Shapoorji Pallonji Group. If the Flipkart deal goes through, it would be CPPIB’s first investment in an internet-based company in India. Flipkart is also talking to Wal-Mart on the sale of a minority stake to the American retail giant. Wal-Mart’s partnership could also help Flipkart take on Alibaba, as it scales up its India presence. The Chinese player already has investments in mobile payment and commerce firm Paytm and another e-commerce marketplace, Snapdeal.Foothold for Wal-Mart? While Wal-Mart has declined to comment, industry watchers said that if it invests in Flipkart it may do so with an eye on getting a foothold into the niche grocery segment. Wal-Mart has been exploring the option of getting into the food and grocery segment since the Centre relaxed FDI rules. “Wal-Mart will have to choose between investing in an established e-commerce player like Flipkart and investing in its existing cash & carry business,” said an industry expert. This will be Flipkart’s 13th round of funding since July 2015, when the company raised about $700 million from Steadview Capital and Tiger Global Management, at a $15-billion valuation. In all, Flipkart has raised about $3.2 billion over seven years.Valuation hit However, over the last 12 months, the company’s valuation has plunged to around $11 billion following a series of markdowns by its own investors and by outside investment banking firms, as it failed to achieve its sales and revenue targets for 2015. Amazon, on the other hand, has pumped in over $5 billion in its Indian unit over the last four years.

The decision to install solar panels can be driven by factors like a desire to use clean energy or an interest in becoming more self-sufficient when it comes to electricity. But when large companies choose to go solar, they're doing so based on the dollars and cents of the investment. You may not know if the  Target or Walmart  store you're shopping at has solar, but if it does, it's saving the company money. And today, U.S. corporations are installing solar energy rapidly as a way to save millions of dollars.  The Solar Energy Industries Association recently released its Solar Means Business 2016 report, and it showed a big increase in the amount of solar energy on corporate rooftops. There's now more than 1 GW of solar for corporate customers, enough to power 193,000 homes. Target led the way with 147.5 MW, with 70 MW installed so far in 2016, while Walmart is using 145.0 MW. Apple 's 93.9 MW and Costco 's 50.7 MW means those companies are also among the top five installers.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Seven out of the top 10 corporate customers have installed SunPower solar panels, reflecting the company's corporate focus. SolarCity, meanwhile, has Walmart as a major customer.  One incredible stat from the report is that more than three quarters of the commercial solar installations and half of the capacity are at data centers. Large data centers are often buildings with flat roofs, perfect for solar energy, and they're energy hogs. So offsetting some, or all, of the energy consumption with solar on a roof or a nearby field is an attractive option.  Solar panels on the island of Eigg, Inner Hebrides, Scotland. Paul Hackett/Reuters How big is commercial solar today?  In the first three quarters of 2016 there was 142 MW of solar installed at corporate sites. Compared to a total of 13.9 GW expected to be installed in 2016, this is a fairly small market. But it's becoming increasingly important.  Utility-scale solar, which will be around 7.8 GW this year, is the largest segment of the solar market in general. But it's highly volatile, and 2017 will see only a small number of new projects signed and built. Commercial solar is improving in viability, and will likely be a growth market in the future.  Related Stories Solar Power Brightens Prospects in East Africa Solar Plane Finishes U.S. Flight, Lands in New York One reason that corporate solar customers haven't traditionally been a big customer base is that it's hard to finance their installation. It may sound crazy, but it's easier to finance a residential solar project that's backed by a customer with a reliable FICO score than it is a corporate customer with anything but a stellar credit rating. Companies come and go, leaving creditors in their wake, and solar companies—and their financers—don't want to take the loss for companies that go out of business. Today, solar is cheap enough that companies can put systems on their balance sheets, or even take out loans to finance projects. This means the financing barrier is breaking down, opening up the market.  The two companies that have put a lot of attention on commercial solar are SunPower and SolarCity. Both have installation designs built to make commercial rooftop installations cost effective and efficient.  SunPower's pitch is based more around a higher efficiency product that's able to squeeze more energy out of each square foot. In small installations, a higher efficiency can lead to lower cost per watt—that's a big reason the company is serving so many of these customers.  10 stocks we like better than SunPower When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Visa Inc., which has accused Walmart of using customers as leverage after the retail giant said in June it would stop accepting the credit card in Canadian stores, appears to be ratcheting up the months-long battle by offering $10 credits to cardholders in Manitoba who shop elsewhere. The new promotion, which will run throughout November in Manitoba, doesn’t specifically name Walmart, the U.S.-owned retail giant that sells clothing, toys, household items, and groceries. But the $10 credit is being offered to Visa cardholders who register their card and then make a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. “We hope this eases the inconvenience for Visa cardholders in Manitoba who cannot use their card everywhere they may want to,” Visa Canada spokesperson Carla Hindman said in an interview. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart Canada, told CBC News: “We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand.” Related Walmart stops accepting Visa at all its stores in Manitoba as fee dispute continues Walmart Canada expands ban on Visa to Manitoba, raising stakes in high-profile fee dispute Walmart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in Manitoba stores on Oct. 24, following the initial withdrawal from stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. after a dispute over fees. Negotiations broke down between the credit card company and the retailer in June, and Walmart declared it would stop accepting Visa cards in stores across the country beginning the following month. At the time, Walmart said the fees it was charged for accepting Visa were “unacceptably high,” and its aim was to keep all costs as low as possible so it could keep prices low for customers. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants in June, Visa said it had already offered Walmart “one of the lower rates” of any merchant in Canada, and accused the retailer of demanding rates even lower than what the credit card company charges charities and schools. “They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants… And yes, charities and schools too’,” Visa said in the letter, which was published in newspapers including the National Post. We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand The letter also accused Walmart of “using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” The fees the companies are at odds over are called “interchange” fees, which are paid by all merchants on each credit card transaction. Once collected, the fees are shared by banks that issue the credit cards, credit card processors, and credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with retail groups and some politicians arguing that they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. In late 2014, after a series of negotiations, the fees charged to retailers in Canada were voluntarily reduced in a move that kept the government from entering the fray and regulating the interchange rates set by credit card networks. But retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in jurisdictions including Australia and parts of Europe. A banking industry source told the Financial Post last summer that the dispute between Visa and Walmart could put some $82 million in interchange fees at stake for the Canadian banks that issue Visa cards. While not material, the amount is not insubstantial either, the source said, suggesting banks could put put pressure on Visa to head back to the negotiating table and cut a deal to lower fees charged to the retailing giant.

News York County Six new faces vie for three spots on City Council Mike HoltzclawContact Reportermholtzclaw@dailypress.com Privacy Policy When Poquoson residents came together last year to successfully block plans for a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, it was something of a watershed moment for the city. As citizens spoke up to define what they wanted and what they didn't want, it put an even sharper focus on the subject of economic development in the city. How to market that type of city, how to attract new businesses and families, will be a central issue in Tuesday's City Council election, in which three seats will be filled. Residents will vote for one candidate for each district, not just in the district where they live. Incumbents Henry Ayer III, Raymond Vernall and Traci-Dale Crawford chose not to seek re-election. Here's a look at the three races. Western Precinct Candidates: David Hux and Kylene Pase When Kylene Pase served on the board of Concerned Citizens of Poquoson, the group that rose up to block Wal-Mart, she felt more connected than ever to her hometown. Caption How Trump’s victory has affected the stock market A Trump administration is expected to spend heavily on infrastructure projects and ease many federal regulations. A Trump administration is expected to spend heavily on infrastructure projects and ease many federal regulations. Caption Steven Mnuchin is a leading candidate for Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, 53, served as national finance chairman of Trump's campaign. Steven Mnuchin, 53, served as national finance chairman of Trump's campaign. "The goal was to get the City of Poquoson more involved in what was going on, and make them more aware," Pase said. "Years and year ago, we heard that at City Council meetings, half of the city attended ... We wanted to bring a little of that back." She is a single mother of three, and has never run for office before. Her opponent, David Hux, a designer at Newport News Shipbuilding, has spent five years on the Poquoson School Board. Hux believes Poquoson is moving in the right direction regarding economic development. The city has earned high marks for its schools and for public safety, and Hux proposes to increase revenue "through thoughtful, well-planned and managed growth and development." Central Precinct Candidates: Kevin Brennan and Thomas Cannella II Fourteen years ago, government defense contractor Kevin Brennan ran for Poquson City Council and lost to incumbent Arthur "Binks" Holloway. This time around, his opponent is Thomas Cannella II, the 19-year-old grandson of the late "Binks" Holloway. Cannella, a sophomore studying political science and history at Christopher Newport University, said he always knew he would run for elected office. "Everything I've done has been with one goal in mind, and that is to run for council and serve my city one day," Cannella said. "I don't believe it's ever too early to serve. I think I'm ready. I know I'm ready." His biggest talking point leading up to the election has been a push to raise salaries for the city's teachers, firefighter and police. Cannella said the city loses too many of the people who provide those things because they leave quickly to seek better pay. Brennan said any spending increases need to be offset by new revenue sources, so citizens won't be hit with higher taxes. He said many small business owners have left Poquoson to move elsewhere on the Peninsula, citing lower rents. Eastern Precinct Candidates: Jana Andrews and Greg Martin With Traci-Dale Chapman, the only woman on City Council, choosing not to run for re-election, Jana Andrews believed it was important to maintain a female voice. But more important than that factor, she said, is her background as a financial analyst and the insight that gives her into the city's budget. "Financially we are in good shape with what we have, and obviously the AAA bond rating is a great thing," Andrews said. "But it's a tight budget, and any city department will tell you that they have to squeeze every bit out of their budget and could use more. The challenge is how to increase revenue without raising taxes." Her opponent, Greg Martin, sees that challenge as well. "If we can spread that around, a lot of other good things will happen in the city," Martin said. "Upgrading our facilities, bringing on new employees in public safety and the school system, and providing upgrades in infrastructure that will help the quality of life of our citizens." Holtzclaw can be reached by phone at 757-928-6479. Poquoson City Council candidates Citizens will vote for one candidate in each precinct, not just in the precinct where they live.

November 7, 2016 CBS MoneyWatch Subscribe Industry News Retail News Trends Walmart may soon find out whether it’s easy - or profitable - being green. The country’s biggest retailer is ramping up its environmental goals, noting that the plan is part of a “new era of trust and transparency.” The vow, which will be delivered by chief executive Doug McMillon at the environmentally focused Net Impact Conference in Philadelphia, includes doubling sales of locally grown produce and supporting the “human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain.” The green-focused goals come amid a changing consumer landscape, with the millennial generation now outranking baby boomers in numbers and projected to move into their prime spending years. Millennials are also considered more likely to pony up for environmentally sustainable products, while members of Generation Z - the demographic that’s younger than 20 - are willing to pay more to shop at companies that are committed to helping social and environmental causes, Nielsen found in a 2015 survey.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, November 8, 2016 CHICAGO - Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> is in talks with several mobile wallet companies to offer more payment options in its Wal-Mart Pay app, an executive at the world's largest retailer said, after signing up JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> last week. Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said on Thursday. Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card. Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964. "The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind," Eckert said. U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores. Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 U.S. stores. Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register. An e-receipt is sent to the app. Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month. He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay. Wal-Mart leads a consortium of U.S. retailers developing a mobile wallet app called CurrentC. The group, which includes Target Corp <TGT.N> and Best Buy Co Inc <BBY.N>, said earlier this year it would delay launching the app after the project hit several roadblocks.

Washington and Tyrus L. Williams Print Email Andy Hoag | ahoag@mlive.com By Andy Hoag | ahoag@mlive.com The Saginaw News Follow on Twitter on November 07, 2016 at 4:49 PM comments SAGINAW, MI — A man and a woman will serve probation time for the their roles in the theft of ammunition commonly used for an assault rifle. Circuit Judge Robert L. Kaczmarek on Monday, Nov. 7, sentenced Shauna S. Washington and Tyrus L. Williams for receiving and concealing stolen ammunition. Kaczmarek sentenced Washington, 24, and Williams, 22, to 18 months probation and two years probation, respectively. Washington and Williams pleaded guilty to the ammunition charge, which carries a maximum possible penalty of 10 years in prison. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped a charge of possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony, which carries a mandatory, consecutive two-year prison sentence. Kaczmarek sentenced Washington and Williams one week after he sentenced Manndrell D. Fuller to six years behind bars for the ammunition charge as well as single counts of possessing a firearm as a felon and possessing ammunition as a felon and three counts of felony firearm-second offense. Man gets 6 years for theft of rifle ammo at Walmart Fuller, 23, pleaded no contest as charged for the Oct. 29, 2015, incident that started at the Walmart on Brockway in Saginaw Township. After observing a vehicle matching the description of one involved in the theft of ammunition from the Walmart, Saginaw police performed a traffic stop on the vehicle, which contained all three defendants, according to testimony from their preliminary hearing. Officer Matthew Carpus testified he observed an SKS-style rifle and SKS-style magazine on the floor boards of the back seat. Officer Isaac Babinski said the magazine was "high capacity," which he defined as a rifle magazine that accepts more than 10 rounds. Carpus testified that after he was alerted by another officer, he observed a box in the area of the front-seat passenger. Inside the box was a box of 9mm Winchester ammunition and multiple 7.62 ammunition in a plastic shopping bag. The 7.62 ammunition also was Winchester, police said. If Washington and Williams violate the terms of their probation and received jail or prison sentences, they would receive credit for 77 days and 131 days, respectively. Because he was on parole at the time of the incident, Fuller did not receive any credit for time served. He was on parole for assault with intent to commit great bodily harm, which he committed by opening fire on an East Side Saginaw house in March 2011.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. “He said ‘ma’am are you pregnant,’ and I said ‘yes I am,’ and he said ‘you did not look pregnant five minutes ago,'” said Pautke. “He said, ‘I’m going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don’t have anything under your shirt.'” Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. Then when she proved she wasn’t hiding anything, she said that employee told her to have a good day.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit From the Magazine How Envy Replaced Greed as the Cardinal Sin of Our Time Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER From the Magazine How Envy Replaced Greed as the Cardinal Sin of Our Time Thanks to trickle-down economics and Wall Street, greed was widely celebrated at the end of the last century, but an even darker sin may define the 21st. It’s tough to put a positive spin on this one. by Michael KinsleyDecember 2016 Email Facebook Twitter Photo Illustration by Darrow. My computer printer, a bottom-of-the-line model I bought at Walmart for $69, is named “Envy.” This is its trade name, not some cute name that I gave it, as you might name a dog “Byte” or a major corporation “Google.” The logic of naming an office appliance after one of the seven deadly sins is not obvious, but it must have something to do with an effort to make computer printers seem sexy. This is marketing gone mad. Oh, the two or three endless seconds between the moment you hit “print” and the moment that reassuring churning sound starts may have elements of erotic tension and release. But in the end, you are not looking for love with your printer. The relationship you should want is mutual professional respect. A printer should also know its place. You push its buttons; it doesn’t push yours. Nor are you looking for love when you buy a Subaru, another company that wants its product to take on an aura of illicit romance. TV commercials to the contrary notwithstanding, “love” is not “what makes a Subaru a Subaru.” How much extra am I paying for my car to love me—and can I buy a Subaru without love and have a strictly platonic arrangement with my car? It should be optional, like doing without the special undercoating that the salesman tries to pressure you into buying after you think you have a deal. Video: The Evolution From Business Mogul to Presidential Candidate Cars have always been marketed with romance in mind. Among pieces of office equipment, the effort to make consumers covet thy neighbor’s printer seems especially futile. A computer or other high-tech gizmo can be made to seem glamorous if it is exceptionally small (or, perhaps, exceptionally large). But a printer? Unlike some of the other deadly sins—one thinks of sloth—a little bit of envy can be useful. In fact, as is also the case with lust, society could not function without it. (“What do you mean, darling?” says Arianna. “Sloth is tremendously useful. I get 10 hours of sloth every night. It is my favorite deadly sin. What? Oh yes, sleep is what I mean. I get 10 hours of sleep every night. But my mind is working away all that time. Read my new book, Sleepytime Girl. It’s all in there. I’d give you my own copy here, except that it’s signed by President Trump.”) Ronald Reagan once had some thoughts . . . and I’ll stop right there for a moment so you can catch your breath . . . about what he called “greed and envy.” It was January 1984, and he aimed his remarks at people who opposed his tax cuts. “There will be those,” he said, “trying to appeal to greed and envy. Make no mistake, that is what they’re trying to do. They suggest our tax program favors the rich. Well, this is the same anti-business, anti-success attitude that brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.” I especially like that “trying to.” It’s not really hard to appeal to greed and envy. We’ve all got some of that in us. Reagan’s tax program did favor the rich, of course. Reaganites somewhat more honest, or awake, than Reagan were happy to admit as much. “Trickle-down economics” was the unkind epithet for this scheme, but “greed and envy” wouldn’t have been a bad slogan, either. Greed and envy are not the same thing. Greed is “I want to be rich enough to buy that ugly plastic computer printer.” Envy is “If I can’t have one, I don’t want him to have one, either.” But both greed and envy played a role in supply-side economics, Reagan’s economic program. It was not just that, if rich people grew richer, a bit of that money would dribble down the economic ladder. It was that the rich themselves would be “incented” (a word that has risen in prominence in the decades since Reagan) to work harder, take greater risks, and so on. Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas) in Oliver Stone’s movie Wall Street put it succinctly: “Greed is good.” It didn’t work. That’s why we now have the huge deficit that both parties, for reasons of their own, have decided to dismiss or ignore. So that’s greed. But what about envy? It carries a decadent aroma that straight-on greed doesn’t. Greed’s purpose is to finance envy. Greed has you working overtime in order to buy that printer. Envy has you stealing it. Envy also can cover almost anything—you can envy a friend’s complexion or a rival’s reputation—while greed pretty much is restricted to money. Nevertheless, by tying greed and envy together, Reagan was making an important point—in the process of denouncing it. You need greed and envy to spur people to work hard. Are we a more envious society than we used to be when Reagan was more than just an airport? It seems like it. Opinion surveys are pretty clear in documenting rising levels of consumerist resentment toward people who “have more than they deserve.” Growing income inequality plays a role in this—tax cuts for the upper-income brackets really did contribute to this phenomenon (though they don’t explain everything). The way wealth is flaunted these days can only feed envy. Keeping up with the Joneses used to be about things that were within reach of ordinary middle-class citizens. That, I guess, was the useful form of envy. When Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous first appeared on TV, it had a cheesy quality to it that almost made you feel sorry for the celebrities it featured. People snorted. Now the real-estate ads in the weekend Wall Street Journal and Financial Times offer properties that no ordinary aspirational person could ever own. Unrequitable envy is no fun at all, but there’s always the flip side: inducing envy in others. This is a pastime for everyone, and one of the main uses of social media. Ordinary people once flaunted their lives in mass holiday mailings. With Facebook and Instagram these holiday letters can be posted every few minutes. “There are a lot of awful braggarts,” one Instagram user told The New York Times, “whose posts have a vibe of ‘Hey, you’re not invited to my awesome.’ ” Yes, envy is an engine, but one that starts to cough and wheeze as you move up the ladder of wealth and fame. I’m not advancing the familiar but possibly false idea that love is more important than money. But I am asserting that money and things become less and less important as you ascend the wealth scale and have more and more of each. There’s a limit to all the things you can buy, and another limit on how much pleasure you get from the next thing. That’s why so many billionaires keep working. At Microsoft, where I worked in the late 90s, the folks who had gotten there first and now had more money than Arianna were called “volunteers.” Supply-side economics does not explain why they get out of bed in the morning, let alone why they get out of bed, eat their granola, and bicycle to work. Why do they do it? It’s a mystery. I mean, the motivation can’t be that my printer has automatic sheet feed (which actually sounds like it belongs to lust, not envy) and yours doesn’t. No one is going to think less of you for it.

In the midst of the firestorm, he also got arrested and charged with 8 counts of fraud after prosecutors accusing him of using a public drug company he ran as a personal piggybank to pay back investors whose money he lost at his now-defunct hedge funds.

But the international fraud empire he built over the course of two decades, in which he offered phony high-interest certificates of deposit at a bank he started in Antigua, imploded. He was charged with 13 counts of wire and mail fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering and sentenced to 110 years in prison without parole.

While federal investigators circled Cohen and his firm, S.A.C. Capital, for nearly a decade, only his employees were convicted of wrongdoing, while Cohen was never nailed. His firm pleaded guilty to insider trading and forker over a record $1.8 billion fine, but all Cohen got was a two-year ban on managing outside money—a most gentle slap on the wrist from the S.E.C. while he happily manages his family office and prepares for his next steps in the hedge fund world. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Cohen). RAJ RAJARATNAM Raj Rajaratnam was a frugal billionaire of sorts—opting to fly commercial and flouting the fancy art and high-end collectables that many of his fellow hedge fund managers favored. But he was also keen on skirting the law, a court found. Rajaratnam was charged with trading on inside information in 2009 and convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud in case considered to be one of the biggest prosecutorial wins in white collar criminal history. He is currently serving out his 11 years in the main prison at the Federal Medical Center at Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Rajaratnam). MICHAEL MILKEN That billionaire Michael Milken, the high-flying junk bond king of Beverly Hills, found himself sobbing in front of a courtroom in 1990 as he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, surely felt like a cruel twist of fate. That he ended up there because another convicted fraudster, Ivan Boesky, traded his name as part of his insider trading charges, surely felt even crueler. Milken was originally charged with 98 counts of racketeering, securities fraud, and mail fraud, though he pleaded guilty to just six counts of conspiracy and fraud related to illegal securities trading. He was ordered to pay $600 million in fines. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Milken). JEFFREY SKILLING Jeffrey Skilling was the chief executive of Enron when the energy-trading giant crumbled under the weight of its accounting schemes, which hid the scope of its financial woes and stripped billions of dollars from shareholders and employees. He was initially sentenced to 24 years in prison—a punishment that was later reduced to 14 years and a $42 fine. He reportedly spent his time behind bars tutoring in Spanish and reading the newspaper to a blind inmate each day. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Skilling). R. FOSTER WINANS A scheme that netted less than $1 million in profits and resulted in an 18-month jail sentence is hardly the sexiest on this list, but the transgression is perhaps the most unusual. Former Wall Street Jornal columnist R. Foster Winans admitted that in the early 1980s, he would slip Peter Brand information about a stock he would be featuring in his column, “Heard on the Street”—the contents of which would often move markets. Brant would make trades based on the early information, and Winans would receive a kickback in kind. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Winans). MATHEW MARTOMA Over the course of several days in July of 2008, Mathew Martoma sealed his fate. That was when the former S.A.C. Capital portfolio manager allegedly used inside information about a clinical trial for Alzheimer’s drugs to bring in a windfall for his firm. Martoma was one of about 85 individuals who were either convicted of or pleaded guilty in the ensuing investigation that rocked Wall Street, though Martoma’s 9-year sentence was on the harsher side. A judge ruled that he also had to forfeit nearly $9.5 million in bonuses he received while working at S.A.C. in 2008, including the Boca Raton home he bought for $2 million. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Martoma). SAGE KELLY By Wall Street standards, Sage Kelly had it all: a cushy, $7 million-a-year gig running Jefferies’s health-care investment-banking unit, a home in Sag Harbor, a growing family, and a group of buddies to pal around with. But it all came crashing down when his wife filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that they had engaged in a foursome with clients and that he would often take so many drugs that he would pee all over their home. Jefferies denied all of the allegations and Kelly’s wife later recanted the statements, but the banker found himself out of a job for two years. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Kelly). BRUNO IKSIL Bruno Iksil earned himself the moniker the “London Whale” for a $6.2 billion trading loss he made on J.P. Morgan’s ledger in 2012. The Frenchman, who contends that his risky trades were made at the behest of his superiors, avoided any sort of prosecution. But the bank was subject to government probes and $900 million in regulatory fines, and its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, took a 50 percent pay cut. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Iksil).

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.86 +0.37 +0.52% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 150.90 -1.10 -0.72% After years of operating as a bare-bones retailer, paying employees the minimum wage or as little as possible, the company seems to have turned over a new leaf. CEO Doug McMillon, who took the helm in 2014, has invested billions in higher wages and training in order to bring stores up to modern standards and improve customer satisfaction. McMillon lifted the base wage to $9/hour in 2015 and again to $10/hour in February of this year. The moves seem to have paid off as same-store sales reached their fastest clip in years in the company's most recent report, increasing 1.6% in the second quarter. It's been a long time coming for Wal-Mart critics. For years, advocacy, worker, and union-backed groups like OUR Walmart have called on the retail giant to hike wages and improve workers' rights, eyeing a minimum of $15/hour. The United Food and Commercial Workers, a 1.3 million-strong union, has repeatedly tried to unionize the company's workers. However, Wal-Mart's recent efforts are causing some to see it in a different light.  This new strategy of paying workers better to improve company performance instead of minimizing all costs has caused some to draw comparisons with Costco Wholesale (COST), the membership-based warehouse retailer that has outgrown Wal-Mart for several years.  When it comes to labor relations, Costco may be the diametric opposite of Wal-Mart. It's a veritable darling of labor advocates, and has avoided all of the union fights that have sullied Wal-Mart's brand. The warehouse giant pays a minimum of $13/hour and many of its store-level employees make upwards of $20/hour. It regularly ranks as one of the best places to work, and it has an exceptionally low turnover rate for a retail business.  Costco's philosophy is pretty simple -- treat people well and they'll return the favor. The company believes it's more profitable in the long-term to pay people a decent wage because it minimizes turnover and maximizes productivity, commitment, and loyalty. Borrowing from Costco Paying its employees better and giving them more opportunities seems to be paying off for Wal-Mart, but those decisions didn't come cheap. Those two years of wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, which is the primary reason why earnings per share are down this year and expected to remain flat next year. Wal-Mart and Costco have very different operating models. As a no-frills warehouse operation, Costco displays its goods on pallets, meaning it does not need employees to stock shelves as Wal-Mart does. The buy-in-bulk nature of Costco also means it needs fewer cashiers as a percentage of sales as the average amount its customers spend is much higher, and the help-yourself nature of shopping there means there are hardly employees on the floor to assist you.  As a result, Costco is much more efficient with its use of labor, meaning it can afford to pay its employees less.  Costco's revenue per employee, a popular way of measuring labor efficiency, is nearly three times that of Wal-Mart, as the chart below shows. © Provided by Fool WMT Revenue Per Employee (Annual) Chart That explains why it can pay its hourly workers about 50% more than Wal-Mart, since even with that gap its overall labor costs are still less. According to a study by the UC Berkley Center for Labor Research, if Wal-Mart were to accede to labor activists' demands and pay a base wage of $15/hour, it would cost the company an additional $4.95 billion a year. That study was performed at the request of advocacy group OUR Walmart, so the actual number could be even higher, but a $5 billion increase in expenses would cut more than a third off of Wal-Mart's profit, a sacrifice shareholders would be unlikely to tolerate. Wal-Mart and other retailers have raised wages as the labor market has tightened, making hiring good employees more competitive. But continuing wage hikes would have diminishing marginal returns, as there is little need for the company to offer a starting wage that's at least 50% better than that of the average retailer. On the question of higher wages, Wal-Mart simply doesn't have the leverage that Costco does through its warehouse business model to pay average employees around $20/hour. The two companies' diverging pay scales may be due in part to strategic choices, but mostly they're a reflection of their much different business models.

Baucom apologized for the delay and said he’s been taking extra care of his mother who has been gravely ill over the past few weeks. We know it’s late in the campaign season to be publishing a candidate profile, but we didn’t provide Mr. Baucom with a deadline to respond, so we’re posting his answers now. A former Walmart manager is one of two candidates to challenge Mayor Lioneld Jordan in the 2016 general election, along with local developer Tom Terminella. Baucom, 59, currently works part-time at MailCo USA while caring for his 89-year-old mother. Baucom said his Christian faith guided his decision to run for mayor, and said that he believes Fayetteville is “in serious trouble” because of poor decisions made by the current administration. He criticized the planning of the new regional park in southwest Fayetteville, and said he believes the infrastructure will not be able to handle the kind of traffic and attendance the park will attract. Baucom noted Jordan’s absence from a Nov. 2 event held on the University of Arkansas campus. The event was first announced on Oct. 27 as a mayoral forum hosted by the Fayetteville High School Young Democrats and Young Republicans. Baucom and Terminella agreed to participate, but Jordan told club representatives he already had commitments and wouldn’t be able to change his plans with such short notice. Jordan offered to send a representative, Stephen Smith, in his place. The club initially agreed to allow Smith to make opening and closing remarks, but later told Smith the other candidates were not comfortable with a representative speaking for Jordan. Smith criticized the handling of the event in a Facebook post where he provided a timeline of his exchanges with the students. “Needless to say, I am disappointed that I will not have the opportunity to represent Mayor Jordan in the “forum” or even be allowed to give opening and closing remarks,” Smith wrote. “It will surely be ‘fair and balanced.'” Two hours before the event was set to begin, a club representative sent a press release to the media stating that the forum had been cancelled because all three candidates couldn’t attend. Videos posted to Facebook later that evening showed Baucom and Terminella participating in what appeared to be a mayoral forum inside the same room where the original event was scheduled in the UA’s Agriculture, Food and Life Sciences Building. During the event, both candidates made opening statements and answered questions submitted by high school students. A club representative later told the Flyer that the high school was not associated with the event that took place. Baucom later accused Jordan and Smith of “bullying” the club and said they owed the students an apology. Early voting continues through 5 p.m. at the Washington County Courthouse in Fayetteville. Election Day polls open at 7:30 a.m. on Nov. 8 at over 40 locations in Washington County. Profile: Ron Baucom Position sought: Mayor Age: 59 Residency: Lived in Fayetteville entire life Employment: Former Walmart employee Education: B.A. Business Administration (double majors in Accounting and Finance), University of Arkansas Political Experience: None Questions What made you decide to run for mayor? Is it something you’ve been considering for a while? I was born and raised in south Fayetteville. I have seen what previous politicians have claimed as advancements and changes for the city. It is not a whole city approach. I want to make those changes. Most of our city has not been able to enjoy the amenities that are being promoted. Yes, I have thought about this for quite some time, and my Christian faith has guided me in this direction at this point and time in my life. I believe that our country and our city are in serious trouble, and a big part of that is due to the poor choices of our leaders. With the region’s recent growth, what keeps you in Fayetteville? How would you describe the city today? The growth that has been referenced is not near what it needs to be. We need to bring in businesses that will help with living wages and employment. Our median household income in Fayetteville is $37,350. That is below the state averages of a little over $41,000 and the national averages of over $54,000. Our state is only ranked 49th out of 50 and we are still below the state average. 25.2 percent of the population for whom poverty status is determined in Fayetteville live below the poverty line, which is higher than the national average of 15.5 percent. Over 13 percent of our citizens live on a household income of less than $10,000 per year and that figure is probably much higher because we don’t have an accurate count of our very large and growing homeless community. I have not seen the changes that are constantly being promoted and marketed. The folks that are bragging about our prosperity are the ones that are at top of the hill. I want to see a whole city improvement. Are there any recent city administrative decisions you agree or disagree with? If so, please explain. Our new regional park was very poorly planned. There is only one lane in and out. There is a serious problem with getting emergency personnel in and out to treat injured children or adults. The administration’s answer to this is that it will be addressed in future phases. The water tables were not properly studied and a lot of the fields are on a flood plain. Numerous soccer games were cancelled while they were still held at the Lewis facilities. The soccer fields are too small. There are parking and bathroom facility issues. They want to hold regional and national events there but as evidenced by Bikes and Blues, we have a lack of enough lodging in Fayetteville and lose a lot of tax revenues because they have to go to other cities to stay. Our present leaders have created large tax burdens on our city, that could have been prevented with proper analysis, prioritization, and resources. Our present mayor and his designated representative Stephen Smith should publicly apologize and be held accountable for their actions last week in their treatment of the Fayetteville High School Young Democrats/ Young Republicans forum and their undue influence and bullying that encouraged the high school to cancel the event for the students less than two hours before it was to begin is inexcusable! They can bash me all they want, but to discourage our future leaders is a disgrace!! Fortunately, the College Democrats/ Republicans picked it up and the forum was still held. But of course the Fayetteville High School students were told not to attend and Mr. Jordan, of course did not attend.

Lifestyle 7 0 0 November 6, 2016 What’s Open On Veterans Day 2016 And Where Can Vets Get A Free Meal On Friday? Cheryl P Veterans Day is observed every year on November 11, and just like on other federal holidays, people are never quite sure what’s open and what’s closed on Friday. Although there are a number of federal offices and local business that will be closed, rest assured that restaurants will be open and many of them will be serving up a free or discounted meal to veterans. Whether you have the holiday off or you’re working, find information below about the holiday hours for banks, retail stores like Walmart and Target, and the U.S. Post Office, as a list of Veterans Day restaurant freebies and deals offered on a day that was created to honor those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Veterans Day [Image by Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images] According to International Business Times, all U.S. Post Office locations will be closed and there will be no mail delivery on Friday, but you’re in luck if you are expecting a package from UPS or FedEx — both delivery services will be open at regular business hours on Veterans Day. The Office of Veterans Affairs reports that it’s not mandatory for state offices to close on Veterans Day, but most federal offices will be closed. However, many states observe the federal holiday calendar, so expect your local Department of Human Services, Department of Motor Vehicles, public schools, and libraries to close for the day on November 11. Veterans Day is a bank holiday, so that means you may have to use the ATM or your mobile app to do your banking. However, there are a few banks that will be open on Friday, including TD Bank in the Northeast. It’s always a good idea to call ahead before you go or check your bank’s operating hours online. If you have shopping to do on Friday, most big box stores like Walmart, Target, and Kmart will be open, as well as most malls, supermarkets, and liquor stores.

Every year, restaurants across the nation are honor veterans as well as active members of the U.S. Military with free or discounted meals on Veterans Day, with some extending the offer throughout the weekend. Some restaurants will be offering a full breakfast, lunch, or dinner with a proper ID to say “thanks for your service.” Others will give a discount or free appetizers, desserts, or simply a free cup of coffee. We love to serve those who served us! All military eat FREE on Veteran's Day, Nov. 11th! #VeteransDay pic.twitter.com/xdhPlZAgMJ — Hooters (@Hooters) October 31, 2016 One thing is for sure — veterans can expect long lines for the freebies on Friday, but it’s worth the wait for some of the offers and it’s likely you will be in line with other veterans who would be more than happy to share their stories with you. Every year, the most popular Veterans Day free meals are offered by popular chains including Olive Garden, Applebee’s, TGI Fridays, Boston Market, Hooters, Golden Corral, and Cracker Barrel. Keep in mind, you’ll need a valid ID that indicates that you are a vet, although some restaurants will allow you to come in uniform to get your freebie. According to The Military Wallet, dozens of restaurants are participating this year and they’ve come up with a printable page of free meals and deals that may come in handy if you’re out and about looking to score a good meal for free — or at least a restaurant that offers a Veterans Day discount. Whether you’re in search of a quick breakfast or a complete meal, it won’t be hard to find a number of chain restaurants that will honor our nations’ veterans this Friday with a free Veterans Day meal.

Despite strong circulars from Kohl’s, JCPenney, Sam’s Club, Costco, and BJ’s, the largest retailers — notably Walmart, Best Buy, and Target — have all been quiet. While they still may hold out a few more days, it is likely all of their ads will be leaked by Friday. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the recently released circulars from Staples, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Michaels. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. 2016 Staples Black Friday Ad [Image by Staples] Leaked on November 6, the 15-page Staples Black Friday ad features an assortment of desktop computers, laptops, printers, monitors, office furniture, and accessories. Staples will be closed on Thanksgiving this year, which is a policy that they implemented in 2015. Regardless, their online store will remain open on Turkey Day, and shoppers can make purchases and pick their order up anytime on Black Friday. Here are a few important facts about the sale. Doors Open at 6 a.m. on Friday Limit 1 Item Per Customer for Top Doorbusters HP Laptop wit Intel Core i5 Processor for $389.99 (save $250) HP Laptop with Intel Pentium Processor for $229.99 (save $190) HP Laptop with Intel Core i3 Processor for $299.99 (save $170) 5 Percent Back in Rewards on Everything Free Shipping for Orders over $14.99 You can see the entire 15-page Staples Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. 2016 Bed Bath and Beyond Black Friday Ad [Image via Bed Bath & Beyond] Leaked on November 5, the 2-page Bed Bath & Beyond Black Friday ad only has a few deals this year. This is nothing new for them, as their ad last year was only a single page. Thanksgiving hours are going to depend on your specific location, but doors open on Black Friday at 6 a.m. Here are a few important facts about the sale. 20 Percent off Your Entire Purchase (Friday Only) Select Dyson Vacuums & Heater for up to $200 Off Save $30 on Keurig K55 Elite You can see the entire two-page Bed Bath & Beyond Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. 2016 Michaels Black Friday Ad [Image via Michaels] Leaked on November 6, the 14-page Michaels Black Friday ad has an assortment of holiday-related items to get your home ready for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The sale begins early online on Thanksgiving at 4 a.m. EST. Retail stores will be open from 6 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving. On Black Friday, they will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. They are also extending the sale through Saturday, and they will be open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Here are a few important facts about the sale. 30 Percent off Your Entire Purchase on Thanksgiving with Code: THANKS1 30 Percent off Your Entire Purchase on Black Friday with Code: THANKS4 40 Percent off All Regular Price Purchase on Black Friday from Noon to 10 p.m. with Code: THANKS3 25 Percent off Entire Purchase on Saturday from 8 a.m. to Noon with Code: THANKS6 50 Percent off Any One Item on Saturday from Noon to 10 p.m. with Code: THANKS7 You can see the entire 14-page Michaels Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Update While the Walmart ad has not yet leaked, there is strong evidence that it will be released by the end of this upcoming week. Here are the dates over the past few years that Walmart’s ad has been released. 2012 – November 8 2013 – November 11 2014 – November 11 2015 – November 11 This upcoming week covers all of those dates, so Walmart’s ad should be out by Friday, November 11. Since Black Friday is earlier this year, November 25 compared to November 27 last year, it is unlikely Walmart would push their ad release back another week. Additionally, Walmart has already warned BestBlackFriday.com to not post their ad early. Traditionally, this notice comes a few days before the actual ad is going to be released, so it should be here soon. Expect it to come in the very early morning hours on November 10, with the possibility of it being pushed back to a little after midnight on November 11. As a reminder, Walmart’s website is currently hosting an “Early Bird” Pre-Black Friday sale, but you are better off waiting until Thanksgiving or Black Friday for the best deals.

Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy, who had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband, was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop a few feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city in 2016 agreed to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Tamir Rice’s family for $6 million. Jose Luis Magana — The Associated Press file By Dan Sewell and Jennifer Farrar, The Associated Press Posted: 11/06/16, 6:02 PM EST | Updated: 1 week, 1 day ago # Comments In this file photo, Gwen Carr holds a picture of her son Eric Garner during a news conference in New York with relatives of New Yorkers killed by police. died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict the officer who put Garner in the hold or any of the other officers involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. Bebeto Matthews — The Associated Press file CINCINNATI >> Sam DuBose was pulled over near the University of Cincinnati campus for a missing front license plate. Walter Scott got stopped for a broken taillight in South Carolina. Neither black man got out of the traffic stops alive. Former university police Officer Ray Tensing, 26, is on trial for murder in Cincinnati in the July 2015 fatal shooting of DuBose, 43. Former North Charleston, South Carolina, officer Michael Slager, 34, is on trial for murder in Charleston in the April 2015 fatal shooting of Scott, 50. Both officers, who are white, have pleaded not guilty. The cases are among a series across the country since mid-2014 — from the fatal shooting of a 12-year-old boy in a Cleveland recreation area to that of a 66-year-old woman in her Bronx, New York, apartment — that have raised a national debate over race and policing. Advertisement A summary of other deaths of black people after police encounters: ERIC GARNER The 43-year-old man died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict the officer who put Garner in the hold or any of the other officers involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. MICHAEL BROWN The 18-year-old was shot and killed in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. A grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot him. The Department of Justice also opted against bringing civil rights charges against Wilson. The death of Brown, who was unarmed, led to months of sometimes-violent Ferguson protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. JOHN CRAWFORD III Police in the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Beavercreek responded to a Wal-Mart store in August 2014 on a call of a man waving an apparent rifle. A white officer fatally shot Crawford III, 22, who was carrying what turned out to be an air rifle from a store shelf. Police said they believed it was a real gun and that he didn’t respond to their commands to put it down. A grand jury declined to indict the officers. The U.S. Justice Department has been reviewing the case. LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke is charged with first-degree murder in the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting death of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Van Dyke, who is white, was charged in November 2015 on the same day that the city, under judge’s orders, released dashcam video showing the 17-year-old McDonald being shot 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty and is free on bond. The video has prompted local and federal investigations of both the shooting and the Police Department. AKAI GURLEY Peter Liang, a rookie New York City police officer, was convicted Feb. 11 of manslaughter in the November 2014 death of the 28-year-old Gurley. Liang was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn in 2014 when he fired and a bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he had been holding his weapon safely when a sound jarred him and he accidentally fired. In April, a judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years’ probation and 800 hours of community service. An attorney for Gurley’s family said in August that New York City reached a settlement of more than $4 million with the family. TAMIR RICE Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy, who had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband, was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop a few feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city in 2016 agreed to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Tamir Rice’s family for $6 million. FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man entered a Baltimore police van in April 2015 shackled but alive. He died of severe neck injuries suffered during the ride that followed. His death led to rioting. Prosecutors in July 2016 said they were dropping charges against the remaining police officers awaiting trial, leaving no convictions against six officers who were charged initially in the case. Gray’s family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff’s deputy Robert Bates, age 74, was sentenced in June to four years in prison on a second-degree manslaughter conviction in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, an unarmed and restrained black man, during a sting operation. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, Police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced Oct. 12 to 2½ years in prison for fatally shooting William Chapman II, 18. Rankin shot the unarmed Chapman on April 22, 2015, after responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart store. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed Chapman “willfully, deliberately and with premeditation.” Chapman’s body was delivered to the medical examiner with handcuffs still bound behind his back, according to news reports at the time. Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin’s stun gun, according to the reports. Rankin, who is white, was fired after the shooting. WALTER SCOTT Michael Slager faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder in the shooting death of Scott in April 2015 in South Carolina. The shooting was captured on cellphone video by a passer-by. Slager told investigators Scott had grabbed his Taser and pointed the stun gun at him as they fought on the ground. Slager was fired by the North Charleston Police Department. There has been a $6.5 million settlement between North Charleston and the Scott family. Slager also faces federal charges including for allegedly violating Scott’s civil rights. SAM DUBOSE Ray Tensing faces 15 years to life if convicted of murder of Sam DuBose, killed in July 2015 near the University of Cincinnati campus. Tensing’s body camera captured much of the traffic stop, although the two sides dispute what conclusions can be reached. Tensing’s attorney says DuBose was using his car as a weapon that could have killed him. The university fired Tensing, hired outside consultants, and restructured its public safety department. The school also reached a $5.3 million settlement that includes free undergraduate tuition for DuBose’s 13 children. DARRIUS STEWART A federal prosecutor announced in September there was insufficient evidence to file civil rights charges in the July 2015 fatal shooting of Stewart, 19, by Officer Connor Schilling. Schilling, a white Memphis, Tennessee, police officer, shot Stewart during a struggle following a traffic stop that escalated after an attempted arrest for outstanding warrants. Schilling has said he shot Stewart because he feared for his life. He retired due to a disability, police said, in a move that allows him to receive disability pay. A grand jury in November 2015 declined to charge the officer. JEREMY MCDOLE Jeremy McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander’s cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general’s office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed “extraordinarily poor” police work. RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ricky Ball, 26. Boykin, facing trial Nov. 28, has said he shot Ball because the man appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin as he was trying to resign, saying he had broken department policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancee to ride along without permission, and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. DEMARCUS SEMER A Florida grand jury cleared two police officers in September who fatally shot Semer, an unarmed black motorist, in April 2016 as he fled. Prosecutors said the man’s actions gave the officers a reasonable belief that their lives were in danger. The St. Lucie County Grand Jury cleared Fort Pierce police Sgt. Brian MacNaught and officer Keith Holmes for the shooting of Semer, 21, during a traffic stop. Prosecutors say their investigation showed he refused to get out of his car and then tried to drive away, clipping Holmes and dragging MacNaught. Both officers are white. ALTON STERLING Sterling, 37, was shot to death July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking widespread demonstrations across Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II were placed on administrative leave. Neither officer has been charged in the case, which was turned over to federal investigators. PHILANDO CASTILE Castile was shot and killed July 6 by officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is Hispanic, after being pulled over as he drove through a St. Paul, Minnesota, suburb with his girlfriend and her young daughter in the car. His girlfriend began livestreaming on Facebook shortly after the shooting and said Castile, 32, was shot while reaching for his ID after telling the officer he had a gun permit and was armed. Yanez and his partner, Joseph Kauser, who was present for the shooting, were placed on administrative leave. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has turned its findings over to a county prosecutor, who will review the case. TYRE KING The 13-year-old Ohio youth was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer Sept. 14 after running from police investigating a reported armed robbery. Police said he a pulled a BB gun that looked like a real firearm. Officer Bryan Mason, who is white, was put on administrative desk duty while the investigation into Tyre King’s death continues. The attorney for his family has asked for a Justice Department review. KEITH LAMONT SCOTT The North Carolina State bureau of Investigation is reviewing the fatal Sept. 20 shooting of Scott by a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer. Scott, 43, was sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his Charlotte apartment complex when he was shot by police trying to find a different man. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times as he slowly backed out of an SUV. Scott’s family said he did not have a gun and was reading a book. The shooting, part of which was recorded by his wife and shared widely on social media, caused days of violent protests and a state of emergency to be declared in Charlotte. TERENCE CRUTCHER Tulsa, Oklahoma, police Officer Betty Jo Shelby was charged with first-degree manslaughter on Sept. 22 in the shooting of Crutcher, an unarmed man. Shelby, who is white, shot the 40-year-old Crutcher on Sept. 16 shortly after she arrived on a street to find his SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Crutcher was seen without a weapon and with his hands up on videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter before Shelby shot him. Police Chief Chuck Jordan has said that Crutcher did not have a gun on his body or in his SUV when he was shot. Shelby has pleaded not guilty and is on unpaid leave. ALFRED OLANGO In the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, a police officer opened fire on Ugandan refugee Alfred Olango within a minute of arriving at the scene on Sept. 27. Olango’s sister had described her brother as mentally unbalanced in multiple 911 calls. Video released by police shows the officer approached the 38-year-old man with gun drawn, as Olango paced in a strip mall parking lot. Olango pulls something from his pocket, takes what police call a “shooting stance,” and aims something at the officer, who then fires his gun. A second officer fired his Taser simultaneously. The object in Olango’s hands turned out to be a 4-inch electronic cigarette device. The two officers were placed on leave as the district attorney investigates. DEBORAH DANNER New York police were responding Oct. 18 to a 911 call about an emotionally disturbed person when Sgt. Hugh Barry encountered Danner, 66, in her Bronx apartment. The mentally ill woman picked up a baseball bat in her bedroom and tried to hit Barry, who fired shots that killed her. New York’s mayor rebuked him publicly the next day, and he has been stripped of his badge and gun and placed on desk duty while the state attorney general’s office determines whether the case falls under its authority to investigate police shootings of unarmed civilians. Police are also investigating the officer’s actions. Farrar reported from New York.

This year saw the addition of a memory board to honor those who have died was attached to one of the three vehicles donated by Red's Towing, Transport & Recovery, in West Springfield. To qualify in Sunday's run each rider was asked to bring a new unwrapped toy or a gift card in place of an entrance fee. Bruce Rivest, one of the event coordinators, said he was adopted through Brightside as a child, and wants people to know about Brightside for Families and Children. Rivest along with organizers Melvyn Hook and Pete Silvano, meet with representatives of Brightside several times a year to keep them (Brightside) up to date on the annual toy collection. Last year the toy run drive provided 237 families with toys, said Rivest. Hook noted that one art company donated art supplies, while some individuals donated PlayStations and bicycles. Older children usually receive gift cards so they can buy what they want, he added Riders left the Walmart parking lot at 11a.m. and proceeded to Providence Hospital, in Holyoke, where the toys were to be unloaded. The riders were served chocolate chip cookies and hot chocolate during the 30-minute stopover. Riders then continued to an after ride party at the Moose Family Center on Fuller Road in Chicopee. Sponsors for the ride included Indian Motorcycle of Springfield, Red's Exxon, Rock 102 and Lazer 99.3, and Walmart, while Chicopee, Springfield, and South Hadley Police provided escort service for the riders. Brightside for Families and Children is part of the Mercy Medical Center and the Sisters of Providence Health System.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Best Xbox One S Black Friday Deals Selling Now Posted: Nov 6 2016, 3:36pm CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The Black Friday 2016 sales season is just a couple days old, but deals on the Microsoft Xbox One S are off the charts already. It was clear very early one that Microsoft will be very aggressive selling the Xbox One S this Holiday season. We called out a new Console war back in September and now we are in the middle of it. The funny thing is that Sony is not reacting. They let Microsoft go crazy with Holiday bundles, discounts and bonus items. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Sony has not announced an new holiday bundle for the PS4 Slim and there is none in released Black Friday 2016 Ads. The best deal on a Sony PS4 bundle will be a $50 discount or a free game in Black Friday sales. Xbox fans can get much more free stuff and deeper discounts on the Xbox One S.  Initially we believed that there will be deals on the original Xbox One, but with the amazing deals on the Xbox One S, it does not make sense to bother with the old Xbox. The best Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deal we know off so far is advertised in the Dell Black Friday 2016 Ad. Walmart is though already offering now Xbox One S Bundle deals that are almost as good as Dell's deal. You can get on walmart.com now a Xbox One S 500GB bundle with your choice of bonus game, a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Movie, and a Controller for $298.89. At Walmart the Battlefield 1 and Minecraft Bundles qualify for this deal. If you are in the market for another Xbox One S bundle, Amazon is your destination. Amazon offers until November 12 a free game of your choice with any Xbox One S bundle on amazon.com. The new Microsoft Xbox One S is a great upgrade for Xbox One owners. Amazon offers a trade-in of your old Xbox One to make the upgrade more affordable. The Xbox One S supports 4K for watching video. Gameplay is upscaled to 4K. More importantly, the Xbox One S also supports HDR, giving games richer, more luminous colors and higher contrasts. In case you are hunting also for a 4K TV with HDR this Holiday season, we have listed the best 4K HDR TV Deals on sale now. Full HDR10 support is in most cases only found on 2016 TV models. Take a close look at the specifications to find out what the TV is supporting in terms of HDR. HDR is besides 4K, what makes Ultra HD Blu-ray movies pop out on your TV.

(Photo: Kevin O'Leary photos) ABC's Shark Tank has built enough of a quirky kind of brand recognition that an 11-year-old girl recently approached Kevin O'Leary at the San Francisco airport and wanted to talk about financing deals with convertible debentures. Everyone it seems has an idea about how a deal should be done — or an idea for a new product — to share with a shark. Celebrity investor O'Leary — who co-founded O'Shares, a line of exchange-traded funds — chatted with me by phone last week about how entrepreneurs can get financing, life in the Shark Tank and why, more than likely, I shouldn't plan to strike it rich with a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe. Here are excerpts from that interview: QUESTION: How did you end up with the role as the one who challenges the contestants on the show, where you're kind of like the Simon Cowell of the sharks? How did that happen?  ANSWER:  Either you make money or lose money. My feeling from day one, and you know Shark Tank has gone on for many years now, is that it's better to tell the truth. A couple of episodes ago, we got into an argument about it. The family comes out with a product or service and clearly it has no merit and the probability of success is extremely low. They're funding it with their own money. They're mortgaging their homes or going into credit card debt. The other sharks tend to say, "You know I'm not going to invest in it." It's clear to them also that it has no merit. And yet they'll give them encouragement to go on. Well, I find that incredibly disingenuous. Reality is going to strike anyway. And if they think it's tough in the shark tank, wait until they get out in the real world. They're going to get eaten alive. I'm not the mean guy; I'm the best friend they ever met. They're lucky they met me. Q: I happened to watch the show on Friday and saw you talking about this deal, this LuLu Bang sauce, and they already had some shelf space in Walmart. But you were really, really hard on them. Why? A: The numbers were showing it was failing in Walmart. The number of turns per week were too low to stay on the shelf. That consumer market is brutally competitive.  I'd argue that the chance of getting a hot sauce to actually return on an investment is extremely low unless you have a different strategy. I'm not saying it's impossible that they're successful, I'm just saying the probability is incredibly low. I'm the merchant of truth, that's what I am, and I'm Mr. Wonderful all bundled together. Q: Did you ever have a deal that you thought was a surefire bet but it bombed?  A: Mark (Cuban) and I did ToyGaroo and it went to zero. Lost a fair chunk of money on that one. They didn't understand their customer acquisition costs. (ToyGaroo, which went out of business, was to be the Netflix of toys. Parents would rent toys and send them back when the child was done playing with them.) Q: What are the signs of a winner?  A: One, they're able to articulate the opportunity in 90 seconds or less. Take (Wicked Good) cupcakes for example. 'We make cupcakes. We put them in a Mason jar. We FedEx them all over America.' I get it. No. 2, they're able to articulate why they're the right team to execute the business plan. They want to grow their business; here's how they're going to do it. You get those two elements together you can start to sense in the Shark Tank things are starting to sizzle like an isotope. You realize these entrepreneurs have a plan. Here's the third thing, and this is where I've seen the air go out of the room, you have to know your numbers. If you get to the Shark Tank, you get through the 100,000 applications, you're actually on the carpet, and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in hell to perpetuity and I will personally put you there. What are your gross margins? What's your break-even analysis? How many competitors? How fast is the market growing? Q: You seem to do fewer deals than the other sharks. I don't know if that's true or not. But if it's true, why is that?  A: No, it's not true. I just tend to do very high-quality deals. The truth is I've had the largest exits in Shark Tank history. Groovebook, for example, was sold for $14.5 million cash. No one has done that before. Look at the success of something like Wicked Good Cupcakes. It's a monster hit. One of Shark Tank's first royalty deals. Everybody was saying 'Wow, royalties, that's terrible.' No, it isn't. The family still owns 100%. It's the fastest-growing cupcake company in America, and I've made a lot of money, too. USA TODAY Life without lattes? Test-drive your retiree budget ahead of time Look at IlumiBowl, everybody laughed at those kids from Salt Lake City. $7 million in sales. IllumiBowl — that's a toilet bowl light. You go near your toilet, it lights it up. Monster, mega smash hit. The other sharks have no imagination. I create deals. I look at them as pieces of art. Q: You mentioned Groovebook. Is it correct that you put $75,000 into that deal? So how much did you make personally? Why did it work out so well? A: We don't discuss the terms of the deal with Shutterfly; they bought it. They only disclosed the purchase price but none of the other terms. Why it worked so well is it had a very simple solution to a huge problem. People want printed versions of their children to show grandparents and extended family members. Not everybody uses their phone; they want a photograph. This thing sent catalogs every month of 100 of your top images of that month to every extended family member. It went viral. It exploded. The reason Groovebook or IllumiBowl or Wicked Good Cupcakes or recently the Potato Parcel. Think about how ridiculous that is:  somebody writes your name on a potato and mails it to you. I invested in that because I know what's going to happen. It's going to explode. The reason all that is occurring is that Shark Tank is an amazing platform. It has millions of people watching it every night. USA TODAY How to get free publicity for your small business Q: Yet why doesn't everything work out? What are two or three things that really hold up a deal? A: If you look at venture investing since the late '50s, the typical model is you make 10 investments, two of them are phenomenally successful; 10, 100, 200 times on your money. Six of them are what are called the living dead where they stay alive but they make no money. And two of them go bankrupt within a year. It's the six living dead. The biggest challenge the living dead have is customer acquisition. So what happens in Shark Tank is some percentage of the living dead, the marginal companies, the ones that weren't going to make it in the normal world, get free advertising each year because they're in the Shark Tank family. The ones that do fail generally it's because execution skills aren't there. Q: I have a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies, five kinds of chips, peanut butter, everybody loves it. The recipe was given to me by a colleague on the copy desk. How do I make money on those cookies? A: My advice to you is don't quit your day job. Q: And you haven't even tasted the cookies. A:  It doesn't matter how good they are. The competition is unbelievable. Every year we get somebody who has a 'bright light' dream of breaking into the cookie market. It's next to impossible.

Here's the third thing, and this is where I've seen the air go out of the room, you have to know your numbers. If you get to the Shark Tank, you get through the 100,000 applications, you're actually on the carpet, and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in hell to perpetuity and I will personally put you there. What are your gross margins? What's your break-even analysis? How many competitors? How fast is the market growing? Q: You seem to do fewer deals than the other sharks. I don't know if that's true or not. But if it's true, why is that?  A: No, it's not true. I just tend to do very high-quality deals. The truth is I've had the largest exits in Shark Tank history. Groovebook, for example, was sold for $14.5 million cash. No one has done that before. Look at the success of something like Wicked Good Cupcakes. It's a monster hit. One of Shark Tank's first royalty deals. Everybody was saying 'Wow, royalties, that's terrible.' No, it isn't. The family still owns 100%. It's the fastest-growing cupcake company in America, and I've made a lot of money, too. USA TODAY Life without lattes? Test-drive your retiree budget ahead of time Look at IlumiBowl, everybody laughed at those kids from Salt Lake City. $7 million in sales. IllumiBowl — that's a toilet bowl light. You go near your toilet, it lights it up. Monster, mega smash hit. The other sharks have no imagination. I create deals. I look at them as pieces of art. Q: You mentioned Groovebook. Is it correct that you put $75,000 into that deal? So how much did you make personally? Why did it work out so well? A: We don't discuss the terms of the deal with Shutterfly; they bought it. They only disclosed the purchase price but none of the other terms. Why it worked so well is it had a very simple solution to a huge problem. People want printed versions of their children to show grandparents and extended family members. Not everybody uses their phone; they want a photograph. This thing sent catalogs every month of 100 of your top images of that month to every extended family member. It went viral. It exploded. The reason Groovebook or IllumiBowl or Wicked Good Cupcakes or recently the Potato Parcel. Think about how ridiculous that is:  somebody writes your name on a potato and mails it to you. I invested in that because I know what's going to happen. It's going to explode. The reason all that is occurring is that Shark Tank is an amazing platform. It has millions of people watching it every night. USA TODAY How to get free publicity for your small business Q: Yet why doesn't everything work out? What are two or three things that really hold up a deal? A: If you look at venture investing since the late '50s, the typical model is you make 10 investments, two of them are phenomenally successful; 10, 100, 200 times on your money. Six of them are what are called the living dead where they stay alive but they make no money. And two of them go bankrupt within a year. It's the six living dead. The biggest challenge the living dead have is customer acquisition. So what happens in Shark Tank is some percentage of the living dead, the marginal companies, the ones that weren't going to make it in the normal world, get free advertising each year because they're in the Shark Tank family. The ones that do fail generally it's because execution skills aren't there. Q: I have a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies, five kinds of chips, peanut butter, everybody loves it. The recipe was given to me by a colleague on the copy desk. How do I make money on those cookies? A: My advice to you is don't quit your day job. Q: And you haven't even tasted the cookies. A:  It doesn't matter how good they are. The competition is unbelievable. Every year we get somebody who has a 'bright light' dream of breaking into the cookie market. It's next to impossible.

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA: Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. Read the other stories in this series here. LA PLATA COUNTY, COLO. — The river gallops past ghost towns and plunges through canyons of quiet before tumbling into the old mining town of Durango. Legend has it that the Spanish christened these waters more than 300 years ago to honor a small band of conquistadors who died on its banks without receiving the sacrament of last rites. They called it El Rio de las Animas Perdidas. The River of Lost Souls. Today, some 53,000 people live in Durango and the surrounding county of La Plata. And all along the Animas, people are still dying before their time, particularly women in midlife, succumbing not to diabetes or heart disease, but to suicide. Two-and-a-half times as many people die by suicide as homicide in this country; among whites in 2014, it was nearly nine times as many, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although more men than women take their own lives, the rate of suicide has nearly doubled among middle-aged white women since 1999 — rising from 7 per 100,000 to 12.6 in 2014 — helping to explain a startling increase in their early mortality. The numbers are even worse for middle-aged white women with a high school diploma or less. For them, the suicide rate has more than doubled over the past 15 years, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal health data. Most of the victims lived in small towns and rural areas, particularly in the Southeast and in mountain states, where social isolation can be acute. Colorado has the fourth-highest suicide rate in the nation for white women ages 45 to 54. Among Colorado counties with a population of at least 30,000, La Plata has the highest. Since 2007, 14 middle-aged white women have killed themselves here. The Post looked at half of those cases and found striking commonalities: Most worked physically demanding jobs. Most suffered from chronic pain. And most struggled with mental-health issues that, surviving friends and relatives say, were addressed through psychiatric medications that were ultimately ineffective. Nationally, many mental-health experts have raised concerns about the growing use of such medications for everything from insomnia to ordinary loneliness. Between 1999 and 2013, psychiatric drug prescriptions shot up by 117 percent. The number of prescriptions written by non-psychiatrists also has risen. As many as 80 percent of all antidepressant prescriptions are written by physicians who are not psychiatrists, multiple studies have found, and doctors often give the drugs to people who have received no psychiatric diagnosis. Studies also show that the drugs work only about half the time and can produce side effects, such as anxiety and sleeplessness, that mimic worsening symptoms. Women are far more likely than men to receive these prescriptions: In the United States today, nearly 1 in 4 white women ages 50 to 64 is taking an antidepressant, according to federal health officials. No expert suggests that these medications are driving the uptick in suicide among this population. Research into that question is difficult, because many women on psychotropic drugs are already prone to depression and suicide. PhRMA, which represents the nation’s biggest drug companies, declined to comment for this story. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the nonprofit American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said the presence of multiple medications may suggest that the patient’s mental illness was particularly difficult to treat. “When I hear that someone is on more than three psychotropic medications, that tells me their doctor was going after the condition because the person didn’t respond to the first medication,” Moutier said. “There is a case to be made for rational polypharmacy.” However, Moutier added that multiple prescriptions can also suggest “suboptimal treatment.” And for women who believe the drugs hold the promise of a cure, other medical experts said, their failure can induce a withering spiral of hopelessness. “There’s all kinds of reasons to be depressed, and doctors are not attending to them anymore,” said Joel Paris, a professor of psychiatry at Canada’s McGill University. “What doctors are being told is, if the patient isn’t getting better, then you need to add another two or three [medications] to the regime. “The issue that antidepressants help about half the time is absolutely right.” The western slope of the Rockies has always had higher-than-average suicide rates, people venturing westward in search of excitement or escape and finding neither. For Pamela Beckert, Colorado was just another place to start over. Born in Ohio, Beckert grew up in Arizona. She was married twice but largely raised her son on her own. After Beckert’s father died in the 1990s, and with her son grown, she became a nomad, moving first to Fort Worth, then to Durango. Nothing felt permanent, including her jobs — a waitress in a bar, a process server, a security guard for Planned Parenthood. She had trouble paying rent, and sometimes her moods vacillated wildly. Through Medicaid, she received psychiatric medication from a Durango health clinic: Wellbutrin to raise her spirits; Lamictal to even out the mood swings; Klonopin for anxiety; Seroquel, an antipsychotic, to sleep. Sometime in the months before her death, Beckert stopped taking all of them and began stockpiling the pills. “It had become so dark at the end,” said Beckert’s son, Sean Dillman, who lives in Arizona. “I look back and I’ll always wonder what I could have done. But her demeanor was always the same. . . . I had no idea, no clue this is where she was at.” No longer able to afford her apartment, Beckert bunked with a friend and worried about where she would go next. When she asked a caseworker at the clinic about temporary housing, the young woman suggested Beckert live out of her Jeep at the back of the vast Walmart parking lot. Surely no one would notice her there. Pamela Beckert died of an overdose in this parking lot in Durango, Colo. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Wendy Faye Miller passed that Walmart on Route 550 nearly every day for decades. Most often, she was driving home from her bartending job at the Purgatory Mountain ski area, the road weaving around the Animas, where the outdoorswoman loved to raft and fish. Miller couldn’t wait to move to Durango. She left Waterford, Mich., at 17, missing her high school graduation to follow the man who would become her first husband. That was 42 years ago. About five miles east of downtown and half a mile past a sign that reads “Pavement Ends,” Miller lived in a mobile home until last December. A sagging porch and a tin roof secured with concrete bricks betray the home’s age. Most days, the only sounds are distant dogs barking at strange cars and the crunch of pickups passing on the unpaved road. When she lived here, Miller owned two horses until she was forced to sell them to pay bills. Her most beloved possession: a pearly white Harley-Davidson motorcycle. “She loved to ski. The outdoor lifestyle. She never grew out of it. Ever,” said her only sibling, younger sister Lorrie Searle, who still lives in Michigan. In addition to tending bar, Miller shoveled snow in the winter and sprayed mosquitoes for the county in the summer. Nearly all her life she also cleaned homes and businesses, including the office where her daughter, Autumn Concepcion, now works. It wasn’t easy: Miller had had two back surgeries for injuries suffered while breaking up a bar fight and falling down the stairs carrying a keg of beer. Autumn Concepcion’s mother, Wendy Miller, pictured in rear, killed herself at age 59. Autumn said she was very close to her mother and continues to grieve. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) The woman with the quick smile didn’t like being alone. She was an alcoholic, according to family and friends, but careful to conceal her misery. Only her daughter saw her mother’s sadness. “I could see her in town and she’d be fine, laughing, and then talk to her 20 minutes later at home, and it would be totally different,” Concepcion said. “Even her voice would change.” Miller’s daughter suggested she see a mental-health counselor in Durango. More than half of all counties in the United States — all of them rural — have no practicing psychiatrists, psychologists or social workers, according to a 2013 federal report. In La Plata County, only one mental-health clinic accepted Medicaid. Miller, unfortunately, qualified for Medicaid only part of the year, when she wasn’t earning wages above the federal poverty limit. Otherwise, she would have to pay on a sliding scale, and the scale didn’t slide quite enough. Miller visited just once. “She hid her pain,” said Crystal Andasola, a close friend. “She was a broken person, with a broken spirit, a broken soul.” Charlotte Sieber hanged herself when she was 54. (Family photograph) Charlotte Sieber fought depression for years, and then she battled her own medications. The Sweden native was a flight attendant when she met her future husband, Brad, more than 30 years ago. They settled in a small, fruit-tree-laden enclave just north of downtown Durango, where they had two children. He was a UPS driver; she found a job in a local clothing store. But 20 years ago, after injuring her neck and back in a series of automobile accidents, she could no longer work, and she spiraled into depression. “If she had a great day, it was usually two or three weeks before there was another,” said Sieber’s husband. The psychiatric medications doctors prescribed seemed to work only for a short time (when they did at all): the antidepressant Effexor, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Seroquel. There were others, too, but none offered long-term relief. “Multiple drugs overload the system in ways we can’t predict,” said Rene Muller, a psychologist at Johns Hopkins. “Everyone metabolizes drugs differently, which also affects how they interact with each other.” Four years ago, Charlotte Sieber met Jennifer Roeder, who told of her own travails trying to come off psychiatric medications when they failed to help her feel less depressed. “It was the first time she heard that maybe the drugs were hurting, not helping,” Roeder said. Sieber began to slowly wean herself off her many medications, tapering the drugs one at a time, according to family and friends, though she often had to stop to let her body and mind recover. “It’s really hard to withdraw from antidepressants,” said New York psychiatrist and pharmacology expert Julie Holland. In some cases, “people feel like cold water is running down their spine. They can feel their brain sloshing around, or electric zaps in their head.” By July 2015, Sieber had successfully discontinued all but one of her psychiatric medications. “One of her worst [side effects] was sleep. She could not sleep,” said Pati Wolfe, who often joined Sieber in the struggle to withdraw from drugs. “This went on for months and months. Maybe a couple of hours a night was all she would get.” It was so bad that Sieber had to move out of the bedroom she shared with her husband so he could get some sleep. Heart palpitations, obsessive worrying and anxiety clouded her nights. She lost weight and sometimes told friends it was too hard to talk to them. Toward the end of July 2015, Sieber texted Roeder: “I know I’m in a state of shock, never been this sick in my whole life. Of course the long process of tapering (6 years in Nov.) has worn me out.” Over the next two months, Sieber mostly retreated to her room, where she wrote in a journal and painted delicate pastoral scenes on seashells she had collected at the shore. At other times, she sat out back on an island deck, under the scrub oak and beside a stream that branches off a creek that branches off the River of Lost Souls. Seashells painted by Charlotte Sieber in Durango, Colo. Her husband, Brad, said she was happiest at the beach. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Pamela Beckert, 54, died Sunday, Jan. 15, 2013, after telling a friend, with whom she was living, that she might be late. “It’s going to get really, really cold. Don’t wait up for me,” Beckert told her. “I know my way home.” A week later, friends found her body, clad in a white winter jacket and jeans, a pair of mittens and clogs beside her. Beckert had bought a light blanket at Walmart and a cup of tea at Starbucks, downed dozens of pills from six different bottles of psychiatric medication, then lay down in the back of her Jeep Wrangler — at the far end of the Walmart parking lot. Wendy Miller, 59, died on Monday, Dec. 14, 2015. It snowed hard all day in La Plata County, and Miller fell while leaving a house she had cleaned that afternoon. She was scheduled that evening to clean her daughter’s workplace, but Concepcion called to tell her they’d closed early. Miller asked her daughter to let her know when she got home safely, and at about 6 p.m. she did. Her mother texted back: “good, thank you, xoxo.” Miller was probably already home by then, after stopping to buy a fifth of McCormick vodka, which she nearly finished that night. About 9 p.m., she was on Facebook, making plans for her 60th birthday party in January. At one point she smoked a little pot, which usually helped her sleep. Then, sometime after 9:30 p.m., Wendy Miller crawled into bed, put a .38 Special in her mouth, and pulled the trigger. Her shopping list was still on the kitchen table: dish towels, laundry soap, milk. Brad Sieber reminisces about his wife, Charlotte Sieber, at his home in Durango. Sieber has struggled to reconcile his feelings about her death: “I'm a fixer. I fix things. But I couldn’t fix Charlotte.” (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) No one knows what Charlotte Sieber, 54, was doing in the hours before her death on Nov. 11, 2015. She was alone in her bedroom that Wednesday afternoon, with her 26-year-old son on the computer in the next room. Two weeks earlier, her husband, Brad, had called a suicide hotline. They told him to take her to the hospital, but he knew that was the last place his wife would go, afraid she’d be given even more medications. The final text Jennifer Roeder received from her friend had come five weeks earlier. Sieber had told her: “I’ve been really really bad, however it makes me feel worse talking about it . . . Trust me, I just need the pain and suffering (anxiety/fear/panic) to go away, not to mention the insomnia!” Sieber hanged herself from a rope thrown over a rod in a small closet in her bedroom. Later, her husband found a belt from one of her dresses, torn in half and thrown in the trash. It had taken her two tries to die. After his wife’s death, Brad Sieber’s anger banged its fist against his grief. Furiously, he scoured the house for the bottles of pills he believed had driven his wife to take her life. He found them in the medicine chest, the kitchen cabinets, the drawers of her desk — two dozen of them, maybe more — and poured them all, one by one, down the toilet. Then Sieber threw the bottles and all his wife’s medical files into a garbage bag and dragged the load out of the house. Beyond the rock garden, the apple trees and the stream from the creek from the River of Lost Souls, he spilled all those decades of pain into the backyard fire pit. And as the pyre burned into the twilight, Brad Sieber watched and wept.

Life Buy/Sell Health Close 1 of 2 Art Maines, standing, with his stepfather Bill Haney.  Maines wrote a book on scams against the elderly after his father fell victim to one. 123rf.com More older Americans are discovering social media, and scammers are there waiting for them By Jim Gallagher St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jim Gallagher Nov 6, 2016 (…) +1  Art Maines, standing, with his stepfather Bill Haney.  Maines wrote a book on scams against the elderly after his father fell victim to one. +1  123rf.com Nelda is 76, lives in central Missouri and is $27,000 poorer because she trusted a message that seemed to come from a friend on Facebook. Her case illustrates a nasty and evolving phenomenon: As more old people discover social media, they are finding new ways to get scammed. Nelda and her friend Susie had worked together at a school where Nelda managed the cafeteria. “I go to church with Susie,” said Nelda. “We’ve been together for years.” They were friends on Facebook so when the Facebook message came in September with Susie’s name attached, Nelda believed it. “Did you get your money yet?” the note asked. “Oh, I got mine.” Susie went on to explain that she’d received a big cash “grant” and saw Nelda’s name on the list of winners. She sent Nelda to a page on the Facebook website, which showed happy people standing by a UPS delivery truck. “This is a great organization,” Susie wrote. Nelda didn’t know that Susie’s Facebook account had been hacked, and that messages from Susie were really from a crook. Nelda didn’t ask that her last name be withheld in this story, but the Post-Dispatch is withholding it anyway. Scammers hunt for trusting victims, and Nelda is a prime catch. The local sheriff’s office confirmed that she reported the scam. Social media surge The sheriff has seen a “tremendous increase” in scam complaints as more older people learn to use social media, an officer said. “Five or 10 years ago, they were being scammed through the mail or by telephone.” Now, computers and smart phones do them in. Nelda is married, but her husband has mild dementia. She checked the website and soon found herself text messaging with an “agent.” “You have won prize money of $70,000 in an ongoing cash grant,” he wrote. The grant was sponsored by a “conglomerate” promoting responsible citizens. She was warned not to tell anybody about her good fortune, to protect the UPS drivers who would be carrying all that cash. Could this be true? Of course, said the fake Susie in another Facebook message. “I got $90,000,” she said. Nelda was delighted. “My granddaughter underwent major surgery today and this will help her,” she texted the agent. Then came the catch. Nelda had to pay an $850 delivery fee, then UPS would deliver the cash to her door. “You have to take cash to the MoneyGram store,” said the agent. Fake Susie was on Facebook again, assuring Nelda that she’d done the same thing and got the money. So, Nelda wired off the money. Then came another problem. The IRS had gotten wind of the windfall, and wanted $6,000 in taxes before the money could be released. “I had cancer a few months ago and I had to use about everything,” Nelda told the agent. “I am just devastated. This is crazy,” she said. But she followed instructions, traveling to Walmart and other stores and wiring four payments of $1,500. Dividing the payment was a smart move on the scammer’s part. Walmart clerks had become suspicious. “Do you know the person you’re sending money to?” they asked Nelda, who assured them that she did. The crooks played their games twice more — the truck had been in an accident, and another big delivery fee was needed. Then her award had been raised to $150,000, but she had to make another tax payment first. All the while, Nelda kept hearing from fake Susie on Facebook, urging her on. “This is very legitimate,” said Susie. When she told the scammer about the suspicious Walmart clerks, they sent her to a bank and had her send money to a Bank of America account. The routing number shows a branch near Richmond, Va. Amid it all, her son arrived on the scene and learned what was happening. “Mom, it’s a scam,” he told her. Nelda didn’t believe it. Then she went to church and saw the real Susie. Susie knew nothing about a grant, but she did know that her Facebook account had been hacked. Nelda realized that she’d been taken. “I told her (Susie), and she turned white and started crying,” said Nelda. “Then both of us were crying. I was just sick. I told my husband I may have really messed up,” said Nelda. Can she stand the loss of $27,000? “I’ll just live on Social Security,” she said. Warning signs Facebook and other social media sites are guidebooks for thieves. A member often lists relatives, friends, interests, education, personal events, with pictures attached. All that can be used to mimic another’s identity. “These people are as good at data mining as any big corporation,” said Art Maines, a St. Louis social worker who became a crusader against elderly fraud when his stepfather was scammed. Nelda was the victim of a scam with several variations. More often, victims are told they’ve won a sweepstakes, sometimes second prize in the Publisher’s Clearinghouse drawing. Sometimes they learn they’ve won a lottery. Facebook and other social media provide fodder for the “grandma” scam. The caller claims to be a grandson or other relative in deep trouble, needing money quickly to get out of jail or a jam. They know the names of family members, mention vacation and other family details. Any request for payment to use MoneyGram, prepaid cards, gift cards, iTunes cards, electronic transfers and the like is almost certainly a scam, says Bill Smith, investigator for the Better Business Bureau in St. Louis. Chances of recovering the money are nearly nil. Local law enforcement will investigate if it seems the thieves are local, but most fraudsters are outside the U.S. So it becomes a job for the FBI. Authorities in India recently emptied an entire building of people pretending to be IRS agents, arresting 70. They were on the phone to Americans, threatening to jail or sue them if they didn’t make big payments immediately. More than 600 others are under investigation. The IRS scam — which has become a national plague — illustrates a change in tactics for criminals, from sweet talk to threats. “It used to be that they were the nicest people you’d ever talk to. Now it’s about intimidation,” says Maines, author of “Scammed,” a book on preventing fraud of the elderly. A call from the IRS demanding money immediately is always a scam, says the IRS. The agency almost never calls taxpayers and always sends letters first. More younger victims Loneliness and cognitive loss can make certain old people easy marks for scammers. But the elderly as a group actually don’t seem more vulnerable than others. In fact, the old lose less to fraud than younger people, according to a survey of 2,000 people this year by the Better Business Bureau. Adjusted for their share of the population, the bigger losses are among people ages 18 to 54, with the greatest losses among those ages 25 to 34. People over 54 lose less, and that holds true for people over 65 and over 74 years old. “Far from the prevailing stereotypes, several studies have found that those most likely to be exposed, targeted and ultimately victimized are the young, the middle-aged, and the better educated,” the study said. Youth and education seem to bring overconfidence, the study suggests. They think they will recognize a rip-off, when they actually don’t. But older people are less likely to understand computers and the online world, and that can lead to losses. Rose Smith, 60, holds a bachelor’s degree in psychology and an associate degree in paralegal services. Her education didn’t save her from a sneaky computer scam. She downloaded what she thought was Microsoft Outlook software. The installation stopped, and a popup appeared advising that she call a toll-free number with questions. She called, and the technician, who had a foreign accent, gave her instructions that completely shut down her computer. “It was totally blank, blank, blank,” she said, and nothing she tried would revive it. “He told me the only way I could get the computer back was to pay him $200.” She’d have to purchase a gift card and tell him the numbers. “I was totally outraged. I realize that this guy totally scammed me,” said Smith, who lives in the Central West End and has gone public with her story on television. She paid the money.

A request that money be sent by Moneygram, or other wire transfer, through a gift or prepaid card or an iTunes card is a sure sign of a scam. News that you've won a prize, but must send money first in order to collect, is always a scam. The Federal Trade Commission offers these tips for friends of the elderly hoping to save them from being victimized.  Watch out for: Suspicious changes in wills or powers of attorney: Out of the blue, your grandfather wills all of his belongings to his new nurse. Financial activity the person couldn’t have done herself: You discover repeated ATM withdrawals from your bedridden mother’s bank account. Bills not being paid: When visiting a neighbor, you see mail piling up on his desk. Maybe his caregiver is using his money for something other than paying bills. Significant withdrawals or unusual purchases: You notice charges for fancy electronics on your thrifty aunt’s credit card bill.

Kevin O'Leary, celebrity investor, will speak at a forecast luncheon in Detroit Nov. 18 before the CFA Society Detroit. (Photo: Kevin O'Leary photos) Story Highlights Kevin O'Leary says Potato Parcel -- where people send messages on potatoes -- could prove popular. Two in 10 deals can go bankrupt; while two in 10 can skyrocket. Shark Tank can give an edge to those in middle. Competition is unbelievable in food; frozen products especially tough. ABC's "Shark Tank" has built enough of a quirky kind of brand recognition that an 11-year-old girl recently approached Kevin O'Leary at the San Francisco airport and wanted to talk about financing deals with convertible debentures. Everyone it seems has an idea about how a deal should be done — or an idea for a new product — to share with a shark. Celebrity investor O'Leary — who cofounded O'Shares, a line of exchange-traded funds — plans to visit Detroit on Nov. 18 to speak at the 2016 Forecast Luncheon for the CFA Society of Detroit at the Motor City Casino Hotel. The event, expected to attract more than 500 people, is also open to nonmembers. The ticket price for nonmembers is $65. See www.cfasociety.org/detroit. ► Related: 'Shark Tank' star thrills local candy makers The 62-year-old Canadian, who was once part of the cast of CBC's "Dragons' Den," chatted with me by phone last week about how entrepreneurs can get financing, life in the "Shark Tank" and why, more than likely, I shouldn't plan to strike it rich with a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe. Here are excerpts from that interview: QUESTION: How did you end up with the role as the one who challenges the contestants on the show, where you're kind of like the Simon Cowell of the sharks? How did that happen?  ANSWER:  Either you make money or lose money. My feeling from day one, and you know "Shark Tank" has gone on for many years now, is that it's better to tell the truth. A couple of episodes ago, we got into an argument about it. The family comes out with a product or service and clearly it has no merit and the probability of success is extremely low. They're funding it with their own money. They're mortgaging their homes or going into credit card debt. The other sharks tend to say, 'You know I'm not going to invest in it.' It's clear to them also that it has no merit. And yet they'll give them encouragement to go on. Well, I find that incredibly disingenuous. Reality is going to strike anyway. And if they think it's tough in the shark tank, wait until they get out in the real world. They're going to get eaten alive. I'm not the mean guy; I'm the best friend they ever met. They're lucky they met me. Q: I happened to watch the show on Friday and saw you talking about this deal, this LuLu Bang sauce, and they already had some shelf space in Walmart. But you were really, really hard on them. Why? A: The numbers were showing it was failing in Walmart. The number of turns per week were too low to stay on the shelf. That consumer market is brutally competitive. I'd argue that the chance of getting a hot sauce to actually return on an investment is extremely low unless you have a different strategy. I'm not saying it's impossible that they're successful, I'm just saying the probability is incredibly low. I'm the merchant of truth, that's what I am, and I'm Mr. Wonderful all bundled together. Q: Did you ever have a deal that you thought was a surefire bet but it bombed?  A: Mark (Cuban) and I did ToyGaroo and it went to zero. Lost a fair chunk of money on that one. They didn't understand their customer acquisition costs. (ToyGaroo, which went out of business, was to be the Netflix of toys. Parents would rent toys and send them back when the child was done playing with them.) Q: Have you ever worked with any businesses with a Michigan connection?  A: Yes, Talbott Teas. It was acquired by Jamba Juice. (West Bloomfield native Steven Nakisher and his partner Shane Talbott founded the Chicago-based company.) Q: What are the signs of a winner?  A: One, they're able to articulate the opportunity in 90 seconds or less. Take (Wicked Good) cupcakes for example. 'We make cupcakes. We put them in a Mason jar. We FedEx them all over America.' I get it. No. 2, they're able to articulate why they're the right team to execute the business plan. They want to grow their business; here's how they're going to do it. You get those two elements together you can start to sense in the "Shark Tank" things are starting to sizzle like an isotope. You realize these entrepreneurs have a plan. Here's the third thing, and this is where I've seen the air go out of the room, you have to know your numbers. If you get to the "Shark Tank," you get through the 100,000 applications, you're actually on the carpet, and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in hell to perpetuity and I will personally put you there. What are your gross margins? What's your break-even analysis? How many competitors? How fast is the market growing? Q: You seem to do fewer deals than the other sharks. I don't know if that's true or not. But if it's true, why is that?  A: No, it's not true. I just tend to do very high-quality deals. The truth is I've had the largest exits in "Shark Tank" history. Groovebook, for example, was sold for $14.5 million cash. No one has done that before. Look at the success of something like Wicked Good Cupcakes. It's a monster hit. One of "Shark Tank"'s first royalty deals. Everybody was saying 'Wow, royalties, that's terrible.' No, it isn't. The family still owns 100%. It's the fastest-growing cupcake company in America, and I've made a lot of money, too. Look at IlumiBowl, everybody laughed at those kids from Salt Lake City. $7 million in sales. IllumiBowl — that's a toilet bowl light. You go near your toilet, it lights it up. Monster, mega smash hit. The other sharks have no imagination. I create deals. I look at them as pieces of art. Q: You mentioned Groovebook. Is it correct that you put $75,000 into that deal? So how much did you make personally? Why did it work out so well? A: We don't discuss the terms of the deal with Shutterfly; they bought it. They only disclosed the purchase price but none of the other terms. Why it worked so well is it had a very simple solution to a huge problem. People want printed versions of their children to show grandparents and extended family members. Not everybody uses their phone; they want a photograph. This thing sent catalogs every month of 100 of your top images of that month to every extended family member. It went viral. It exploded. The reason Groovebook or IllumiBowl or Wicked Good Cupcakes or recently the Potato Parcel. Think about how ridiculous that is:  somebody writes your name on a potato and mails it to you. I invested in that because I know what's going to happen. It's going to explode. The reason all that is occurring is that "Shark Tank" is an amazing platform. It has millions of people watching it every night. Q: Yet why doesn't everything work out? What are two or three things that really hold up a deal? A: If you look at venture investing since the late '50s, the typical model is you make 10 investments, two of them are phenomenally successful; 10, 100, 200 times on your money. Six of them are what are called the living dead where they stay alive but they make no money. And two of them go bankrupt within a year. It's the six living dead. The biggest challenge the living dead have is customer acquisition. So what happens in "Shark Tank" is some percentage of the living dead, the marginal companies, the ones that weren't going to make it in the normal world, get free advertising each year because they're in the "Shark Tank" family. The ones that do fail generally it's because execution skills aren't there. Q: I have a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies, five kinds of chips, peanut butter, everybody loves it. The recipe was given to me by a colleague on the copy desk. How do I make money on those cookies? A: My advice to you is don't quit your day job. Q: And you haven't even tasted the cookies. A:  It doesn't matter how good they are. The competition is unbelievable. Every year we get somebody who has a 'bright light' dream of breaking into the cookie market. It's next to impossible.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. "He said 'ma'am are you pregnant,' and I said 'yes I am,' and he said 'you did not look pregnant five minutes ago,'" said Pautke. "He said, 'I'm going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don't have anything under your shirt.'" Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. Then when she proved she wasn't hiding anything, she said that employee told her to have a good day.

Previously, this toy had only been available at Entertainment Earth for all of about a few hours, so this is the first confirmed sighting of the toy in brick and mortar retail, or anywhere else really. The price was given as $19.97. You can check out the image that Scotty provided to us below, and you can start heading out to your local Walmarts and other stores to hunt this guy down.

Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1839687) Posted by Kurona on November 7th, 2016 @ 9:10pm CST It is pretty stealthy, actually. Disguising himself as Bumblebee to trick more parents into getting him for their kids' christmas.

Also, I never thought that 'Stealthasaurus Rex' would ever be used as an official name. As a nickname in the show, sure, but and official name? That's interesting. Seriously though, what's with the empty box? Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840077) Posted by Hellscream9999 on November 9th, 2016 @ 9:43pm CST Fellow Seibertronians, Scottimus Prime Toy Hunter Productions was on the hunt at a Target in Commack, within Long Island New York, and found the new 3 Step Drift and Energon Boost Bumblebee. This Drift is unique in that it is the first 3 Step version of the character with his original deco. The first 3 Step figure was the 'Blizzard' themed deco and featured a different head. This Drift has a new head based on the original design of his face. And Bumblebee has blue highlights... So check them out and let us know what you think of them - or if you've seen them - in the comments below. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840199) Posted by Tyrannacon on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:11pm CST Saw this show up on io9 and BWTF: http://bwtf.com/news/rid2015-io9-figure ... ember-2016 http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-robots-i ... 1788753393 Soundwave is apparently taking from his WFC/FOC design while Cyclonus is a play on his G1 design like Starscream. Plus, Skywarp? It looks like so. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840214) Posted by Bronzewolf on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:47pm CST We've got some huge news for you today, Seibertronians! User Mindmaster has alerted us to an article on the website Io9, Where they revealed a majority (if not all) of the toys coming out in the Robots In Disguise Spring 2017 wave! The big news here is most of the new figures are classic characters no one expected to be included in RID2015, so this is a surprise certainly coming out of left field for most. Spanning all size classes, characters like Blurr, Bludgeon, Cyclonus and, most importantly, Soundwave will be joining the cast sometime in the future! The toys also have some interesting new gimmicks, such as Activator Combiner Soundwave, who comes with a Laserbeak who turns into a small weapon, with "Deploying Battle Cannons". This calls back to the similar Minicon Deployers that are currently included in this line. Take a look at all of the images of the new toys down below and tell us in the comments what you think of these new incarnations of classic Transformer Characters! Warrior Class Legion Class 3-Step 1-step Activator Combiners Soundwave Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840215) Posted by Cobotron on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:50pm CST Wow! Some of those look amazing! Blurr and Twinferno look fun. And Hey! Skywarp before Thundercracker? Now we're talking! Yo News crew! You guys seeing this? EDIT: Bronzewolf with the save! Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840217) Posted by Kurona on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:53pm CST Someone in Hasbro REALLY likes Twinferno, huh? First being the only Monsterbot to get the Generations treatment and now this. I'm getting a John Warden Deluxe Vehicles vibe here While this all looks majorly badass, I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it. RiD 2015 used to mostly be it's own thing with the recent Starscream harkening back to the past so much being a big surprise, but what made it so great is that it was unique. Now it feels like the toyline's starting to overflow with G1 influence when before it was packed with originality and new characters. Don't get me wrong, I still prefer these G1 characters to what RiD has put out and I'm excited for most of these figures - especially that Soundwave holy shit - but... I dunno. It's starting to feel like RiD's uniqueness is starting to fade and mesh in with everything else. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840218) Posted by Sigma Magnus on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:53pm CST The one article said Hasbro is making designs inspired by G1...that's not all that new, and Titans Return is a much better example of that... Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840221) Posted by Cobotron on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:58pm CST When the Bludgeon mold was revealed at NYCC he was a Bot and had a different name. So we're getting two, or they changed their mind? And I agree Kurona. Although these look fun, I wouldn't mind the line staying the course of originality it was on.

"The warrior class features some of the largest figures in the RiD line" oh come on Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840224) Posted by JelZe GoldRabbit on November 10th, 2016 @ 1:00pm CST Warrior Class Starscream Bludgeon Blurr Soundwave Twinferno Skywarp Legion Blurr Cyclonus Starscream Of note is that the Warror Starscream is a regular retail release, and thus may have some changes from the TRU Clash version. As for Bludegon, I'm going to assume he's a redeco of Blastwave, as I don't see any of the others revealed earlier. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840225) Posted by Railbomb on November 10th, 2016 @ 1:04pm CST I kinda like how that Soundwave takes design cues from both the WFC/FOC and Prime designs. And depending on how well that Bludgeon looks in hand I might use him as my G1 Bludgeon.

The 3 we saw in new york arent there so I am assuming these all come after. That means that we will first get Blasstwave, White Drift and Stormshot. So far they have been releasing 3 new warriors per wave, so I dont know how this will all play out. So much for those who thought this line was dead is growing more and more and giving us more stuff. I love it. I still want a warrior hamerstrike but this is all good stuff. I dont know if I will get that skywarp or not but all the rest of these warriors are definite buys. And I find it cool how taht Soundwave has the same body type as Prime Rumble and Frenzy. It will be a cool dynamic to have him stand in the middle of the two with them acting like his goons. About Soundwave, man, that guy's agent must have been working overtime.

Wonder how Soundwave and Cyclonus will factor into the show, if at all. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840241) Posted by Kurona on November 10th, 2016 @ 1:16pm CST Soundwave will definitely be a big thing in the show; probably the new 'con leader. You don't just get a whole slew of toys like that, all original molds and don't appear. Cyclonus too considering he's a new mold. I'd expect Skywarp and Bludgeon too but since they're easy redecoes of past figures, won't be surprised if they don't appear. Then again, Soundwave probably needs team fillers, and there don't appear to be many Decepticon toys not currently arrested and taken back to Cybertron...

ReleaseWire Sign Up Login Services Distribution NewsWire MediaWire SBWire Engagement CRM Connect Publisher For Journalists Journalists Center Process Create Distribute Analyze Respond Newsroom Press Releases Multimedia Help About NKBJ InfoNet, LLC (TDMST) Email Alerts| RSS November 8 Has Been Named "Low Clearance Awareness Day" Vicki Simons of Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com has named November 8 "Low Clearance Awareness Day". She listed tips to help professional truck drivers avoid being involved in low clearance accidents -- and has announced a reward and challenges.   Aiken, SC -- (ReleaseWire) -- 11/07/2016 --Vicki Simons of Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com has named November 8 "Low Clearance Awareness Day" for the purpose of helping professional truck drivers avoid driving commercial motor vehicles under or into structures that are shorter that their vehicles. The date November 8 (11/8) was selected in honor of the "11 foot 8" (11'8") railroad trestle in Durham, North Carolina, where many low clearance crashes have happened despite the installation of numerous warning devices. Many videos have been made of large and straight trucks -- and recreational vehicles -- that have been damaged by the "can opener" bridge, which can be seen on the website 11foot8.com or the site's YouTube channel. "Low clearance truck accidents -- which are always costly -- are 100% preventable," Mrs. Simons said. "With all of the technology available today, though, why are these accidents still happening?" A photo from a news report about a low clearance truck accident appears on the TruckersSavings Pinterest social media channel on the "Truck Under Blunders" board. It originally appeared in an article on OregonLive.com on February 25, 2013. The article says that according to the Marion County Sheriff's Office, the driver attempted to take a Walmart truck measuring 13'6" high under a 12'9" bridge at River Road South and Orville Road South. Mrs. Simons notes two seemingly contradictory pieces of information in the article: 1. The trucker "misread the height limit" and 2. The trucker "was relying on directions from the truck's navigation system" at the time of the accident. She wants to know why a navigation system installed in a commercial motor vehicle would route a trucker under a low clearance bridge and what brand and model of navigation system it was. While truck low clearance accident statistics have been hard to come by, Mrs. Simons speculates that many truckers are having these accidents because they are relying upon GPS -- or Global Positioning System -- units in one of two respects: - Either the GPS unit being used by the trucker was not properly configured for commercial motor vehicles; - Or despite the GPS unit in use, the truckers didn't heed clearly marked low clearance signs. In order to help her learn more, Mrs. Simons announced the following reward to help raise awareness among professional truck drivers about low clearances. In the name of Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com, she will give a $50 Amazon.com gift card to - the first professional truck driver who can document to her satisfaction - that any GPS (Global Positioning System) unit that has specifically been configured for 13'6" commercial motor vehicles - has routed him/her to go under any overpass that is shorter than 13'6" in the lanes of travel (not on the shoulders) within the continental USA. Truckers are invited to submit information through a special form on the site in order to qualify. Besides challenging professional truck drivers to be aware of low clearances, Mrs. Simons also challenged: - News reporters who report about low clearance truck accidents, to always ask the driver if he/she was following the routing of a GPS unit that was specifically configured for commercial motor vehicles; and - Trucking companies to provide their drivers with lists of brands, models and specifications of GPS units that are allowed for use in their trucks. To help American truckers who are traveling in Canada -- and Canadian truckers who are traveling in the USA -- Vicki Simons has created a "Truck Height Feet to Meters Conversion Table", which is available through their Free Downloads page. To get instant access to the printable PDF document, enter your name and email address in the form on our website and confirm your subscription. Mrs. Simons listed five tips to help professional truck drivers avoid low clearance accidents: 1. Know the height of your entire truck: tractor and trailer(s). 2. Do not use non-CMV GPS units. 3. Plan your route according to approved truck routes. 4. Always watch for and heed low clearance signs. 5. If you're unsure your truck will clear an overpass, it's always better to stop than risk having an accident. For more information, visit the Low Clearance page of Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com. About Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com was created by trucker consumer advocates Mike and Vicki Simons "because truckers know that no trucker deserves to be stung financially". Through the site, the couple provides real world tips that help professional truck drivers save hard-earned money and personal reporting about products and services for use on the road. They share the tips they have learned through the years and encourage other professional drivers to do the same. Since 2009, Mike and Vicki have helped untold numbers of professional truck drivers and their home support team members save money in many different ways. The couple's 25+ years of marriage, frugal lifestyle and commercial driving experience serve as the backdrop for blending two of their passions: truck driving and saving money. They have published hundreds of articles and reviews on their site, have sent thousands of news snippets to their continually updated Truckers' Savings Blog and publish a free monthly email newsletter.

Information: cityoflagunaniguel.org For the past decade, Laguna Niguel has hosted an annual toy drive dedicated to providing military families with gifts and well wishes. The drive returns Friday when the Laguna Niguel Military Support Committee hosts the event at Walmart. New toys for kids aged 1 to 12 and gift cards for teenagers will be accepted. Rich Encinas, who sits on the military committee, said the toy drive provides about 250 children with Christmas presents. “When they see what we give them, they are literally blown away and amazed," he said. Once the toys have been collected, Encinas said, they are delivered to USS Stockdale sailors and their families. “We have taken it to the point now where the parents only need to get a couple small toys.” Laguna Niguel Mayor Laurie Davies, co-chair of the military committee, plans on collecting toys for the committee Saturday from 1 to 3 p.m. “It's amazing how generous our community is,” she said. Davies said committee events are beneficial in part because they provide some services to sailors that they often have to pay for, such as toiletries. In a typical year there are two car washes, a golf tournament, baby shower drive and other events helping local military. Residents wishing to support sailors and their families can stop by Walmart Friday through Sunday and drop off the gifts.

By TonyaGarcia Reporter Amazon.com Inc., with its online retail and web services businesses, is facing competition from a wide range of companies, and has the goods to win on both sides, Moody’s says. On the e-commerce side, Amazon AMZN, +3.27%   is well-positioned for the fourth quarter, but could feel the pinch from a highly promotional holiday season. “Based on what we’ve seen so far, we think this fourth quarter is shaping up to be an excellent one, with revenues likely growing at least 22% as the company reaps some nearer-term benefits from its protracted investment program,” Moody’s wrote in a note published Monday. Still, the e-commerce giant will have to deal with a holiday shopping season rife with discounts. Retailers like J.C. Penney Co. Inc. JCP, -3.73%  , Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY, -0.95%   and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +0.68%   have already announced holiday plans, including pre-Black Friday sales. Amazon has also launched its Black Friday Deals Store, weeks ahead of Thanksgiving Day. See also: Distracted consumers could pause holiday shopping around election, but they’ll come back “We believe this early activity is laying the groundwork for promotions that will be above what we have been seeing in recent years,” Moody’s wrote. “We believe the investment thesis for Amazon should be on top-line growth for now.” Netflix, Amazon: How Best to Capture India Viewers (4:12) As Amazon.com and Netflix look to grow their business in India amid a global expansion, they are following two diverging scripts. WSJ's Shalini Ramachandran has details on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: Amazon Amazon reported third-quarter sales of $32.7 billion for the third quarter on Oct. 27, up from $25.4 billion last year, and in line with the FactSet consensus. Earnings per share were 52 cents, up from 17 cents last year, but falling short of the 76 cents FactSet consensus. Moody’s highlights that Amazon “‘absorbed’ over $500 million more in shipping costs than in third-quarter 2015.” See also: Amazon posts smaller-than-expected profit increase Moody’s calls these results “solid,” and believes Amazon will continue its online dominance over other retailers. “The better-performing brick-and-mortar retailers are expecting fourth-quarter online sales to grow at least in the high teens – a level that Amazon should easily eclipse,” Moody’s wrote. “Our ‘forecast’ holds margins steady at fourth-quarter 2015 levels, though there is a greater potential downside risk due to uncertainties around the company’s investment plans.” Among the areas of investment Amazon has highlighted are video content and fulfillment centers. See also: Amazon’s investment strategy doesn’t scare away analysts In addition to the aforementioned retailers, Moody’s believes Macy’s Inc. M, -0.66%  , Target Corp. TGT, -0.76%  , off-price retailer TJX Cos. Inc. TJX, -0.65%  , “or basically the entire brick-and-mortar universe,” which is focused on e-commerce and fighting for holiday season dollars, are Amazon’s competition. But the fight is on two fronts. Amazon Web Services posted strong results in the third quarter, with revenue of $3.2 billion. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.87%   and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +2.87%   are fighting for position in this space. See also: Most retailers would benefit from staying closed on Thanksgiving Day “On the web front, it faces Microsoft and Google, which are both focused on the cloud and have the desire and financial wherewithal to go head-to-head with Amazon,” Moody’s wrote. “While we believe both sets of competitors are formidable, if we had to choose, increased competition for the cloud is apt to be somewhat more cutthroat than the retail side.” Amazon shares are up 4% in Monday trading and up 16.2% for the year so far. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.32%  is up 4.1% for 2016 to date, and the Dow 30 Industrials Average DJIA, -0.15%   is up 2.7% for the period.

The biggest shopping day of the year will have many deals and bargains and stores open for your purchasing convenience. As the days go on, more info is coming out, including numerous ads and circulars to show all the big sales. Toys R Us has now revealed its Black Friday gameplan, and there is also a big update on the hours for numerous stores. Some of the bigger stores have not yet revealed their Black Friday 2016 ads, and shoppers are still waiting for Walmart, Target, and others. As they wait, Toys R Us has decided to at least issue a press release detailing their plans for the upcoming holiday, and it includes their store hours. [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Shoppers heading to Toys R Us for Black Friday will be able to enjoy “30 hours of straight shopping” if they so choose. Stores will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day (November 24, 2016) and will not close until 11 p.m. on Black Friday (November 25, 2016). That’s a lot of shopping, and the giant toy retailer is looking to make things as convenient for their shoppers as possible. At the front of every location, a G.P.S. (Gurus for Play Stuff) will be standing and assisting shoppers to find certain items. The G.P.S. assistants will be in place for every Saturday and Sunday in November, and then starting on November 25, Fridays as well. Extra store maps, longer hours, and more customer service will be there to make Toys R Us shopping experiences as hassle-free as possible for Black Friday this year. Now, many other stores are releasing more information about their store hours and deals that are coming out. One of the biggest things, aside from the bargains, is what hours will a store be open and it’s time to check out the most updated numbers. [Image by Yana Paskova/Getty Images] A lot of stores have not yet revealed their store hours for Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday 2016, but they will soon. The Black Friday put together a great list of those that have given forth that information so let’s see when some of the bigger retailers will have their doors open. Michaels – 7 a.m. Friday PetSmart – 7 a.m. Friday Costco – 9 a.m. Friday Sam’s Club – 7 a.m. Friday Belk – 6 a.m. Friday Staples – 6 a.m. Friday GameStop – 5 a.m. Friday BJ’s Warehouse – 7 a.m. Friday Office Depot/Office Max – 6 a.m. Friday JCPenney – 3 p.m. Thursday to 5 p.m. Friday Bed, Bath & Beyond – 6 a.m. Friday Kohl’s – 6 p.m. Thursday – midnight Friday Other stores such as Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Kmart, and others still have yet to announce their hours. Some other retailers may have hours that vary by location so always check with your local store before just heading out to shop. Getting organized and having a plan in place for Black Friday shopping is really one of the best things anyone can do. Heading out into the throngs of people and hordes of traffic without knowing where you’re going or what you’re chasing is not an ideal situation. When it comes to the holidays, shopping is a big part of it and there is no getting around that. Many feel that Black Friday 2016 hours and tactics should change, but as long as millions will head out to the stores, things will remain the same. Toys R Us is living proof of that, and it shows in their recently revealed holiday shopping plans. If you’re going to head out for the bargains, get your ads ready and a plan in place so you can make the most of your time and money.

The Connecticut Department of Transportation recently identified previously unknown Raymark waste in the area of the new Exit 33 interchange, according to Jim DiLorenzo, a project manager for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The waste was identified in five soil borings out of nearly 50 done as part of the DOT’s geotechnical design work for the interchange. The DOT also detected asbestos waste in other soil borings that were unrelated to Raymark Industries. The waste was located between Barnum Avenue Cutoff and the southbound side of I-95 across from Walmart and is not easily accessible to the public, DiLorenzo said. The current Exit 33 is a partial “diamond” interchange consisting of a southbound I-95 entrance ramp and a northbound exit ramp. The new configuration, according to state DOT officials, would be a full “diamond” interchange with the proposed southbound off-ramp connecting with Veterans Boulevard on the north side of I-95. The new northbound on-ramp would extend from Ferry Boulevard/U.S. Route 1 northbound on the south side of I-95, and the bridge carrying I-95 over East Main Street will be widened to accommodate the new on-ramp and acceleration lane. While DiLorenzo said it’s “fairly certain” the waste is the same as the Raymark waste found elsewhere in Stratford, more testing will be needed to verify it. DiLorenzo said the discovery will likely not change the recently finalized EPA cleanup plan. The agency finalized its plans to remediate waste found in four designated Operable Units, or OUs, throughout town. OU2 includes groundwater and vapor intrusion and the plan calls for the installation of vapor systems in a variety of impacted buildings and structures to protect building occupants against the intrusion of volatile chemicals from contaminated groundwater into air. OU3 covers the Upper Ferry Creek area, the Raymark ballfield site off Barnum Avenue is OU4 and 22 sites around town are considered OU6. The $95.7 million plan involves excavating contaminated soil and sediment from OU3 and OU6 and consolidating it at the ballfield with other waste as well as capping it. The waste at the Interstate 33 interchange would be included in OU6, DiLorenzo said. “We always anticipated the possibilities that more properties [with Raymark waste] would pop up,” DiLorenzo said. “The decision we had includes that…we will clean up these 22 sites and other properties in the same manner. We have a plan in place. We have no idea of the volume yet.”   The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the state Department of Public Health announced Friday that air and ground sampling and monitoring will be conducted after asbestos was found in the soil at the site of the Exit 33 design and reconstruction. Preliminary indications are that there is no immediate threat to public health, according to the two state agencies.

 A travel hacker with 45 credit cards reveals his tricks for maximizing airline miles, points, and rewards Talia Lakritz, INSIDER Nov. 7, 2016, 12:52 PM 2,831 facebook linkedin twitter email print Daniel Gillaspia at Yosemite View Lodge. Daniel Gillaspia/Flickr The INSIDER Summary: • Daniel Gillaspia is a pro at managing airline miles, points, and rewards. • He recommends using many credit cards carefully. • Flying out of airline hubs and using companion passes also saves time and money. When Daniel Gillaspia isn't working as a full-time attorney in Houston, he and his partner Bradley Darnell travel around the world by expertly managing airline miles, points, and rewards from their 45 credit cards. "Travel is naturally a pretty expensive thing to to enjoy, but I knew that there were ways to do so-called 'travel hacking,'" Gillaspia said. "I started to learn the ins and outs of everything, and then I was like, 'Alright, well, I'm going to put this knowledge into practice and see how far it can get me.'" He now shares this knowledge on UponArriving, a website he runs that covers the latest developments in credit cards, airline and hotel award programs, and other travel topics. INSIDER asked Gillaspia for his best travel hacks. Here's his advice for making luxury travel happen at a fraction of the cost. Daniel Gillaspia/Flickr Make sure your finances are in order. "The average American household has something like $15,000 worth of credit card debt, and if someone is prone to running up credit card balances, they should think twice about getting into this, because rewards credit cards almost always come with some of the highest APRs (annual percentage rates)," he said. Choose cards with valuable sign-up bonuses. "There's the Chase Sapphire Reserve that offers a 100,000 point sign-up bonus, which could convert into $10,000 worth of first-class airfare, but you have people running into Wal-Mart signing up for cards that send them home with a free rotisserie chicken," he said. "Not all cards are created equally." Keep an eye out for multiple sign-up offers on the same credit card. "If you just search around a little bit more, you may find a sign-up bonus for the same card offering 20,000 more miles or something like that," he said. The more cards you have, the better — as long as you keep track of them. Daniel Gillaspia/UponArriving Gillaspia estimates that between him and his partner, they have 45 different credit cards. "A lot of people shudder when they hear that, they think our credit score is in the crapper," he said, "But actually, our credit scores are as strong as they've ever been." The key is keeping track of them and paying them off fully each month. Gillaspia uses two to four cards regularly, and organizes the rest in intricate spreadsheets. "The more credit cards you have, the bigger payment history you can build up over time. If you're responsible and don't run up a huge balance on your credit cards, pay them off each month and keep their utilization down to a minimum, you're going to inevitably increase your score over time," he said. Think of points as a form of currency, and spring for deals that give you the best exchange rate. "You don't want your points to be redeemed for poor values, really low values," he said. "You always want to maximize." Fly out of airline hubs. Daniel Gillaspia/UponArriving Flying out of an airline's headquarters means you will have more flight options, and thus save time and minimize extraneous connecting flights.  "It's just a better, more efficient use of miles a lot of times, if you're going through hubs," said Gillaspia. "And it also saves time, especially for people like me who like to do weekend getaways." Earn a companion pass. A companion pass allows another person to fly for free on any flight you book. It's earned after reaching a certain number of points, depending on the airline. Gillaspia's companion pass allowed him and his partner to get away about every two weeks to explore places around the US and the Caribbean. "I would say that while the first class experiences we enjoy are certainly our favorite way to fly, earning the Southwest Companion Pass was one of the best things we ever did," he said.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. “He said ‘ma’am are you pregnant,’ and I said ‘yes I am,’ and he said ‘you did not look pregnant five minutes ago,'” said Pautke. “He said, ‘I’m going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don’t have anything under your shirt.'” Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. Then when she proved she wasn’t hiding anything, she said that employee told her to have a good day. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

But just as importantly it yields valuable business intelligence through a rich depository of captured data that helps you make informed decisions as you improve operations.   As distribution giants Amazon and Wal-Mart flex their supply chain muscles in a race to get goods into their DCs and out to the customers quickly and perfectly, one thing is clear: shipping is a key part of any retailer’s competitive edge. Your logistics operations can be optimized as keenly as any profit center in your business. No surprise that the road to enhancement and efficiency begins with data, and it comes from your carriers’ invoices.   Freight and parcel invoices contain a wealth of information. Auditing and processing these invoices electronically and prior to payment yields three crucial benefits for supply chain management:   1. Savings, excluding duplicate invoices, of $4.25 per bill. It’s not unusual for shippers to see savings of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.    2. Administrative cost savings of $10-$12 per bill. Your accounting people are freed up from processing and paying dozens of carrier invoices each week.    3. Game-changing data that offers opportunity for significant logistics improvements.   Using freight auditing software in-house or partnering with a third-party auditing and payment vendor allows businesses to save money and gain insight into their operations. If you work with a freight auditor, you will have access to your shipping data through web-based dashboards, as well as have the option of importing the data directly into your ERP system.   The Data Freight Auditing Captures More than 150 data points are captured and examined in the freight auditing process. Examples include origin and destination addresses, customer and vendor names; shipped and delivery dates; weights; freight, accessorial and fuel charges; product classifications and descriptions; GL codes; service levels and numerous other elements.    Criteria checked during the audit process include checking for duplicate invoices; ensuring proper rate bases and discounts; and identifying late deliveries, improper accessorial charges and fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges change weekly and make up a substantial portion of freight, parcel and ocean invoices.    Identify Your Greatest Shipping Expense  Data from freight invoice auditing gives you a complete breakdown of costs in numerous categories. This can help you make better decisions regarding your shipping practices. For example, you can identify how much you spend by parcel service level. Are you shipping next day when ground delivery will suffice? You can also allocate costs to account or general ledger codes, and allocate your freight spend by vendor, region, store, business division and taxes.    Other cost savings opportunities can be identified with this data.  An example is address correction charges. Fees for repeated shipments to wrong addresses can add up quickly. You’ll be able to identify these charges and make the appropriate changes to eliminate these ongoing fees. Without data from the audit, retailers are unaware there is a problem or an opportunity for improvement.    Freight audit data also aids in rate negotiations with your carriers. These agreements are typically renewed annually, and the more information that a shipper can bring to this discussion with a current or prospective carrier, the better the result. Just as each shipper has a forecast for the next 12 months, so do carriers. They want as much information about your shipping practices as possible in order to give you their best possible pricing. By providing information regarding tonnage by shipping lanes, number of minimum weight shipments and requirements for additional services, the more competitive pricing you’ll receive.   In these negotiations, shippers typically too often focus only on the discount that they receive. However, up to 25% of your freight expenses may be in the fuel and accessorial charges category. Knowing where your spend is in these areas will allow you to focus on these items during the negotiation process.    The Impact of Proposed Carrier Pricing Another benefit to companies that have access to data garnered from freight audits is a real view of how proposals from new or existing carriers would look in terms of real dollars. With the complexity of factors involved in carrier pricing, comparing one proposal with another is not always an apples-to-apples comparison, especially since definitions of charges can vary between carriers.    However, knowing you historical shipping lanes, minimum shipment volumes and accessorial requirements, you can calculate the total amount you will pay under different proposal scenarios. This allows you to identify best value carriers, and make decisions based on numbers rather than gut and perception.    Supply Chain Visibility A full analysis from audit data likewise aids retailers with route optimization. The data reveals which shipping lanes are common without relying on carriers for this information. This allows you to identify possibilities for shipment consolidations where you’re shipping from the same origin to the same destination within a short time period. The shipping data also includes origin and destination points, as well as the cities packages are routed through. All this information can be used in decisions regarding locations for new distribution centers and stores.   Conclusion Shipping today is obviously an integral part of the retail business. Whatever improves your shipping operations helps your business. Freight bill auditing pays for itself through the savings that it generates. And the business intelligence made possible by capturing and analyzing all of your logistics data allows you to drive cost reductions while implementing operational improvements.   Garry Oswald is VP of sales and marketing for National Traffic Service, a freight auditing, payment and information processing company headquartered in Amherst, New York.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases DHgate.com CEO Diane Wang Explains Effects of Globalization through Digitalization According to Wang, this is the effect of the adoption of technology and changing habits of consumers, “For example in China, street vendors must support mobile phone payment methods, or they will be abandoned by potential customers. This is also true for big chain stores like Wal-Mart, as well as mom-and-pop shops selling baked goods. These may be examples of the shallow integration of traditional industries and the Internet, but this is just the beginning. In the future, businesses more prominent use of the Internet will create inestimable opportunities.” Wang mentioned that digital globalization has brought another change, cross-border e-commerce platforms, like DHgate.com, which have been breaking down the trade boundaries between countries, gathering global business people and goods. “In our eyes, the future presents an image of people being able to buy and sell globally very easily. In actuality, digital globalization has not abandoned these major markets. Through cross border e-commerce platforms, they can transform their businesses, acquiring business from beyond the confines of their locality, and accept orders from across the globe. In addition, we have entered directly into the overseas market; we have established overseas exhibition centers in many countries, providing a multitude of services, including: product inspection, brand representation, online and offline sales, warehouse logistics, and after-sale customer service. The barriers to overseas markets have been significantly reduced, thanks to global digitalization. As a result, it is now far easier for Chinese sellers to enter more overseas markets.” About DHgate.com DHgate.com is the first to market and the biggest transactional cross-border B2B e-commerce marketplace in China, aiming to provide global buyers with quality products at competitive prices.

Police Captain John Sherwin says two SUV’s were spotted ramming a car and shots were also fired at the vehicle as it sped north on Broadway in the vicinity of the county fairgrounds around 7:30 p.m at about 80 mph.   Sherwin says the incident had its beginnings in the parking lot of the Pure Pleasure store in Stewartville .That’s where a 21-year-old Rochester woman made contact with a man she knows. She later left with two passengers, a 23-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl and drove back to Rochester.   The woman says while near 28th Street in the south Walmart store area, a white SUV suddenly pulled in front of her, forcing her to stop. She says the man she had met earlier also pulled up behind her car and boxed her in. The woman says when a man in the white SUV got out and began approaching her car, she decided to drive away.That’s when the drivers of both SUVs began chasing her, taking turns ramming her car as she decided to go to the Law Enforcement Center. The woman says 5-6 shots were fired at her car and at least one struck the vehicle before she was able to make it to the LEC. Sherwin says officers located the white SUV and arrested the suspected driver, 27-year-old Kristian Miranda. Kristian Miranda – Photo from Olmsted County Sheriff’s Office   The other SUV was also located and Sherwin says the search continues for its driver. Sherwin has identified him as 23-year-old Victor Miranda, believed to be the brother of the other suspect. Sherwin says the three people in the car were shaken up but not hurt. He says the wild chase was witnessed by several people who called 911. He says the motive for the incident is unknown at this point.

By Arthur Zaczkiewicz on November 7, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Macy's Herald Square Clint Spaulding For ad effectiveness as measured by the ABX Advertising Benchmark Index, Amazon Inc., Macy’s Inc. and Target Corp. were among the top performers for October. According to ABX in its report, major retailers ran 595 new ads in October, and many scored well with the research firm’s new Gender Equality Measure, “which means the advertisers are portraying girls and women in respectful ways,” the company noted, adding that the GEM impacts several of the other measures in the index such as “Reputation” and “Action.” The company added the GEM last month as part of the #SeeHer hashtag effort from the Alliance for Family Entertainment as well as the Association of National Advertisers. The ABX Advertising Benchmark Index includes 14 variables, with a score of 100 being equal to “average effectiveness.” ABX said several major retailers delivered effective ads during the month that scored well over 100 while the same companies saw campaigns in other channels miss the mark. For October, some of the most effective ads were launched by retailers such as Macy’s, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kohl’s Corp., Kroger, J.C. Penney, Best Buy and Toys ‘R’ Us, among others. ABX noted that some of the least effective ads across media channels were from CVS, Gap Inc., Best Buy, Walgreens and Fry’s Electronics. Click here to see a chart of the ABX October Ad Report. For television, the number-one ad was Amazon Echo Dot “Just Ask” spot. It scored an overall ABX Index measure of 133. ABX researchers described the ad as a “fascinating spot with off-screen actors asking the Amazon Echo Dot questions that are humorous to the situation — such as losing jewelry down the garbage disposal, capturing a spider and wondering how many minutes are in 18 years in relation to a baby making a mess of spaghetti.” “This ad scores a strong +33 percent over norm in the overall ABX Index; a very high +103 percent in Reputation, and a great +53 percent in Action,” ABX said. “Within Action, all options for researching the product further scored extremely high, but Purchase was lower, at only 6 percent over norm.” The researchers noted that for average TV scores for the month, Amazon didn’t fare well despite the strong performance of this ad. Overall, it placed 14th out of 18 major retailers measured. For radio, Target delivered the most effective ad with the “Imagine hearing that your child has cancer…” spot. Its ABX Index score was 117 and had a whopping 201 “Reputation” score. In the ad, ABX said “a female voice asks listeners to imagine their child has cancer or Sickle Cell Disease and how terrible that would be. That’s why Target is teaming up with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Interestingly, Awareness and Message are only about average, but the association with St. Jude’s drove high Action subset scores in Intent to Contact, Research the Web, Recommend and Talk About it.” For print ads, “Macy’s teaming up with Breast Cancer Research Foundation” campaign scored the best with an ABX Index reading of 116. “This simple black-and-white ad shows how Macy’s is helping in the fight against cancer,” ABX said. “Of note is the new Gender Equality Measure, which evaluates how respectfully girls and women are presented in advertising. At +16 percent over norm, Macy’s has done a good job with this ad, showing a female with a healthy figure walking for the cause.” In the digital realm, J.C. Penney’s “Biggest Sale of Them All” spot was number one. The ad’s ABX Index score was 129. ABX said for the month, J.C.Penney ranked third out of 19 digital retailers placing major campaigns. In the free-standing insert category, Kohl’s “Columbus Day Door-Busters” was number one with an ABX Index of 122. ABX researchers said the retailer did a “good job of messaging,” which pushed other measures in the index up. “Also helping those scores is the 109 Gender Equality Index, which means Kohl’s is doing better than average in portraying its female models with respect.” For out-of-home ads, Best Buy was top with its “Prices Matched, Miles Saved” billboard ad. It had an ABX Index score of 110. You're missing something!

However, 2016 could bring different dynamics to holiday shopping with the imminent presidential election and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December. Year-to-date, Amazon (NasdaqGS: AMZN) and Dow component Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) have recently helped XRT’s rival, the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEArca: RTH), perform less poorly than XRT. XRT, an equal-weight ETF, has been plagued by slumping apparel retailers, among other corners of the flailing retail industry. With Amazon being one of the story stocks of 2016, RTH is primed to keep rolling, but XRT is reversing its fortunes for the better thanks to rebounding department store names. That scenario is bolstering the ETF’s technical outlook. SEE MORE: America’s Less Dressed: 3 Factors Weighing On Retail ETFs “The beginning of the Christmas holiday season (November) has been a good time to buy the group, and the post-shopping season (January) has been a good time to avoid (or be short) the sector,” reports ETF Daily News. “XRT has outperformed the market in November with an average gain of 2.26% in that month alone.  In addition, XRT has lost an average of 1.87% during January in the period examined (2006, 2009 to 2015). December has been a relatively neutral month for retail stocks compared to the S&P 500.” Trending on ETF Trends Insurance ETFs Ascend to New Highs mREIT ETFs Could be Ready to Shine Brazil, A Once Hot Emerging Market ETF, Cools Off Already a Winner, Steel ETF can Keep Soaring Under Trump Investors Quickly Utilized ETFs in Reaction to Trump Victory RTH covers the 25 largest U.S. companies involved in retail distribution, wholesalers, on-line, direct mail and TV retailers, multi-line retailers, specialty retailers and food and other staples retailers. The ETF’s exposure to traditional department stores is light.

And be sure to exit your trade by the end of November or December,” according to ETF Daily News. For more news and strategy on the Retail ETF market, visit our Retail category.

The restaurant opened October 20 and is expected to observe a Grand Opening within the next two weeks. (Telegram Photos By Pete Wilson) Portsmouth resident Jordan Clark, owner-operator of the new Papa John�s restaurant in Jackson, has been very active in the operation of the new eatery and had his hands in the dough preparation process on a recent morning. PETE WILSON @NewsmanPete Owner-operator Jordan Clark was planning for a fairly quiet and smooth "soft opening" when his new Papa John's restaurant threw open its doors Thursday, October 20, in the former Radio Shack building at 1113 East Main Street, Jackson, located just south of the Jackson Heights subdivision and across State Route 93 from the Jackson Walmart Superstore. Even without any advance advertising or promotion, pizza lovers turned out in droves on those first few days and business has been good ever since. "It has been great, better than expected," Clark said of the steady flow of customers to Papa John's door. "We had to have another (delivery) truck come in because we didn't have enough ingredients." Papa John's is headquartered in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky and since being founded about 30 years ago has grown into the third largest pizza take-out and delivery chain in the nation with 4,900 locations in 37 countries. Other nearby Papa John's locations are located in Chillicothe, New Boston, Gallipolis, Athens, and Marietta. Like most others in the chain, the Jackson restaurant is a franchise location and represents Clark's first ownership experience after eight years of employment with Papa John's, starting as a customer service representative and most recently serving as the general manager of the New Boston restaurant. When Clark, who grew up in Wheelersburg and lives in Portsmouth, became interested in securing his own Papa John's, he settled on Jackson as a prime location with potential and was able to sell the company's brass on the proposal. The former Radio Shack building, which is in a prime visibility location, was available for lease and is actually a bit larger than most Papa John's restaurants. Clark already has a payroll of 35 full and part-time employees and expects to add 15 more based on the early volume of business. Clark feels the chain's overall popularity and success are due to its commitment to product quality and customer service. "We have better ingredients and use no fillers," Clark explained. "Everything we use is the gold standard and it's always fresh. We will never stray from service and quality and we take pride in what we do for our customers." Clark also says Papa John's prides itself on its community service programs and says the Jackson restaurant will be reaching out to and supporting the community as well. For example, the local restaurant will offer store tours to students in kindergarten through grade 2 and actually help kids make their own 10 inch pizzas. Other possible projects include a coloring contest, a canned food drive, and a "toys for tots" project. Although a specific date is yet to be determined, Clark says plans are being made for a Grand Opening which he expects to take place within the next two weeks. The Jackson Papa John's restaurant is open Monday-Thursday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. until 12 a.m.; and Sunday, 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. Article Comment Submission Form Please feel free to submit your comments about this story for possible publication online and/or in our print edition.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Record Hot Year Of 2015 May Become New Normal By 2025 Posted: Nov 7 2016, 5:37am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Current Record Levels of Heat may be the Norm by the Year 2030   It is being said that the current record levels of heat may be the norm by the time the year 2030 arrives. The hottest year was 2015 and it could be that by the time 2025 arrives, the record heat levels would have become the new norm. If such is the case, humanity will be subject to lassitude and heat exhaustion thanks to the high temperatures. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart The root cause of this heat wave during the summer months is carbon emissions. The novel research on the subject was published in the journal Bulletin of American Meteorological Society. Yet by now, the fact is clear as the light of day, that it is almost too late. Even if we drastically reduce carbon emissions, the new normal temperatures during summer would skyrocket by the time 2040 arrives in all its futuristic and grim reality. There is a slim chance of rewinding the climate change clock. Yet it will take enormous amounts of effort. It won’t be a walk in the park or a piece of cake. Were humanity to continue in its wreckless path of increasing carbon emissions, the future will be very bleak indeed.  Australia will be the first nation to face record heat levels due to this mistake we are making. In 2013, in Australia, the record summer temperatures were 50 degrees Celsius. Bushfires erupted in several regions due to  extreme and sultry heat. It was in fact so hot in the Land Down Under that it was termed the “angry summer”. Yet the fact that this could be the new norm by 2035 is frightening to say the least. If we were to really reduce carbon emissions and build an environmentally-friendly society on earth, only then will the temperatures normalize. This, however, is a pipe dream since it cannot be accomplished in such a short time basis.  The point about the record heat levels being the new normal has become a new definition of the stakes involved in the climate change game. It seems that we will have to act fast or we are going to be facing catastrophe on a grand scale. Using a supercomputer, a series of model simulations were made regarding the future weather. Australia, Europe, Asia and North America were the countries that were put under the microscope. There is hope yet for humanity but it will involve snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. The thing to remember is that we have one planet and only have one chance to save it from certain ruin.

Vock | November 9, 2016 Last year, a decision from lawmakers and regulators set off an exodus of solar companies from the state. (FlickrCC/BlackRockSolar)         Read all of our coverage on 2016 ballot measures at governing.com/ballotmeasures. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and Republican megadonor, doesn’t often agree with U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, the outgoing Democratic majority leader. But this year, they teamed up in an attempt to break up Nevada’s electric monopoly and secured an initial victory. The two are part of a larger effort to amend Nevada's constitution to force legislators to rewrite the state’s policies for electric utilities, giving customers the choice of which company they want to provide their power. The arrangement would make electric companies compete for business, rather than simply operating as monopolies in their area and charging rates set by state regulators. RELATED Solar Measure Fails in the Sunshine State The first step in that amendment process cameTuesday, when 72 percent of voters backed the plan. But it would still be a while before any changes could take effect: In order for the amendment to pass, voters would have to approve it again in 2018. Lawmakers would then have five years to overhaul the electric utility law. Whatever the long-term ramifications, the constitutional amendment is an outlet for pent-up frustration with NV Energy, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and has a monopoly in the state. The company says it's neutral on the proposal. Big-time customers like Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corporation and data-center operator Switch want to buy electricity from sources other than NV Energy but have been stymied by state regulators. Solar companies, meanwhile, are still chafing from decisions last year by lawmakers and regulators favoring the utility over solar providers, which set off an exodus of solar companies from the state. Reid, according to Nevada journalist Jon Ralston, orchestrated the amendment after repeated run-ins with NV Energy over clean energy. “The only way we’re going to effectively change policy is by resetting the table,” said Matt Griffin, an attorney for Nevadans for Affordable Clean Energy Choices, which drafted the amendment. “We’re stuck in a rut with our energy policy, and there’s no way out of it unless we get everybody together and say: What does our energy future look like?” Amendment 3 hadn’t received a lot of attention this year because Nevada also has competitive elections for president, U.S. Senate, several members of Congress and other ballot measures on guns and marijuana. Switch and Sands spent a combined total of $2.4 million to promote the electric deregulation amendment. Tesla, MGM Resorts, Patagonia and Walmart have also voiced support, and the solar industry has gotten on board as well. The only organized opposition to the amendment has come from unions, who worry that removing price controls could lead to big cost fluctuations that would hurt lower-income and middle-class electric customers. "They’re not spending millions of dollars each to make sure that the consumers are taken care of in this. It’s about the economic well-being and the bottom line of their companies,” said Dan Hart, a strategist for the No Handouts to Billionaires campaign that’s working against the measure and is largely funded by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The idea of deregulating an electric market certainly isn't new: 15 states and the District of Columbia, which together have roughly a third of the country’s population, use deregulated markets. But the idea lost much of its luster following the rolling blackouts in California and the bankruptcy of the energy speculating company Enron in 2001. Nevada officials had pulled the plug on an earlier attempt to deregulate its electricity market in light of those developments. Opponents of the current measure point to those failures as reason to stay away from further deregulation. But Griffin, the amendment’s author, says federal regulators are much better equipped to oversee electricity markets now than they were when the concept of allowing customers to choose the company that provides them power was still new. The two sides differ over which approach is more environmentally friendly. The opponents say that an open market for electricity will encourage customers to buy cheaper but dirtier power. The proponents say the freedom to choose your own provider will let customers get an even higher percentage of their power from renewable energy than is available now through NV Energy. Plus, the amendment would specify that people have the right to sell the energy they generate on their own, such as from solar panels. There's also considerable dispute over whether deregulation actually lowers customers’ bills. A 2015 study by the American Public Power Association, which opposes deregulation, concluded that, between 1997 and 2014, “retail electric price increases were higher in states with deregulated electric markets than in regulated states.” In 2014, for example, customers in deregulated states paid an average of 12.7 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with 9.4 cents for customers in regulated states. But proponents of the Nevada measure say that it could lead to average savings of 20 percent on electric bills. Finally, the two sides disagree over whether this issue belongs in the state constitution in the first place. “Why aren’t we having a discussion at the legislature?” asked Hart from No Handouts for Billionaires. “If they feel it’s obvious that this should happen, then they should be able to make that argument to the legislature.” Griffin, the proponent, sees nothing wrong with adding electric deregulation to the state charter, especially because, he says, advocates for change have tried for years to get the legislature to look at the issue with no success. The Nevada constitution already includes provisions on marijuana, mining taxes and lotteries, he noted. “I don’t know what the heartburn is with putting economic freedom and economic liberty in the state constitution. In fact, half of the original 13 colonies put economic freedom in their constitutions,” said Griffin. “This is nothing foreign to the United States Constitution or the state of Nevada’s constitution.” Read all of our coverage on 2016 ballot measures at governing.com/ballotmeasures.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 7, 2016 3:00 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Retail IT IT Management E-commerce Comments As we start the sprint to this year's holiday shopping season, I had hoped to start to see the disappearance of the store-centric mentality that has hurt so much of retail for years. This is best illustrated by complaints — from the likes of Target, Walmart and Home Depot — that they are being victimized by showrooming with Amazon. It was a bogus argument from the start. I mention this disheartening thought because I just tried — unsuccessfully — to give money to Home Depot, only to have Home Depot's store-centric — not even chain-store-centric but individual store-centric — mentality drove me into the waiting HTML arms of Amazon. This time, I really was determined to buy the item from Home Depot, but Home Depot's suicidal store-centric policies defeated me. And now, my tale. This weekend, I needed a new doorbell chime. (Who knew that they don't last forever?) It had very precise specs for a digital doorbell. Because I was working with a contractor from Home Depot, I wanted to get the chime from Home Depot. Best of all, there are several Home Depots near me, and the item is carried by the chain. In researching the product, I found that Amazon offered it for a few dollars less than Home Depot (and, as a Prime Member, I would get free shipping). Still, I wanted to get it from Home Depot. This was Home Depot's sale to lose — and it managed to do exactly that. I quickly found the item on the Home Depot website. Even better, the page volunteered that this product was in stock in more than 200 stores. So far, so good. The site, bizarrely, had set as my local Home Depot store a location that was quite far from me. If I had never visited Home Depot's site, this would be excusable, because using IP address to guess location is far from precise. The reality, though, is that I have made multiple buy-online-pickup-in-store purchases from Home Depot, and I routinely have to change my "local store" to the store actually closest. Ever heard of cookies, Home Depot? But this a minor matter. I changed to my actual local store and proceeded to check availability. None. Oh, well. It was a Sunday and I had some time. I would drive to a different Home Depot. I asked the site for the next closest. No stock. OK, how about the third closest? No stock. I went through six stores — none of them had stock, but the site kept bragging that it was in stock in more than 200 stores. Instead of forcing me through this sadistic guessing game, why didn't the site simply let me see the nearest stores where the item actually is in stock? It's certainly not because Home Depot's e-commerce team never thought of this. It's because Home Depot is not merely being store-centric, but  focusing on individual stores. The managers at specific stores want to tell you if a desired item is there. But if it's not, they'd rather sell you something similar. They would much prefer that than sending you to another store manager's turf, where you may also make a lot of other purchases. A Home Depot executive once told me how customer-centric the chain now is. He must have been sarcastic. After all this, I toyed with having it shipped, but the shipping from HomeDepot.com took far longer than Amazon and it cost more. I then went back to Amazon, with its lower price and free shipping, which said that it would have it to me by the next morning. I truly started out this chime-time aggressively planning on giving my money to Home Depot. This was not a sale that Amazon won. It was a sale that Home Depot went out of its way to lose.

Contact Us Newsletters Sales: 1-800-405-0844 Articles Customer Stories Why eMarketer Plans Product Tour Research Topics Mobile Payments in the US Growing Fast, but Still Far from Mass Adoption Fewer than 20% of smartphone users use proximity mobile payments this year, but mobile peer-to-peer payments are growing November 7, 2016 | Retail & Ecommerce | Mobile Share Email Print Despite double-digit growth this year and next, Americans’ use of mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, as well as branded apps that include mobile wallets like the Starbucks app, Walmart Pay and CVS Pay, will not reach mass adoption in the foreseeable future. This year, 38.4 million Americans 14 and over will have used their mobile phones to pay at the point of sale at least once in the preceding six months. That’s just 19.4% of US smartphone users. By 2020, that figure will grow to 33.1% of smartphone users. “There are several reasons why US consumers aren’t yet making proximity payments en masse,” said eMarketer analyst Bryan Yeager. “There are still concerns about security, a patchwork of merchant acceptance, and a lack of perceived value in replacing the use of cash or card with the tap or scan of a smartphone. Nonetheless, eMarketer expects those issues to be addressed over the next several years, which will help propel growth.” Proximity mobile payment users in the US skew young, with 11.9 million in the 25-to-34 age group in 2016—31.1% of the total. By 2020, this group will exceed 21 million, though its share will decrease to 27.8% as older consumers start paying at the point of sale with their phones. In 2017, close to 55% of all US proximity mobile payment users will be under 35, and more than three-quarters will be under 45. This year, proximity mobile payment transactions will grow 183.3% to $27.67 billion. That figure will more than double next year to reach $62.49 billion. By 2020, proximity mobile payment transactions are expected to equal $314.13 billion. “More than 90% of US retail sales ($4.45 trillion) will occur in traditional contexts like brick-and-mortar stores this year, which is where consumers primarily make proximity payments,” said Yeager. “Increasing acceptance of proximity payments at a wider array of merchants is pushing average spend via such methods higher, which helps explain why transaction value is growing far faster than the number of users.” Mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) payment apps, such as Venmo and Square Cash, have been more widely adopted by US consumers than proximity mobile payments. eMarketer defines a mobile phone P2P payment as a transaction made between two individuals using a mobile phone as a payment method via mobile browsers and mobile apps. This year, 45.8 million US adults—nearly one-quarter of US adult smartphone users—will use a P2P payment app at least once per month. That figure will exceed one-third by 2018. The value of P2P mobile phone transactions will total $59.42 billion this year, with that figure growing to $92.10 billion by next year.

Saimin (Blog) - November 7, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail This is the time of year when everyone is waiting for good deals but few other important questions remain uncovered.

Although it mainly features his work experience in WWE, the recent episode disclosed a bizarre Halloween experience of the ‘Human Wrecking Ball’. During his WWE tenure, Ryback was once invited to a Halloween party hosted by the real life brothers, Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas. The only condition was for every guest to attend wearing a costume. In order to find something suitable, Reeves decided to visit a local Wal-Mart. Not to his surprise, it was packed with John Cena merchandise and costumes. Reeves had no other choice but to buy one for himself.  Although he couldn’t recollect most of the events of that night, Reeves remembers the moment when he was watching TV in Bray’s bedroom after taking what he believes were ‘mushrooms’ as his state of mind was altered and he had never felt that way before. Wyatt was amused to witness Ryback, under the influence of mushrooms laughing without any reason. Moreover, on the same night, under the influence of mushrooms, Reeves confessed his love for Wyatt’s wife, which everyone seemed to have laughed off.  The former Intercontinental Champion affirmed that such kind of behaviour was an anomaly: “What happened the rest of that night is so outside of how I normally am. I can’t explain.” Till date, both of them cherish those incidents whenever they meet. Apart from the awkward party story, Reeves also praised the in-ring work of the two brothers. During this edition of the podcast, he stated : “Bray was awesome. He just kind of came in there, and, like, you could just tell this guy was going to be a star, just his promos and there was just something. Him and Bo both.” Ryback, Big Show and Kane were involved in an angle with the Wyatt Family earlier this year. That feud culminated with another ‘heel’ turn of the Big Guy. Within a few months, Ryback and the WWE ended up parting ways.

Gateway Dr. in Marion, Iowa on Nov. 1, 2016. Municipal and economic development leaders are exploring the possibility of expanding public transit services east to encompass this area. (Lynda Waddington/The Gazette) Lynda Waddington The Gazette More stories from Lynda Nov 6, 2016 at 11:00 am | Print View City Manager Lon Pluckhahn and Marion Economic Development Corporation President Nick Glew made the pitch to Cedar Rapids Transit: Expand public transit services farther east, across Highway 13, to the police station and 184-acre business park known as the Marion Enterprise Center. Brad DeBrower, CR Transit manager, answered that call, providing statistics and options to the Marion City Council. One clearly rose above the rest. Marion can expand access and give current riders a convenience boost with a new “circulator” route. With this option, Marion would have a transit bus looping the city throughout the day. Riders would connect with other routes through a hub at Lindale Mall. Current service has two routes — 5N and 5S — that travel between Marion and the transit hub in downtown Cedar Rapids. As their names suggest, one route serves northern portions of Marion, the other serves southern portions. It may seem counterintuitive that a reduction of buses in Marion would be better. But the circulator route would offer a larger service area and save riders time. For instance, Ann Roberts, who I met last spring, is an older Marion resident with mobility challenges who needs accessible bus stops near her destination. Because existing routes loop between Cedar Rapids and Marion, Roberts has a short ride to a stop near the Marion Library, but the return trip is nearly the full route. Each trip to the library requires an extra hour that’s spent simply riding the bus. Transit staff looked at a week’s worth of 5N and 5S data — every trip, every passenger — to explore the possibility of Marion’s requested expansion. They learned most stops are regularly used, and that Marion has three hot spots — apartments along 10th Street near the Linn-Mar campus; apartments at the other end of town near Grand Avenue; and Walmart. “Neither route can absorb additional service without negatively impacting service,” DeBrower said. “We’ve kind of stretched these rubber bands as far as we can without really having to do something differently.” In other words, an expansion requires a trade off. And, except for the circulator, the trade offs would negatively impact current riders. Marion could, for example, extend one route east of Highway 13, keeping service otherwise limited to Seventh Avenue. This would become the only route to the popular Walmart stop. The other route would enter Marion and loop between the popular northern and southern stops at the apartment complexes. DeBrower would like to see this loop travel as far east as 35th Street, but he can’t guarantee it. He’d also like the two routes to intersect at least once so that riders could wait at a shared stop for the bus going east to Walmart. Even so, if the routes don’t intersect twice, riders would be in a worse situation than now — waiting for the intersecting route to go further east, then either riding to Lindale Mall (where they’ll wait again) or the Cedar Rapids hub. Unfortunately, council members seemed drawn to this frustrating option because it could be done at no additional cost. The best option for transit riders, the circulator, has an additional price tag of $167,000 a year. Nevermind that the cost could easily be met with an increase of Marion’s existing 15-cent transit levy rate, which is far less than what’s assessed by other similarly sized Iowa communities. (Clinton is at 69 cents, Fort Dodge at 43 and Ottumwa at 71.) The business park that city and economic development leaders hope to connect to transit was made possible, at least in part, by $3.2 million in city funds. And tax increment financing was used to develop water, sewer, roads and storm sewers, establishing the now “shovel-ready” lots. No doubt public transit access would give the Marion Enterprise Center a marketing boost, but such benefits can’t come at the expense of residents who depend on transit services. Cedar Rapids residents have carried more than their fair share of public transit’s cost. Even with state and federal subsidies, Marion’s yearly contribution has fallen about $100,000 short. Future budgets include increases to address this disparity. But if the city believes public transit is important enough to expand, then it’s valuable enough to justify an investment.

Fielder is the president and founder of Cozy CoverZzz, a club that makes blankets for children in hospitals, homeless shelters and domestic abuse shelters, Fielder said. “They’re like kid-themed blankets with patterns and colors and animals or sports or whatever ones we buy,” she said. Fielder said she got the idea for the club when she participated in SPARTANS WILL. POWER Global Day of Service last year. For the service day, Fielder and a friend went to Grand Rapids to make blankets for kids in hospitals. When she returned to MSU, she checked to see if there was an organization that did something similar on campus, but said she didn’t see one.  Fielder decided to start Cozy CoverZzz, whose name was inspired from the sleeping face emoji, she said. Human biology sophomore Vito Vitale is another member of Cozy CoverZzz. He said Fielder encouraged him to join the club during one of their classes together.  “She was just extremely passionate about it,” Vitale said. “It was a great idea. Once she explained it to me I was all for it, and I knew eventually a lot of other people would join, too.”  Although turnout for the club was low at the first meeting on Oct. 5, both Fielder and Vitale said the numbers grew exponentially for the second meeting. Membership dues for the club are $10 and students have two weeks in between meetings to produce at least one blanket, Fielder and Vitale said. So far, Vitale has made four blankets for the club. During Halloween weekend, he and his roommates, who are also in the club, put on a scary movie and each cranked out a blanket, he said. The materials for the blankets come from Wal-Mart, as it’s generally cheaper than Michaels or Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, Fielder said. She usually gets 30-35 blankets to pass out at their meetings. Instead of using two blankets to produce a single tie blanket, they only cut and tie one so they make twice as many, Fielder said. Vitale likes to go with designs he thinks will resonate with kids more. When making the blanket, it’s hard to keep the ties at the end even. He described tying the blanket as being similar to tying a water balloon and said the first blanket was rough to make, but was worth it. “I feel like there’s not a lot of opportunities where we actually get to give back,” he said. “I guess a lot of clubs are just like resume boosters and people just join like, ‘yeah I don’t really know what I do.’ But you go to a fundraiser every now and again. I guess it helps but here you actually get to see the difference that you’re making. You make the blankets for the kids in the hospital then you can come to the hospital, and actually drop them off.” Sherri Szilagyi, Women and Children’s Shelter manager for City Rescue Mission of Lansing, said when organizations like Cozy CoverZzz drop off blankets to her shelter, they get added to the blanket supply and are given on an as-needed basis. This is to make sure the shelter is being a good steward of the donations it receives.  Some people are overwhelmed at first when they come to the shelter and are in need of many things. After becoming acclimated with their new environment, guests are able to appreciate donations like those made by Cozy CoverZzz, Szilagyi said. “Once here and settled, many guests will share their happiness with their accommodations and care, which includes the nice, warm blankets,” she said. “They are greatly appreciated by our guests and guests are grateful to be able to take the blankets with them when they leave for their new place.” Although they were unable to meet with the children they donated the blankets to at the City Rescue Mission of Lansing, Vitale said as the club donates to more places they will be able to see the difference they are making. Fielder said for Cozy CoverZzz meetings, students can stay just long enough to gather the supplies to make their blankets or they can stay and make a blanket there. The time it takes to make a blanket depends on the person making it, as Fielder said it takes her between 30 and 45 minutes to make a blanket while Vitale said it takes him around an hour. The next meeting will be Nov. 16, Fielder said. Fielder said that she is very thankful to the Associated Students of Michigan State University, or ASMSU, for funding Cozy CoverZzz for the semester and the club is always looking for new members. “It’s really easy and it’s fun and it’s not a big time commitment,” she said. “You can give an hour out of two weeks to help a little kid.”  Want more articles like this?

Done Editing Tags 94 Comments Share this article 89 89 89 Massachusetts is in the middle of its most expensive ballot measure fight ever—over the expansion of charter schools. Dark money has poured in from outside the state pushing a yes vote on Question 2, which would dramatically increase the number of new charter schools allowed each year, while unions in the state and the national unions they’re affiliated with have had to spend millions fighting back. More than 200 local school committees and 30 mayors have opposed Question 2. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is opposed. So is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. So what’s it all about? Charter school advocates like to frame their position as being somehow about civil rights, but let’s put it this way: you’ve got the Walmart Waltons pouring millions into charter expansion vs. the NAACP and the Movement for Black Lives opposing it. Juan Cofield, president of the New England Area Conference of the NAACP, is a leader in the fight against Question 2. He writes that Massachusetts charter schools: … don't serve students with serious special needs. They are not accountable to the local taxpayers who must pay for them. And many charter schools have been cited by the state for using hyper-disciplinary policies that target black and disabled students at shockingly disproportionate rates. You won't hear these facts from the billionaire backers of Question 2, who have a long history of claiming charter schools will "save" poor students of color, in an obvious effort to appeal to white progressives. Yes, there are individual schools that are falling short, and we must invest in them. What we must not do is allow 2016 to go down in history as the year Massachusetts cemented into law a separate and inherently unequal school system. If Question 2 passes, it will perpetuate de facto segregation by siphoning vital public education funds off to privately-run schools that only educate a select group of students. When he talks about siphoning funds, he’s not kidding. Question 2 would threaten bond ratings for Boston and three other cities, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Why is that? Nancy Grossman, a municipal treasurer, explains how this siphoning works: For simplicity’s sake, imagine a neighborhood school with 1,000 students and a $15,000,000 budget, or $15,000 per child. Assume that a very conservative one-third of this budget might go to relatively fixed costs for maintenance, debt service, basic administration, custodial staff and other costs that don’t vary significantly with student population. Thus, $5 million goes to fixed costs, $10 million to variable expenses such as instructional costs — $10,000 per child. If 200 students “choice-out” for charter schools and take with them perhaps $13,000 each (factoring in temporary state tuition offsets which this year average just 11 percent of assessed tuition) or $2.6 million, that leaves $12.4 million to run the school. Five million is still needed for fixed costs; $7.4 million is left for instructional needs. Dividing this amount by the 800 remaining students equals $9,250 left for instructional needs and other non-fixed costs, or $750 less per student. And, since charters educate proportionally fewer special-needs children, district schools shoulder a higher percentage of costs to educate these kids, but with fewer dollars per child available to do so. Author and former teacher Jonathan Kozol argues that the siphoning goes beyond dollars: … an even greater loss may be the draining-off of parents who no longer have a stake in advocating for the schools from which they’ve chosen to depart. Their advocacy efforts take place in a new and more select domain from that moment on. Who will stand up for the children at the schools they’ve left behind? Slice it any way you want. Argue, as we must, that every family ought to have the right to make whatever choice they like in the interests of their child, no matter what damage it may do to other people’s children. As an individual decision, it’s absolutely human; but setting up this kind of competition, in which parents with the greatest social capital are encouraged to abandon their most vulnerable neighbors, is rotten social policy. What this represents is a state-supported shriveling of civic virtue, a narrowing of moral obligation to the smallest possible parameters. It isn’t good for Massachusetts, and it’s not good for democracy. It’s significant that this fight is happening in one of the states with the very best public schools in the country—if opponents of public education can win in Massachusetts, it will be that much harder to fight back elsewhere. If you’re a Massachusetts voter, please vote no on Question 2.

Photo: Trae Patton/NBC Superstore Thursday, 8:30 p.m., NBC Trigger warning, retail clerks: Thursday’s fall finale of “Superstore” could induce pre-traumatic stress disorder. In the second of two back-to-back holiday episodes (the first airs at 8 p.m.), the Cloud 9 employees put on a hell of a Black Friday display to kick off the holiday shopping season. On Black Friday, a potluck for staff members before the big-box store opens results in rampant food poisoning, including Amy (America Ferrera) and Jonah (Ben Feldman). They fight over bathroom-stall access while powering through a long shift that features door-busting by early-arriving customers. Amid the havoc, Amy confronts her troubled relationship with her husband, Adam (Ryan Gaul), while the will-they-or-won’t-they flame heats up between her and Jonah, despite the insalubrious conditions. Some Cloud 9 employees fare better than others — and there are significant cliffhangers. (“Superstore” returns at 8 p.m. Jan. 5.) The Post recently spoke with creator and executive producer Justin Spitzer, who said upwards of 100 extras were brought in daily to play store customers for the five-day shoot, which took place last month at Universal Studios in LA. What is your goal with this episode? If you go onto YouTube and look up Target, Kmart or Walmart on Black Friday, what you see is so crazy it feels like you’re watching a [TV] show. We just wanted to hit the chaos as much as possible. Where did the food-poisoning storyline come from? A lot of these stores provide meals to employees because it’s such a big day. To make the chaos of Black Friday pay off, we thought, “What’s the worst thing that could happen on the busiest day of the year?” And that’s one of them. Amy (America Ferrera) and Adam (Ryan Gaul) may be at a crossroads on “Superstore.”Photo: Bill Inoshita/NBC Do you feel bad for retailers who have to work Black Friday, much less Thanksgiving Day? [laughs] Of course; it’s got to be terrible. That’s an incredibly, incredibly difficult job, especially on that day. Sometimes they’ll get time-and-a-half, so there’s some compensation — but I don’t think anybody enjoys that experience. On top of all the mayhem at the store, Amy also has a pregnancy scare. Why did you include that? We wanted to use the scare as a catalyst for her to take some action in her marriage. She’s known in the back of her head that things aren’t great with Adam. But when you’re working all the time and with the day-to-day grind, sometimes you don’t act on those things. Any particular Black Friday moments that you think worked best? We have a somewhat emotional scene between Jonah and Amy while they’re sitting in side-by-side toilets. I’m pretty happy about the fact that we managed to do that. And I don’t know how much credit I can take for it, but America [Amy] at the end talking to her husband gave me goose bumps on set and when I watched it. — Eric Hegedüs And here’s what else to watch this week: Great Performances: Gypsy Friday, 9 p.m., PBS “Gypsy” has been revived countless times, but there was something extra special about the 2015 London production with Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (“Vera Drake”), who played Mama Rose. She won the Olivier Award for her performance. With Lara Pulver.

By: Elizabeth Cameron For Metro Published on The sixth annual “Stuff this Truck” food drive for the Veterans Food Bank transformed the parking lots of the Royal Oak and 130 Avenue Walmarts into donation centres this weekend. The goal? Beat last year’s haul of eight full-sized skids. “The number of hampers we require this year has almost doubled from last year, so any help we can get it appreciated,” said John Sereda, a veteran and volunteer with the food drive organized by the Canadian Army Veterans Motorcycle Units. Sereda said Alberta’s economy is a factor in the huge increase. “We’re seeing an increased number of vets suffering from PTSD, or having a hard time adjusting after they leave the service,” he said. “We have some veterans from Afghanistan, and some going back to the Second World War, so there are a lot of people who need our support.” The Veterans Food Bank is looking for donations of non-perishable goods, cash, and toiletries. “Any items you would need, veterans could use them as well,” Sereda said. “I think we could always do more for our veterans, but the support we are seeing in Calgary has been quite phenomenal,” he added. Volunteers will be at the South Trail Crossing Walmart (130 Avenue) until 5 p.m. Sunday.

Samsung has been going through a rough patch lately. 2016 has not been kind to Samsung. The year started off well with great Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Reviews. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Sales were going great however things turned sour when Samsung faced a twice –over recall and discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung now faces another recall. This time it is a Samsung washing machine. Samsung is issuing a recall of 2.8 million washing machines. It has been proven that these machines are defected. It is possible that a portion of the machine may detach while in use. This is very hazardous. It may cause potential injury due to the explosion risk. Given Samsung’s current customer relations this recall is not good at all. Almost 733 reports have been received by Samsung which faced the issue. Nine out of these machines also caused injury. Samsung has given two options in this scenario in a press release. One can just hope this recall does not cause more damage to the company than the Galaxy Note 7.

Maine liberals move on after megadonor's exit By MARINA VILLENEUVE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story AUGUSTA, Maine The loss of a liberal megadonor's millions of dollars in contributions this election season led Maine Democrats fighting to regain control of the state Senate to increasingly lean on a national Democratic Party group targeting state races in the state legislature where Republicans control the Senate and Democrats the House. Maine Democrats' $2 million push to pick up at least three Senate seats in rural districts comes as the independent-minded New England state is becoming less reliably blue. Billionaire hedge fund manager S. Donald Sussman once provided $1 out of every $7 raised by Maine's Democratic Party and its House and Senate campaign committees. But his donations have dried up since he and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree announced last year that they were divorcing. "Any time you lose a donor of that magnitude, it's a big deal, especially in a state such as Maine," said Mark Brewer, University of Maine political science professor. As Sussman turns his attention to the presidential race, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, a national committee that offers financial assistance to state leaders and candidates, has stepped in by contributing $1.5 million this election cycle to Maine's Democratic Party and House and Senate campaign committees — double what it gave in 2012. The Washington, D.C.-based group — financed by unions, Wal-Mart and pharmaceutical companies — says Democrats have a good shot at five seats in areas where President Barack Obama received at least 55 percent of the vote in 2012. "GOP Gov. Paul LePage's bigoted, racially charged comments and erratic behavior have damaged the Republican brand in the state," reads the website of the group, which didn't respond to a request for comment. State campaign finance reports show political groups have spent $2 million on independent expenditures in state Senate races, with $1.5 million spent on races for seven Republican-controlled seats outside the Democrats' stronghold in southern Maine. Sussman, who once owned Maine's largest media company, has gained prominence as one of the nation's most prolific donors to progressive politicians, political groups and causes, with tens of millions in reported donations to national and Maine politics since 2008. He is a registered voter in Florida, from where he has supported dozens of Democratic congressional candidates and reportedly donated $21 million to the Democratic Party's pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. "It's very odd to be giving millions when your objective is to actually get the money out of politics," he told The Washington Post last month. Sussman, whose divorce to Pingree became final this summer, didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. Between 2008 and 2014, Sussman gave $2.1 million to Maine Democrats and another $3.2 million to political action committees supporting causes like same-sex marriage and more funding for Maine public schools. But even though Sussman's name isn't appearing on state campaign finance reports, his money is finding its way to Maine politics in other ways. He gave the maximum $2,700 contribution to Pingree and Democratic congressional candidate Emily Cain for their primary fights, and has contributed $7.9 million to House Majority PAC, which has announced spending $1.6 million in Maine TV ads attacking Cain's opponent, Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin. Jason Savage, executive director of the Maine Republican Party, said he supports political donors' free speech rights, but finds it hypocritical when Democrats don't denounce big out-of-state checks from one-percenters. "He became a significant liability to Democrats," Savage said, adding that Democrats used Sussman's checkbook for "ridiculous" attack ads that didn't help Democrats win the governor's seat or keep the Maine Senate. Even without Sussman's contributions, Maine Democrats have outraised Maine Republicans 2-1 this year, according to state reports. Maine Democratic groups reported raising $5.2 million so far this year, just about the amount reported by this point during the Democrat's unsuccessful 2014 fight to unseat LePage. Savage said he's proud the GOP spends less money in more targeted ways. Maine Republican groups have gotten an $180,000 boost from the Virginia-based Republican State Leadership Committee, and $190,000 from LePage's political group ICE PAC to help the GOP support candidates. ICE PAC has also reported spending $25,363 to support Republican senatorial candidate Ricky Long, who is running against former Democratic Attorney General Michael Carpenter.

We have all the major highlights together in one place so you can quickly catch up on all that's been going on. One of the biggest highlights of the week was perhaps the launch of the Xiaomi Redmi 4; it was launched alongside the premium variant the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime, and a budget variant, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A. If phones are not your thing, then you might be more interested in the fact that Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare - which will very likely be the top selling game of the year - is now available to buy worldwide. Wondering if you should buy the game? Check out our Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare review to help you decide.(Also see: Everything You Need to Know About Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare) Then of course, there was crazy news like the man who legally changed his name to "iPhone Sim" (Ukranian for "iPhone 7"), in order to get a free iPhone 7 that was offered by an electronics store. In case you're wondering, Sim says that he's going to keep the name even now after getting the phone; though he might change it back once he has children. That's not the craziest thing someone has done for an iPhone over the years, and his family seems to be supportive of the decision for now. Meanwhile, other than launching the new MacBook Pros, Apple has jacked up the prices of the MacBook by up to Rs. 10,000 in India, though prices for other Macs remain unchanged. (Also see: Five Best Camera Phones Under Rs. 30,000) There were also a lot of launches that took place over the last week. We saw the launch of the Huawei Mate 9, which comes with a Leica dual-lens camera, and comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, a 5.9-inch screen, and a 20-megapixel camera. It also launched the limited edition Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9, with a EUR 1,395 (roughly Rs. 1,03,000) price tag. Aside from the phones, Huawei also launched the Huawei Fit activity tracker with a heart rate monitor. Samsung also announced a phone that really stands out this week - it launched a flip phone, the Samsung W2017, which has dual full-HD displays, and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. The premium phone's pricing has not been announced yet, but last year's version, the Samsung W2016, was sold at CNY 9,999 (roughly Rs. 98,700). At the other end of the spectrum, ZTE also launched an Android flip-phone, the ZTE CYMBAL-T, but this is strictly a budget affair, with a single 3.5-inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 SoC. Launched in the US market, the phone is priced at $99.95 (roughly Rs. 6,700), and available in Wal-Mart stores. Other launches this week included the Alcatel Idol 4S (Windows 10) smartphone, which is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. As the name implies, the phone runs Windows 10 Mobile. Meizu launched two phones this week, the Meizo Pro 6s with a 12-megapixel camera, and the Meizu M5, which has VoLTE support and a 13-megapixel camera. The Intex Aqua Power M with a 4350mAh battery was launched, as was the Micromax Canvas Spark 4G with VoLTE support. We also saw two new tablets launched, the Lava Ivory Pop with a 7-inch display, and voice calling support; and the iBall Slide Brace X1, with 4G voice calling support. (Also see: iPhone 8, Galaxy S8, and Other Phones to Look Forward To) Meanwhile, Samsung's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad year continues, with the recall of 2.8 million washing machines in the US. The top of the machines can unexpectedly detach from the chassis during use, and Samsung has received nine reports of injuries, including a broken jaw. Between this and the Galaxy Note 7, well, it's going to take some courage to shop from Samsung. Railways booking platform IRCTC continues to add more partners for its online payments, and now apart from paying via netbanking, credit cards, and other wallets, users can opt to pay directly from their MobilKwik wallet while booking tatkal tickets. Google is also looking for simpler ways to get people to pay - this week it announced Google Play subscription promos, which will allow developers to entice customers with an introductory offer on subscription for a limited time. According to Google, subscriptions are the fastest growing business model on Play, with consumers spending on subscriptions increasing 10 times over the last 3 years. There was also some news that is bound to please Indian readers - Netflix is considering an offline mode, the company's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in an interview. For people in developing countries with poor Internet connectivity this could be a very helpful feature, and even for people who live in conditions with good connections, it could be useful in scenarios such as flights, where you could queue up videos for entertainment. Also, architecture and interior design platform Houzz launched in India - it now has a presence in 15 countries.s This week, in an interview Steve Ballmer, the previous CEO of Microsoft, also talked about how smartphones broke his relationship with the company's founder (and previous CEO) Bill Gates. Meanwhile, Twitter, which continues to face a lot of pressure, also lost two very senior executives in the India/ South East Asia region. India Head Rishi Jaitly announced his exit on Monday, while South East Asia and India Managing Director Parminder Singh left on Thursday. By the way, in case you were wondering, Reliance Jio and its relations with the other telcos remains in the news.This week, Airtel announced that it's providing another 7,000 points of interconnect to Reliance Jio - whether this will help interconnectivity between the networks remains to be seen, though in our experience, there are still a lot of problems when calling other networks from Jio. Airtel also said that it might bring in price drops, but will not offer Jio-like free calls. And finally, apart from the Call of Duty release, there was a lot more from the world of gaming this week. It was the end of an era, as Nintendo ended Wii U production this week, even as the curtains were lifted on Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro console, including the launch lineup of games for the beefed-up variant of the PlayStation 4. (Also see: PS4 Pro Unboxing: Here's What to Expect) Meanwhile on Friday Blizzcon kicked off, and the World of Warcraft maker had a lot to show. Some of the biggest highlights included the fact that Blizzard and Google Deepmind are going to use Starcraft II for AI research. It also revealed that it's going to bring the much-demanded Necromancer to Diablo 3 as DLC, nearly 5 years after the game initially launched. In case that wasn't enough, Blizzard also revealed that the original Diablo will be made playable in Diablo 3, as part of a free content patch for people who already bought the Reaper of Souls DLC. There will be special graphic filters to make the game pixelated and grainy just as it was in its original 1996 release.

Follow @pinknews News News Home UK US World Trans Politics Education Law Religion Business Entertainment Trans Opinion Travel Life Life Home Health Sport About Advertise Contact Privacy RSS Search Home UK US World Current Affairs Entertainment Opinion Travel Features Trans Current Affairs Comedian Dave Chappelle slammed LGBT and women’s rights activists Meka Beresford, PinkNews 6th November 2016, 2:17 PM Comedian Dave Chappelle attacked LGBT and women’s rights activists in a set on Friday. Performing at the Cutting Room in New York Chappelle revealed his support for republican runner Donald Trump and criticised the opposition, Hillary Clinton. According to the Observer, Chappelle made misguided comments about LGBT and women’s rights. Speaking about activists, he said: “They should not be having that conversation in front of black people. You go ahead and feel something about your rights. But if you’re putting sexism and homophobia and transphobia in front of racism, you should be ashamed of yourself.” Chappelle attacked the controversial bathroom bill, which restricts people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, and instead demands they use the bathroom of the sex they were assigned at birth. “If you need to show your birth certificate to take a dump at a Wal-Mart in North Carolina, that’s insane,” he said. Chappelle counteracted this as he said he would not want to use a urinal next to a “woman with a dick.” The comedian went on to discuss the ‘pussy grabbing’ tapes that were leaked recently. “What I heard on that tape was gross,” Chappelle said. “But the way I got to hear it was even more gross. You know that came directly from Hillary.” Chappelle denied that Trump was talking about sexual assault. “Sexual assault? It wasn’t. ‘And when you’re a star, they let you do it.’ That phrase implies consent. I just don’t like the way the media twisted that whole thing. Nobody questioned it.” He confirmed he would vote for Hillary Clinton despite supporting Trump. However, he felt his vote would be wasted and likened it to sleeping with Halle Berry and having her fart in his face. “I’m still going to go for it, but I wish she hadn’t done that thing,” he said. He went on to praise Trump’s “resilience” and demeanour during the second presidential debate. “Something about this was backward,” Chappelle said. “A gay white man and a white woman asking a multibillionaire how he knows the system is rigged and insisting it’s not. Does that sound right to you? It didn’t seem right to me. “And here’s how you know Trump is the most gangsta candidate ever. They asked him how he knows the system is rigged and he said, ‘Because I take advantage of it.’ He may as well have flashed his membership card for the Illuminati right then.” 25 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous story North Carolina lawmaker comes out as bisexual after homophobic attack Next story Pakistani woman files petition in court to seek gender reassignment surgery More like this Hillary Clinton vows to be an ally to LGBT community in the White House if elected US Election 2016: LGBTQ candidates to watch out for RuPaul’s Drag Race judge: ‘Clintons are paedophiles, Obamas are murderers’ Sir Elton John: We have to make sure that love trumps hate Neil Patrick Harris isn’t looking his prettiest in the ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ teaser LGBT people quote Trump’s craziest phrases in hilarious new video Christian activist: Vote Trump, or Hillary Clinton might force kids to have gay sex Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos burns Pride flag in vile election ad More: LGBT Hillary Clinton Trump comedian activists presidential election Dave Chappelle ST Test Trending Trending Now Christian marriage blogger announces she is dating soccer star Abby Wambach Sainsbury’s Christmas ad casually features a same-sex couple for a second year in a row 17 Biden and Obama memes that will make your week better Pro-Republican ad depicts little girl getting raped because of transgender equality Trending Christian marriage blogger announces she is dating soccer star Abby Wambach Sainsbury’s Christmas ad casually features a same-sex couple for a second year in a row 17 Biden and Obama memes that will make your week better Pro-Republican ad depicts little girl getting raped because of transgender equality Latest stories Comment: Why we need to engage with Trump supporters on issues of equality Robbie Williams thought he was gay but “just couldn’t do the cock” Mayor drawn into controversy over post calling Michelle Obama an ‘ape in heels’ Tinder introduces genderfluid, transgender-inclusive options Is a drag queen mayor about to be the next Secretary of State?

Weekly Newspaper Museum Online Newspaper (E-Edition) Simple battery reported on Country Lane Posted by Staff Writer in Public Safety Sunday, November 6. 2016 Comments (0) Simple battery and criminal trespass were reported on Country Lane recently. Deputy Chad Parr went to a home there and met with a grandfather who said his granddaughters had been fighting. Par interviewed the granddaughters and one of them told him that the other came into her room and wanted to know where all her stuff was. She said she told her she didn’t know, but she needed to get it and “get out of the house.” That when she said the other girl hit her in the head with her fist. The other girl then left with in a car with a male and female. Their grandfather said after they stopped fighting, the one who hit the other went outside and starting kicking the back door. He said she may also be on methamphetamine. Both were explained the TPO and two-part affidavit process. Other incidents on file at the sheriff’s office recently included: •Identity fraud was reported by someone on Whitsel Road. A man told Deputy Gabe Martin that he had purchased a firearm about two weeks prior from a gun shop in Winterville and about three hours after buying the gun, he received a text from a bank stating that someone had attempted to open accounts in his name at various places, including JC Penny, Zales, Best Buy and Walmart. •Identity fraud was reported in Madison Hills. A man there said he had received a $1,500 bill for a credit card in his deceased wife’s name from an auto store in Charlotte NC. He said a purchase was made on the card on Sept. 22 and his wife passed away a few days earlier. The store told him he needed to file a police report to have the bill canceled. •Simple battery was reported on Hwy. 29 North near Mason Mill Road. Deputy Austin Dean Blake and Cpl. Shawn Rhoades responded to a suspicious female waking south near Mason Mill Road. While in route we were flagged down by a man in a vehicle at Superior Trailers who had called in the woman. The complainant said he picked up the woman and was giving her a ride to the DFACS office in Danielsville. He stated he and a passenger spotted the female while they were driving down the highway. They passed a white SUV going about 60 miles per hour with the door open and witnessed a white female in the passenger seat struggling with the driver. The complainant stated that when they passed the vehicle he observed the driver pulling the woman by the hair as she struggled to get away from him. Blake then spoke to the victim, who told him that she and the driver were going down Hwy. 29 near Jones Chapel when they began to argue and she told him to stop so she could get out. At that point, she said he became physically abusive and grabbed her by the arm and hair to keep her from getting out of the SUV. He finally stopped so she could get out. She said she didn’t want to press charges. Sae said they do not live together but have been dating for three years. She also said he has been arrested previously for physical abuse against her.

Download The Definitive Guide to API Integrations to start building an API strategy. JavaScript's recent rise in popularity calls attention to platforms such as Node.js, which offers a revolutionary take on the role of JavaScript on the web. By now, it's clear that Node.js is a valuable tool for those who care about the future of web development. Why Care About Node.js? Developers Embrace Node.js for a Number of Reasons, Including: Better performance. PayPal, one of the major early adopters of Node.js, noticed that when compared with a similar Java framework using Spring, Node.js showed a 35% average decrease in response time when delivering pages to the end user. Other companies have noted comparable improvements. Better time to market. Node.js is a lightweight, flexible tool with a smaller CPU footprint, fewer files and lines of code, and no compilation required. This lets you write, test, and deploy your code quicker and easier than with alternatives like Java, PHP, and Ruby. Strong user community. Dozens of major companies, from Yahoo and Netflix to Walmart and Microsoft, have adopted Node. In 2015, more than 120 of the Fortune 500 companies used Node.js internally. This corporate support caused interest in Node.js to skyrocket among both developers and hiring managers. Check out Cloud Elements Developer community How to Integrate Node.js Into Your Stack Even if you're already using technologies like Java and PHP, you can integrate Node.js into your tech stack using various APIs developed by the Node.js community. For example, Node.js and Java can work together using the node-java API and you can run Node.js web applications on a PHP server using Node.php. If you're merely curious about trying Node.js, there are a number of internet tutorials that will walk you through topics such as creating a REST API with Node.js and integrating Node.js into various platforms. How Node.js Benefits Your Business Some businesses that switched to Node.js have written extensively about the positive effects for users. For example, Groupon reported that its page load times were cut in half after moving from Ruby on Rails to Node.js. Additionally, when Walmart launched its new Node.js system on Black Friday of 2013, servers remained online and CPU utilization never went above 1 percent. Adopting Node.js benefits your product and app development teams, as well as potential hires. As a fresh, interesting technology, Node.js helps motivate developers, making them more productive and challenging them intellectually. Jeff Harrel, director of user interface engineering at PayPal, said: "Since PayPal has adopted Node, I’ve been told countless times from engineers in passing that they are energized by their job again and excited to be adopting a modern technology to build our future."

Authorities say they received an anonymous tip at about 5:20 p.m. after someone spotted Decker's vehicle at the Walmart in Eau Claire.  The 35-year-old was taken into custody without incident by the Eau Claire County Sheriff's Department and the Eau Claire Police Department. He's now at the Eau Claire County jail; no word yet on when he'll appear in court.  Police asked for the public's helping finding Decker after he ran from an officer Thursday morning. They spent part of the day searching for him around Violet Avenue and Stein Boulevard, which put an elementary school in the area on lock down for a short time.  They say he was wanted on a Department of Corrections warrant and was also a Person of Interest in another case. Authorities thought Decker could have been armed, so they said they were extra cautious in their search for him.  The Eau Claire Police Department told News 18 Saturday that they were grateful for the public's help in the case, saying officers couldn't do the work they do without the community's help. They said they received a number of calls from people trying to help find Decker.  ========================================================================================================= Eau Claire (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police have called off the search for 35-year-old Dennis Decker. Police had been searching the south side of Eau Claire since this morning after he fled from police.  Earlier, police told News 18 Decker may be armed. Though the officer never saw him with a gun, they still warned people to avoid the area.  They say there was no incident with Decker on Thursday morning, but he's wanted for a Department of Corrections warrant and has an extensive criminal history. Police say even though the search was called off, they're committed to finding Decker.  "We don't just give up a search and pack up and go home," ECPD Spokesperson Kyle Roder said. "We search the immediate area the best we can. Obviously, we can't go into residences and things, but we search the areas that we can search in these. And then we do a follow up investigation. So we are still looking for him."  Now, the department is asking for the public's help locating Decker. Anyone with information is asked to call 715-839-4972.  News 18 has also learned that the lockdown has been lifted at Putnam Heights Elementary School.  ------------------------- UPDATE (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police have identified the suspect as 35-year-old Dennis Decker. According to court records, he has been charged multiple times with eluding an officer. He has also been charged with obstructing an officer, criminal damage to property and car theft.  -------------------------- UPDATE (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police tell News 18 the suspect has a probation warrant out for his arrest and ran from police. They say he has an extensive criminal history.  --------------------------------- UPDATE (WQOW) - Putnam Heights Elementary School is on lockdown as the search for a possible armed man continues on Eau Claire's south side.  Principal Kim Koller tells News 18 Eau Claire Police informed her of the situation and the school went into lockdown. Koller says that means learning-activities will continue but will stay inside. Students will also be supervised during transitions in the hallway.  Koller says that practice will continue until the school hears otherwise from the police department.  ----------------------- Eau Claire (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police Department say they are searching for a possibly armed man in the area of Violet Avenue and Stein Boulevard, south of Bollinger Fields.  Police are asking people to avoid the area. They say the man was wanted and ran away from officers. He is reportedly wearing a white hooded sweatshirt, flannel shirt and light colored jeans.  Our reporter on scene says officers are searching the area with guns drawn. News 18 will bring you more information as soon as it becomes available.  Most Popular StoriesMost Popular StoriesMore>> UW-Stout death update: 2 people identified by Menomonie Police UW-Stout death update: 2 people identified by Menomonie Police The two people in the image shared to the media have been identified by the Menomonie Police Department.More >> The two people in the image shared to the media have been identified by the Menomonie Police Department.More >> 1 dead after single vehicle crash in Pierce County 1 dead after single vehicle crash in Pierce County A Baldwin man is dead after a crash in the Township of Salem.

By Maghan McDowell on November 7, 2016 twitter @Maghan McDowell Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Amazon is gaining ground in apparel. Amazon’s push in fashion has it gaining steam in apparel, but so far it’s mostly in basics. According to e-commerce research firm One Click Retail, October apparel sales on Amazon grew 5 percent versus a year earlier and 85 percent compared with September. But luxury shopping still has yet to come to the e-commerce behemoth in full force. One Click analyst Jeff Brown said Halloween costumes led the growth for the month, accounting for an estimated $21 million in sales and 27 percent in the total lift in apparel month-over-month. Outside of costumes, the men’s category in October saw “very strong growth,” said Brown, who has worked at Target and Overstock.com. Amazon is still largely seen as a destination for functional basics, with popular items including Levi’s 501 Original Fit Jeans and workwear items such as Dickies overalls and Carhartt hoodies. In September, back-to-school shopping fueled the number-two growth category of shoes, with athletic shoes accounting for more than $28 million in sales. One Click Retail has been tracking Amazon sales data since 2015 and found that, compared with other categories that are experiencing “explosive” growth, apparel growth has been “relatively flat.” “Although Amazon had a big push for luxury goods, the mainstays, such as underwear, socks, jeans, workout apparel and sporting goods, are doing the best,” said One Click’s managing partner Spencer Millerberg, who previously worked at both Wal-Mart and Amazon. Amazon has made attempts at attracting luxury retailers, but it’s struggled to gain significant traction. Recently, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said that the company would not do business with Amazon in its existing business model. “Amazon has been described as the ‘mall of the mess,’ and when you take a look at it, that’s probably a fair statement,” Millerberg said. “It’s the same reason that Wal-Mart has struggled. It’s not the destination that customers think of first, and not the way they shop, either.” Millerberg said it was an awareness problem. “They didn’t have the brand and the product two years ago, and one year ago they didn’t have the platform to support it; now, they have an awareness issue,” he said. But potential competitors are certainly aware. Gap Inc. chief executive officer Art Peck told shareholders in May that he was open to selling on Amazon and not considering it was “delusional.” Some experts anticipate that Amazon will experiment with a physical retail space in the form of a pop-up shop or sample shop to build awareness of Amazon apparel. Amazon has also slowly started rolling a number of lines of in-house apparel. “It’s the same thing as everything Amazon does,” said Millerberg. “They launched private brands of baby wipes and now they are the number-three brand in the space. They’ve done it in hundreds of different categories, but I don’t know if they will be able to make those same in roads [in apparel].” You're missing something!

Pleasant Township By Renatta Signorini | Thursday, Nov. 3, 2016, 11:00 p.m. Anthony Schake is charged in a violent 2013 robbery. State police charged two men this week in connection with a violent 2013 robbery that left a Mt. Pleasant Township convenience store owner unconscious. Barry Allen Hall and Anthony Joseph Schake, both 27, are accused of hitting the owner of McCloy's Store on the head with a tool in August 2013 and fleeing with cigarette packs and cash. Hall is incarcerated at a Greene County state prison on unrelated robbery and drug charges. He has not been arraigned on the new counts. Schake is being held in the Westmoreland County Prison on $100,000 bail. Store owner Melvin McCloy suffered a skull and finger fracture, brain contusion and cuts in the attack, police said. He was flown by medical helicopter to a Pittsburgh hospital. McCloy said Thursday that he still experiences dizziness. “I've been robbed before, but I never dreamed that something like this would happen,” he told WPXI, the Tribune-Review's news partner. “For the longest time, I didn't think they would catch them, but I'm glad this day is here.” At the time of the crime, both suspects lived with Hall's girlfriend, police said. They attempted to sell a Wal-Mart gift card at the convenience store and, when McCloy refused to purchase it, the pair allegedly assaulted him, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Police said Hall's fingerprints were found on a pack of cigarettes the pair dropped as they fled to a car waiting on Buckeye Road that was driven by Hall's girlfriend, who later implicated the two in the crime. The girlfriend, who is not charged in the robbery, told police Schake was covered in blood when the men got back to her Jeep and he threw his clothing out the window, the affidavit stated. Troopers found a hammer along Buckeye Road and submitted it to the state police crime lab last month. McCloy said he has installed surveillance cameras and keeps a gun handy at his store for protection. Hall and Schake both are charged with robbery, conspiracy, aggravated assault, theft and receiving stolen property. Neither had an attorney listed in online court records. Schake's preliminary hearing is set for Nov. 14. Renatta Signorini is a Tribune-Review staff writer. Reach her at 724-837-5374 or rsignorini@tribweb.com.

Print   Email   Font Resize Your Take Letter to the editor: A conservative case to raise the minimum wage By Edwin Zoe Posted:   11/07/2016 01:58:57 PM MST I have been a fiscally conservative Republican since I was a young man because President Ronald Reagan's unshakable optimism in the goodness of America and his message of personal responsibility and the dignity of work resonated strongly with me. And that's why as a business owner, I'll be voting for Amendment 70 to gradually raise Colorado's minimum wage from $8.31 to $12 by 2020. Amendment 70 will reward work, encourage self-reliance, and strengthen the free market by expecting businesses to compete fairly and not count on taxpayers to subsidize them. At a minimum wage of $8.31 per hour, an employee working full time year-round is actually making a subminimum wage because it does not add up to cover the basics. There is no such thing as a free lunch — one way or another, someone pays. The question is: Who pays for a worker to support themselves and their family? The business who is benefiting from their work, day in and day out? Or the taxpayer who funds the government assistance that saves thousands of Coloradans from going homeless, hungry or sick because they — or their parents — are paid too little to live on? When someone works a full-time job, they should not have to ask for welfare assistance to get by. That's not fair to the worker or the taxpayer or the many businesses that pay livable wages. Advertisement Imagine if a foreign corporation came to Colorado and said the only way for their business to be viable is to allow them to pay Coloradans poverty wages and expect the state of Colorado to subsidize them with welfare benefits for their workers? I hope we would have enough common sense to send that foreign corporation packing. Labor costs are a basic cost of doing business. Amendment 70 will help assure a more level playing field — where businesses don't offload their costs onto other businesses and taxpayers. Unlike many other cost increases, raising the minimum wage has a return on investment. When the minimum wage goes up, consumer spending goes up. Increasing the minimum wage is one of the most efficient ways to boost the local economy because low-income people have the greatest need to spend additional earnings. They don't put them in offshore tax havens or speculate irresponsibly on Wall Street like those who brought us the Great Recession. This common-sense understanding is supported by the University of Denver's study that estimates Amendment 70 will expand Colorado's gross domestic product by $400 million. Raising entry wages has another important return on investment: lower employee turnover. With lower turnover, businesses save time and money on hiring and training costs. We benefit from increased productivity and improved customer service. These returns on investment explain why many businesses that have workers earning less than the new minimum wage don't have to raise prices when the minimum wage goes up. And why, when a business does increase prices, it is generally modest and in no way cancels out the positive impact of the minimum wage increase to workers, families, communities and our economy. To take a well-known example: Costco and Wal-Mart both have affordable prices, but Costco has a fair-wage/low-turnover approach, while Wal-Mart has long had a low-wage/high-turnover model, leaving many of its workers relying on public assistance. The minimum wage should reinforce the former, not the latter business model. Amendment 70 opponents would have you believe that passage means many small businesses will close and many workers will lose their jobs. The TV ads make it sound like the coming apocalypse. They predicted this the last time minimum wage was on the ballot in 2006. They were wrong then. They are wrong now. In fact, researchers at the Bell Policy Center and the Colorado Center for Law and Policy found that 71,000 jobs were added in the two years following the last ballot measure, in rural as well as suburban and urban areas — including in the restaurant industry. The reality is that most businesses have many more customers than they have employees. When customers have more money to spend, it's good for everyone. Raising the minimum wage is good business and good government.

Gerald W. Angelo II, 40, of the 500 block of West Second Street, who was arrested Saturday night, told police he had no intention of hitting the woman but fired a shot to scare her after the two had twice argued in her home. "I pulled my gun out and the gun went off but I didn't shoot at her, I shot away from her," the arrest affidavit states he told police. He had a permit to carry the loaded .45-caliber handgun that police said was in a holster on his hip following the shooting outside the woman's home in the 700 block of Catawissa Avenue just before 8 p.m. Saturday. Angelo's two daughters, ages 6 and 11, were in the vehicle when it was stopped in the 500 block of Market Street and he was arrested, city police said. They later were turned over to their mother, they said. The woman gave this account of what happened, the affidavit states: After returning from taking the children to the YMCA, Angelo and she argued in her bedroom. The children were in another room. Angelo and his daughters left about 6:30 p.m., went to a Wal-Mart, they texted each other, he returned with his daughters to try to talk things out but they argued again. Angelo went downstairs, made threats, left the house and hit the woman's car several times with his hands. Upon hearing the noise, she grabbed a candleholder, left the house and threw it at Angelo's vehicle hood. He retrieved a weapon from the vehicle, she ran toward the house, the gun discharged, he caught up to her and knocked her to the ground. Police said a witness gave a similar account, and said Angelo then returned to his car, where his daughters were crying, and drove off. The witness is identified in the affidavit as one of the woman's two male roommates. Angelo is jailed in lieu of $250,000 bail on charges of aggravated and simple assault, terroristic threats, endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person.

The Flare Online The student newspaper of Kilgore College News Features Organizations Clubs Opinion Editorials Columns Your View Sports Football Men’s Basketball Women’s Basketball Softball Video Comics Advertising Online Print Kilgore College About Us November 15, 2016 Tri-C accepts new intern November 7, 2016 by Cam Williams, Staff Writer By: Sam Rodriguez Ellie Norris, 18, of McKinney, the new intern at the Christian Campus Center, greets and speaks with people, sends out the weekly emails and manages the social media accounts for the Tri-C on a daily basis. “For me it’s a big opportunity to meet people,” Norris said. “I’m not a super outgoing person. I enjoy talking to people, I just wouldn’t walk up to a person and be like, ‘hi,’ but working here, it’s kind of in my job description to do that. It’s a little bit out of my comfort zone, but it’s still a lot of fun.” Norris was born in Kilgore, but grew up in McKinney. She found this opportunity through her grandmother, Momma Jan, who has been Assistant Director of the Tri-C for about five years, and has lived here all of Ellie’s life. The move from McKinney back to Kilgore has been something of a culture shock, despite only being two and a half hours away. Norris has found the two cities have completely different atmospheres, in terms of social and dietary norms. “People come up and talk to you more than they do in McKinney,” she said. “Here everyone talks to me; when I go to church here [at Chandler Street Church of Christ], people know that you’re not from that church, whereas most of the time when you go to church in McKinney, the churches are so big that nobody notices if you’re new. Someone might notice, but not everyone.” In addition to the social differences, the move has taken a toll on her diet. Norris is a vegan, and has to go out of her way to find things to eat. Grocery stores such as Brookshire’s, Walmart, and Super 1 Foods have limited options, whereas in McKinney she was able to find a much greater variety. “For the Tri-C, I really just want to make sure I get done what [campus minister] Britt [Davis] wants me to do; I want to make sure I’m working hard and fulfilling everything that’s expected of me, but I also want to make sure that people see me as a person they can talk to,” Norris said. “Britt’s super awesome, but if you’re a young girl, you might not feel comfortable talking to a grown man about whatever you’re going through, or if Britt is busy a lot, I want to make sure people know that they can come to me and talk to me about anything.” Norris continued, “I’m not necessarily pursuing ministry, but I do enjoy talking about Jesus and I enjoy helping people. As a Christian, that’s what I’m called to do. The main point in me being here is to be a helping hand and to be a friend for other students.” However, this has not only benefitted her. “I’m not a huge extrovert. It has really been helping me with my personal growth and being able to talk to people,” Norris said. “If I do choose to do ministry or missions, I’m going to be around a lot of people all the time, and I’ll be talking about Jesus to them. I’m more of a listener than a talker, so this has really been helping me.” Norris can be found from around 9 or 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays at the Tri-C.

Roston - Nov 7, 2016 5 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Verizon Wireless has added two new data-heavy plans for its prepaid customers, one with 5GB of 4G LTE data and the other with 10GB. The plans bring various perks with them, including hotspot support, carryover data, and more. Still, and per typical with Verizon, the plans are a little more pricey than you’d pay elsewhere, and it may be worth shopping around if you don’t have to have Big Red. Here are some other prepaid plans with similar data options. The new 5GB and 10GB plans will be available starting November 13. The 5GB plan costs $50/month, and includes carryover data for those who pay on time, as well as unlimited talk and text, hotspot support, always-on data, and international messaging across 200 countries. The 10GB plan is the same as far as features go, but costs $70/month. It isn’t clear whether these prices require Auto Pay. It’s not unusual to find prepaid smartphone plans with 5GB and 10GB data per month, though, and there are some alternatives out there that are cheaper. Cricket Wireless Cricket Wireless has been around for years and now boasts a few prepaid monthly plans, the two largest of which offer 8GB and 10GB of high-speed data per month. The 8GB plan costs $50/month as its base rate, with Auto Pay dropping the cost to $45/month. Similarly, the 10GB plan is $60/month, with Auto Pay dropping it to $55/month. If both those are too expensive, though, Cricket also has a $30/month plan with 1GB of high-speed data, and a $35/month (with Auto Pay) plan with 2.5GB of data. You can check out the carrier’s coverage map here. T-Mobile Though it’s not as cheap as Cricket, T-Mobile has managed to undercut one of Verizon’s new plans, offering its own prepaid 10GB offering for $60/month versus Verizon’s $70/month. The 5GB month plan has the same $50/month price tag, however, making T-Mobile only marginally more attractive. That is, unless you grab the carrier’s Walmart-exclusive deal, which gets buyers 5GB of ‘up to’ 4G speeds for $30/month. The big difference between Verizon and T-Mobile in this case may be its perks for travelers: Verizon charges $10/month for 1,000 minutes to be used in Canada and Mexico. T-Mobile, on the other hand, charges $5/month for unlimited data, texting, and calls in Mexico and Canada in addition to the U.S. Boost Mobile Boost Mobile has one of the most attractive prepaid plans available…at least for those in its coverage area. The prepaid carrier has a $50/month plan that offers ‘unlimited gigs’ of 4G LTE data, with the exception of ‘mobile optimized’ video, music, and streaming cloud gaming. In the latter cases, video streams are capped ‘at up to 480p+ resolution,’ music is capped at 500kbps, and streaming cloud gaming is capped at 2mbps. The plan includes mobile hotspot support, a $5/month credit if you use Auto Pay, and add-ons like international talk and boostTV. Virgin Mobile Virgin Mobile is another prepaid carrier that is really driving down the cost of smartphone ownership. The carrier offers a $35/month prepaid plan with 5GB of 4G LTE data and unlimited streaming music. Those who need more data can get 10GB of 4G LTE data for $45/month (likewise offering unlimited music streaming). Those who use up their high-speed data allotment will be throttled to slower speeds, as with the three carriers mentioned above. Virgin offers add-on data, as well: $5 will get you an extra 1GB for the month, and $10 will get you an extra 2GB for the month. The data-free music streaming feature, meanwhile, supports Pandora, Spotify, Slacker, and more.

The San Diego premium seafood company revered for its superior-tasting tuna packed in pure olive oil has launched a new line of yellowfin and albacore tuna packed in Easy-Open cans. Gourmet tuna aficionados can now find two of Genova’s most popular products packed in portable cans with pull-tab lids. Genova Yellowfin Tuna in Olive Oil in Easy Open Cans Genova Albacore Tuna in Olive Oil in Easy Open Cans Genova Yellowfin Tuna in Extra Virgin Olive Oil with Sea Salt in Easy Open Cans Genova Albacore Tuna in Olive Oil, Very Low Sodium in Easy Open Cans Earlier this year, the release of Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 urged Americans to eat seafood at least twice a week in place of other protein foods. The new report concludes that average seafood consumption is below recommendations for all U.S. age-sex groups. According to Gautam Malla, senior brand manager of Genova Seafood, the new product line answers consumer demand for faster recipe preparation and portability. “Discerning foodies are seeking high-protein, convenient products that also deliver on taste. We’re thrilled to offer easy-open cans to allow time-crunched consumers to enjoy the decadent taste of Genova on-the-go.” The product is available in most U.S. supermarkets, Clubs (Costco and BJs) and Walmart in 3- and 5-ounce individual cans, and 5- and 7-ounce quad packs. To accompany the new packaging, Genova today launched Genova’s Easy Open Sweepstakes through November 26, 2016. Users who tag #GenovaSeafoodSweeps on social media have the chance to win a weekly giveaway Mediterranean-themed gift basket from Genova. In honor of the new easy-open cans, Genova introduced a series of quick and easy recipes that showcase the rich taste of Genova: Deconstructed Tuna Caesar Salad — Toasted French baguette alongside plated romaine hearts topped with rich and flavorful Genova, egg, garlic and parmesan and chives is a new twist on traditional Caesar Salad. Tropical Tuna Lettuce Wraps — These lettuce wraps blend Genova Tuna with mango, mint, walnuts and coconut flakes for a healthy bite of paradise. Tuna in Avocado with Red Onion — The savory taste of Genova combined with Greek yogurt, lemon juice, coriander, red onion, cucumber and cilantro spooned generously into avocado halves creates a perfect low-carb lunch. Gourmet Tuna Nachos — Tortilla chips topped with Genova, lemon, parsley, rosemary, parmesan cheese, diced tomato, green onion and mozzarella cheese delivers a fresh take on the ultimate game-day snack.

But when security is done right, it's a beautiful thing...sexy even. Security IS sexy. News Analysis Russian users far better at passwords than U.S. users A researcher analyzed passwords used in the U.S., Russia, China, Pakistan and India, finding that Russian have the best and most secure passwords. Americans are especially bad at creating long passwords. More like this Periodic password changes -- good or bad?

Comments Computerworld | Nov 7, 2016 9:58 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Security Internet Personal Technology Comments Pathetic passwords and password re-use is a worldwide problem, but recent analysis indicated the United States is a top offender when it comes to poor password security hygiene. Faizan Ahmad of Fsecurify wanted to know if entire countries had better passwords than others. Although he didn’t specify which public database breach he used for his analysis, it was a data dump which included IP addresses; he used the IPs to get users’ locations. He then compared passwords used in the U.S., Russia, China, Pakistan and India and graphed the results. After looking at password length, the use of most common passwords, if passwords contain users’ names or email usernames, and the top 100 password patterns which make brute-force attacks a piece of cake, Ahmad concluded that people in Russia tend to use all-around better passwords. Password length by country For each of the five countries, he analyzed the percentage of users with passwords ranging from six to 14 characters. According to his analysis, people in the US “are not very good at having longer passwords.” The biggest majority of passwords in Russia were 12 characters long, followed by 11 characters. The biggest majority of US passwords were eight characters; the U.S. and China tied for the same percentage of passwords with nine characters. Users in India and Pakistan also favored a password length of eight characters, but both countries as well as China had higher percentages of passwords with 10 to 14 characters than in the U.S. Passwords that can be quickly cracked via brute-force attacks Do you know how long it would take to crack your password? You can check at sites such as Random-ize. More than 50 percent of users in Pakistan and the US have passwords from the top 100 password patterns; China had nearly 50 percent, followed by India at 45 percent and then Russia at around 30 percent. The top 100 password patterns came from Ahmad’s previous research about mining password patterns for targeted brute-forcing. Percentage of passwords containing names and/or email usernames When it comes to names or email address usernames used in passwords, several countries finally did worse than the US. China was the worst offender with close to 14 percent, followed by India and then Pakistan. In the US, a little more than six percent committed this password sin, compared to a little less than four percent in Russia. While India and Pakistan tend to have close percentages, India scored a bit better. Ahmad wrote, “This proves the fact that Indian people are indeed better at security than Pakistani people.” Being from Pakistan, Ahmad said, “People here use really, really weak passwords.” He followed that comment with analysis about using the weakest passwords. Percentage of passwords using the most common passwords Pakistan did the worst when it comes to using the top 50 most common and therefore worst passwords. The results are in graph form, but it appears as if about 37 percent of Pakistanis use weak passwords. About 25 percent of users in China favor the most common passwords. India and the US are nearly neck-and-neck with around 21 percent using weak, common passwords. Only about 1 percent of passwords in Russia come from the most common list. Nearly 14.6k passwords allegedly from Sam’s Club leak online It looks like users from most countries, with the exception of Russia, need to work on cybersecurity by using better passwords. Password reuse and weak passwords can come back to bite you at any time. For example, ZDNet reported that account details for thousands of Sam’s Club members were leaked online. The passwords had allegedly been stored in plain-text. The Pastebin post with the password dump has been taken down, but Have I Been Pwned noted it contained 14,599 email addresses. Sam’s Club, which is the “eighth largest retailer in the US by annual net sales,” claims it wasn’t hacked; Walmart spokesperson Dan Toporek told ZDNet: We've looked into this issue and there is no indication of a breach of our systems. It is most likely a result of one of the past breaches of other companies' systems. Because customers often use the same usernames and passwords on various sites, bad actors will typically test the credentials they obtain across many popular sites. Unfortunately, this is an industry-wide issue. At the rate that breaches occur, even using a password manager for strong and unique passwords isn’t always enough. A few customers contacted by ZDNet claimed their passwords had been unique and therefore couldn’t have come from a previous data dump. You should sign up to be notified of data breaches at sites such as Have I Been Pwned, LeakedSource, or ChangePassword. If you receive a notification about your data being leaked, but you don’t even have an account on that site, keep in mind that security researcher Troy Hunt pointed out that your information could have been collected by one site and then sold to another. Geography may not make much of a difference when it comes to passwords, since users across the world seem to fall into most of the same traps. But please try to do better with your passwords.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Lifting Up Westchester’s Rolls Out Holiday LIFT Campaign Lifting Up Westchester’s Rolls Out Holiday LIFT Campaign Posted on November 7, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer County-Wide Organization Puts out Call-to-Action for Volunteers and Donors White Plains, NY (PRWEB) November 07, 2016 The hustle and bustle of the holidays is around the corner. To get local residents into the spirit of giving, Lifting Up Westchester (LUW), a nonprofit agency which provides homeless and poverty services to individuals throughout Westchester County, is launching a Holiday Lift campaign which kicks off on November 5th. The campaign offers multiple opportunities for the community to spread holiday cheer and lift the spirits of Westchester’s men, women and children in need. Holiday Lift activities will include distributing warm coats and winter clothing, providing 2,000 holiday meals from the LUW soup kitchen, filling and distributing 500 holiday food bags, and wrapping and delivering hundreds of holiday gifts. It will take an army of volunteers to get it done. “Preparing and serving holiday meals at Grace’s Kitchen on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s is our most popular volunteer activity” said Paul Anderson-Winchell, executive director. “We get calls as early as August and all of those slots are now filled. But there are many other ways for people to help and it’s always heartwarming and humbling to see the community come together during the holiday season to make sure that everyone has something to eat, receives a small gift or has warm gloves for the cold winter ahead. This is when we see the best of humankind.” Rhesa Browne, a Berkeley College employee, began volunteering at Lifting Up Westchester last holiday season. After organizing a successful holiday toy drive for college staff she said, “I was motivated to do more because there are many needy people in Westchester. I immediately decided to volunteer my time helping in any way that I can. Recently, I made a commitment to volunteer at Grace’s Kitchen every other week because I realize that individuals in need also need to be treated as people, and a smile and a warm meal can definitely make a difference in someone’s day.” This holiday season Browne has organized a staff drive to collect $25 gift certificates from Target, Walmart, McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts to distribute to teens in LUW’s Brighter Futures After-School Mentoring Program. Nancy Inzinna, LUW Volunteer & Community Outreach Manager said, “We get lots of donations of toys and games for young children at Christmas, but teens are often forgotten and they love to receive gift cards so they can shop for themselves.” A winter clothing giveaway will launch LUW Holiday Lift activities on Saturday, November 5th. Students from the White Plains High School Key Club will be on hand at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains to sort and distribute coats, hats, gloves, scarves, sweaters and other donated clothing. The clothing giveaway will be followed by Pie Day on Saturday, November 19th. Inzinna said, “We never seem to get enough donations of holiday desserts, especially pies. The kids in our youth programs love pie, so we’re trying to make it easy for people to bring in donations of their favorite pies to make Thanksgiving a little more delicious.” On Pie Day, home baked or store bought pies can be dropped off from 10:00 a.m.-2:00 p.m. at the agency’s head office at 35 Orchard St. in White Plains (just off Hwy 287 Exit 6). Donations of brownie and cake mixes are also welcome. LUW is also hoping to receive donations of home baked Christmas cookies. “The guests at our soup kitchen seldom get a taste of home-baking items and nothing says Christmas like a plate of Christmas cookies,” said Inzinna. She added that getting children involved in baking and donating holiday treats is a great way to introduce them to the spirit of giving. Below are some other ways that the community can help LUW provide 2,000 holiday meals, fill 500 holiday food bags and gifts for hundreds of individuals and families in need: Organize a food drive and involve your neighborhood, school, religious organization or community group. Foods needed most are turkeys, hams, instant mashed potatoes, gravy mix, stuffing, canned vegetables, canned cranberries, cake and brownie mixes. Donate the free turkeys that many grocery stores give away at Thanksgiving or Christmas. Donate $25 grocery store gift cards for food bags given to vegetarians and families who traditionally eat something other than turkey and ham for their holiday meals Donate NEW gloves, hats and scarves for residents of the Open Arms Men’s Shelter and Samaritan House Women’s Shelter Donate sports balls, board games and multi-cultural dolls for the children and teenagers in the Brighter Futures Youth Programs. Donate cash online at http://www.liftingupwestchester.org to help fill any gaps or last minute needs. For specific date and timing information on Holiday Lift activities, please contact Nancy Inzinna at ninzinna(at)liftingupwestchester(dot)org or call (914) 949-3098 ext. 9735.

Its stores will open at 5 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 24, and remain open until 11 p.m. Nov. 25. The 30-hour spree stands out as most retailers have dialed down marketing for Thanksgiving hours or reversed course and allowed their employees to observe the holiday.   "Our customers have voted at the doors year after year, and they continue to want the option to get an early start on their holiday shopping lists," Toys R Us executive vice president Joe Venezia said in a statement.  Although Black Friday has been considered the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, major retailers -- some trying to make up for lagging sales during the year -- have gotten a head start with Thanksgiving hours. Wal-Mart began a trend of such early openings in 1988.  But with the perception that more shoppers were opting for bargain hunting over a holiday spent with family, some retailers are actively marketing the fact that they were closed on Thanksgiving.    Total revenues for Toys R Us, which also includes its Babies R Us stores, were down $1.9 million or 3.2 percent at midyear compared with the first six months of 2015, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The decrease was linked to a real estate transaction.   Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Business Names in the News Does your company have a recent hire, promotion, appointment or honoree to announce?

Lehigh Valley Craft Beer: Tastings, new places opening, upcoming events & more LV Business Cycle Finance 7 inventive ways to make money using your credit card Elise Amendola/AP There's a smart way you can pay off your credit card debt: Make your credit card work for you. There's a smart way you can pay off your credit card debt: Make your credit card work for you. (Elise Amendola/AP) Valencia HigueraOf GOBankingRates.com (TNS) Americans are no strangers to credit card debt. In fact, the median amount owed on a credit card is $2,000, according to GOBankingRates.com's 2016 U.S. Household Debt survey. If you're one of these people carrying a high balance on your card, you're probably racking up interest charges. So, as your credit card issuer is making money off the interest and fees you have to pay, you're losing more and more of your hard-earned cash. But there's a smart way you can pay off your credit card debt: Make your credit card work for you. Sure, swiping your card everywhere you go won't get you rich quick. But when you use your credit cards strategically, you can generate some cash for payments. Or, if you're debt-free, you can use the extra funds to pay for an upcoming trip or that flat-screen TV you've always wanted. Here are seven creative ways you can make money with your credit cards. GET MONEY WITH CASH-BACK CREDIT CARDS To make money using credit cards, get a card that pays you to shop. This type of card is called a cash-back credit card. Depending on the type of card you get, you can earn 1 percent or even 5 percent in cash-back rewards for certain purchases. Take the Discover it card, for example. With this credit card, you can earn 5 percent cash back in rotating categories - such as gas, restaurants and more - on up to $1,500 in purchases every quarter. So let's say you spend $1,500 on qualifying purchases - that's $75 going right back into your pocket. And in addition to 5 percent cash back, you get 1 percent unlimited cash back on all other purchases. This card also offers a rare perk: Discover matches dollar-for-dollar all of the cash back you earn in your first year, which can add up quickly. The more you use a cash-back credit card, the more cash you can earn. Be careful, though. Pay off your credit card balance in full every month to avoid racking up credit card debt and paying high interest charges. If you fall too deep into debt, the cash-back rewards might not be worth it. EARN BONUS REWARDS POINTS "The best way to leverage credit cards for money, in my experience, is to open a new card with a large flight mileage bonus, and use the points toward a free or heavily discounted flight," said Stacy Caprio, search marketing manager at TimePayment, which provides equipment financing for businesses. You can take your pick of credit cards offering sign-up bonus points. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card - named one of the best travel rewards credit offers by GOBankingRates - lets you earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in purchases with the card in the first three months after opening an account. That's the equivalent of $625 you can use toward travel. So, you might want to use this card, or similar rewards cards, for as many expenses as possible. And if possible, see if you can rack up rewards points by using your credit card to pay your rent. "It's common knowledge that the best way of getting value - or money - back from credit card use is earning points," said Roman Shteyn, co-founder of RewardExpert.com, which helps travelers make the most out of their credit card points and airline miles. "However, oftentimes people are not charging one of their biggest monthly expenses to their cards: their rent." INVEST YOUR CASH BACK You can also put cash-back rewards to work for you and invest the money - even if you earn less than a few hundred dollars. Thanks to the power of compounding interest, your cash-back rewards will grow into a sizable nest egg over time. Let's say you earn $300 in cash back every year. If you invest that $300 into an account that earns 7 percent interest annually, in 10 years your balance will grow to more than $4,000. As an added credit card benefit, some rewards credit cards allow card owners to link their cards to eligible investment accounts. Take the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature credit card: You can earn unlimited 2 percent cash and have those rewards automatically deposited into an eligible Fidelity account, such as a brokerage account, a 529 college savings plan, a retirement account and more. To maximize your investment earnings, look for credit cards with no restrictive categories. The more restrictions, the fewer opportunities to cash in and invest your rewards. SELL YOUR REWARDS POINTS - BUT BE CAREFUL Travel rewards credit cards are a godsend if you're a frequent traveler. But what if you don't travel often? Shteyn suggested selling your points for money by booking tickets for friends and family with points in exchange for cash. "It can be a win-win for both parties," he said. "Your friends get a discounted ticket, and you get cash back at a higher rate than your bank may offer." But, before you get too excited and start selling your unwanted rewards for cash, know the risks. Although some rewards programs allow members to gift rewards or points to their family and friends, selling these perks for cash might violate the terms and conditions of some programs. So before you sell, carefully read your credit card rewards' terms and conditions thoroughly - and make sure the process is not illegal in your state. DO YOUR SHOPPING ONLINE As a credit card benefit, some cards allow you to earn cash back or points by shopping online. You might need to log into your credit card account in order to access these savings and take advantage of the deals. For example, eligible Discover card members can earn additional cash back when they shop through Discover Deals. This includes 5 percent cash back when they shop LivingSocial, Apple, Wal-Mart and other online retailers. They can also score gift cards, like a $25 Sam's Club gift card, or savings off their next purchases. Other credit card issuers have similar shopping portals. Whichever shopping portal you use, read the terms and conditions and fully understand how the program works. JOIN ACORNS AND LINK A CREDIT CARD If you want to invest but don't know where to begin, the Acorns app might be an excellent starting point. This investing platform automatically invests your spare change from everyday purchases. Simply sign up, and link your credit card or debit card. For every purchase you make, Acorns rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference, turning your spare change into income. Your funds are invested in a diversified portfolio to lower your risk, and you can link as many credit cards as you like. The amount you can potentially earn through the app depends on how often you use a linked credit card. There's a $1 monthly fee for using the service. But if you're a college student with a valid .edu email address, you can use Acorns fee-free for up to four years. GET CREATIVE WITH EXPIRED CREDIT CARDS You can't make a purchase with an expired credit card - but you can turn the card into art and cash in. This is probably a foreign concept, but some DIY-ers are exploring their crafty side and making handmade jewelry using expired credit cards. The profit you can generate from selling these unique fashion pieces vary. But if you're interested, there are credit card accessories on Etsy.com selling for as little as $5 and as high as $20. Since the credit cards are cut into tiny pieces, the chance of someone piecing the card together and getting their hands on your card number is unlikely. Still, it's safer to err on the side of caution. Don't use too many pieces of the same credit card for one piece of jewelry. Credit cards can get you into financial trouble if you don't keep a close eye on spending. But if you use them to your advantage, you can get free cash from everyday purchases and use these earnings to pay down debt.

In this piece from Artist Rights Watch, Chris Castle dives into what he sees as the evils of Facebook's copyright infringement. After making itself what seems to be a necessary evil for artists, Facebook hides in plain sight while still avoiding proper licensing and evoking the DMCA.  Read on and tell us what you think. ____________________ Guest Post by Chris Castle on Artist Rights Watch There’s a massive infringer hiding in plain sight.  That’s a tactic that worked from the Case of the Purloined Letter to Osama Bin Laden–worked for a while, anyway. So who is this massive infringer?  Pirate Bay?  mp3skull?  YouTube-mp3?  No–it’s Facebook.  That’s right.  Facebook, the property that every band is told they must be on, the property to which the entire global music industry drives millions of fans every minute of every day, the property that live streams music as a business line–isn’t licensed and is hiding behind the DMCA. The dilemma that Facebook has created is one based on bait and switch.  First, they invite artists into the platform with the promise that being on Facebook will open up new vistas of audience engagement with the implication of untold riches. What Facebook don’t tell artists is that Facebook intends to get that music for free and also datamine the artist’s fans, sell the artist’s name as an advertising keyword, and generally do everything Facebook can to capture the fan.  Even if the fan was already on Facebook, the music increases the fans engagement with the platform. Unlike Amazon and Google, music isn’t even a loss leader to get consumers to buy other stuff.  For all their problems, Amazon and Google do get at least some licenses and do pay royalties.  Facebook won’t even pay the pathetically low royalties that these two massive Wal Mart level commoditizers pay, and Facebook doesn’t even recognize the rights of the very artists and songwriters whose names they sell out the back door for advertising keywords. The other part of the dilemma is that Facebook can help artists reach an audience, assuming the artist broke the cardinal rule of marketing–don’t get dependent on these online platforms because when the switch comes, you’ll be trapped.  Don’t have your only or even primary online presence be Facebook, because Facebook will own your fans. "Facebook needs to properly articulate the bargain they want to make." This isn’t to say that Facebook doesn’t provide a valuable service, it does.  But Facebook needs to properly articulate the bargain they want to make.  If the deal is you get access to our platform at no charge and in return we let you pay us to boost your post or other fee based methods of engaging with your fans–but you have to give us your music for free–then say that up front. There are many artists and especially songwriters who just can’t believe that Facebook pays nothing for music.   And not only doesn’t but refuses to even engage on a negotiation. This failure makes Facebook one of the biggest infringers.  You would think that the government would be leading the charge against these people, right? You would think.   Related articles Former Rhapsody, Sony Execs Sends An Open Letter To The Music Business Facebook Starts Paying Video Creators, Is In Talks With Record Labels How to Grow your Fan Base by Focusing on Location Posted by Guest Post on 11/07/2016 in More News, Music Business, Social Media | Permalink Comments Is Facebook The Musicians Friend Or A Massive Infringer?

(WFM) Stock Kroger shouldn't want to polish the beleaguered Whole Foods brand By John Kilhefner, InvestorPlace Assistant Editor  |  Oct 6, 2016, 1:11 pm EST     Popular Posts: Amazon.com, Inc.

GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Cracks After Lousy Q3 Earnings Square Inc (SQ) Stock Finally Catches a Tailwind View All Posts Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NYSE:WFM) and Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) are playing M&A tag, it seems. On Thursday, WFM stock got a 5% bump amid reports that it might have a buyer in Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) while it turns out that nobody wants TWTR after all. The news broke courtesy of Mike Bergen, who tweeted: Chatter $40 cash/stock bid for $wfm from $kr. — Mike Bergen (@BergenCapital) October 6, 2016 But as one astute Tweeter pointed out, why would Kroger buy Whole Foods when it can beat them? Why Would Kroger Want WFM? Shares of Whole Foods Market are up nearly 5% on the speculation, but it’s still barely off of its 52-week lows, where nary a buyer dares go near. That’s because it’s easy to keep making new lows from here, and WFM stock has been on a wild ride over the past five years. A lot of that has to do with increased competition in the healthy foods space. Whole Foods was once king of the hill, with hardly a worthy competitor in sight. Those days are long gone, and Kroger has been eating WFM’s lunch for some time. That wild ride of Whole Foods has cost shareholders 11% for the past five years, while KR stock is up 165% in the same timeframe. It turns out there’s not a high barrier to enter into the organic market, and people don’t actually care where they get their organics from as long as it’s fresh and cheap. The Whole Foods brand is not worthless, but is worth less in that regard. Of course, Whole Foods hasn’t helped itself, either. It accused of price gouging in 2015, which contributed to its second-quarter profit decline of 22%. Then there’s the slew of “serious violations” at WFM’s Everett, Massachusetts, food-prep facilities, where WFM was faulted for egregious employee violations ranging from failing to sanitize prep surfaces to spraying greens with an ammonia-based sanitizer. Bottom Line on WFM and KR I just can’t see Kroger paying $40 per share — a 43% premium to WFM’s closing price of $27.96 Wednesday. Earlier in the year, the rumor mill churned organic butter out of news that Kroger would buy The Fresh Market, sending TFM stock up about 23%. That turned out to be false. The Fresh Market instead was bought out by Apollo Global Management LLC (NYSE:APO) at a premium of 24%. It’s not like KR is adverse to buyouts. Kroger snatched up Harris Teeter for $2.5 billion in 2014, followed by Vitacost.com for $280 million. Then, in 2015, it bought little-known organic grocer Roundy’s for $800 million in 2015. Roundy’s was neck-deep in debt and hasn’t increased comps in years, but Kroger needed more locations in Chicago and Wisconsin to remain competitive and ultimately take on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The grocer ultimately paid a 60% premium for the deal. Kroger paid cash for all those moves, and it has racked up a significant amount of debt. Kroger currently has $320 million in cash and short-term investments on hand. And it has $9.6 billion in IOUs. The one thing that Whole Foods could possibly offer Kroger is more locations. That’s because store count increases the moat of an organic grocer, as people tend to shop in stores that are near them. But with 2,700 locations already, is adding another 452 stores globally worth valuing beleaguered WFM stock at $40 a share and taking on even more debt? I wouldn’t bet my kale and quinoa salad on it. But with Kroger stock up 1.2% today, it looks like the market would welcome a deal with open arms. As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Drug problems are one factor contributing to a labor shortage that delayed filling orders earlier this year. “We’ve become a recruiting company,” Brown said of the relentless struggle to maintain a strong workforce. Bremen Castings illustrates the central tension in U.S. manufacturing: Plant managers complain of a talent shortage, while workers see too few acceptable jobs. The paradox has echoed through the presidential campaign, with both major candidates lamenting the loss of factory jobs — even as unemployment in most industrial regions has dropped to rates usually considered healthy. The jobless rate in the county surrounding the Bremen plant, for instance, is less than 4 percent, according to state data. The national rate is 5 percent. Such statistics, however, obscure the struggles of manufacturers and workers, particularly in the Midwestern U.S. Factories in the countryside are distant from pools of unemployed workers in cities. Drug tests are disqualifying more applicants. Low wages discourage others from taking jobs that are available, and employers say tougher immigration enforcement makes it difficult to fill many low-wage jobs. The problem boils down to a quality issue on both sides: Employers gripe about workers with little work ethic, while employees decry falling pay for the kind of jobs that once fed families. The logical response to a labor shortage is to raise pay enough to attract a quality staff, but many manufacturers say they can’t afford it in an era of rising global competition. Bremen Casting in August raised its starting wage to $14 per hour from $13 — after raising it from 11.50 earlier this year. The company pays up to $27.50 for its top hourly workers. Brown said he’s nearing the limit of what he can pay because of pricing pressure from his customers. The upshot is that most factory jobs, in the view of many blue-collar Americans, have been redefined as lower-level work. The average wage on factory floors fell below the average for all U.S. workers in 2006 and now sits at $20.57 per hour. Many make much less. A third of factory floor workers collect some form of public assistance, such as food stamps, according to a study this year by the University of California-Berkeley’s Center for Labor Research and Education. Among temporary manufacturing workers, the portion qualifying for government help jumps to 50 percent — on par with families of fast food workers. Between 2009 and 2013, state and federal governments spent $10.2 billion on assistance for factory workers. Many employers are getting what they pay for, said Ken Jacobs, a co-author of the study. “You can’t both complain about a skills shortage and offer compensation that’s too low to attract workers,” he said. SHUTTERED UNION FACTORIES Since the recession ended in 2009, more U.S. workers are choosing unemployment over the jobs available to them. Among men between 25 and 54 years old, the share of those neither working nor looking for work — 12 percent — has doubled since the 1970s. The rate jumps to 17 percent for men without college degrees, who would be likely candidates for factory jobs. In Manitowoc, Wisconsin, Steven Schenian recently sat across from his human resources manager, Amanda AnSorge, puzzling over recruiting. Schenian owns four small companies in this town overlooking Lake Michigan, including IMF Solutions, a furniture factory. They thought they might get a windfall because Manitowoc Co — a crane maker and once the town’s largest private employer — is shutting its local factory. So is another company, a foundry in nearby Brillion, Wisconsin. But there’s been no surge of applicants at Schenian’s furniture factory, where the average worker makes about $15 an hour, compared to pay of up to $28 at the unionized factories that are closing, Schenian said. “Our industry just doesn’t allow that kind of wages,” Schenian said. Workers with specialized skills, such as welding, have seen wages perk up a bit amid the tight labor market. Power Curbers Inc, an equipment maker in Salisbury, North Carolina, pays experienced welders “well over $20 an hour,” says CEO Dyke Messinger. With little heavy industry in the area, he tends to have his pick of workers. But he’s also noticed more turnover lately. “There are guys with higher skills seeing their talents bid up,” he says. “But that does nothing for the guy with average skill.” ‘HYGIENE ISSUES’ Some experts believe the erosion of pay and opportunity in factories has helped create a generation of workers more prone to problems that make them less employable.  Many hiring managers say applicants lack a solid work ethic, reflected in what they call “hygiene issues” — chronic tardiness, job-hopping and refusal to work overtime. They also report more drug problems. A manufacturer down the street from Bremen Casting, who didn’t want to be named, uses a hair-analysis test to catch drug use. The company recently fired one employee after the man shaved every hair on his body before showing up for testing. More permissive social attitudes about drugs, along with and marijuana legalization in some states, are complicating the issue for manufacturers, who need drug-free workers to handle dangerous equipment and chemicals. The share of U.S. workers who fail drug tests has hit its highest level in a decade, 4 percent, according to a recent study by Quest Diagnostics Inc, one of the nation’s largest testing labs. That’s only those who were caught — such tests are better at identifying some drugs than others, and an entire industry has sprung up offering ways to beat them. Some applicants just don’t show up after they find out they have to take a drug test, manufacturing employers said. Failure rates trended downward in previous decades, according to Quest’s records. The study found use of illicit drugs — from marijuana to heroin to methamphetamines — grew both among the general workforce as well as those in “safety sensitive” jobs like pilots and railroad engineers. In some regions, the surge of opiate addiction has tainted the labor pool. Back in Bremen, Brown says the drug problem has come in waves. First there was marijuana, then cocaine. Now it includes prescription drugs such as Vicodin and OxyContin. And a wider array of workers is failing the tests, he says, including older, white-collar workers applying for accounting and sales jobs. “We used to look at weed and say, ‘I hope they’re not smoking,’” Brown said. “Now, we hope that’s all it is.” Beyond drug issues, business leaders have a bleak view of the traditional blue-collar labor pool, according to a steady stream of reports from consulting and industry groups. Accounting firm Deloitte found recently that 84 percent of business executives see a “talent shortage” in U.S. factories. The study was conducted in partnership with the Manufacturing Institute, an employer group. Some labor advocates see a shortage of money instead. Workers accused of lacking performance, ambition or loyalty are reacting predictably to a lack of pay and opportunity, said Catherine Ruckelshaus, program director at the National Employment Law Project. She cited recent raises by Wal-Mart as an example of a corporation recognizing the importance of worker morale and retention. “There’s not really a ‘skills shortage,’” she said. DITCHING WORK Bremen is a factory town, with a population of about 4,800 and about 2,000 factory jobs, estimated Trend Weldy, Bremen’s town manager and Chamber of Commerce president. Many workers are drawn from the surrounding regions, including some who commute from distant farms and towns in Michigan. Yet recruiting remains a daily struggle for Brown and Bremen Casting. Among his competitors are two big operations in town that paint recreational vehicles, operations that are humming amid strong demand from baby-boomer retirees. Even some longtime workers at Bremen Casting can pose problems, including absenteeism, said Sharon Calahan, the company’s director of human resources. Her all-time favorite excuse for ditching work came a few months ago, when a worker told her, “My girlfriend’s husband just died — and she’s distraught.” The company has stopped strictly enforcing its attendance policy. “If we held to it, we wouldn’t have those employees,” says Stan Hueni, the company’s employee relations manager. One problem is that the company has cut itself off from a big source of local labor: Those in the U.S. illegally. As recently as a decade ago, nearly half the workforce of Bremen Castings was Hispanic. But after the company implemented E-Verify — a U.S. government program that identifies workers with legal status — the share of Hispanic workers has gradually declined. Brown made the change after some other companies in his area were hit with government immigration raids. Today, Bremen’s workforce is only about 15 percent Hispanic. Brown believes there are plenty of other potential workers on the fringes of the job market, but some aren’t particularly motivated. The company recently interviewed a 21-year-old man who had graduated from high school but never attended college or held a job. Brown decided not to give him his first one. A tactic he may try is bringing in workers from local Amish communities in hired vans. That’s worked well for some local employers, but Brown has his doubts. Foundry work involves pouring molten metal, and many Amish seem more familiar with other types of wood and metalworking trades. AVOIDING OVERTIME Among Brown’s more dependable employees is Steve Humfleet, who started eight years ago on the graveyard shift and moved to day work three years ago. But the 43-year-old has little interest in overtime hours, for the same reason he wanted off the night shift: More time with his wife, Natalie, also 43, and two daughters, Shauna, 21, and Diana, 12. In the past, Brown said, workers would compete for those extra hours, which pay 50 percent more. He thinks this may in part be an impact of the recession, when many younger workers, in particular, appeared to learn how to get by with much less. Humfleet doesn’t dispute that assessment. To him, time is more important than money. When not with family, he prefers to spend that time out hunting or target-shooting. He tries to keep grocery bills low and routinely tells his two daughters that the family can’t buy all the things they want. He and his wife, Natalie — who also works in a local factory — have chosen to build their lives, he said, “on 40-hour paychecks.” (Editing by Joe White and Brian Thevenot) Your next Nation & World articles North Dakota sheriff investigates report ...

Once I saw the commercial for what Green Lighting a Vet meant ,I made plans to pick up a green light for my porch the next day. Green Light a Vet is calling on Americans from coast to coast to display green lights at their homes and workplaces, a symbolic show of gratitude for the service and sacrifice. “A veteran can sit for an average of twenty-two weeks in unemployment between their last military paycheck and a new job … and they just need to know there is a support network out there for them.” said Chris Erickson, an Army veteran and resident at FleishmanHillard, a marketing agency helping Walmart promote Greenlight A Vet. There are some great pictures on the sites homepage of porches, and businesses participating in the Green Light a Vet Project. To see people participating around the country, or to post your own show of support click here. The meaning behind the color green, according to GreenLightaVet.com is because: Green is the color of hope, renewal and well-being. “Greenlight” is also a term commonly used to activate forward movement. The simple gesture of changing one light to green creates a beacon of support and appreciation, and a visible symbol symbol of our commitment to “greenlight” veterans forward as valued members of our communities.   Photo By Travis Jacobs Sources: Greenlightavet.com Sign Up for Our Daily Newsletter See Also: Subscribe to 1140 KSOO-AM on Filed Under: Military Appreciation | Veterans Category: News | Newsletter KSOO | Top Stories Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

Some retailers and shopping venues have given in to the backlash: Various malls (such as the Mall of America) and chain stores including RadioShack and Office Depot will be shuttered on Thanksgiving this year, per CNNMoney. But one of the largest superstores is doubling down, then adding a few hours for good measure, USA Today reports. Toys R Us will be opening its doors at 5pm on Turkey Day and keeping them open for 30 hours straight—until 11pm on Black Friday. "Our customers have voted at the doors year after year, and they continue to want the option to get an early start on their holiday shopping lists," Joe Venezia, executive VP for the company's global operations, said in a statement. But not every consumer feels that way: Per a BestBlackFriday.com poll cited by USA Today, 60.2% of consumers say they'd refuse to shop on Thanksgiving. And Brian Rich, who started the Boycott Black Thursday Facebook page five years ago, tells CNN that while "Walmart, Best Buy, and Target probably won't close on Thanksgiving anytime soon … this movement is clearly having an impact." Patrons definitely still have plenty of other stores they can descend upon after emerging from their tryptophan fog, including Kohl's (a 6pm Thanksgiving Day opening), Macy's (5pm), and JCPenney (3pm), per CNBC. Check out DealNews and BestBlackFriday.com for updates on store openings on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. (24/7 Wall Street notes Toys R Us' finances are spurring it to lure customers to wander its aisles like "[groggy] winners of the 1920s dance marathons.")

It is sad that the people who manage these stores don't realize that for those who have no choice but to work on these holidays, they are not promoting a family atmosphere for their employees. A lot of people have said they resented having to give up their family time so their stores can take advantage of people.

They’re joining the trend of those taking part in “Black November” instead. “They’re taking advantage of this trend and wanting to make sure they’re engaging the consumer that’s already eager to shop for the holiday season,” notes Ana Serafin Smith of the National Retail Federation. Several surveys agree consumers are eager, with more than 40 percent well underway with their Christmas shopping, stretching purchases over several paychecks instead of just one. “They’re demanding to do their shopping earlier than ever so that when it’s December, it’s time to enjoy it with their families,” says RetailMeNot.com’s Sara Skirboll. Retail experts also expect other retailers to join in long before the day after Thanksgiving. They say shopping earlier in the month means skipping crowds, less stress, and a better chance at getting the bigger bargains. “November is the best month to buy electronics such as laptops,” said Courtney Jespersen, retail and shopping expert at NerdWallet. “We also expect massive electronics deals at Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Costco, and more,” said Jespersen.

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Thursday November 3, 2016 in Beijing, China, Diane Wang, Founder and CEO of DHgate.com, who is part of the first generation of cross-border e-commerce entrepreneurs in China, delivered the keynote address at the 2016 International Summit of Women Entrepreneurs. In her speech, she highlighted the trend of globalization through digitalization, how it changes industry landscapes and forces businesses to adopt digitalization order to thrive. Wang noted the huge opportunities presented by digitalization, but at the same time stressed that traditional enterprises will only have access to these opportunities if they leverage the Internet to enhance their core abilities. Wang cited large scale traditional trading companies in China who offer services to thousands of local SMEs that engage in foreign trade, helping them with customs clearance, tax returns etc, however, they are being surpassed by smaller companies that leverage the Internet and foreign trade services more effectively than they do, as an example of how digital globalization helps level the playing field. Wang said, "There is already a deep integration between traditional businesses and the Internet, including the adoption of both an online and offline presence by businesses of all kinds." Wang also said, "We are only in the early stages of seeing companies with an online presence alone gaining an offline presence, and traditional enterprises gaining an online presence." According to Wang, this is the effect of the adoption of technology and changing habits of consumers, "For example in China, street vendors must support mobile phone payment methods, or they will be abandoned by potential customers. This is also true for big chain stores like Wal-Mart, as well as mom-and-pop shops selling baked goods. These may be examples of the shallow integration of traditional industries and the Internet, but this is just the beginning. In the future, businesses more prominent use of the Internet will create inestimable opportunities." Wang mentioned that digital globalization has brought another change, cross-border e-commerce platforms, like DHgate.com, which have been breaking down the trade boundaries between countries, gathering global business people and goods. "In our eyes, the future presents an image of people being able to buy and sell globally very easily. In actuality, digital globalization has not abandoned these major markets. Through cross border e-commerce platforms, they can transform their businesses, acquiring business from beyond the confines of their locality, and accept orders from across the globe. In addition, we have entered directly into the overseas market; we have established overseas exhibition centers in many countries, providing a multitude of services, including: product inspection, brand representation, online and offline sales, warehouse logistics, and after-sale customer service. The barriers to overseas markets have been significantly reduced, thanks to global digitalization. As a result, it is now far easier for Chinese sellers to enter more overseas markets."

Among the questions the judge will have to answer? Whether they actually worked for Amazon. “Amazon controls everything, without a shadow of a doubt,” says Theron Bradley, a former employee of Amazon contractor Silverstar who’s one of the named plaintiffs in the proposed class action. “Silverstar pays me, but I definitely know I work for Amazon.” Bradley’s lawsuit, filed this week in Chicago federal court, targets not just the contractor that signed his paychecks but the e-commerce behemoth itself. In the complaint, he contends Amazon was so involved in his day-to-day work as to be a “joint employer” and as such, liable for the alleged violations under both state and federal law. Drivers have also brought wage-and-hour lawsuits naming Amazon as an employer in Washington State and California. Amazon sees its relationship with the drivers differently. “The small and medium-sized businesses that partner with Amazon logistics have their own employees and are required to abide by applicable laws and Amazon’s Supplier Code of Conduct,” the company said in an e-mailed statement. “We investigate any claim that a provider isn’t complying with these obligations.” (An attorney for Silverstar said Wednesday it was still investigating the allegations.) But labor advocates say when it comes to contracted workers like Bradley, Amazon is much more than a mere consumer of services. “The trainings were done by Amazon personnel, the daily assignments were given out by Amazon personnel, Amazon personnel tracked the routes taken by the drivers, they wore Amazon logos,” says the workers’ attorney, Chris Williams. “If there was a problem with package delivery, they went to Amazon. They didn’t go to Silverstar.” The Illinois lawsuit is among the latest in a series of efforts by activists, attorneys, and agencies to hold name-brand companies accountable for the conditions of workers they rely on but are ostensibly employed by someone else–be it a supplier, a franchisee, or (if they’re classified as independent contractors) no one at all. In 2012, guest workers at a Louisiana seafood supplier went on strike over alleged forced labor and mounted simultaneous protests targeting Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the U.S. and Mexico. In 2014, California legislators passed a law increasing company liability for labor law violations by contractors. Last month, McDonald’s Corp. agreed to a $3.75 million wage-and-hour settlement with workers at five franchisee-run restaurants that had sued the corporation as a joint employer. “More and more, businesses are varying organizational and staffing models,” David Weil, chief of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, wrote last January in an Administrator’s Interpretation. He said that “as a result, the traditional employment relationship of one employer employing one employee is less prevalent.” Weil, who before joining the Obama administration wrote a book about how the “fissuring” of employment structures has hurt workplace standards, emphasized the breadth of who federal law deems to be an employer, and the need to expand enforcement beyond the company that signs a paycheck. In the litigation context, being able to target the larger, deeper-pocketed defendant does increase the potential for a more lucrative outcome, for workers and their lawyers. But it may also lead to change for more employees. “Where joint employment exists,” Weil wrote, “one employer may also be larger and more established, with a greater ability to implement policy or systemic changes to ensure compliance.” Copyright 2016 Bloomberg.

(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) 11 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Election Day is almost here. While it has frazzled our nerves and stressed our sensibilities, it has also provided parents of all political persuasions with many a teaching moment. Based on my experience this election season, here are five lessons that can benefit us all: Friends can disagree, and that’s OK. You can still be friends. If your friend likes one candidate and you like the other, but you still both love to play Minecraft together and bake cookies and she’s such a good listener, the politics don’t matter. You can each keep your half of the BFF heart necklace. Play fair. Stealing money from the Monopoly bank or moving your Sorry piece ahead when no one is looking will get you a time out. Because Mom has eyes in the back of her head. And even if she doesn’t catch you, karma will. So leave those political signs alone! (Talking to both sides here). Honesty is the best policy. If you tell a lie in our house, you face the wrath of Dad and Mom. Even a half-truth will get you in pretty serious trouble. This election season, indeed just about every election season, shows us how telling a lie or half-truth can hurt you in the long run. The negative effects of lies in politics are great teaching moments. Your vote counts. No matter who is in the running, election time is a great time to talk with your children about the election process and why voting at age 18 and beyond is so important to a functioning democracy/republic. Need an example of a close race? There’s always the George W. Bush vs. Al Gore contest here in Florida. Just 537 votes decided the contest. That’s fewer people than you’ve got Instagram followers. Don’t be a sore loser. Or a braggart winner. In our house, if you lose and throw a temper tantrum, you will sit in time out. By the same token, if you win and rub it in your opponent’s face, you will also be reprimanded. No matter how this election turns out, heed your mother’s advice. Be gracious, win or lose.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton takes the stage at a campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. November 6, 2016. Brian Snyder, Reuters WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for U.S. president, with stints as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but she is also a polarizing figure and a Washington insider with decades of political baggage. Should Democrat Clinton, 69, defeat Republican Donald Trump, 70, in Tuesday's election, she would become the first woman elected U.S. president, having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party. Clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in 2008, losing her party's nomination to Barack Obama. Her time on the American political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in U.S. society. Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton. Clinton's admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist. Clinton entered the 2016 race as her party's odds-on favourite, but was an establishment figure, the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage, at a time when voters seemed enamoured with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July. For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clinton's infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She famously complained in 1998 during her husband's presidency about a "vast right-wing conspiracy." Many Democrats back her for championing women's rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy. As President Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Iran's nuclear program, China's growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya in which the U.S. ambassador died. That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack. 'WHAT TO MAKE OF ME' A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up. "The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part," Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. "I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me." At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, "There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill - nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States." Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton "extremely careless" in her handling of classified information by email, but Obama's Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges. "If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently," Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a "mistake" for which she took responsibility. The controversy flared again on Oct. 28 when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe, but said their significance was unclear. Trump seized on the probe into Clinton's email, deriding her as "Crooked Hillary," saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant "lock her up." Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief. "Such a nasty woman," Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy. MIDWESTERN ROOTS Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a "rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican" and a mother who was a closet Democrat. She said she inherited her father's distinctive laugh - she called it "a big rolling guffaw" - and Americans have heard it frequently. She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club. In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator. Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat. At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couple's only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980. As Arkansas' first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member. Most Americans were introduced to her during her husband's bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get "two for the price of one" if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who "stayed home and baked cookies." After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynette's song, "Stand by Your Man." "You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette," she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. "And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him," she added. Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values. WHITE HOUSE CONTROVERSIES Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors. Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as "Hillarycare." At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights." She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted "conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he 'knew about Whitewater.'" In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behaviour related to Whitewater. In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with "high crimes and misdemeanours" for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a "Soviet-style show trial" and condemned what she called "an attempted congressional coup d'etat." She also said she "wanted to wring Bill's neck" for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counselling. "All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does," she wrote in her 2003 book "Living History." Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009. She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the party's nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president. In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump. "What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn't stop caring, and she doesn't stop trying. And she never stops fighting for us, even if we haven't always appreciated it," Obama told a September rally.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Hanes Introduces FreshIQ Technology Innovation across Men’s Apparel Basics to Drive Organic Growth, ‘End the Smellfie’ Hanes, a Brand Known for Delivering Superior Comfort, Becomes First to Add Advanced Odor Protection Benefit to Everyday Underwear and Socks; Supports Innovation Across Core Line with Whiff of Humor WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Hanes, America’s No. 1 apparel label and flagship brand of HanesBrands (NYSE: HBI), is launching FreshIQTM Advanced Odor Protection Technology across its line of men’s underwear, socks, T-shirts and fleece products. Hanes FreshIQ underwear and socks, which offer antimicrobial protection, for men are available at major retailers and directly to consumers through the brand’s website and in owned stores. Additional products will be introduced through fall of 2017. Marketing support, including a campaign to “End the Smellfie,” debuted Oct. 31 with national television commercials and coordinated digital advertising. “FreshIQ will differentiate Hanes and be a competitive advantage in the marketplace – exactly what we are trying to accomplish with our Innovate to Elevate strategy,” said HanesBrands Chief Executive Officer Gerald W. Evans Jr. “We are the first mainstream brand to include odor-control technology in everyday underwear and socks, and research among consumers indicates that this benefit will generate organic core growth in our basics line.” Sidney Falken, chief branding officer for HanesBrands, added, “We are really proud of our long history of innovations that provide consumers with superior comfort. From the Tagless T-shirt to X-Temp underwear and socks to ComfortFlex Fit bras, we are on a mission to make the world a more comfortable place.” FreshIQ is an antimicrobial finish that physically inhibits bacteria growth. Textiles naturally aid in the growth of bacteria by providing nutrients, and odor is a byproduct of bacterial growth during the time period in which the product is worn. The brand’s FreshIQ marketing takes a lighthearted, relatable approach to product benefits – turning the issue of odor into an opportunity for consumers to feel fresher and be more confident throughout their day. The End the Smellfie campaign highlights men in a variety of settings – at the office, in a wedding and on a bus – doing “self-checks,” such as an underarm sniff, for freshness. But Hanes FreshIQ offers consumers a “smarter way to stay fresh.” Television commercials can be seen on ESPN, and on programs such as the NFL on CBS and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, among others. Digital advertising will run on Facebook and Instagram. “Hanes is obsessed with comfort and that includes helping our consumers be more confident,” Falken said. “Our research indicates FreshIQ will be the biggest news for Hanes since the launch of the Tagless T-Shirt, which fueled double-digit growth for the brand.” Consumers who want to breathe easy in what they are wearing can find Hanes FreshIQ products online at www.Hanes.com and in stores at Wal-Mart, Target, Kohl’s, JCPenney and other retailers, where robust displays will offer consumers bonus packs to drive trial. Visit www.Hanes.com for additional information on FreshIQ and other Hanes products.

Scott Levine (scott81236) Nov 7, 2016 at 8:17AM Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) is set to release its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 7, and as usual, investors will surely be charged up to see how this leader in fuel-cell solutions fared. It's easy to be overpowered by the many facts and figures, so let's prepare by keying in on three things we can expect management to address in its report. Image source: Getty Images. Earning extra credit Unlike the solar and wind industries, which rejoiced when Congress passed a spending bill that extended tax credits for solar and wind technologies, the fuel-cell industry has been left out in the cold. According to management, the lack of inclusion was due to an oversight -- an oversight that many members of Congress are intent on remedying. On the company's second-quarter conference call, Andy Marsh, Plug Power's CEO, reported that he, "along with a broad coalition of industry advocates," has spent many months in Washington "working with Congress to expand the current investment tax credit legislation to include fuel cells." Furthermore, Marsh reported that there is bipartisan support to extend the credits, and it's likely that this goal will be accomplished when Congress returns after the election. The extension of the investment tax credit is crucial for the fuel-cell industry to thrive, so investors should be focused on any insights that management provides. An unlikely target -- or two At the beginning of the year, management identified a target of using less than $20 million in operating cash flow for fiscal 2016. And as recently as the company's Q2 earnings release, management affirmed the target. Image source: Plug Power corporate website. Considering the company has reported $15.8 million in negative operating cash flow through the first half of the year, it seems rather brash that management would reiterate this guidance, suggesting that it will use less than $5 million in operating cash flow through the second half of the year. Doubling down on the aggressive targets, Marsh suggested, "Growth in sales and margin, while being vigilant on keeping administrative costs in check, will enable us to achieve positive cash flows and EBITDAS in the near term." Marsh should be more circumspect in suggesting that the company will achieve breakeven on an EBITDAS basis. On a conference call in 2013, he suggested the company would achieve breakeven on an EBITDA basis in fiscal 2014. Instead, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $84 million.  Staying grounded One of Plug Power's strengths is its ability to forge relationships with numerous companies across a range of industries. One example is the partnership it has developed with FedEx (NYSE:FDX). One of Plug Power's major initiatives is to provide solutions to the ground support equipment market, and through its relationship with FedEx, it continues to do that. On the Q2 conference call, Marsh announced that Plug Power has developed a second-generation air fuel cell system, which it intended to launch with FedEx in the third quarter. Moreover, he reported that the company is also "engaged with other potential customers."  Besides commentary on its GSE solutions, investors can look for management to address progress on its range extender program with FedEx; Plug Power expects to test the first units in the fourth quarter. Marsh also stated his belief that larger scale deployments of 500 to 1,000 units could come within the next 12 to 18 months. Service with a Buckeye smile Earlier, in October, Plug Power announced the opening of its new service center in Dayton. Ohio. In addition to expanding service capabilities to its Ohio customers -- Wal-Mart, Ace Hardware, Home Depot, and Honda -- the Dayton service center will also provide parts and maintenance for GenDrive fuel cell units in the Midwest region and GenFuel stations throughout the nation. It's too soon to evaluate the impact the Dayton service center will have on Plug Power's services business; nonetheless, investors should look for management to provide some insight during its presentation. Image source: Getty Images. Whereas the company has reported a 16.7% gross margin on sales of fuel-cell systems and related infrastructure through the first half of fiscal 2016, it has also reported a negative-10.1% gross margin on services performed on fuel-cell systems and related infrastructure. Perhaps the Dayton service center, which management foresees growing by 50%, will go a long way in driving the company's services business to profitability. Keying in to new relationships One of the criticisms of Plug Power's business has been the lack of diversity among its customers. In fiscal 2015, for example, Wal-Mart accounted for 56.7% of total consolidated revenue. Adding the French retailer Carrefour SA, among others, the company has made headway in diversifying its customer base. Equally important -- if not more -- for Plug Power is selling these new customers on its turnkey solution, GenKey. Once a new customer installs the GenKey system -- committing to a hydrogen-based solution -- that customer is likely to maintain a relationship with Plug Power, thus providing a continuous revenue stream. In the beginning of the year, management had forecast more than 25 GenKey installs for fiscal 2016, and it reiterated this guidance during the Q2 presentation. Through the first half of the year, however, Plug Power has installed only nine. Presumably, there should be many new installs that management will be reporting for the third quarter. The takeaway Management has been generous in providing a forecast for fiscal 2016; however, its generosity may end up doing more harm than good. Should the company fail to achieve its guidance, it would be yet another example of how management's forecasts are nothing more than a boy crying "wolf."

Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com Smithfield Finance Director Greg Siler gives a presentation on the town’s 2015-16 finances and its annual audit. Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com Smithfield Mayor Andy Moore, left, shakes hands with Fire Chief John Blanton as he hands over thank-you gifts for staff who worked during Hurricane Matthew and in the aftermath of the storm. Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com 1 of 3 i By Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SMITHFIELD The town is in good financial health, according to an audit of its 2015-16 books. Like other North Carolina towns, Smithfield pays an independent accounting firm to look over its books once each fiscal year. This year, the town received “an unmodified opinion,” which, in auditor speak, means Smithfield is spending taxpayer money properly and its accounts are healthy. Finance Director Greg Siler summed up the town’s 2015-16 fiscal year in a report to the town council on Nov. 1. Smithfield’s general fund took in slightly more than $13 million last fiscal year, up about 1 percent over the year before. Most of that money came from property taxes and sales taxes. The town’s tax base this past year was $1.07 billion, virtually unchanged from the prior year, Siler said. General fund spending, including transfers to other funds, totaled $11.97 million in 2015-16, up 4.6 percent, or $530,000, from the prior year. Siler attributed the higher spending to Smithfield paying off three loans early. The town spends most of its general fund dollars on public safety (36.6 percent), culture and recreation (13.9) and streets and vehicles (11.6 percent.) On June 30, the end of the fiscal year, Smithfield’s savings, or rainy-day fund, stood at $6.7 million, up $1.24 million from the prior year. The savings is equal to 56 percent of general fund spending, well above the 8 percent the state requires. “You want a healthy number there,” Siler said of the rainy-day fund. “You want this kind of money on hand for catastrophic events.” Siler said Smithfield had made considerable strides since 2012, when it had next to nothing in its rainy-day fund. The town’s debt stands at $8.88 million, down about $1.3 million from a year ago. The water and sewer fund, which had been hemorrhaging money, is still leaking, Siler said, but is “much improved over the prior year.” The fund is “still not completely supporting itself,” Siler said, but took in $5.78 million this past year, nearly $300,000 more than the year before. Water and sewer expenses, meanwhile, totaled $6 million, creating a slight deficit that taxpayers had to make up. Still, the year-ago deficit in the fund was $1.27 million, Siler noted. Siler said the electric fund is “in good shape,” with revenues of $18.1 million and expenses of $15.44 million this past year. Revenues were down about $1.8 million from last year, but expenses fell $3.34 million. Looking ahead Siler said Smithfield is facing some spending needs in the near future. Among them: ▪  $3.5 million in expenses related to extending Booker Dairy Road behind the Belk and Walmart shopping centers. ▪  $1.4 million to replace a transformer at the Brogden Road substation. ▪  A total of $999,000 this year and next to rehab the town’s aging sewer lines. ▪  $369,000 for sludge-handling equipment at the water plant. ▪  $195,000 for a records-management system. Around town Town Mike Scott brought the council up to date on some projects around town: ▪  The water-logged aftermath of Hurricane Matthew continues to delay the rebuilding of Venture Drive. ▪  The town has awarded a contract for greenway repairs, but the contractor will have to wait until Raleigh stops releasing water from Falls Lake. ▪  Smithfield figures it has about $650,000 in reimbursable expenses from Hurricane Matthew. It is meeting with FEMA representatives to settle on a dollar amount. The town suffered damage to its infrastructure, including streets, the Hospital Road substation and water and sewer systems.

Even though the merchandise and business models vary, digital sales are rarely a priority, resulting in fairly low ecommerce penetration across the board, as explored in a new eMarketer report, “Discount Retailers and Digital Commerce 2016: Trends and Benchmarks” (eMarketer PRO customers only). According to US Department of Commerce figures, discount and variety store sales growth has remained steady over the past decade, climbing from $459.89 billion in 2007 to $546.57 billion in 2015. The sector’s percentage of total retail sales, however, hit a low last year, at 17.1%. eMarketer groups big-box mass merchants, warehouse clubs and dollar stores under the discount and variety sector. Of course, a Wal-Mart, Costco and Dollar Tree have different models and unique challenges. However, they do share a relatively low level of ecommerce penetration—around 3% for the leaders in the sector. There are several reasons for this. The small profit margins of dollar stores don’t easily translate digitally. Warehouse clubs, with bulk sales and membership fees, have also been late to investing digitally, and now upstarts like Jet.com and Boxed Wholesale are encroaching on their territory. Additionally, groceries—a category slow to come online—make up a fair portion of discount and variety sales. It’s nearly impossible to talk about this sector and not bring Amazon into the discussion, as the online retailer arguably poses the largest threat to this group. Discount and variety stores compete on price, but they can’ always match Amazon’s appeal in other areas. According to RBC Capital Markets, Amazon was the leading retail site used by US internet users in September 2016 (89%). eBay ranked second (35%), followed by Walmart.com (33%) and Target.com (21%). When judged on selection, convenience and price, Amazon blew away all of the included retailers, while Walmart.com’s only claim was a distant second place finish for convenience (8%).

Its stores nationwide will open at 5pm (local time) on Thursday, November 24 and remain open through 11pm on Friday, November 25 for 30 hours of continuous shopping*. Readying the stores to offer doorbuster savings on the season's must-have toys, Toys"R"Us has hired thousands of helpful elves to begin stocking the shelves.

The holiday is called Singles' Day and it's held every year on November 11. It's like China's version of Cyber Monday, but seven times as big. Alibaba — China's largest e-commerce company — has helped turn Singles' Day into the biggest shopping frenzy in the world by offering deep discounts during the 24-hour period on items as varied as cars and clothes. Hundreds of other companies have started taking part in the cyberspending blitz over the years by offering discounts of their own. So why don't more Americans' participate in Singles' Day — or even know what it is? US retailers are largely to blame, as most of them have been reluctant to add another "Black Friday" or "Cyber Monday" to their fall calendars. "All retailers are laser-focused on ramping up for the period from Black Friday to Christmas," says Danny Silverman, head of product strategy at ecommerce analytics firm Clavis Insight. "To participate in Singles' Day would sap sales from that critical period." This would be a risky move "particularly for publicly held companies where Black Friday to Christmas sales are considered indicators of retailer and market health," he said. © Reuters An employee sorts packages at a hub of Shentong (STO) Express delivery company in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, November 11, 2014. Singles' Day also coincides with Veterans Day in the US, and some retailers already plan promotions tied to that holiday, says Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, an e-commerce solutions provider that owns FreeShipping.com. Several US-based companies do in fact participate in Singles' Day — including Walmart, Macy's, Gap, Target, and Costco — but very few of them offer deals to domestic shoppers. Most of them target Chinese shoppers on Alibaba's shopping websites Tmall and Taobao. © Reuters Workers sort packages after Singles' Day in 2015. In fact, Costco was the top TMall Global seller on Singles' Day last year. The company sold about $3.14 million worth of products in a single hour, according to Alibaba. The most popular brands sold on Singles' Day last year include Uniqlo, Nike, Adidas, and New Balance. Overall, Alibaba generated $14.3 billion in sales on Singles' Day last year. This year, sales are expected to reach $20 billion in the 24-hour period, according to the research firm Fung Global Retail and Technology. By comparison, Americans spent $5.8 billion online last year on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, the largest sales days in the US. Caporaso says its only a matter of time before more US retailers take advantage of Singles' Day and start promoting it domestically. "Last year, QVC, Michael Kors, and Bloomingdale’s offered specific promotions, and we expect a similar showing this year, with additional retailers potentially joining the festivities as Singles’ Day approaches," Caporaso says.  So US shoppers should keep their eyes peeled on Singles' Day, because there might be some unexpected deals coming their way.
