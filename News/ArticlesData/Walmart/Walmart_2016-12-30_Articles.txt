Print Email Paul Milo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Paul Milo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author on January 01, 2017 at 5:05 AM comments Two major retailers, Walmart and Target, are expected to go head-to-head for shoppers looking to ring in New Year's Day 2017 with some shopping therapy Sunday. Here's a closer look at when the stores will open and close on New Year's Day, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017: When is Walmart open on New Year's Day? Most Walmart stores will be sticking to the normal 7 a.m. (EST) through midnight store hours on Sunday. Those stores that are normally opened 24 hours a day also are sticking to those hours, according to the store websites we checked. Still, it's always smart to with your local store before heading out. You can get to customer service at the chain 24/7/365 online with this feedback menu. And if you need to find the Walmart store nearest you, use this store locator, which also lists hours specific to each location: Where's the Walmart nearest me? The Walmart grocery circular this week (it runs through Jan. 7) is loaded with party specials if you need to make a last-minute run Sunday to stock up snacks for the final regular season week of NFL games. When is Target open on New Year's Day? While Target stores will close by 9 p.m. EST on New Year's Eve, they will reopen New Year's Day at 8 a.m. with most staying open to 9 p.m. However, store hours might vary and it is always smart on holidays to check hours. You can do that with the Target store locator. Find the Target store closest to you and search opening and closing hours at any Target store with this tool. If you need stores that are open 24/7, here's a guide to stores that have extended hours or will be open all night.      Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries N.J.

Posted on December 31, 2016 by admin There are a few things that pretty much everyone knows about Walmart: 1. They sell a lot of stuff! 2. They have great prices! 3. You can spend a lot of money in their stores! But, while there are many reasons to do a good deal of your shopping in this type of large-scale retail environment, there are still some products that are better bought online, and Garcinia Cambogia seems to be one of them. So, before you head out to buy your Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart, here is some information that might help you decide. What Is Garcinia Cambogia? This is a natural weight loss product that is made from the extract of the tamarind fruit, which is a small pumpkin-looking fruit that is grown in certain parts of India. This fruit is extremely high in anti-oxidants, which we all know are great for your body, help to slow down the aging process, fight disease, and even inhibit the storage of fat. How Does This Supplement Work? This is one of the few natural products that actually attacks your weight problem on two fronts – it deals with hunger and it deals with stored fat. First and foremost, the extract from the tamarind fruit is known as an appetite suppressant, which means that you will feel less hungry throughout the day and you will eat less at each meal. That is obviously a big selling point. The other benefit of taking this product is that it helps to burn off the fat you already have while also preventing more fat from forming. So, you should see a weight loss in addition to a drop in size, especially around the middle of your body. Where Can You Buy Garcinia Cambogia? This is perhaps the trickiest aspect of the product, because it is extremely new and everyone is jumping onto the Garcinia Cambogia bandwagon. This product was initially only sold in health food stores, but when the story launched on a recent television program about how successful this product was, everyone sold out of it. A lot of people wanted to know if they could buy Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart, but because this is an enormous chain of stores, they are unable to act quickly enough to satisfy their buyers. It can take months for a new product to make it into Walmart stores. So, if you were able to buy Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart, then you were one of the few who did. The good news is that you can now buy this supplement for weight loss online, where it is not only cheaper than it is at Walmart, but you will get a money back guarantee. What Kind of Guarantee Will You Get? There aren’t a lot of retail stores that will give you a guarantee on the effectiveness of a diet pill, and that is why you don’t want to buy Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart. When you buy it online, you will have a full 30 days to try it out and if it doesn’t work for you (or you don’t like it for any reason), you can return it. This is obviously reason enough to buy this product other than at the large superstores, and when you go to one of the Garcinia Cambogia retailers, you will be able to learn more about what this powerful anti-oxidant, appetite suppressant, and fat burner can do for you, too.

The company's shares have plunged by more than 64 percent in 2016 as foot traffic fell at its more than 4,400 U.S. stores and customers cut down on buying vitamins and nutritional supplements. Once a Wall Street darling, GNC's market value has dropped by about $5 billion since its peak in 2013 as it battled slumping sales and aggressive competition from online sellers and Wal-Mart Stores. Even after the decline, only one of the 10 analysts who follow the stock recommend buying it. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Moran, a board member who took the helm in July, is trying to turn around the operation. He's unifying GNC's pricing system to make it less confusing, rolling out promotions and boosting loyalty programs in an attempt to relaunch the brand. The chain will also run its first-ever commercial during the Super Bowl in February, a bold but costly gambit. "I'm very skeptical about what they are trying to do right now," said Seema Shah, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "There're no new innovative products, and there's more competitive pricing across the board. None of what they are doing changes that." In October, Moran said the company's third-quarter financial results "continued to be unacceptable" and that it has a "badly broken business model in need of a change." GNC revenue has dropped for three straight quarters. The retailer has also held discussions with several Chinese suitors about a possible sale, but those talks have stalled following disagreements over the structure of a deal, people with knowledge of the matter said this month. GNC's troubles come as other retailers are also suffering from declining mall traffic and heavy discounting. Macy's Inc. is closing 100 stores, and J.C. Penney cut its sales forecast. Weak tourism traffic prompted fashion houses Michael Kors Holdings and Kate Spade & Co. to lower their full-year earnings forecasts and reduce inventory at department stores to rein in promotions. GNC has been battered by Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp., which lured away customers by offering cheaper prices and devoting more space to vitamins and supplements, said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. "There's stiff competition out there, and lower prices are always better if you're spending a lot on vitamins, especially because some of the niche supplements can be pricey," Feinseth said. GNC was a much different company when it went public in 2011, and shares more than doubled in the first year of trading. Several innovative products brought in new consumers, including diet pill Garcinia Cambogia, which was developed by Mehmet Oz, the television personality known as Dr. Oz. GNC hasn't introduced products that have caught fire with shoppers in the past few years, said Shah. With annual sales of about $2.6 billion and 9,000 locations across the globe, Pittsburgh-based GNC is the largest specialty retailer of health, wellness and performance products. Yet its size doesn't translate into market dominance: GNC controls less than 8 percent of the $35 billion supplement business, said Shah. "They have to figure out a way to get people interested in going to them," she said. "If you sell a commodity product, you would have to be the lowest price or you have to have some amazing experience." To that end, GNC is spending $8 million to $10 million on employee training and other marketing strategies to help in-store customers shop with tablets. It's also introduced a new loyalty program to entice shoppers with incentives and a new mobile app to draw online consumers. Earlier this week, the company closed its U.S. stores for a day to overhaul its pricing. "The New GNC leaves the old, broken model behind," Moran said in a statement this month. "We're confident it will have a positive impact on the business, but it will take time for the changes to take hold and translate to improved financial results." GNC's next major campaign will be the Super Bowl commercial, which it hopes will raise awareness and drive interest in the brand, Moran said. CBS Corp. last year charged a reported $5 million for a 30-second spot. That would represent 8 percent of GNC's ad budget last year, said Sean Naughton, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. He called the buy a "risky marketing decision." Feinseth of Tigress was also skeptical about the big game. "The Super Bowl is probably one event that people eat the most unhealthy food possible," he said. "I don't think advertising for GNC during the Super Bowl would be for the right people. They are not going to be in the right frame of mind. I don't know why a vitamin retailer would do that."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Garrison Keillor: Done. Over. He's here. Goodbye.

Times Community News Burbank Leader News Year in Review: Media City had a busy 2016 New Walmart in Burbank Raul Roa / Staff Photographer The new Walmart Supercenter on N. Victory Place in Burbank held its grand opening on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. The new Walmart Supercenter on N. Victory Place in Burbank held its grand opening on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (Raul Roa / Staff Photographer) Burbank Leader staff Changes at Hollywood Burbank Airport A lot has happened, and many things are in the works, at Hollywood Burbank Airport. Since 1978, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority has been trying to replace the 14-gate terminal, which was originally built in 1930. After years of litigation, pushback from residents and persistence, 2016 saw a shift for airport officials. In the Nov. 8 election, Burbank residents approved Measure B, allowing the airport authority to construct a 355,000-square-foot, 14-gate terminal on a plot of land at the airfield known as the B-6 parcel in the northeast quadrant of the airfield. Once the construction on the new facility is completed, the other terminal will be demolished. Join the conversation on Facebook >> Bob Hope Airport File photo In the Nov. 8 election, Burbank voters approved Measure B with 69% of the vote, allowing airport officials to move forward with plans to build a 14-gate replacement terminal at Hollywood Burbank Airport. In the Nov. 8 election, Burbank voters approved Measure B with 69% of the vote, allowing airport officials to move forward with plans to build a 14-gate replacement terminal at Hollywood Burbank Airport. (File photo) On election night, 29,587 voters, or 69.7% of those who voted, supported Measure B and gave the airport authority the green light to move forward with its terminal project. Burbank's airport saw a few more changes during the year, such as getting a new name. In 2003, the airport authority legally changed and marketed the facility as Bob Hope Airport as a tribute to iconic comedian Bob Hope. Officials were looking to attract more travelers east of the Colorado Rockies and decided that a new name was needed. Working with South Pasadena branding firm Anyone Collective, the airport authority selected Hollywood Burbank Airport as the new brand name. However, the airport will legally remain Bob Hope Airport. Along with a new moniker, Anyone Collective helped create a new logo for the airport, which is a two-toned chevron with an image of an airplane in the middle.

(Courtesy of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority) With or without the new name and logo, the airport has already seen a bump in passengers this year. The airfield had a rough start at the beginning of 2016, but the number of passengers grew each month from May through October compared to last year. Also, the tallies were higher, in most cases, than airport officials had projected. Walmart opens at the Empire Center The Walmart Supercenter in the Burbank Empire Center finally opened its doors to the public after being delayed for several years due to pushback from some residents and litigation. The 143,000-square-foot remodeled retail facility, which used to be a Great Indoors store, employs about 400 people, many of whom are Burbank residents or live in the surrounding area. The Burbank Walmart was one of the first stores in Southern California to introduce large black overhead signs with a picture and description of each store section. It also was the first to set up its produce and bakery sections to mimic the feel of a farmer's market.

Victory Place in Burbank for the location's grand opening on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (Raul Roa / Staff Photographer) The store was set to open in 2013, but a lawsuit between three residents and the city made the retail chain pump its brakes. The residents claimed that construction on the store should not start until street improvements are made to address the additional traffic. After a few years in court, the 2nd District Court of Appeal sided with Walmart, saying that the city should not have stopped the retailer from getting its building permits. However, the city did need to address the traffic in that area, according to the ruling. In April, the City Council approved a supplemental environmental impact report that stated that traffic improvements did not need to be made currently. Low police morale impacting department Current and former officers with the Burbank Police Department expressed low morale and dissatisfaction within the organization, according to police union survey administered earlier this year. Approximately 75% of the officers who answered the survey felt morale was low, and one officer wrote that working at the department is "depressing." About 60% surveyed indicated they wouldn't recommend working for the organization to their relatives or friends. Officials with the Burbank Police Officers' Assn. said the survey was meant as a way to identify problems within the department and work with leadership to fix and improve conditions.

Lundigan Park, in Burbank on Thursday, Feb. 4, 2016. (Tim Berger / Staff Photographer) Survey respondents offered several suggestions for changes that could be made, including the hiring of more officers, increasing special assignments and work on improving overall leadership. They also suggested the department should end its use of predictive-policing technology, which utilizes crime reports to predict potential problems areas. Officers are then required to spend 15 minutes in each of three identified areas. Critics said the system would sometimes come up with obvious areas to patrol, such as the Empire Center, where shoplifting is known to occur, and even the police station, where people come to report crimes. The department suspended its use of the technology in October after receiving pushback from officers. Bicycles banned on Mariposa Street Bridge After several months of arguing and pleading their case with the Burbank City Council, equestrians persuaded members to ban bicycles from the Mariposa Street Bridge, which connects Burbank to Griffith Park. Many horse-owning residents in Burbank and elsewhere complained that bicyclists were making the bridge unsafe and that bikes easily startle horses, possibly leading to injuries for the rider. In December 2015, council members approved an ordinance that allowed bicyclists to walk or carry their bikes across the bridge but barred them from riding across it. However, many equestrians did not like the compromise and asked the City Council to outright ban bikes from the 140-foot-long bridge. In February, the City Council approved the bicycle ban on the bridge, which rubbed one Burbank resident the wrong way. Doug Weiskopf claimed that the ban was unenforceable and decided to test the city's new ordinance throughout the summer . During an afternoon in May, Weiskopf attempted to get a citation or be arrested by Burbank Police. He even called the police on himself, but all he received was a warning. Police department establishes new unit In response to growing community concerns over a rise in gang activity, the Burbank Police Department established a new hybrid gang-enforcement unit in June. Made up of four officers who are overseen by two patrol sergeants, the unit is tasked with contacting gang members and gathering intelligence while also handling regular service calls. The department had been without gang officers for the last two years because of staffing shortages. During that two-year period, a single detective from the agency's vice/narcotics unit handled gang-related crimes. The lack of gang officers drew criticism from residents as the city experienced an increased number of violent, gang-related crimes this year including several shootings and stabbings. Eighty-nine gang-related crimes were reported by police last year, and almost half of them involved graffiti. Juniors refuse to take state exam Nearly 300 juniors refused to take the state's standardized exam in April after Burbank High student Sam Gorman initiated a school-wide opt-out movement, alerting them how to get out of the test with a parent's signature.

Junior Sam Gorman initiated an effort that led to nearly 270 students opting out of the state standardized exam at Burbank High School. (Courtesy of Sam Gorman) Gorman stood against taking an exam based on "big data and redundant standards instead of the acquisition of long-lasting knowledge," he said. In all, about 350 Burbank High juniors out of about 640 took the test. Burbank Unified Supt. Matt Hill said he heard from both students and parents about juniors' desires to take and prepare for other exams, such as the SAT, ACT and AP tests, to determine if they are ready for college. "I'd encourage the state to continue to look into the value of administering the test to our juniors," Hill said. Investigation leads to change Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights closed its investigation into Burbank Unified several months after a Burbank parent alleged discrimination against her son based on his disability. Kelly Duenckel filed a complaint after her son, Robert, who has learning disabilities, was told he would not participate in a popular cow-eye dissection lab, which he ultimately did after Duenckel pressed school officials to include her son and fellow special-education students in the lab. The complaint alleged that special-education students were denied an opportunity to participate in science labs that were provided to general-education students. The investigators found that general-education students completed 45 science labs compared to the 26 labs that special-education students completed during the 2015-16 school year. Investigators closed the case after learning Burbank school officials took immediate steps to resolve the allegations. As part of the changes, Burbank special-education students at all three middle schools have access to the same curriculum, labs, equipment and trained teachers as general-education students. Burbank parents influence National PTA convention When the National PTA passed four resolutions in July during a convention in Orlando, Fla., two of the four had been introduced by Burbank parents or students and already adopted by the California PTA. The first one, called "Homework: Quality over Quantity," pushes for more meaningful homework instead of a lot of it. It was drafted initially by John Burroughs High School parents Suzanne Weerts and Tina McDermott, who surveyed fellow parents and found that homework caused stress and tension in many homes. The second resolution passed at the National PTA convention was "Recognition of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) Individuals as a Protected Class." PTA members, including Steve Frintner and Barbara Miller, along with students, helped draft the resolution after former John Burroughs High student Brian Kaplun advocated for sexual-health-education curriculum acknowledging lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students and those who are exploring their sexual identity. Equine herpesvirus appears A section of the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had to be put under quarantine by the California Department of Food and Agriculture last month after several horses at the facility tested positive for equine herpesvirus, which resulted in one horse being euthanized because of the disease. The disease appeared at the equestrian center after eight horses returned from a horse show in Las Vegas on Oct. 27 through 29. One of the horses, a 5-year-old saddlebred, showed signs of severe neurological symptoms and had to be put to sleep for humane reasons. Another horse, a 10-year-old saddlebred, showed moderate signs of neurological symptoms and was put into quarantine, where it eventually recovered. The Department of Food and Agriculture becomes involved if the disease is found to be equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, a rare neurological form of the illness. Equine herpesvirus typically causes a respiratory infection for horses. As it stands, there were a total of 228 horses under quarantine and 15 cases of equine herpesvirus — eight of which were the rare neurological form and seven that were not. Officials with the state agency had to extend the quarantine at the equestrian center after they discovered that a horse owner took their horse back to their house while the facility was still under quarantine. To make matters worse for the equestrian center, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses canceled the annual Equestfest horse show at the facility because of the outbreak. Burbank on Parade expands event Burbank on Parade turned into an all-day affair to mark the 35th year of the annual celebration. In addition to the marching bands and dance groups that grace the parade each year, the April 23 event expanded to include a run/walk, a bicycle ride and a post-parade festival. While past parades included post-event activities, organizers said this year's festivities were a way to put the attractions surrounding the parade "into the limelight" and garner more participation. An estimated 10,000 people attended this year's parade. Burbank on Parade originally had its start in 1945 as a celebration for the end of World War II and went on for 12 years. It was revived in 1981 by a group of Burbank residents who wanted to a hold a spring festival celebrating life in the city.

Yet its size doesn’t translate into market dominance: GNC controls less than 8 percent of the $35 billion supplement business, said Shah. “They have to figure out a way to get people interested in going to them,” she said. “If you sell a commodity product, you would have to be the lowest price or you have to have some amazing experience.” To that end, GNC is spending $8 million to $10 million on employee training and other marketing strategies to help in-store customers shop with tablets. It’s also introduced a new loyalty program to entice shoppers with incentives and a new mobile app to draw online consumers. Earlier this week, the company closed its U.S. stores for a day to overhaul its pricing. “The New GNC leaves the old, broken model behind,” Moran said in a statement this month. “We’re confident it will have a positive impact on the business, but it will take time for the changes to take hold and translate to improved financial results.” Super Bowl GNC’s next major campaign will be the Super Bowl commercial, which it hopes will raise awareness and drive interest in the brand, Moran said. CBS Corp. last year charged a reported $5 million for a 30-second spot. That would represent 8 percent of GNC’s ad budget last year, said Sean Naughton, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. He called the buy a “risky marketing decision.” Feinseth of Tigress was also skeptical about the big game. “The Super Bowl is probably one event that people eat the most unhealthy food possible,” he said. “I don’t think advertising for GNC during the Super Bowl would be for the right people. They are not going to be in the right frame of mind. I don’t know why a vitamin retailer would do that.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Run-DMC Photo) Run-DMC, one of the most iconic acts in hip-hop history, is suing Amazon, Walmart, and Walmart-owned Jet.com for alleged copyright infringement The complaint, filed in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York, claims the retailers are selling products that illegally sport the group’s brand or logo. Run-DMC is seeking $50 million in damages plus attorney fees. The group accuses Amazon and Walmart of “advertising, manufacturing, selling and distributing multiple products with the RUN-DMC trademark without the permission of RUN-DMC.” Run-DMC is asking the court to immediately ban the retailers from promoting or receiving payments for any products that uses the group’s brand without permission. Two alleged knockoffs called out in the Run-DMC complaint. The complaint identifies several manufacturers of the products in question, including Vision and Infinity. Run-DMC says the retailers are culpable for selling the products and in Amazon’s case taking a greater stake. “Defendant Amazon sells and advertises many of the products directly or fulfills the orders for the infringing products for Vison and Infinity,” the complaint says. “Amazon, Vision and Infinity split the proceeds from the selling of various products that directly infringe on the Plaintiff’s trademark and/or trades on the goodwill of Plaintiff’s trademark.” It’s not the first time a seller has sued Amazon for its role in violating intellectual property. In 2015, a judge sided with Amazon after a seller sued the company for selling a counterfeit novelty pillowcase, but said he was troubled by the law that led to the decision in Amazon’s favor. Amazon has more recently been trying to crack down on sellers who use the site to hawk knockoffs. In November, the Seattle e-commerce giant filed two lawsuits against sellers of allegedly counterfeit goods. The lawsuits are believed to be a first for Amazon. GeekWire has contacted Amazon and Walmart for comment on the Run-DMC suit. View the Run-DMC complaint below.

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. FILE - In this Dec. 9, 2014 file photo, Darryl McDaniels of Run-DMC performs at Christmas in Brooklyn in New York. The rap group Run-DMC has filed a $50 million lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group's name without permission. The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Thursday, Dec. 29, 2016. (Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP, File) The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding. The group's hits include "King of Rock, "It's Tricky," and "Can You Rock It Like This." In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Durkin | 9:26 am, December 30th, 2016   Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rapped rhymes / Wal-Mart selling what they shouldn’t be, that’s their hard time. OK, it doesn’t quite flow as well as the original, but you get the point: Wal-Mart and Amazon are Sucker M.C.’s for selling licensed gear of the legendary hip-hop group Run-DMC without permission. And now? The retail giants are facing a $50 million lawsuit filed by Darryl “DMC” McDaniels. In the lawsuit, McDaniels alleges that Wal-Mart, Amazon, and Jet have been “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products,” that are strictly trademarked to the group. ABC notes that this list of gear includes, “glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, [and] wallets.” The lawsuit, which was filed yesterday in the Southern District of New York, furthers that the sale of these items has injured the brand of Run-DMC, improperly capitalizing on their popularity without the their approval. The iconic trio — comprised of McDaniels, Joseph “Rev. Run” Simmons, and the late Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell — has many licensing agreements with various companies regarding approved merchandising sales. Most notably is the group’s agreement with Adidas, the three-striped sneaker company whose iconic Superstar model the music group made famous in the 80s. To this day, Adidas continues to sell the Superstar sneaker with Run-DMC approved branding.

According to the extensively researched IPS report, “A Tale of Two Retirements,” 100 corporate CEOs possess company retirement funds totaling $4.7 billion — an amount equivalent to the entire retirement savings of 41 percent of U.S. families (50 million families, including 116 million Americans). The retirement funds of these 100 CEOs are also equivalent to those of 75 percent of Latino families, of 59 percent of African-American families, of 55 percent of female-headed households, and of 44 percent of white working class households. Indeed, the top 100 CEO nest eggs, if averaged, would generate a $253,088 monthly retirement check to these 100 individuals for the rest of their lives. By contrast, workers who had 401(k) pension plans at the end of 2013 had only enough in these plans to pay them an average monthly benefit of $101. Of course, these were the lucky ones. Among workers 56 to 61 years old, 39 percent had no employer-sponsored retirement plan at all, and would likely depend on Social Security, which pays an average of $1,239 per month, for retirement security. Of course, these are only averages. When one looks at individuals, the contrasts are even starker. Glenn Renwick, the Progressive Insurance Company’s CEO who retired in 2016, receives a monthly retirement check from his company for $1,035,733. Among Walmart’s 1.5 million employees, fewer than two-thirds have a company-sponsored retirement plan and, if they do, it will pay them, on average, only $131 per month. But Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon can expect to receive at least $360,000 per month — more than 2,700 times the amount a typical Walmart worker with a 401(k) account can expect. And there’s also CEO David Cote of Honeywell — a company that has locked out its workers from its factories in Green Island, N.Y. and South Bend, Ind. for seven months for rejecting a contract that eliminated workers’ pensions — who receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $908,712. Or take the case of John Hammergreen, CEO of the McKesson corporation, a drug wholesaling giant. A few months after Hammergreen arrived at McKesson in 1996, the company froze its employee pension fund, closing it to workers who came there in 1997. Even so, the company launched a lavish Executive Benefit Retirement Account that enriched Hammergreen’s pension with an average of $22,000 a day for the next 20 years. Thus, today he receives a monthly retirement check from the company for $782,339. Things were not always like this. From 1946 to 1980, a combination of union action and government policy led to the expansion of pension benefits for American workers. By 1980, 46 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit pensions. But, in the following decades, declining union strength, corporate attacks on pension funds, and government action resulted in a severe erosion of worker retirement security. By 2011, only 18 percent of private sector workers were covered by defined benefit plans. As demonstrated by the authors of the IPS report, the growth of economic inequality in retirement provisions resulted from rigging things in favor of CEOs through new rules for pensions, taxes, and executive compensation. “Since more than half of compensation is now tied to the company’s stock price,” the authors note, “CEOs have a powerful personal incentive for slashing worker retirement benefits in order to boost the short-term bottom line. Every dollar not spent on employee retiree security is money in the CEO’s pocket.” Although changes in public policy could close the widening pension gap, such changes do not seem likely to occur while a zealously pro-corporate party controls the White House, Congress, and the courts. Indeed, as the authors point out, thanks to the shielding of enormous CEO income in tax-deferred accounts, Fortune 500 CEOs will see very substantial gains in their retirement checks if President-elect Trump succeeds in implementing his plan to slash the top marginal income tax rate. It’s possible that, in the long run, the rising tide of retirement insecurity will spark a revolt challenging the severe economic inequality between corporate CEOs and their American workers. Until then, however, it’s tempting to propose updating Jonathan Swift’s 18th century satirical suggestion, made in “A Modest Proposal,” that poverty among the poor might be alleviated by selling their babies as food for the rich. Perhaps, in 21st century America, retirement insecurity might be alleviated by selling elderly workers to the corporate rich, who could use them for the burgers sold by their fast food companies.

(Photo by Vince Bucci/Getty Images) On Thursday, a founder for Run-DMC filed suit against Amazon and Wal-Mart for $50 million in damages, claiming trademark infringement because Amazon and Wal-Mart have allegedly been selling clothing and accessories with the group’s name without permission. Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run-DMC Brand LLC, says that the Run-DMC brand is “extremely valuable” in the suit and said that the brand has been used in several licensing agreements, including one to endorse Adidas. However, the suit says, the defendants are trading on the rap group’s good name, which hurts the licensing agreements that are in place. According to the suit, “plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage” unless the infringements start. In addition to Amazon and Wal-Mart, other defendants are named such as Jet.com and several companies that sell products through Amazon or do business with Amazon. McDaniels is seeking at least $50 million in damages for the products that infringe on his copyright.   Related Posts Chris Brown to box Soulja Boy over social media feud In hilarious skit, Obama ‘anger translator’ helps with farewell speech Naomi Campbell reveals she was almost robbed in Paris Sherri Shepherd sorry for posting Ricky Harris funeral video Serena Williams shows off her fiancé and engagement ring Viola Davis receives first star of new year on Hollywood Walk of Fame Post navigation Previous Previous post: Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee on Malia Obama: ‘I think we’d get along’ Next Next post: EMT robbed in the Bronx on Christmas made up entire story Get news in your inbox TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America Chris Brown to box Soulja Boy over social media feud Intelligence officials: Vladimir Putin ‘ordered’ campaign to influence presidential election In hilarious skit, Obama ‘anger translator’ helps with farewell speech Black Army sergeant finds ‘Die N—-r’ spray-painted on car Dylann Roof wore shoes with racist symbols in jail Michelle Obama delivers emotional final speech: ‘I hope I’ve made you proud’ Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Politics Living Video Inspire Health Entertainment News Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio ©2017 Entertainment Studios LLC Powered by PressHarbor.com theGrio Proudly powered by WordPress Theme: TheGrio Theme Prod (nbcthegrio).

ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK (AP) — The rap group Run-DMC filed a $50 million lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group's name without permission. A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding. The group's hits include "King of Rock, "It's Tricky," and "Can You Rock It Like This." In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscriber Services Classifieds Submit Announcements & News Market Place Classifieds Real Estate Your Community News Blotters Herkimer County Oneida-Verona New Hartford Rome Utica Oneida Indian Nation Whitestown Blogs - Living - Sports Sports: Anne Delaney Sports: John Pitarresi Sports: Ron Moshier Boilermaker College Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

We made our selection by looking through stories that were the most widely shared, read or stories that we felt were important to the Monroe community. While we can’t run the stories in their entirety, they can all be found online at www.monroecourier.com. The Castillo family Monroe comes together for Masuk teacher  Henry Adams once said, “A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.” For Jayson Castillo, his influence as a Spanish teacher at Masuk High School extends to the entire town as the Monroe community came together to raise money for his family after learning about his wife’s cancer diagnosis. “The students, the staff, the parents all love him. He loves what he does and it shows,” parent Kimberly O’Leary said. “The students flourish in his class and those who are struggling, he takes the time to work with them so they are successful.” Masuk star details life after football As a teenager, Casey Cochran’s exploits on the football field thrilled Masuk fans, quarterbacking the Panthers to the 2010 state championship. Casey Cochran Now, at age 22, Cochran suffers from chronic pain, panic attacks, anxiety and depression, the result, he said, of more than a dozen concussions suffered between age 11 and 20. Cochran recently published an essay, “13 Concussions” on the website ThePlayersTribune.com, a site founded by retired Yankee Derek Jeter as an outlet to let athletes communicate directly with fans. In his piece, Cochran recounts the play that ended his career, a hard hit from an opposing linebacker. “My head smacked off of the turf and everything went black. The only word I know to describe the first few moments after a concussion is limbo — there are a few moments between the world that you were just a part of and your new brain-injured reality. When I regained consciousness, I knew I was on the ground. My head was seized with tremendous pressure, and that same awful, familiar depression from previous head injuries came over me — like a dark, heavy blanket, swallowing me up.” Septic stalls Walmart project While shoppers may be anticipating a Walmart coming to Monroe, it may take longer than expected. According to the First Selectman Steve Vavrek, this Walmart would be constructed at 5 Victoria Drive, right off Route 25. He said there are developmental problems and a big one is the timing of many inspections from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). The chairman of Planning and Zoning Department of Monroe, Patrick O’Hara said this project is stalled because it needs a septic system, which is regulated by DEEP and they are waiting for an approval from this agency.    Cast of Matilda visits local theater company Members of the Matilda cast spoke with the Two Planks Theater Company. The members of Two Planks Theater Company of found themselves starstruck on Monday when cast members from Broadway’s Matilda dropped in for a visit. Monroe’s theater kids had the opportunity to ask the Broadway actors about auditions, training and how performing in Matilda has changed their lives, in addition to watching a short performance by the cast. The Matilda cast also said that it’s important to show off their personality during an audition and that there’s nothing wrong with asking questions during an audition. “Remember casting directors want you to do your best and they don’t want to mess you up,” one actor said about the audition process. Acker sentenced to one year in jail Fred Acker, the owner of the SPCA of Connecticut animal shelter based in Monroe, was sentenced to one year in jail on Tuesday at Milford Superior Court. Frederick Acker Prior to the judge delivering her sentence Deputy Assistant State’s Attorney Matt Kalthoff said that Acker’s desire to continue working with animals is outrageous considering his numerous animal cruelty convictions. “He continues to push this hero narrative. Mr. Acker is far from the only option available here [to care for the animals]; in fact, the evidence shows he is a bad option,” Kalthoff said. Acker’s attorney, Igor Kuperman, responded by saying that Acker recognizes that he “made poor choices.” Kuperman also said that Acker is sorry for his bad decisions but that he should still be able to interact with animals. Chalk Hill not permitted: Town is in violation of zoning regulations The Board of Finance held a joint meeting with the Town Council, Board of Education and Planning and Zoning Commission on Nov. 7 to discuss what should be done with the vacant Chalk Hill School. Essentially, the big issue the town has to face is whether to keep the building for town use or get rid of it. However, during the meeting the officials were faced with the more immediate concern that they’re currently in violation of their own regulations by using the building. Patrick O’Hara, planning and zoning commissioner, said that despite the ongoing programing at Chalk Hill the town does not have the necessary permits to use the building for the Parks and Recreation activities located in the building. Near-death experience inspires Monroe stationery store Her lungs collapsed and her heart stopped for 19 minutes during the birth of her son, and when she came to, everything changed. Sabrina Autera is the owner of the Joyful Noise Paper Company in Monroe. Sabrina Autera of Fairfield said her near-death experience with amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) inspired her to find Christianity, refocus her life on her family and start her company, the Joyful Noise Paper Company. Women who have AFE have a 20% survival rate. It is a rare, but life threatening condition that occurs when amniotic fluid or fetal material enter the mother’s blood stream. Autera said she was a Buddhist before she had her son, and that the embolism turned her life upside down. “That whole situation changed everything,” she said. “It was different after that.” After AFE, Autera said she turned to Christianity and decided to dedicate her time to her three children. But she struggled with survivor’s guilt, wondering why she lived when most women who suffer from AFE die. “It was like OK God, what do you have for me?’ After that it became, clear that I’m meant to raise my children because I almost didn’t,” she said. Community comes together for Katz family It’s said it takes a village to raise a child. It might be more fitting to say it takes a child to inspire a community. Anthony Katz is a typical teenager — he plays sports, he plays video games, he’s in the school play, and he was even named last year’s Homecoming king. However, Anthony has a particularly rare and severe form of muscular dystrophy called X- linked MTM1, which causes muscle weakness and decreased muscle tone. Anthony recently found out that he needs a 12-hour surgery to repair the scoliosis in his neck and back and that as part of his healing process he will have to be transported back and forth from a hospital in New York City over the course of six months. Unfortunately, the family hasn’t had much luck with its last two vans, which led Al DiGuido of Al’s Angels to launch a fund-raiser for the family’s new van. Katz named honorary Junior Firefighter Last week the Monroe Volunteer Fire Department named Anthony Katz an honorary Junior Firefighter. Anthony was given a helmet and other fire gear. Anthony has a particularly rare and severe form of muscular dystrophy called X-linked MTM1, which causes muscle weakness and decreased muscle tone. He is the only child in the state with this condition and is often referred to as a miracle because he was not expected to live past a year. Kevin Catalano, a representative of the Monroe Volunteer Fire Department, opened the ceremony, the content of which had been kept a secret from Anthony. “We’re here tonight for a special ceremony to honor an inspirational young man,” Catalano said. Council clash: Sidewalk project incites debate At Monday’s Town Council meeting, the discussion surrounding a project’s bidding waiver resulted in a clash between Town Council members and First Selectman Steve Vavrek that ended abruptly with Vavrek’s early departure from the meeting. He left after a discussion about a bidding waiver disrupted the council’s more civil proceedings. The tone became more heated, and after some additional back and forth between Town Council chairman Frank Lieto and Vavrek the discussion concluded with the following exchange: “You don’t know or you’re not willing to share information,” Lieto said. “Mr. Lieto, I’ve had enough — have a good night,” Vavrek said as he left in the middle of the meeting.

Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run-DMC Brand LLC, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, is seeking at least US$50 million (RM224.2 million) of damages from the retailers and other defendants over their alleged sale of glasses, hats, patches, T-shirts, wallets and other products that infringe the Run-DMC trademark registered in 2007. McDaniels called the Run-DMC brand “extremely valuable,” and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse sneakers from Adidas AG. He said the defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws. “Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage” unless the infringements are stopped, according to the complaint filed in the US District Court in Manhattan. Other defendants include Jet.com, an online retailer that Wal-Mart bought, and a variety of companies that do business with Amazon or sell products through Amazon. Amazon, Wal-Mart and Jet.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDaniels’ lawyer did not immediately respond to similar requests. Run-DMC was founded in the New York City borough of Queens in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell. It became one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s, including for the album Raising Hell and such songs as the Aerosmith cover Walk This Way and My Adidas. In 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

'Silicon Valley' star Kumail Nanjiani in Jet.com's debut television ad. Image: screenshot, jet By Patrick Kulp2016-12-30 01:22:16 UTC After a huge TV advertising blitz that lasted through much of the past year, Jet.com removed itself almost entirely from the airwaves this holiday season as it turned its full attention to the digital space. According to estimates from advertising tracking firm MediaRadar, the retail site cut out virtually all TV spending in the months following its sale to Walmart in August, while ratcheting up its online ad budget by a whopping 250 times what it spent in the same period the year before. SEE ALSO: Facebook's not alone: Twitter admits to overcharging advertisers The firm says the exponential jump marks by far the biggest online ad investment of any of the other much bigger e-commerce sites and retail chains it analyzed this holiday season. The switch-up seems to be part of a new marketing strategy Walmart is mapping for its digital property that will better mesh with its own corporate agenda.   Meanwhile, Jet's juggernaut rival Amazon took the opposite tack. Usually tight-fisted when it comes to TV commercials, the e-commerce giant splurged on television this season and outspent all of its big-box competitors, including Walmart, Target and Macy's. Amazon's TV spending was around 76 percent more than the same time last year, while Target's increased 54 percent and Walmart's dropped 10 percent. All three companies significantly upped their online ad presence too, with a 224-percent boost for Amazon and 161-percent boosts for Target and Walmart.  Amazon's big TV push seems to have paid off too; the company said this week that it had its most successful holiday season ever this year in terms of sales. "[In the past,] Amazon has achieved their incredible success without much reliance on traditional TV advertising," a MediaRadar spokesperson said in an email. "But, as Amazon goes completely mainstream, their marketing, too, has cast the widest net possible." Amazon's ads were also particularly well-received. The company managed to land two of the top five spots on research firm Ace Metrix's list of the most liked holiday commercials.

"Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage" unless the infringements are stopped, according to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.Other defendants include Jet.com, an online retailer that Wal-Mart bought, and a variety of companies that do business with Amazon or sell products through Amazon. Amazon, Wal-Mart and Jet.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDaniels' lawyer did not immediately respond to similar requests.Run-DMC was founded in the New York City borough of Queens in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell. It became one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s, including for the album "Raising Hell" and such songs as the Aerosmith cover "Walk This Way" and "My Adidas." In 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.The case is Run-DMC Brand LLC v Amazon.com Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-10011.

Damien Norman Hinsley, 26, pleaded guilty to assault, willfully resisting or obstructing a peace officer and possession of stolen property under $5,000 in Penticton Provincial Court Dec. 29. On the morning of Nov. 9 a Walmart employee observed Hinsley stealing clothing and DVDs valued at $370 putting it in a bag before heading for the front door. After telling him to stop Hinsley walked up and kicked her violently in the left tricep. “She described it as a roundhouse-type kick,” said Crown counsel Kurt Froelich. The woman did not need medical attention and suffered a bruise in the area where she was kicked. About 10 minutes later at 8:30 a.m. RCMP found Hinsley walking on Skaha Lake Road after the report of the theft and assault was called in. Hinsley ignored the officer’s command to stop. Backup arrived and two police officers were able to get Hinsley under control after he initially resisted. Hinsley has a criminal record with prior convictions for two charges of assault with a weapon, one for possession of stolen property and multiple fraud-charges related to stolen credit cards. Defence counsel Kathryn Lundman proposed a three-month house arrest. However, Froelich noted Hinsley had twice violated the terms of a conditional sentence order in the past. A psychological report indicated Hinsley suffered from methamphetamine-induced psychosis. After pre-trial custody credit, Hinsley has 43 days remaining on his sentence.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

After closing two hours earlier than in previous years on Christmas Eve and then staying closed on Christmas Day as is their custom, most Walmarts are running business as usual this weekend as we get set to close the books on 2016 and welcome a new year. As for store hours, most of the Walmarts we checked were sticking to their 7 a.m. (EST) through midnight hours, even on New Year's Eve. The stores that normally are open 24 hours a day also are sticking to those hours, according to store websites. Still, it's always a good idea to call and check before heading out, especially if you're making a last-minute dash for party supplies Saturday night. (As always, you can get to customer service at the chain 24/7/365 online with this feedback menu. And if you need to find the Walmart store nearest you, use this store locator, which also lists hours specific to each location: Where's the Walmart nearest me?) The Walmart grocery circular this week (it runs through Jan. 7) is loaded with party specials, including $1 2-liter bottles of Coke & Pepsi, and hard-to-resist prices on everything from shrimp trays to pizza bites. On the other side of the store, there are still plenty of deals on everything Christmas, including toys and electronics. The chain's website is also touting several specials available for in-store pickup, including Keurig coffee makers for $76.49 and a Sky Viper drone for $88.   Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries N.J.

The suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, claims the retailers are improperly profiting, infringing and diluting the group’s trademark. Run-DMC’s brand has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s, the group claims. “The products sold by the Defendants confuse the public as to the source of the products and suggests that RUN-DMC endorses the products,” the complaint says. “The Defendants are trading on the goodwill of Plaintiff.” Also Read: Run-DMC Reuniting for Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin In exhibits attached to the suit, Run-DMC identified several styles of sunglasses with descriptions including the group’s name, although there was no official endorsement from the group. They also included photographs of clothing for sale with modified versions of Run-DMC’s logo, which renders the group’s name in bold white text over a black background, framed by two horizontal red bars. “The RUN-DMC trademark is distinctive and is one of the most recognizable marks in all of the hip-hop industry,” the complaint says. “RUN-DMC has entered several licensing agreements for use of the trademark RUN-DMC, including a deal with Adidas for One Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000.00) to endorse a brand of sneakers. The brand is extremely valuable.” Amazon and Walmart (which also owns Jet) did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. Pamela Chelin contributed to this report.

JOANNE ELVES Special to The Globe and Mail Published Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016 5:00AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2016 12:32PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Rain-X and Tune It! anti-fog liquids Available at: Automotive-supply stores Price: 4.99 and up For the sake of science, we tested Rain-X and Tune It! anti-fog liquids from Wal-Mart on the bathroom mirror and the results were a little hazy. A mirror was sectioned into quarters for tests of both products, with a cleaned strip and a second section left untouched. Following the directions on the bottles, the remaining quarters were cleaned and all lint removed. Then, the anti-fog products were applied and rubbed in until they dried. The mirror was also buffed with a clean cloth. We then ran a hot shower to build up enough fog on the mirror. The part that wasn’t cleaned was extremely foggy. The section that was cleaned with window cleaner was noticeably less foggy and the sections with the anti-fog applications were not foggy. But, for both, it was wet and blurry, so that if you were to drive, your vision would be impaired. After a second shower, the application wasn’t even apparent. Testing them on the backseat window in the car wasn’t a good idea. The window looked like it was covered in plastic wrap and little fingers saw that as a vertical puddle to play in. The best method is simple: Keep the window clean of haze to leave fewer particles for moisture to cling to and give your car a chance to warm up before hitting the road.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Linsey D. Owens, 83, allegedly hit Christian Robertson, 48, with his car and then whacked him in the head with a golf club, the Daily Mail reported. It all began when Owens drove to a Nissan sales event in Sarasota, Fla., with a mailer that promised up to $20,000. Owens presented his scratch-off ticket at a tent and was rewarded with a $5 Walmart gift card that he threw away. After missing out on the jackpot, began “yelling and screaming profanities” about the $5 gift card, Robertson, 48, told WFLA. (Note: Video contains NSFW language) This is the video of an 83 yo man attaching a car salesman in Sarasota last night pic.twitter.com/eMXbrjbMOd — John Rogers (@WFLAJohn) December 29, 2016 “He was pissed off he got a gift card,” Robertson told the Herald-Tribune. Owens argued with some other employees and left the sale, according to Robertson. He returned about 15 minutes later and drove his car down an aisle where Robertson was helping other customers and bumped him with the side mirror of his car. He then got out of the car, opened the trunk, and got his golf club, Robertson said. Robertson, who lives in Fort Myers, said he can’t work until his face heals and he might not be able to work in Florida for months because of a damaged reputation. “You can’t sell $30,000 cars with a black eye,” he added. Owens was charged with two counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office.

In 2016, Trump became president of the United States, we dealt with the Zika outbreak, lost many of our Hollywood favorites, healed after the attack on the Brussels airport, and even experienced the release of “Pokemon Go.” But we had some big news here in the Panhandle too. So, we rounded up the five biggest stories that have impacted our area the most. The Panhandle Train Crash On Tuesday, June 28, two BNSF freight trains met head-on just outside of Panhandle, TX, causing the trains to derail and scatter the cars in every direction. The National Transportation Safety Board said one of the trains failed to slow at a yellow warning sign and continued through a red signal before crashing into the other train. The crash caused a major fire that burned in the days to follow, but most tragic was the loss of three BNSF conductors. Cody Owens, of Claude, Kenneth Smith and Lara Taylor, both of Amarillo, were all killed in the collision. The sole survivor of the crash, Derek Schilling, filed a lawsuit against BNSF in November for $1 million in damages. Walmart Hostage Situation Upset over a missed promotion, Walmart employee Mohammad Moghaddam entered the Walmart on Georgia Street the morning of June 14, fired a gunshot into the air, and then took the store manager and another employee hostage before he was fatally shot by the Amarillo Police Department’s SWAT team. The Amarillo Police Department cited the dispute between Moghaddam, 54, and the store manager as a strong motive. Surveillance video obtained by NewsChannel 10 shows panicked customers quickly escaping the store as Moghaddam forced the manager toward the office area while pointing a gun at his back. Shortly after the noon hour, tactical units found one hostage and later located Moghaddam and the store manager. Moghaddam was shot and killed. Neither hostage was injured. Creepy Clown Sightings A bizarre national fad made its way to the Panhandle in October as pranksters looking for a Halloween scare made nighttime appearances at parks, grocery stores, and even several neighborhoods. But a homeowner in Pampa made it clear to two clowns that he wasn’t joking around. He grabbed a pistol and fired a warning shot as soon as they entered his yard, according to police. Here’s to the clown trend not being part of 2017! The Death of Alexis Wartena In July, a widespread search effort for a 7-year-old girl with autism ended in tragedy when the Amarillo Police Department’s Dive Team recovered the body of Alexis Wartena in a playa lake behind a motel. The Wartena family was driving back home to California when they decided to stop in Amarillo for rest. Alexis disappeared from the family’s room in the late afternoon on July 18, beginning a 19-hour search effort by multiple area agencies. The Wartenas sat down with NewsChannel 10 for an in-depth interview about the tragedy. 11 Car Pile-up In June, around 11 p.m., six semi-trucks and five passenger cars were involved in a major crash which injured multiple people and claimed the life of one person. The deceased passenger was later identified by DPS as Tammy Page, of New York. The cause of the crash has been determined; however, some drivers reported strong winds and blowing dust which caused low visibility in that area during that time. Copyright 2016 KFDA.

These dividend giants have fallen on tough times, and that could spell opportunity for patient investors. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Dec 30, 2016 at 5:54PM Image source: Getty Images. Income investors have a strong preference for stocks that consistently hike their dividends. Since predictable cash flow is a priority, they pass over companies that can't show rising returns during the inevitable industry downturn. That's why many investors shop among the short list of Dividend Aristocrats, which are companies that boast an unbroken streak of at least 25 years of consecutive payout raises. A few members of that elite group have fallen out of favor recently and could represent solid long-term buys. Below, we'll look at the prospects for market-beating returns from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). Coca-Cola Coca-Cola is about as close as you can get to a recession-proof business. Through the world's largest distribution system, it slings nearly 2 billion servings of beverages around the globe each day. Its portfolio spans 500 brands, including four of the top five sparkling drink franchises on earth: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta, and Sprite. That unique market position has powered impressive income growth for investors as Coke raised its dividend in each of the last 54 fiscal years. However, the rate of growth is slowing: Coke's latest hike was just 6%, compared to 8% in 2015 and 9% in 2014. The beverage titan is struggling with weak volume growth due to consumers rejecting many of the core ingredients, including sugar, upon which it built its empire. It has responded by revamping its portfolio with products like Zero Sugar Coca-Cola, yet shares declined in 2016 even as the market surged higher. The recent installation of James Quincey as Coke's new CEO suggests the company aims to aggressively alter its cherished formulas so that all the industry's biggest growth isn't confined to rivals. Target Target's stock fell 2% in 2016, a year that saw the retailer hike its dividend by 7% to mark its 45th consecutive payout raise. Target is struggling even more than rival Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to find growth in a weak shopping industry: Customer traffic is down 1% over the last nine months while Wal-Mart has enjoyed a slight increase. Image source: Getty Images. The retailer has navigated through rough times like these before, though, thanks to a powerful pairing of price leadership in some product segments and premium offerings in others. That approach, which leans heavily on what management calls its signature categories (including beauty and apparel) leads to significantly higher profitability than peers. Its gross margin is 30% of sales, compared to Wal-Mart's 26%. Like most major retailers, Target's growth prospects are at least partially hobbled by the trend toward online shopping. Yet that's no reason for investors to ignore what, at 3.3%, amounts to one of the most generous dividend yields in the industry. Lowe's No matter what it does, Lowe's can't seem to break out of Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) long shadow. Despite a fast-growing store footprint, it trails its larger home-improvement rival in the key metrics of sales growth, profitability, and return on invested capital. It's no surprise, then, that shares fell by 6% in 2016, compared to a 2% gain for Home Depot and a 10% jump for the broader market. Image source: Getty Images. However, Lowe's dominates in the metric of dividend longevity. Its payout has ticked higher each year since 1961, and that streak includes the brutal three-year period around the housing market crises that forced Home Depot to pause its dividend raises. That makes Lowe's the only Dividend Aristocrat to represent the home-improvement industry, in part thanks to its more conservative capital allocation approach. The company allocates 35% of annual profits to dividends, compared to Home Depot's 50% target. Between the three choices, though, I'd bet on Coca-Cola at today's prices. Sure, it will take time for beverage portfolio changes to spark faster sales growth, but patient investors can collect a 3.3% dividend yield while they wait for those improved industry conditions. Its long business history, meanwhile, demonstrates that the drink giant has a knack for adjusting to shifting consumer demands. That challenge is made much easier by assets like a massive marketing budget and unmatched global distribution network. Short-term bumps aside, a decade from now Coke is likely to be selling well over 2 billion beverage servings each day and sending much of the profit back to shareholders.   Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Home Depot.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

From left, Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels, and the late Jason Mizell. MARK LENNIHAN / AP, file NEW YORK — Run-DMC filed a $50 million lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the rap group’s name without permission. A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. The complaint said the defendants are “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products” in the group’s trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. It called the Run-DMC brand “extremely valuable,” and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse Adidas sneakers from Adidas The lawsuit alleges defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons, Darryl “DMC” and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group had officially disbanded. The group’s hits include “King of Rock, “It’s Tricky,” and “Can You Rock It Like This.” In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

The $50 million suit claims that retailers have been selling items featuring the band’s logo, as well as Run-D.M.C.-inspired items—like the band’s distinctive square-framed glasses and fedoras—that use the group’s name in their marketing. A quick search of Amazon and Jet (which is owned by Walmart) brings up a number of items matching the suit’s description, including T-shirts and glasses that all use the band’s name in their descriptions. It’s tricky to tell which, if any, of these items—sold by third-parties via the online retailers—are officially licensed, which certainly gives some credence to the lawsuit’s claim that they “confuse the public as to the source of origin and endorsement of its products.” The lawsuit comes a month after Amazon made a public effort to crack down on chicanery in its marketplace, suing sellers for offering counterfeit versions of trademarked goods.

But the stories that brought the most national attention weren’t always the ones that our viewers read on WKBN.com. We looked at the stories that most viewers clicked on and compiled a list of the top web stories in 2016, in terms of page views: East Liverpool Police find 4-year-old in car with unconscious adults: The City of East Liverpool threw itself into the national spotlight when police declared they had a drug crisis on their hands. Hours after posting the shocking pictures on the East Liverpool Police Department’s Facebook page, they went viral. The photos showed a young child in the backseat of the car, while two adults who police said overdosed on drugs were passed out up front. Responding to criticism, Prosecutor John Gamble said the drug problem is out of control and they were trying to raise awareness of the issue. Highway Patrol warns Ohio drivers of law they may not remember: Highway Patrol talked to WKBN about an Ohio law that many drivers often forget: When windshield wipers are in use, headlights must be on. A violation of the law is a misdemeanor, but drivers could be charged $80-$100 per violation. Employee shot inside Hermitage Walmart: It was a normal day at Walmart when the unthinkable happened — an employee was shot, and police said the shooter was a disgruntled co-worker. Police said Zachary McClimans, who they identified as the shooter, was upset with the co-worker, who he said threatened him after he confided that he was transitioning genders. McClimans is awaiting a court hearing for multiple criminal charges. The victim was expected to recover. 20 charged in large-scale Mahoning Valley drug trafficking ring: Twenty people were charged with being involved in what investigators called a large-scale drug trafficking ring that operated in the Mahoning Valley. Of those charged, six of the suspects were identified by investigators as high-level traffickers who operated the group. They said the group was responsible for selling large amounts of heroin and marijuana that came in from other states like California and Arizona. Woman struck by truck, killed in Southern Park Mall parking lot: A woman was hit by a pickup truck in the parking lot of the Southern Park Mall and later died of her injuries. The family of the man driving the pickup truck said he had a medical condition before the accident. Police haven’t released information on any charges the driver may face, citing an investigation. Atty. refuses to remove Black Lives Matter pin, taken into custody: In the midst of a national “Black Lives Matter” movement, formed after the killings of black people by police and vigilantes, a Youngstown attorney took a stand in the courtroom with her “Black Lives Matter” pin. Attorney Andrea Burton was ordered to remove the pin in court and later arrested for contempt after she refused to do so. The action sparked conversation about what freedoms are allowed in the courtroom, but Burton later withdrew her appeal and conceded that a courtroom was not a venue for the display. Struthers police, school allege severe abuse of kindergartner: Two people were arrested after a Struthers kindergarten teacher noticed what appeared to be signs of abuse from one of her students. That teacher got police involved, and police reported finding deplorable conditions at the child’s home. The child’s mother, Lisa Marenkovic, and her boyfriend, Beau Geidner, were arrested. Court records show the case against Marenkovic was dismissed, but Geidner was sentenced to two years in prison. Semi accident, fire shuts down portion of I-80 in Liberty: A busy stretch of Interstate 80 was shut down for hours after a semi truck flipped over, catching fire. Two nearby vehicles also caught fire, and while everyone got out safely, the accident created a major mess. Student death prompts closure of St. Christine School in Youngstown: The death of a St. Christine student canceled classes at the Youngstown school, as grief counselors were called in to speak with students. Mahoning County’s Deputy Coroner Dr. Joseph Ohr said the 13-year-old girl died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and had been dreading the start of school, leaving behind a note for her parents. 32 people charged with $2 million food stamp fraud in Youngstown: An investigation starting in 2010 led to 32 people being charged with defrauding the food stamp system. Prosecutors said the scam defrauded the government out of $2 million. Of those charged was George Rafidi, owner of a Youngstown convenience store. Prosecutors said Rafidi sold prohibited items, such as alcohol and tobacco, in exchange for SNAP benefits.

McDaniels filed suit against the companies in New York federal court on Thursday, saying that they have been colluding with several other companies, also named in the suit, to jack the Run-DMC logo and slap it on T-shirts, patches, and wallets. In other instances, the suit claims, the companies advertise items such as fedoras and square glasses as "Run-DMC styled." Run-DMC is demanding $50 million in damages, noting that a licensing agreement with Adidas alone ran $1.6 million. The lawsuit also names Jet.com, which Walmart bought for $3.3 billion in September. The suit states that Run-DMC has brought in $100 million in all since its founding in 1981. Amazon and other internet retail platforms have become a hub for counterfeit sales, particularly, according to a Slate report, since Amazon management decided in 2014 to allow Chinese manufacturers to sell directly on the site. In November, Amazon sued two vendors alleging they were counterfeiters, and in December, the maker of Snuggies and other As Seen On TV products sued Amazon alleging it allowed an "astronomical" number of knockoffs to be sold. Run-DMC may have an uphill battle ahead, as similar suits have previously ended with judges deciding that online retailers merely provide a platform and, so long as they make good-faith efforts to block fraudulent vendors when they are identified, they are not responsible for the actions of third-party vendors. We've reached out to Amazon and Walmart for comment and have not heard back.

(KTTC) -- - Winona police investigators say one of the shoppers who they wanted to talk to last week has now been cleared in their counterfeit bill investigation. Detective Chris Nelson said Tuesday that investigators still want to talk to one of the men caught on-camera on December 27 in Winona. Police said two shoppers passed 11 counterfeit 20-dollar bills at 5:25 p.m. last Tuesday at the Walmart store in Winona, using them to pay for groceries.  Walmart has surveillance cameras and police posted photos asking for help from the public in identifying shoppers, as part of their investigation. ORIGINAL STORY: Winona police are on alert for someone passing counterfeit bills, and they may have caught the con artists on-camera. Deputy Chief Tom Williams said at 5:25 p.m. Tuesday at the Walmart store in Winona, two shoppers passed eleven counterfeit twenty dollar bills, using them to pay for groceries.  Walmart has surveillance cameras. "We do have photos of the two," said Williams. The Dollar Tree store in Winona also reported a recent encounter with counterfeiters, but isn't sure when it happened.  The deputy chief said someone had used a fake 100 dollar bill to pay for something, but the staff doesn't know how or when the bogus bill made it into the cash register. Winona police have posted two photos on the department's Facebook page and are asking for help from the public in identifying two shoppers.  Please contact Winona Police at (507) 457-6302 if you can help.  To remain anonymous, you can call a tip to CrimeStoppers at (507) 457-6530.

I guess he drove eight miles to get there and thought he should've been entitled to something more than that.'  Authorities said Owens got into his car and began to leave when he suddenly sped up and swerved his car toward Robertson. 'He saw me standing outside the tent, swerved his car towards me, gunned it,' Robertson said of the moment.   Robertson said his left forearm was hit by a side view mirror on Owen's car. Owens then stopped his car and ran to his trunk as Robertson took out his cell phone and began to film the entire incident.  Robertson (left) has accused Owens of leaving him with a black eye and said he will be out of work for at least two weeks 'You just hit me with your car, sir,' Robertson tells Owens, who is seen pulling out a golf club from his trunk in the video.  Owens then comes running straight toward the camera and hits Robertson in the face, causing the phone to fall out of his hand.  'Now I'm gonna call 911,' Robertson can be heard saying, 'You just hit my phone.'   ‘You are the stupidest bunch of f*****g people I’ve ever seen in my life,’ Owens tells Robertson and a group of employees who have come to his aid.  ‘You’re going downtown with the boys tonight, I hope you like the boys,’ one of the other employees tells Owens.  ‘I am the boys,’ he retorts. During the altercation Owens got back into his car and began to drove off, only to stop and take his golf club so he could threaten to hit Robertson again  ‘You knocked my phone out of my hand, you’re lucky the screen didn’t crack or I’d be calling the cops,’ Robertson tells him.  ‘You broke my f*****g mirror,’ Owens replies.  ‘You hit my arm with it sir,’ Robertson shoots back as Owens calls him a 'lying son of a b***h'.   ‘We all saw it, you hit him,’ another employee says.  ‘Sir, I’m being nice and not putting you in jail,’ Robertson tells Owens, who shoots back: ‘Listen, I am the jail!’   ‘Get out of my face you son of a b***h,’ Owens then says as he starts to drive.  He then stops the car, opens his door and pulls out his golf club as he threatens to hit Robertson again.    Owens (pictured in court) was arrested after he was interviewed by police at his home. He has been placed on supervised release ‘You hit me with that you will be in jail,' Robertson says.  ‘I’m 83 years old but I don’t take a bunch of s***,’ Owens tells another one of the employees as he stands up.  The employee then tells him to leave once again.   ‘I’ll leave when I want to,’ he says. ‘You hit my f*****g car again I will run over you,’ he then threatens Robertson before finally driving away. Owens was arrested after he was interviewed by police at his home. He has been placed on supervised release.  Robertson said he suffered a black eye when Owens hit him with the club and will be out of work for weeks.  'You can't sell $30,000 cars with a black eye,' he told the Herald-Tribune.  'This not only cost me my paycheck for this week, but the week after.'   But Robertson maintains that he is not angry with the old man.  'I was yesterday. I more or less feel sorry for him today,' he said. 'I just hope he gets some anger management and some counseling.'    Share or comment on this article e-mail 39 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are buried together Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...

Run-DMC Suing Amazon, Walmart, & Other Retailers For Using Their Trademarked Name On Products! Get The Deets! 12/30/2016 12:59 PM ET | Filed under: Music Minute • Legal Matters • Business Blitz • Walmart This court battle could get a little tricky. Run-DMC filed a $50 million lawsuit on Thursday, accusing Walmart, Amazon, Jet, and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group's name without permission. Court documents list founding member Darryl "DMC" McDaniels as the plaintiff in the suit — which alleges that the retailers are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the King of Rock performers' trademarked name. These knockoff products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets, and other merchandise — which McDaniels says "confuse the public as to the source of origin and endorsement of its products." Related: Burke Ramsey Files $750 Million Defamation Lawsuit Against CBS! The lawsuit alleged that the vendors have improperly profited from and harmed the "extremely valuable" Run-DMC brand, and have also knowingly "harmed RUN-DMC's ability to utilize, market, promote and sell products with its registered trademark." The suit didn't state how many products were ripped off, because the "number of infringing materials sold by Amazon, Jet and Wal-mart are too numerous to properly list." Yikes! Amazon and Wal-Mart, which owns Jet, have not commented on the lawsuit — and neither have McDaniels or former member Joseph "Run" Simmons.

See All Comments Family Of Chicago Teen Tortured On Facebook Live Speaks Out -- Says Victim Thought One Of His Attackers Was His 'Friend' Our hearts are breaking right now. Earlier this week, it was reported a Chicago-based special needs teenager was tortured for hours by four peers who broadcasted the disturbing beatdown on Facebook live. Now, family members of the 18-year-old victim are speaking out, and it appears the tortured teen had looked up to one of his attackers as a friend. Janet Grant said her nephew will be mentally scarred by the 6-hour abuse where he was bound, beaten, cut, burned, and forced to drink from a toilet.

(AP) - The nation's coal mines are nearing a record low mark for on-the-job deaths for the third year in a row and have a chance to keep the number of fatal accidents in single digits for the first time. With just a day left in 2016, U.S. coal mines have recorded nine deaths. West Virginia had four, Kentucky had two and there was one each in Alabama, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The low number can be attributed to far fewer coal mining jobs and tougher enforcement of mining safety rules. "We know consistently things are getting better," Mine Safety and Health Administration chief Joe Main said. Industry cooperation has been crucial to making mines safer, he said, and "the angst that mine operators have with what (violations) we cite is dissipating as well." Dozens of mines have shuttered in recent years, especially in Appalachia. In 2011, there were about 91,000 working miners in the U.S. compared with 2015 when there were about 66,000, the lowest figure since the Energy Information Administration began collecting data in 1978. The 2016 numbers are not yet available. Fewer mines and a smaller workforce amounts to fewer deaths and injuries, but Main noted that in 2011 - before employment numbers started to drop - a low mark was set for fatalities at 20. That was also a year after the deadly explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia killed 29 miners. Previous lows in coal mining deaths were in 2014 with 16, and last year, with 11. For comparison, in 1966, the mining industry counted 233 deaths. A century ago there were 2,226. Only one fatal accident was attributed to an explosion of gas or dust, which was to blame for the Upper Big Branch disaster. The lone explosion this year occurred July 29 at a Spartan Mining Company mine in Wyoming County, West Virginia. Donald Workman, 58, and another miner were welding when they came in contact with methane at the surface of the mine, causing an ignition. Workman, who had worked in mines for 40 years, died six days after the blast. Other deaths this year included wall collapses and a miner who crashed in a personal vehicle on an access road. There have been 16 fatalities in 2016 in non-coal mines that produce gravel, sand, limestone and mineable metals. That mark also continued a downward trend, with 17 in 2015 and 30 in 2014. Main said a lot of hard work by inspectors and industry leaders has gone into the three record-setting years. He also appeared to warn the incoming Trump administration against changing the successful formula. "There's a lot of ingredients that went into the recipe to make the cake that we now have in terms of having the outcomes of the safest years in mining history," Main said. "If you start taking ingredients out of that, the cake's not going to be as good, I can tell you that." Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo by Drew Gurian/Invision/AP, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The rap group Run-DMC filed a $50 million lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group’s name without permission. A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. The complaint said the defendants are “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products” in the group’s trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons, Darryl “DMC” and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding. The group’s hits include “King of Rock, “It’s Tricky,” and “Can You Rock It Like This.” In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Run-DMC Files $50 Million Trademark Infringement Suit Against Amazon, Walmart, and Other Retailers Run-DMC Files $50 Million Trademark Infringement Suit Against Amazon, Walmart, and Other Retailers Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Brow Beat Slate's Culture Blog Dec. 30 2016 11:13 AM Run-DMC Files $50 Million Trademark Infringement Suit Against Amazon, Walmart, and Other Retailers By David Canfield   It’s the king of lawsuits. There is none higher. Mark Lennihan/AP Billboard reports that Run-DMC has filed a lawsuit for more than $50 million against such entities as Walmart, Amazon, and Jet for trademark infringement. The hip-hop group is alleging that that these and other companies—in addition to about 20 unnamed individuals—continue to “trade on the goodwill of RUN-DMC,” using their name, their logo, and misleading products made in their “style” (such as fedora hats and square-frame sunglasses) without permission. In the specifics of the suit, Run-DMC asserts that these companies feature products which are falsely advertised as being associated with the group. The consequence, as stated in the filing, is the tarnishing of the Run-DMC official brand: The defendants have “harmed RUN-DMC’s ability to utilize, market, promote and sell products with its registered trademark.” Advertisement In the wake of counterfeit scandals sweeping major online retailers, a lawsuit of this scale and significance is hardly surprising—indeed, Allstar Marketing, the maker of the Snuggie, has already accused Amazon of “knowingly and intentionally” allowing faux fleeces and cheap knockoffs to sell on their site. And it should be noted that Amazon has responded by implementing some positive initiatives. But with legislative intervention unlikely (“good luck with that,” as Slate’s Helaine Olen put it last week) and the damage already done, it’s likely too little too late for Run-DMC—not to mention the many other registered trademarks suffering as a result of continued inaction. *Correction, Dec. 30, 2016: Due to an editing error, the headlines on this piece originally misstated that the lawsuit was over copyright infringement. It concerns trademark infringement.

The suit, filed Thursday in federal court in New York, accuses the retailers of manufacturing, marketing and selling products with the group's trademarked name, including glasses, hats, T-shirts and wallets. Run-DMC says in the suit that it has made $100 million on trademarked products over the years, including a $1.6 million sneaker deal with Adidas. "The brand is extremely valuable," the suit said. Neither Amazon nor Walmart had an immediate response to a request for comment. Run-DMC was formed in Queens, N.Y., in 1981 by Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell. Mizell was shot and killed at his studio in 2002. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. TM & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York.

The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items.

Further investigation indicates store employees just didn't have time to update the shelves because they were too busy snapping those wacky "People of Walmart" pictures for the Internet. America makes history in July when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton officially becomes the Democratic candidate for president and the first woman nominated by a major party. And no way, her supporters say, could TV celebrity millionaire Donald Trump win in America as we know it, right? Right? In trending business news, drones — those remote-controlled flying machines that apparently anyone with too much disposable income simply must have — are now the indispensable accoutrement for photographing and videoing weddings. Savvy business prognosticators predict a related new trend destined to be even more popular than the wedding party breaking into "spontaneous" choreographed dance in the church: Guests will now compete to see who can take down those intrusive, annoying flying devices with a precisely aimed Jordan almond. Rick Scott does an excellent impression of a governor who cares about every person in his state when he soberly warns that Matthew, an impending Category 4 hurricane, is life-threatening and must be taken seriously. Though the storm did have some devastating consequences in the Sunshine State, it did not actually make landfall here, promptly earning Scott a "Pants on Fire" rating. Big news at Tampa International Airport: Iceland-Air is soon to offer nonstop flights, giving Democratic voters a nice option to Canada. The first cross-bay ferry between St. Petersburg and Tampa makes its camera-worthy debut, gliding across smooth waters under sunny skies with muckety-mucks and media aboard. That perfect PR moment is marred only momentarily: The boat dangerously lists after St. Pete Mayor Rick Kriseman urges everyone over to one side, where he swears he just saw dolphins cavorting with manatees and possibly mermaids. Speculation later says this may have been the mayor's attempt to keep anyone on board from viewing any possible evidence of the millions of gallons previously dumped into local waters from his city's overburdened sewer system. Some low-income Tampa families that invested in homes as part of a plan to rebuild public housing got stuck with a disaster instead when the properties turned out to be built with nasty, toxic Chinese drywall. After Times reports, miracle of miracles: the city, county and housing authority are teaming up to fix the homes. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. And even more unbelievable, there's good government, too. The One Who Once Could Not Possibly Win went and won. And despite predictions to the contrary from some, the sun came up over Tampa Bay the next day anyway. Sue Carlton can be reached at carlton@tampabay.com.

Files $50 Million Lawsuit Against Companies Including Walmart and Amazon for Trademark Infringement By Karen Brill Companies are being sued for selling Run-D.M.C.-style products. 236 Shares Share 228 Tweet 0 Share 8 Share Email Print Share Run-D.M.C. Photo: Chris Carroll/Corbis via Getty Images Run-D.M.C. is suing a host of companies including Walmart and Amazon for over $50 million. According to Billboard, the lawsuit alleges that the companies in question committed trademark infringement against Run-D.M.C. by illicitly using the group's name and logo. The claim targets both products that explicitly use the famous logo, as well as products that market themselves as "RUN-DMC styled." Walmart and Amazon, as well as Jet, are all specifically called out for allegedly selling and advertising trademark-infringing products that "confuse the public as to the source of origin and endorsement of its products." The suit argues that the knockoffs cheapen the value of the real Run-D.M.C.-licensed merch. As damages, the group is asking for $50 million, in addition to interest, attorneys fees, accounting of all relevant Run-D.M.C.-style product sales, and an injunction and restraining order against further sales and promotion of said products.

The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York on Thursday. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by Joseph “Run” Simmons, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell.

In fact, this was the first year since 2011 when investors didn’t infuse any capital into the company. Flipkart had raised $750 million in mid-2015. The previous year, India’s e-commerce titan had raised a whopping $1.91 billion in external funding—its highest in a calendar year so far. None of the funding talks—including the one with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and another with the world’s largest retailer Walmart—have led to any fund infusion yet. Meanwhile, competitor Amazon has committed $5-billion investment in India and is steadily building its business. This, and the fact that Amazon has been tailing it relentlessly, made Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal come up with a protectionist argument. Earlier this month, Bansal said at a public event: “What we need to do is what China did and tell the world that we need your capital, but we don’t need your companies.” A direct jab at deep-pocketed “foreign” competitors, the comment got a lot of flak from several quarters. “Raising funds is a major challenge as it (Flipkart) has already received several rounds of funding from various investors and still operating at loss. If the Walmart-proposed investment of $1 billion comes through, it will be a big boost for the company,” said Hema Doreswamy, faculty of finance at Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research, Mumbai. Top-level exits A funding drought was not the company’s only problem. Successive C-suite exits have raised questions about Flipkart’s ability to retain top talent. Several top executives left the firm this year, including board member and head of marketplace Mukesh Bansal, who was once touted as the next CEO. The company also lost its chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja, chief product officer Punit Soni, chief technology officer Peeyush Ranjan and chief business officer Ankit Nagori this year. Interestingly, co-founder Binny Bansal had taken over as CEO and partner Sachin Bansal had moved to the role of executive chairman in the beginning of the year. The company hired Kalyan Krishnamurthy as head of categories from its biggest investor Tiger Global. “Kalyan joining back was a key step for the company in supporting the leadership team with his vast experience. The challenge continues from the competitive scenario in India as well as the increasing customer expectation on delivery experience,” said Sreedhar Prasad, partner, KPMG. Valuation falls, losses mount In a huge setback, Flipkart’s valuation almost came down by a third. Quarter after quarter, US mutual funds which have invested in Flipkart marked down the valuation of Flipkart shares. In total, Flipkart suffered a dozen successive markdowns; the lowest was by a mutual fund managed by Morgan Stanley in November which put its value at $5.57 billion, a sharp fall from the peak $15.2 billion valuation last year. Flipkart’s financials point to widening losses. The net loss of Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd, which operates Flipkart, doubled to Rs 2,306 crore in the financial year ended 31 March 2016, compared with Rs 1,096 crore the year before, according to filings with the Registrar of Companies. However, revenue rose to Rs 1,952 crore from Rs 772.5 crore. Some solace  In a year that saw Flipkart fight battles on many fronts, the silver lining was that it managed to retain the pole position in hotly contested festive sales, albeit by a small margin. Also, it trumped many others, including homegrown rival Snapdeal, to acquire Jabong, widening its lead in the fashion category. “The festive season sale appears to have given a very high boost for them, and their level of preparedness for the sale was evident from their overall performance,” said Prasad of KPMG India. The company has dismissed negative perceptions around its performance and put up a brave front. “We have established a clear lead over competition with less than a third of the costs,” said a company spokesperson. The spokesperson also said that Flipkart, including Myntra and Jabong, has a dominant 75% market leadership in fashion. “We have a clear market leadership in smartphones, televisions, large appliances like washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners, where we are more than double the number two player,” he added. India’s biggest e-commerce company hopes the next year will be better, as it drives innovation and offers quality products at affordable rates. As this dramatic year draws to an end, India’s e-commerce poster boys—the Bansals—step into a period that will define the destiny of the company they built nine years ago. In 2017, Flipkart, the vanguard of Indian e-commerce will turn 10. It will be a critical year. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

(Photo by Drew Gurian/Invision/AP, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The rap group Run-DMC filed a $50 million lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group's name without permission. A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding. The group's hits include "King of Rock, "It's Tricky," and "Can You Rock It Like This." In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Go! Sneak Peek e-newsletter Go! Sneak Peek from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Go!

Home News Galleries Interviews Sessions Noise Pro Run-D.M.C. Sue Walmart Over Unauthorised Logo Use by Roger Wink, VVN Music on December 30, 2016 in News Run-D.M.C. has one of the most recognized logos in music history and they want to make sure that they keep that logo licensed and bringing in the money. Original member Darryl McDaniels is suing Wal-Mart and Target for $50 million in damages over their unauthorized (read unlicensed) use of the logo on clothing, glasses, wallets and other items. The Run-D.M.C. logo has been trademarked since 2007 and is officially licensed to such manufacturers as Adidas for use on their sneakers. Named in the lawsuit are Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet.com and a number of companies that sell products through the Amazon marketplace. According to the suit, the unauthorized use of the logo confuses consumers into thinking that the group endorses the product and that the use will cause the “Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage”. As of this writing, all three major retailers are continuing to sell clothing and glasses utilizing the logo. vvnmusic.com Comments comments Tagged as: 80s, hip-hop, rap, Run-D.M.C., USA Tweet Related Posts George Michael Death Investigated As Drug Overdose George Michael's boyfriend Fadi Fawaz is reportedly set to be questioned by police following fears the singer's death was caused by a drug overdose. 17 hours ago David Byrne Extinguishes Chance Of A Talking Heads Reunion David Byrne has destroyed Talking Heads fans' dreams of a reunion, insisting he isn't willing to sacrifice his solo career for a get together. 21 hours ago James Corden Reflects On First Carpool Karaoke With George Michael George Michael inspired James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke segment and it all started for charity. 24 hours ago Gloria Estefan Sings New ‘One Day At A Time’ Theme Netflix has rebooted the mid-70's to mid-80's series One Day at a Time and Gloria Estefan is singing the new theme song. 1 day ago Family of George Michael Won’t Speculate In Cause Of Death George Michael's relatives have urged fans to refrain from speculating on the cause of the pop icon's death until coroners reach a definitive ruling. 3 days ago Janet Jackson Is A First Time Mother Janet Jackson has reportedly given birth to a son. 3 days ago Bruce Springsteen Says Trump Is Mentally Incompetent To Run America Bruce Springsteen fears Donald Trump hasn't got the "mental competency" to lead America. 4 days ago Chuck Leavell part 1 Chuck Leavell part 2 Chuck Leavell part 3 The Monkees Tinie Tempah Release The Hounds Matt Andersen – Quiet Company Dusty The Black Sorrows – It Ain’t Ever Gonna Happen Charlie A’Court – Refuse To Fear HARTS – Lovers In Bloom HARTS – Red And Blue Join our mailing list for daily updates.

LOUIS, MO (KTVI) - Some online holiday shopping deals were too good to be true. Now, police say, the items for sale were stolen. These deals started popping up on Facebook in November. The Chesterfield Wal-Mart reported drones being stolen around the same time. Police say Michael McCall, 28, and Monique Blake, 25, of St. Louis match two people seen in surveillance video stealing two drones and a controller from the Chesterfield Commons store. police say they were Sky Viper drones which typically cost about $50 to $250, depending up on the model. Police say detectives then got a tip about drones for sale on Facebook. Detectives arranged a meeting with the sellers in the parking lot of the Wendy`s on West Florissant in Ferguson. Police say McCall and Blake showed wearing stolen sweat pants and a stolen North Face jacket, with the tags still on them. "They met with the suspects. It ended up they were able to buy some drones but it wasn`t the drones that were stolen from our Wal-Mart. It was drones stolen from a different store in a different jurisdiction. Once they arrested these suspects they found all sorts of stolen property inside their car," said Chesterfield Police Sgt. Rider. Police say they had stolen coats, jackets, and a purse from stores in Chesterfield, Kirkwood, and Manchester. The total value was close to $1,400. Chesterfield police are checking with other departments to see if these two may be connected to other cases. Right now they're both charged with receiving stolen property, a class "C" felony.

(Photo by Leo Jarzomb, SGV Tribune/ SCNG) By Christopher Yee, San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: 12/29/16, 5:07 PM PST | Updated: 1 week ago # Comments The site of a proposed Walmart Supercenter at the northeast corner of Valley Boulevard and Arden Drive, pictured looking south from Rose Avenue, in El Monte, Calif. Dec. 28, 2016. (Photo by Leo Jarzomb, SGV Tribune/ SCNG) EL MONTE >> The long-awaited Walmart Supercenter project could be delayed for months as the city may have to prepare a new environmental report on the store’s potential impacts. The project was slated to be developed at the northeast corner of Valley Boulevard and Arden Drive. In November, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled that the original report failed to adequately address the project’s impacts on traffic and air quality, and as a result, “the public will suffer irreparable harm.” In response, the city requested a new trial and reconsideration of the November judgment. Judge John Torribio heard arguments Thursday from both the city and lawyer Gideon Kracov, who represents resident Aaron Montenegro and other residents who filed the lawsuit against the city in January 2016. Kracov said Torribio is set to issue a final ruling on the motions in 7-10 days. A tentative judicial order issued before Thursday’s hearing listed both requests as denied. While the city and Walmart have yet to decide on their future course of action, city Economic Development Director Minh Thai said it would cost $80,000-100,000 and take six months to prepare a new environmental report that addresses the areas the court deemed inadequate. The new environmental report would then have to be approved by the city Planning Commission and then by the City Council. Kracov said his clients are hoping the judgment is enough to convince the city not to let the project move forward. “Many residents who support the lawsuit do not think Walmart’s business model is good for El Monte,” Kracov said. Should Walmart choose to sell the property instead of trying to move forward with building there, Mayor Andre Quintero said he hopes it sells to a developer that will build a manufacturing facility. “Given the message now in Washington, D.C., of bringing jobs back to the United States and keeping jobs here, maybe the federal government will invest more in providing opportunities for manufacturing in communities like ours.” Quintero and City Councilwoman Norma Macias voted against the project when it was ultimately approved by the City Council in September 2015. Since then, residents have expressed both support and opposition for the project. Supporters say the city needs the Walmart for increased access to retail and the sales tax revenue that would be generated. The first environmental report said the store would generate an estimated $623,000 annually in sales and other taxes and fees, while costing the city approximately $115,000 for public safety and infrastructure maintenance. Advertisement But opponents remain concerned that the store’s prices will put local stores out of business and its low wages will not help residents maintain a living. El Monte first courted Walmart in early 2010, hoping to bring the retail giant to a lot partially owned by the city at Santa Anita Avenue and Valley Boulevard.

Sues Amazon, Walmart for More Than $50 Million Over Trademark Infringement 12/29/2016 by Colin Stutz FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Run-D.M.C. has filed a lawsuit against Walmart, Amazon, Jet and a number of others for more than $50 million over alleged trademark infringement on products using the iconic hip-hop group's name and logo without permission.  The suit was filed Thursday (Dec. 29) in New York and also names a number of the companies selling the products through those online marketplaces, as well as 20 John Does, saying they "trade on the goodwill of RUN-DMC." It explains that some of the allegedly infringing products claim to be "RUN-DMC styled products" such as fedora hats and square-frame sunglasses that use the group's name in their title or description but not the logo. Meanwhile, others more blatantly use the group's famous logo on shirts, purses, patches and other products.  Defendants Amazon, Walmart and Jet are accused of selling and advertising products that infringe on the trademark and goodwill of Run-D.M.C. by partnering with a number of different entities that sell the allegedly infringing Run-D.M.C. products through their marketplaces. These products, Run-D.M.C. states, "confuse the public as to the source of origin and endorsement of its products. Run-D.M.C. is seeking $50 million with interest, as well as attorney's fees, accounting of all sales of the defendants' products that were advertised as being related to Run-D.M.C. or directly use its trademark and an injunction and restraining order against sales and promotion of these products.  The lawsuit also cites previous licensing agreements for the Run-D.M.C. trademark to show its worth, including one for $1.6 million to Adidas for a line of sneakers. It also states the Run-D.M.C. brand has produced revenue in excess of $100 million from the intellectual property associated with the trademark "RUN-DMC" since its inception in the 1980s, including the sale of music, music publishing, concerts, merchandising and endorsement deals. Run-D.M.C. asserts the allegedly infringing products have diluted the group's brand as arguably the most well-known group in the history or hip-hop, saying the defendants have "harmed RUN-DMC's ability to utilize, market, promote and sell products with its registered trademark." Last month, Amazon filed its first ever lawsuits against merchants selling counterfeit items on its marketplace.  TMZ originally broke the story of Run-DMC's lawsuit.  Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Gaming News Game Reviews Game Trailers GR Originals Strategy Guides Hot Topics: 2017 Video Game Release Schedule Destiny Mass Effect Andromeda PS4 Pro Xbox One PC The 9 Best Final Xbox One S Deals for the Year By Dealzon | 1 week ago  Does the new year demand a new Xbox? The Xbox One S deals aren’t dead just yet (though they will be soon) with some holiday clingers still in the works at a few retailers. Some of them are about as good as Cyber Monday too! The best 1TB console deal to pick up is the Gears of War 4 or Battlefield 1 bundle at Walmart. At the big discount retailer, you’ll get your choice of 1TB console with the $50 holiday discount to $299 plus a bonus $50 Walmart Gift Card and a free wireless controller ($50 value). Essentially this is a $50 discounted Xbox One bundle with $100 in bonuses. For the best 500GB deal, your best bet is at Newegg’s eBay outlet store, where the 500GB Battlefield 1 bundle is priced only at $230. Even better, since Newegg only has warehouse/physical location at select states, you’ll also be able to save on sales tax. Elsewhere online those $50 holiday discounts have vanished, but at least the Microsoft Store is offering plenty of bonuses to compensate for the lack of a price break. Instead of a $50 discount, Microsoft will give you a $50 Gift Code (arrives via email). On top of that you get two free games. The first is your choice from a list of 16 with titles like Gears of War 4, ReCore, Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate, and more. Also included is a free copy of Ubisoft’s The Crew. Last Best Xbox One S Deals for 2016 Walmart/Newegg Xbox One S 1TB Gears of War 4 Bundle: $253.99 Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Bundle: $222.99 Xbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 Bundle: $229.99 Xbox One S 1TB Bundle + $50 Walmart Gift Card + Extra Controller: $299 Microsoft Store Bonus: All Xbox One gets $50 gift code plus a free copy of The Crew along with a free game of choice. Xbox One S 2TB Gears of War 4 Limited Edition Bundle + $50 Gift Code + Two Free Games: $449 Xbox One S 1TB FIFA 17 Bundle + $50 Gift Code + Two Free Games: $349 Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Special Edition Bundle + $50 Gift Code + Two Free Games: $349 Xbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 Bundle + $50 Gift Code + Two Free Games: $299 Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Bundle + $50 Gift Code + Two Free Games: $299 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Storm Grey Bundle + $50 Gift Code + Two Free Games: $299 Keep in mind that these deals are only available for a limited time. Microsoft’s offers, for example, are valid now through December 31st, basically the end of the year. Walmart’s bundle doesn’t have an end date but is instead limited by quantity available. Based on Walmart bundle offers from the past, this will end before the end of the week. For Newegg’s deal the discount will last until supplies are sold out. tags: Microsoft, Xbox One Load Comments Latest Features Latest News Latest Reviews Latest Videos © 2009-2016 Game Rant, LLC ABOUT CONTACT US PRIVACY POLICY COPYRIGHT ADVERTISE
Today » 2°C Sat 1°C Sun 2°C Mon 2°C Things TO READ Things TO DO SIGN IN News Topics All News Commentary Straight Talk News Features Elections Real Estate Sports Letters Real Estate B.C.'s highest court dismisses property assessment appeals by Walmart Canada and Home Depot by Charlie Smith on December 29th, 2016 at 3:38 PM 1 of 1 2 of 1 Two deep-pocketed retailing giants have struck out in the B.C. Court of Appeal. Walmart Canada and Home Depot each sought leave to appeal a decision by the Property Assessment Appeal Board to value their stores based on their income rather than the cost approach. In chambers, Justice Lauri Ann Fenlon ruled that neither applicant met the criteria for being granted leave to present its arguments. This follows another ruling earlier this year, in which Justice Elaine Adair dismissed the two corporations' judicial-review applications in B.C. Supreme Court. "The selection of one valuation method in preference over another is a question of fact, which is not reviewable by an appellate court unless there is no evidence to support it, or its application was so unreasonable that no properly trained assessor would have applied it," Fenlon stated in her recent ruling. "The Board exercised its judgment and weighed various factors and evidence in concluding...that generally the income approach is the preferable method for valuation of retail property." Home Depot objected to assessments of between $22.9 million and $23.8 million for its Coquitlam store in each year over a three-year period to 2012. This was based on gross income of $1.65 million in each of those years. Using the cost approach, this site would have been assessed at between $21 million and $21.9 million in each year of the three-year period, according to the B.C. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year. Using the income approach, Walmart Canada's Squamish store was assessed at between $13.4 million and $16.2 million in each year over a four-year period until 2013. Using the cost approach, this site would have been assessed at between $13.5 million and $14.5 million in each year over a four-year period, according to Adair's decision. Fenlon's more recent ruling has significant ramifications for municipal and regional governments and TransLink, which collect taxes based on property values. In addition, the outcome has an impact on the provincial government, which collects 21 percent of its expenditures on schools through taxes imposed on nonresidential property owners. Last year, this amounted to $1.17 billion, according to the B.C. government website. "There are currently 246 'big box' property assessment appeals pending before the Board for the taxation years 2010 through 2016," Fenlon noted in her ruling. "The primary issue on those appeals is whether this kind of property should be valued on a cost approach or income approach to value. All of these appeals are on hold pending final outcome of the present applications."

(Mike Hall/Word of Mouth Media) Related Stories 4 workers at Halifax medical marijuana dispensary face drug charges Pot dispensaries need to take security risks seriously, says advocate Pot enforcement won't change until marijuana is legalized, says Regina police chief Defiant pot retailer vows to 'fight those fines' as Vancouver tries to clamp down A Halifax business shut down after a police raid on Friday has reopened its doors in the wake of drug charges against its employees, and is continuing to dispense medical and recreational marijuana. Shirley Martineau, owner of Auntie's Health and Wellness on Barrington Street, was arrested and charged with cultivating marijuana and two counts of possession for the purpose of trafficking. Three other men working at the store are charged with possession of cannabis resin and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.  Plans to restock store Speaking from her Dartmouth-area home, the 66 year old says she's aware of the legal implications of restocking her store after Halifax police raided it. But her business, she said, is filling a void left by a health care system that is difficult to navigate for people who want marijuana products. "I have to make a stand. I have to fight for the cancer patients," Martineau told CBC News on Saturday. "They have to go behind Walmart to buy their medicine? That doesn't make sense to me." 'I put everything I had into that store' Auntie's Health and Wellness was registered as a business in June. One week ago, Martineau said the store began to sell to anyone over the age of 19, with or without a medical marijuana licence. She said it was a business decision not driven by profits, but to improve accessibility for all patients.  "People were coming to me crying telling me they couldn't find a doctor," she said. "I put everything I had into that store." Martineau is also appealing the city's decision to deny Auntie's an occupancy permit application because of the sale of medical marijuana. The city says selling pot through storefronts is illegal and against bylaws.  Halifax police raid medical marijuana dispensary on Barrington Street0:19 Providing alternatives Staff Sgt. Andrew Matthews of the Halifax Regional Police said in an email Saturday that police are aware there is activity again and will continue to monitor it.  Martineau said volunteers are running the store for now because the conditions of her release prevent her from going near it. "What's the most devastating for me is the oil I had made just recently for a bunch of cancer patients. Now I can't get it," she said, fighting through tears. "It's not easy to make." 4 workers at Halifax medical marijuana dispensary face drug charges Due in court in 2017 Martineau also admits it hasn't been easy to keep the lights on. Revenue from recreational users pays for medical marijuana to be free for her customers, she said, but not for much more.  Despite the risks, she said she's answering the call to give patients alternatives to opiates for pain relief. "I opened the store today. And that's telling people not to give up," Martineau said.  Martineau and the three other men charged are scheduled to appear in Halifax provincial court at a later date.  With files from Steve Berry Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Fourchu Head North Mountain (Cape Breton) Parrsboro Halifax (Shearwater) New Glasgow Caribou Beaver Island Shelburne Baccaro Point Kejimkujik (National Park) North East Margaree Baddeck St. Peter's Hart Island Halifax Digby Brier Island Western Head Liverpool Grand Étang Chéticamp Ingonish Windsor Kentville Lunenburg Bridgewater Sheet Harbour Malay Falls Amherst Port Hawkesbury Tracadie Antigonish Cape George Guysborough Yarmouth Sydney Annapolis Royal Greenwood Bridgetown Tatamagouche Truro Economy Halifax Light Snow -5°C Sydney Light Snow -4°C Yarmouth Cloudy -3°C Annapolis Royal Cloudy -5°C Greenwood Cloudy -5°C More Weather | Latest Nova Scotia News Headlines When a lower property assessment doesn't mean lower taxes 3rd moose cull planned in national park to protect boreal forest Firm wants fresh start on controversial N.S. quarry project read comments 'We can't go back,' says doctor at hospital linked to veteran in murder-suicide Expect a snowy, windy weekend in Nova Scotia Top News Headlines Suspect arrested in Fort Lauderdale airport shooting that killed 5 video Got the flu?

If you’re ready for a little positivity, here’s a bunch of cool stuff we can all look forward to in 2017. Bring it on! (But not like, too much. Some people are still feeling kinda fragile.) 1. A solar eclipse Next summer, a solar eclipse will darken southern cities like Charleston and Nashville for a few minutes. If you don’t live in the South, no worries! The natural blackout will be visible with less intensity in other major cities. If you want visit these spots, NASA has you covered. Just don’t forget to wear your sunglasses! 2. Moon adventures — for real! Humans continue their leap in space, and Google is leading a moonshot effort. The company is rewarding three privately-funded teams who reach Earth’s moon by 2017. The requirements: A team’s rover must travel 500 meters on lunar grounds and send back high-definition footage. You know, because pics or it didn’t happen. Oh, and besides lunar glory, there is a $20 million grand prize on the line. 3. The return of TV favs There’s important, big-dog TV coming down the pike. We’ll get Season 7 of “Game of Thrones” and, after a five-year hiatus, a Season 9 of “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Season 6 will be the last season for “Girls,” and in the streaming realm, Season 2 of “Stranger Things” will crawl out of the upside-down. In reality news, the former host of the “Celebrity Apprentice” is a little tied up with his new job, so new host Arnold Schwarzenegger will get to step into his shoes. 4. DeLoreans The future is back! The DeLorean Motor Company is letting buyers reserve their timeless vehicle online. The famous car was basically its own beloved character in the ‘Back to the Future’ saga. The manufacturer is running late on production but expects to crank out a car per month sometime in 2017. 5. Superfast trains Are super speedy trains in our near future? One company, Hyperloop One, envisions trains traveling as fast as planes, but without the turbulence. The company will test their fastest trains in 2017, with even bigger things to come. “The goal,” they say, is to move “cargo by 2020 and passengers by 2021.” 6. Drones EVERYWHERE Drones are going to BIG. They’ll be everywhere! No really, everywhere. Google could soon make it rain with beer and pizza as they prepare to drone-deliver food from the skies to your doorsteps through the developing ‘Project Wing.’ Amazon will expand on its nascent drone operation in the UK, and mega-retailer Wal-Mart wants to use them too, to help maintain inventory in its warehouses. 7. Attainable ‘Hamilton’ tickets Being one of the cool kids is about to get a whole lot easier. The record-setting Broadway sensation “Hamilton” is going national, which means you won’t have to travel to New York or Chicago, spend a million dollars, wait five years and barter your firstborn just to see it. Here is a list of stops. Good luck, they’ll still probably sell out in a matter of seconds. Oh well, there’s always 2018. 8. Sequels, sequels and more sequels Who says Hollywood needs fresh, original ideas when they can make bucketfuls of money trotting out old ones? Get set for new entries in durable movie franchises like Spiderman (“Homecoming”), the X-Men (“Logan”), Alien (“Covenant”), Thor (“Ragnarok”), Pirates of the Caribbean (“Dead Men Tell No Tales”), Transformers (“The Last Knight”) and The Fast and Furious (“The Fate of the Furious”). And of course we’ll all take yet another trip to a galaxy far, far away when “Star Wars Episode VIII” takes over theaters (and the world) at Christmas. There will be a touch of sadness with this one, however, due to the death of Carrie Fisher. She had finished shooting her scenes for this one, so it will at least give fans one last chance to say goodbye. 9. Dave Chappelle Netflix and chill is over. It’s about to be Netflix and laugh until you cry. After dropping his Comedy Central contract in 2005, the comedian is delivering a new stand-up comedy special on the streaming juggernaut. He’s also releasing two unseen shows from his personal vault. 10. New music and collabs Yes, 2016 took so many of our music legends. But some of your favs will still be putting out new music. The Arcade Fire says its new album will drop in the spring, and it’s about time. Eminem will also get a strange bedfellow in…Adele? Yes Slim Shady and the 10-time Grammy winning singer will reportedly team up on his new album, his first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. Oh, and and we’ll get “More Life” from Drake, which he considers more of a playlist than an album. Whatever, just give it to us! 11. The book everyone’s been waiting for The sixth book in George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series — which “Games of Thrones” is based on — could come out in March. It’s called “The Winds of Winter,” and Martin promises to open it with two big battle scenes.”The Winds of Winter” will also quickly resolve several cliffhangers left over from the end of the last book, “A Dance with Dragons.” We’re waiting, George! 12. A head transplant (?!) Yeah, you read that right. A not-so-mad scientist plans to conduct the first human head transplant. Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero says he has a volunteer — a man suffering from a muscle-wasting disease — so all he needs now is a body. The details of how the surgery will go down — like how they’ll get a body — are a little hazy, but Canavero says it’ll involve 150 people, 36 hours, really cold temperatures, bio-compatible glue and a diamond knife. Best. Craft project. Ever. 13. Nintendo’s next big thing Everybody seems hyped about the Nintendo Switch. It’s the first video gaming system that lets you, well, switch effortlessly between playing games on the big-screen TV in your living room or the tablet in your hand. The price for the Switch, due out in March, hasn’t been released yet, but all the cool kids on the internet are geeked up about it. Nintendo is, too: The company experienced lackluster sales of its Wii U back in 2012, so it’s really counting on the Switch to make a big splash. 14. The Kennedy assassination files For decades, endless conspiracy theories have swirled around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But some details could add context to the tragic events of November 22, 1963 when undisclosed files on the case go public. There’s a catch: The man presiding over the office Kennedy held, President-Elect Donald Trump, will have the power to order these files sealed, if he so chooses. 15. Weird milk Who needs cows? Not a California-based tech start-up called Perfect Day. It’s promising to put bottles of milk made without cows on store shelves by the end of the year. Perfect Day says making milk without the cow is a lot like crafting beer: It involves fermentation and yeast (and probably a little imagination). The company also says making milk this way is better for the environment, since the technique involves using less land, water and energy. 16. Surfin’ in The Eddie It’s the one sporting event in the world that usually gets canceled by the weather. The Eddie is an invite-only Hawaiian surfing contest that takes place off of Oahu’s famous North Shore. Organizers only run it when conditions are right — when the waves are at LEAST 20 feet high — so the contest has only happened nine times in 30 years. The waiting period for the current contest runs until February 28, so everybody’s got their fingers crossed that the big waves will come. 17. Virtual reality (just in case things get bad again) 2017 could be the year that virtual reality finally gets real and fulfill all those promises that were made to us back in the 90s. The Samsung Gear VR (which works with Galaxy phones) seemed to make the biggest splash with the masses this year, and that won’t change going into next year. But the Daydream View from Google will probably make big strides next year too, as it becomes available to work with most Android phones. And Microsoft will put out a number of Windows-10 compatible VR headsets in the next couple of months, so consumers will have a ton of good choices.

Google could soon make it rain with beer and pizza as they prepare to drone-deliver food from the skies to your doorsteps through the developing ‘Project Wing.’ Amazon will expand on its nascent drone operation in the UK, and mega-retailer Wal-Mart wants to use them too, to help maintain inventory in its warehouses. 7. Attainable ‘Hamilton’ tickets Being one of the cool kids is about to get a whole lot easier. The record-setting Broadway sensation “Hamilton” is going national, which means you won’t have to travel to New York or Chicago, spend a million dollars, wait five years and barter your firstborn just to see it. Here is a list of stops. Good luck, they’ll still probably sell out in a matter of seconds. Oh well, there’s always 2018. 8. Sequels, sequels and more sequels Who says Hollywood needs fresh, original ideas when they can make bucketfuls of money trotting out old ones? Get set for new entries in durable movie franchises like Spiderman (“Homecoming”), the X-Men (“Logan”), Alien (“Covenant”), Thor (“Ragnarok”), Pirates of the Caribbean (“Dead Men Tell No Tales”), Transformers (“The Last Knight”) and The Fast and Furious (“The Fate of the Furious”). And of course we’ll all take yet another trip to a galaxy far, far away when “Star Wars Episode VIII” takes over theaters (and the world) at Christmas. There will be a touch of sadness with this one, however, due to the death of Carrie Fisher. She had finished shooting her scenes for this one, so it will at least give fans one last chance to say goodbye. 9. Dave Chappelle Netflix and chill is over. It’s about to be Netflix and laugh until you cry. After dropping his Comedy Central contract in 2005, the comedian is delivering a new stand-up comedy special on the streaming juggernaut. He’s also releasing two unseen shows from his personal vault. 10. New music and collabs Yes, 2016 took so many of our music legends. But some of your favs will still be putting out new music. The Arcade Fire says its new album will drop in the spring, and it’s about time. Eminem will also get a strange bedfellow in…Adele? Yes Slim Shady and the 10-time Grammy winning singer will reportedly team up on his new album, his first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. Oh, and and we’ll get “More Life” from Drake, which he considers more of a playlist than an album. Whatever, just give it to us! 11. The book everyone’s been waiting for The sixth book in George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series — which “Games of Thrones” is based on — could come out in March. It’s called “The Winds of Winter,” and Martin promises to open it with two big battle scenes.”The Winds of Winter” will also quickly resolve several cliffhangers left over from the end of the last book, “A Dance with Dragons.” We’re waiting, George! 12. A head transplant (?!) Yeah, you read that right. A not-so-mad scientist plans to conduct the first human head transplant. Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero says he has a volunteer — a man suffering from a muscle-wasting disease — so all he needs now is a body. The details of how the surgery will go down — like how they’ll get a body — are a little hazy, but Canavero says it’ll involve 150 people, 36 hours, really cold temperatures, bio-compatible glue and a diamond knife. Best. Craft project. Ever. 13. Nintendo’s next big thing Everybody seems hyped about the Nintendo Switch. It’s the first video gaming system that lets you, well, switch effortlessly between playing games on the big-screen TV in your living room or the tablet in your hand. The price for the Switch, due out in March, hasn’t been released yet, but all the cool kids on the internet are geeked up about it. Nintendo is, too: The company experienced lackluster sales of its Wii U back in 2012, so it’s really counting on the Switch to make a big splash. 14. The Kennedy assassination files   For decades, endless conspiracy theories have swirled around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But some details could add context to the tragic events of November 22, 1963 when undisclosed files on the case go public. There’s a catch: The man presiding over the office Kennedy held, President-Elect Donald Trump, will have the power to order these files sealed, if he so chooses. 15. Weird milk Who needs cows? Not a California-based tech start-up called Perfect Day. It’s promising to put bottles of milk made without cows on store shelves by the end of the year. Perfect Day says making milk without the cow is a lot like crafting beer: It involves fermentation and yeast (and probably a little imagination). The company also says making milk this way is better for the environment, since the technique involves using less land, water and energy. 16. Surfin’ in The Eddie It’s the one sporting event in the world that usually gets canceled by the weather. The Eddie is an invite-only Hawaiian surfing contest that takes place off of Oahu’s famous North Shore. Organizers only run it when conditions are right — when the waves are at LEAST 20 feet high — so the contest has only happened nine times in 30 years. The waiting period for the current contest runs until February 28, so everybody’s got their fingers crossed that the big waves will come. 17. Virtual reality (just in case things get bad again) 2017 could be the year that virtual reality finally gets real and fulfill all those promises that were made to us back in the 90s. The Samsung Gear VR (which works with Galaxy phones) seemed to make the biggest splash with the masses this year, and that won’t change going into next year. But the Daydream View from Google will probably make big strides next year too, as it becomes available to work with most Android phones. And Microsoft will put out a number of Windows-10 compatible VR headsets in the next couple of months, so consumers will have a ton of good choices.

(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Multiple bullet holes speckle the side of a VW in the far end of an American Fork Wal-Mart parking lot near 900 West and 300 South, where a woman was shot and killed on Dec. 4, 2016. The suspect was soon pursued to a nearby movie theater where he died in a confrontation with police. Tribune’s tally » Utah’s high number of fatal attacks by relatives or cohabitants may be partly attributed to culture, birth rate, some experts say. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (4) On the night of Dec. 4, Utah Valley dispatchers received a frantic 911 call from a woman begging for help in the last moments of her life. Sue Ann Sands screamed in terror from inside her lime green Volkswagen Beetle, which her ex-boyfriend had rammed with his SUV before coming at her with a gun in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in American Fork, according to police. James Dean Smith fired at least seven rounds into Sands' car — one of them fatally striking the 39-year-old woman in the head. Minutes later, Smith died during a shootout with police. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Two weeks earlier, Smith, 33, had been served with a protective order after giving Sands a beating that left bruises all over her face and body, her mother told KUTV. Of the 63 homicides in Utah in 2016, at least 20 — nearly 30 percent — were reportedly the result of domestic violence, or violence at the hands of a family member or cohabitant, according to The Salt Lake Tribune's unofficial tally, which is based on information from police and prosecutors. See the list of 2016 homicide victims While that number is on par with the national average of 30 percent, Jenn Oxborrow of the Utah Domestic Violence Coalition said domestic violence-related homicides in Utah have accounted for 42 percent of homicides statewide over the last 16 years. Utah has a "squeaky clean" reputation in a lot of things, she said, but domestic and sexual violence are not part of them. The UDVC is a private nonprofit group designated by the federal government to coordinate efforts to combat domestic violence in the state. Of the Utah deaths related to domestic violence this year, the youngest victim was an 8-week-old girl who allegedly was abused by her father. She was one of at least six Utah children who died as the result of domestic violence and abuse. Part of the reason so many children are victims of lethal domestic violence in Utah, Oxborrow said, is because the state has a high birth rate to begin with, and many mothers fear they will lose custody of their children if they report domestic violence because they have exposed their children to a dangerous environment. Also, the wage gap in Utah between women and men is bigger than in many other states, she said, and women are often afraid they won't be able to survive financially if they lose their household's main income, provided by their abusers. "It's just a really bad combination of factors," Oxborrow said. "People are staying in really dangerous relationships for a long time." While men and women can be perpetrators or victims of domestic violence, she said that 88 percent of offenders are male. Of the 20 deaths in 2016 resulting from domestic violence, 18 accused perpetrators were men, one was a woman and in one case a suspect has not yet been named by police. Of the 17 women and girls who were homicide victims, 11 died as the result of domestic violence. Nine domestic-violence victims were male. The oldest victim of domestic violence was a 73-year-old Logan woman believed to have been fatally shot by her husband who later killed himself. "I am astonished at how many really dangerous domestic-violence abusers are allowed to have guns in Utah," Oxborrow said. "It's stunning. ... Having a gun in a domestic-violence situation is like pouring gas on fire." A state study from 2010 to 2013 showed that of 86 domestic violence-related homicides, 59 percent were shootings, Oxborrow said. And, of those, 39 percent of the perpetrators had a prior criminal domestic-violence history. When a gun is present in a domestic-violence situation, it increases the risk of homicide by 500 percent for women, according to a 2014 study conducted by Everytown, a gun-safety advocacy group. Of the total number of Utah homicides in 2016, at least 35 were shootings. Nine of those were domestic-violence related, while other cases of lethal domestic violence involved starvation, drowning, physical beating, stabbing or strangulation. At least three of the domestic homicides reported were followed by the suicide of the perpetrator. "Utah has a lot of work to do when it comes to holding people accountable for perpetrated domestic violence," Oxborrow said. In other parts of the country, a standard response to domestic violence is a mandatory, court-ordered 26-week intervention program, she said, but the Utah court system does not mandate such offender programming. A 2016 amendment to the state's Cohabitant Abuse Procedures Act made domestic-violence treatment optional for those convicted of domestic abuse. Of those with a previous criminal domestic-violence history, Oxborrow said 12 percent are enrolled in such a program, which seeks to coordinate safety and hold people "accountable to the violence they've perpetrated." "In Utah, we've tethered this to our mental-health system, and it's one more way of watering down the accountability for a domestic violence perpetrator," said Oxborrow, a licensed clinical social worker. "If mental-health issues are a factor in it, then that should be assessed for sure," but domestic violence should be treated and prosecuted as a violent crime. She also believes victims throughout the state need more support and resources. Oxborrow said friends and family members are too often "incredulous" and skeptical when they are clued in about a case of domestic violence. Additionally, she said, data collected by the state show that 2 percent of female victims of lethal domestic violence in the last 16 years have had a protective order against their killers. "That tells me people don't know where to go," Oxborrow said. Even when they do find resources, she said, the programs frequently are overwhelmed. In Utah, she said, 17 programs partner with the UDVC to serve 29 counties. Part of the reason there are so few programs is because there is no dedicated state funding for the cause, Oxborrow added. Most states set aside between $1 million and $8 million, she said, but "in Utah, sometimes we get about $400,000 of state money." Despite having limited resources, Oxborrow says the UDVC has a goal to never turn away someone seeking help. Free, confidential resources are available through the Utah Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-897-LINK (5465). More information can be found at udvc.org. Editor's note: The Tribune's homicide count excludes deaths charged as negligent homicides, those caused by impaired drivers, and deaths deemed justified as self-defense by prosecutors. Also excluded from the list are officer-involved shootings determined to have been justified. mnoble@sltrib.com Twitter: @mnoblenews   Share This Article RELATED STORIES 2016 closes with a rise in Utah homicides Published January 2, 2017 ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 4 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment RELATED STORIES 2016 closes with a rise in Utah homicides Published January 2, 2017 POPULAR NEWS Utah anti-porn bill draws attention of Stephen Colbert Utah's snowpack above normal -- but switch to rain this weekend could lead to flooding Lyman Family Farm blocks road to popular part of new Bears Ears monument in Utah Spy agencies' report clashes with Utah Rep.

BUSINESS Smart shopping in January: Buy TVs and fitness gear, skip smartphones and toys Black Friday Shoppers in Mesquite LARRY W. SMITH / EPA TV deals should abound as the Super Bowl approaches, just as they did around Thanksgiving, when these shoppers in Mesquite, Texas, took advantage of low prices. TV deals should abound as the Super Bowl approaches, just as they did around Thanksgiving, when these shoppers in Mesquite, Texas, took advantage of low prices. (LARRY W. SMITH / EPA) Courtney Jespersen If finding deals is your New Year’s resolution, January is a great time to start. For those who want to make saving money a priority in 2017, here are our recommendations for what to buy (and skip) this month based on NerdWallet’s analysis of historical sales cycles. Buy: Christmas decorations The period after Christmas has long been the best time to buy Christmas decorations. You may scoop up some post-Christmas deals on Dec. 26, but come Jan. 1, there will still be a handful of artificial trees, red ornaments and shiny wrapping paper spilling over in store clearance aisles. Stock up on holiday close-outs if you have space to hang onto extra tinsel until December. Skip: Smartphones You can’t always time your smartphone purchase. If your trusty iPhone has seen better days, it may be time for something new. But if you’re planning an upgrade in the not-so-imminent future, consider waiting a while longer. Prices on existing phone models tend to go down whenever a new phone is released. For Apple phones, the sweet spot is usually September after the company’s annual keynote product announcement. As for Samsung, tech enthusiasts speculate the Galaxy S8 could arrive around April. Buy: TVs The end of football season marks the beginning of television deals, as retailers help shoppers prep for viewing parties. The Super Bowl will air on Feb. 5, but we expect retailers will kick off sales at the end of January — making it an excellent time to score a bargain. In 2016, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Amazon and more discounted a wide variety of TVs in assorted brands and sizes ahead of the big game. Look for similar savings again in 2017. Skip: Toys Toys were hot during the holidays; if you haven’t heard of a Hatchimal, you’ve probably been living under a rock. But with Christmas over, January likely won’t see many worthwhile toy deals. The good news is your little ones are probably set for a while after all of their December gifts. Buy: Fitness gear January is a solid time to sign up for a gym at a discounted introductory rate, as many chains offer special New Year’s rates. But don’t spend that money unless you’re sure you’ll use the membership. All too often, new members lock themselves in for a full year, then stop showing up after a month or two. Skip: Mattresses Great deals on mattresses will come in February, when Presidents Day sales bring discounts. Presidents Day is Feb. 20, so hold off for another month if you’re in the market for a new mattress. Or if February is too soon for your budget, mattress deals will be back again in May over Memorial Day weekend and in September over Labor Day weekend. Buy: Bedding You might not want to buy a whole new mattress, but you can save on the sheets and blankets that go on your existing mattress. January is the month when department stores host “white sales” to clear out their existing inventory of sheets, towels, blankets and more. Expect savings to be especially deep on clearance items. Last year, we saw several stores offer 60%-70% off bedding basics. Bonus: Martin Luther King Jr. Day sales You may not associate Martin Luther King Jr. Day with shopping, but retailers certainly do. The holiday falls on Jan. 16 this year, and you can anticipate deals on clothing and home goods. Highlights from the holiday’s 2016 sales included 10% off select major appliance purchases of $396 or more at Lowe’s and an extra 40% off sale items at Anthropologie with a coupon code as part of the Winter Tag Sale. Sale shopping reminder As you’re searching for deals and end-of-season savings this month, keep in mind that waiting for low prices can be a trade-off, says Ozalp Ozer, a professor of management science at the Jindal School of Management at The University of Texas at Dallas. You’ll have to put time into the search. And buying at the time of a better deal may mean that inventory will already be picked over. But for the budget-conscious, the extra time and risk of regret is worth it. Courtney Jespersen is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website. Email: courtney@nerdwallet.com.

But there’s no denying that 2016 was a huge turning point, both socially and technologically. VR didn’t exactly soar this year — but it didn’t crash and burn, either. At the beginning of 2016, virtual reality was almost purely the province of developers, artists, and the lucky few who got to see their work. Concepts were usually more important than execution, and VR experiences didn’t have to be good, just novel. The only real options for most people to try it were the Samsung Gear VR, an interesting product with a lot of flaws, and the simple Google Cardboard. VR didn’t exactly soar this year — but it didn’t crash and burn, either The year didn’t get off to an auspicious start. The first high-end VR system launch, the Oculus Rift in March, was a bit of a mess. The headset had some great features but cost far more than people expected. It felt incomplete without motion controllers, and a component shortage made it almost impossible to find. The HTC Vive — which came soon after — felt more powerful, but it was barely a consumer device, and selling it as one laid bare how sparse experiences still were. At the same time, it proved that VR could stay entertaining for weeks or months instead of minutes. Outside the big commercial headset launches, super-ambitious VR entertainment company The Void launched its first experience in Times Square, to mixed reviews. The Chinese VR market got bigger and more interesting, focusing on compact, self-contained designs and special features. The Sundance and Tribeca film festivals made VR a big part of their lineup, and The Verge co-hosted a pop-up exhibit with the Toronto International Film Festival. Late fall saw a few highlights. Sony’s PlayStation VR showed how VR could fit with the typical console gaming experience, with uniquely trippy games like Thumper and Rez. Daydream, a mobile VR platform built into Android, put Google’s weight behind virtual reality. Then Oculus made up for its past stumbles by releasing the best VR controllers ever made, alongside clever games like Superhot and I Expect You To Die. These still don’t feel as full-featured as non-VR games, but they’re a far cry from anything we saw in 2015. VR is still too flawed to succeed Inside virtual reality, we’ve started figuring out its weak points — the potential for harassment, problems with embodiment, and confusion about how to fit it into the existing worlds of gaming and film. Also, nobody can make money developing for it. These could be signs that VR is still too flawed to succeed, or they could be the growing pains that let it flourish down the road. It’s frustrating to have yet another year of uncertainty ahead of us, but it’s also a good sign that VR has at least squeaked through one of its biggest transitions. — Adi Robertson Verge 2016 Report Card: VR B+ 2016 Grade Gold Stars: Lots of creative, genuinely good experiments Hardware that (eventually) lived up the hype Widespread interest in film and gaming Needs Improvement: Still inaccessible and expensive for most of the year Economic future is uncertain Interest hasn't translated into full-featured experiences TV and set-top boxes TV makers kept up the “4K!” cheerleading throughout 2016, and as we wrap up December, the years-long slog to Ultra HD still isn’t over — not even close. But we’re entering 2017 in a much better place. You can walk into a Best Buy or Walmart, or log onto Amazon and buy a nice 4K TV for under $700. Most of those will look pretty great when streaming Netflix or Amazon Video in 4K -- some even include HDR, which adds brighter and more vivid picture for a more theater-like experience. So the price barrier to entering the world of UHD is pretty much gone. Will a $2,000 TV still look better than a bargain set? Most always, but it’s (probably) easier than ever to find something affordable that looks great to your own eyes. The price barrier to entering the world of UHD is pretty much gone The software experience on those TVs hasn’t radically changed since we last left CES. It’s a mix of Tizen (Samsung), Android TV (Sony, etc.), webOS (LG), a very minimal Chromecast UI (Vizio), and Roku TV. Most sets ship with the must-have popular streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube built in, giving you an instant source of 4K video. Not everything’s great, but you can mostly navigate menus on your TV without pulling your hair out. Progress! Depending on your TV, a set-top box like an Apple TV or Roku might not be the automatic purchase it was a year ago. But if you still want one, they’ve made improvements this year too. Pretty much all the big ones except Apple’s now support 4K resolution. Most of them can also serve as a cable box replacement thanks to services like DirecTV Now, Sling TV, and PlayStation Vue. But there are still annoying problems and potential frustrations lingering. You’ve got competing standards for HDR: HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (The former has seen wider support across TV brands.) And when it comes to 4K content, you’ve got to pay attention to the HDMI ports when buying a new set. On many TVs, only one or two of several HDMI inputs might support HDMI 2.0, which is critical for streaming Ultra HD. Yet again, 2017 is going to be all about 4K The year ahead will likely be one of iteration. LG will keep leading the class in picture quality with its OLED TVs — though it’s rumored that Sony might be releasing some of its own. Samsung will put out some fantastic high-end sets, and yep, some will be curved. Vizio, a favorite of home theater nerds, is in the process of being acquired by LeEco, which may result in interesting changes. But yet again, 2017 is going to be all about 4K, 4K, 4K. — Chris Welch Verge 2016 Report Card: TVs B+ 2016 Grade Gold Stars: 4K is more affordable than ever HDR makes your living room closer to a movie theater Several set-top boxes now do 4K Needs Improvement: A winning HDR format between HDR10 and Dolby Vision All TV makers need to keep current with HDMI and HDCP standards OLED, the TVs with best picture quality, are still expensive Apps Remember Peach? Remember Peach? It was the biggest new thing in social networks in January, but chances are you’ve probably forgotten it existed. That seems to be the general consensus around 2016 in apps. Occasionally, there are standouts, but most become temporarily popular only to get overshadowed or bought out by the big companies — mainly Facebook and Google. The biggest promise of the year was also the biggest disappointment: bots. Despite Facebook, Google, and Microsoft all committing to bots as the future of technology, 2016 was definitively not the year of the AI chatbot. Facebook added bots to its Messenger in the form of apps — yep, apps within apps — but rather than wave of new interactions within our smartphones, we got a bunch of text-based versions of things like weather and food ordering. Microsoft went big on bots as a platform, but none of those experiments have really broken through. And Allo, Google’s big bet to bring AI bots to messaging apps, landed with more of a whimper than a bang. 2016 was definitively not the year of the AI chatbot The other takeaway from apps this year is that everyone seems to be hastily looking across the aisle to see what they can take from others. Apple updated iMessage to have Snapchat’s self-destructing photos and LINE-style stickers. Snapchat’s Memories is basically cloud photo storage like that of Google Photos’ and GroupMe’s. Instagram flat out copied Snapchat’s stories down to its feature name. Finally, Facebook Messenger ripped off Snapchat’s live filters and vanishing messages. Instead of any real innovation, we just saw the same features in more places. Meanwhile, beloved apps like Vine and Sunrise left our phones for good. Despite the backing of major companies like Microsoft and Twitter, it seems that having a small but dedicated community that use your app is no longer enough. It’s also been a bad year to be an up and coming iOS game developer. There were some interesting new titles this year, but the F2P market has long since taken over the platform. Suffice to say, we haven’t seen something like Monument Valley take the mobile gaming space by storm. The biggest gaming apps of the year came in the form of Nintendo’s blockbuster franchises making their way to mobile platforms, but Pokemon Go has had little staying power since its summer success, and Super Mario Run faces an uncertain future while clinging to an app store pricing scheme that hasn’t succeeded since 2008. Prisma is a genuinely brilliant and fun photo editing app That said, it isn’t all doom and gloom for the future of apps. We did have some fun new players this year: Prisma is a genuinely brilliant and fun photo editing app that feels like a throwback to apps of years past. And Google’s Motion Stills app took Apple’s Live Photos and elevated them to an entirely new level of brilliant entertainment by turning them into GIFs. In the end, apps are still the way we interact with almost all of our technological devices, and probably will be for some time. People still buy apps, and despite the promise of bots to make individual applications unnecessary, that future is still ways to go. If that promise extends to next year — perhaps, with some new, more nimble competition to the entrenched players — 2017 could be quite exciting. At the very least, we have more ways than ever to get robots to order us pizza. — Chaim Gartenberg Verge 2016 Report Card: Apps C+ 2016 Grade Gold Stars: Some new, creative apps that remixed old smartphone features in new ways Email apps are back Needs Improvement: Bots need big improvements Messaging apps are unnecessarily complicated It’s tough for new, smaller developers to be found and make money In this Storystream The Verge 2016 tech report card The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Virtual reality, TV, and apps The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Headphones and streaming music View all 15 stories More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending This is Apple’s click wheel iPhone prototype Displays are the secret superstars of CES How much can police find out from a murderer’s Echo?

Two anonymous donors have paid for student lunch accounts in the district as a gift. Jim T. Ryan photo  By Jim T. Ryan Staff Writer Newport School District received a "secret Santa" gift of sorts just before Christmas. Two anonymous donors wrote checks totaling about $6,000 to pay for all outstanding student lunch accounts and to pay for reduced lunches for the remainder of the school year, according to school officials. "Wow. I was just shocked," Superintendent Ryan Neuhard said last week. "It was amazing." The community really values the district and provides for the students, he said. The district first received a Facebook message from a resident on Dec. 13 that the anonymous donor wanted to write a check to go toward student lunch accounts, elementary school Principal Michael Smith said. Two days later, a second donor stated a desire to give to student lunch accounts. "I was surprised, in a good way," Smith said.  The district receives support from the community, but it never expects large donations like this, he said. "They were inspired by the Walmart story," Smith said, referencing anonymous donors who paid the tab on lay-away accounts at Walmarts around the country. The money means that about 55 students who receive reduced lunches will not have to pay for the rest of this school year. Districts offer reduced lunches to families who may face financial difficulties. The district last week still was contacting families to let them know of the gifts that will mean more than 100 free lunches.  Smith said the only requests from donors was that they remain anonymous and that the district spread the news so that maybe other people would be inspired to give back to their communities in some way. "We would like to say thank you for the generous contributions," Neuhard said. Jim T.

Run-DMC accuses Amazon, Wal-Mart of trademark infringement in $50 million suit - Irish Sun Issue 07/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Run-DMC accuses Amazon, Wal-Mart of trademark infringement in $50 million suit Irish Sun Saturday 31st December, 2016 • Retails accused of selling clothing and accessories with rap group’s name without permission • Run-DMC founder Darryl McDaniels called the Run-DMC brand “extremely valuable” • McDaniels said it is the subject of several licensing agreements CALIFORNIA, U.S. - One of the Run-DMC founders has filed a legal case against Amazon, Wal-Mart amongst other retailers claiming they have been selling clothing and accessories with the prominent rap group’s name without permission. The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and has named more than 20 retailers. It alleges that these retailers have confused the public and diluted the group’s brand and their ability to “utilise, market, promote and sell products with its registered trademark.” Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run-DMC Brand LLC and the plaintiff in the lawsuit is claiming damages over the “alleged sale of glasses, hats, patches, T-shirts, wallets and other products that infringe the Run-DMC trademark registered in 2007.” He has said that the Run-DMC brand is “extremely valuable,” adding that it is subject of several licensing agreements. The $50 million infringement lawsuit has accused the retailers of using the group’s image for “advertising, manufacturing, selling and distributing multiple products.” McDaniels further added that “the defendants are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws.” According to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, “Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage” unless the infringements are stopped. Run-DMC was founded in New York City in the year 1981 by Joseph “Run” Simmons, Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell and Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, rising to fame as one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s. McDaniels and Simmons announced the group was disbanding after the third member Mizell was shot dead in 2002.

Featured Story Authorities claim 97 percent property-owners paid taxes last year DUBLIN, Ireland - According to Irish tax authorities, as many as 97 percent of all property owners paid taxes last year. The tax authorities have said they collected as much as 463 million euros from tax last year.  Astonishingly, a huge number of people have already paid the taxes for this year. However, this wasn’t without prompting owners to do so: The tax collection authorities had to send as many as 300,000 warning letters telling owners to pay up, or face consequences. Further, those who are yet to pay up their taxes can do so via an electronic cheque, also called an annual debit authority by the Revenue Department. Owners doing so must inform tax officials about the same by Wednesday. All the tax shall be hence withdrawn from their accounts in March. Michael Gladney, Collector General, has stated that since the Revenue Department took charge of tax collection in 2013, as much as 64 million dollars have been collected.  Moreover, as many as 360,000 properties have been taken over by the department following non-payment of taxes on the owner’s behalf. The collector general said in a statement, “The vast majority of property owners fully comply with their local property tax payment obligations, either in a single payment or with phased payments. As long as payment obligations are being met, Revenue will automatically roll over existing payment methods for property owners who pay by direct debit or by deduction at source from pay/pension.” Find Irish Sun on Facebook Latest Irish Sun news Huge surge in electrical goods sales help to boost retail figures DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Statistics office has released figures that show a rise of ...

A popular sledding spot along Senator Highway was a busy place this week. By Max Efrein Originally Published: December 31, 2016 6:02 a.m. Share Tweet mefrein As the remaining snow from Christmas Eve’s wintry storm creeps away, it leaves many Prescott area residents smiling with recent memories of quality snowmen, snowball fights and sledding. HOW RARE WAS IT? Prescott had the third most snow on the ground Christmas morning this year than it has had in the last 100 years, according to measurements taken by volunteer cooperative observers for the National Weather Service. Here are the top seven Prescott snow depth figures for Christmas Day dating back to 1916: 1967 = 24 inches on the ground 1916 = 7 inches on the ground 2016 = 5 inches on the ground 1987 = 3 inches on the ground 1968 = 3 inches on the ground 1941 = 2 inches on the ground 1939 = 2 inches on the ground Prescott doesn’t get much snow each year, but when it does, many in the quad-city area quickly capitalize on the occasional marvel. Good indicators of how much the community is engaging in winter recreation are local retail stores. Just two days after snow hit the ground — one of which was Christmas Day when most businesses were closed — nearly every retailer carrying sleds, tubes and toboggans for the season was completely sold out of such items. Large department stores such as Target and Walmart were some of the first to run out. Prescott Target’s store manager, Myrza Lamper, said they’ve had sleds stocked in their stores since October, but the plastic toys only really started selling when the snow started falling. “When I got here Monday morning (Dec. 26), there was only one left,” Lamper said. Prescott Home Depot’s operations manager, Tom Tuttle, reported a similar rush for the store’s limited stock of sleds. “When the snow came, everybody gobbled them up,” Tuttle said. That didn’t stop some shoppers from finding a way to hit the slopes. “One of the things that a lot of our guests were doing — and they did last year as well — was they were buying crates and using the lids to slide around with,” Lamper said. Both Lamper and Tuttle said they weren’t sure if and when their stores will receive another shipment of sleds this season, so it is recommended to call the stores to ask whether any have been restocked before trying to pick any up in person. Where to go sledding Acquiring a sled is one thing. Figuring out where to go sledding is another. Just about any snow-covered hillside will do the job. However, there are a few key spots that Quad Cities residents tend to favor. One is a picnic site along Highway 89A on Mingus Mountain. Another — and perhaps more popular — is a pull off along Senator Highway just a few miles south of Gurley Street. “This is probably the best spot,” said Mike Boeckner, a Chino Valley resident who was out sledding at the Senator Highway pull off with his family earlier this week. “I hear there are a few good areas along Walker Road too.” Children and their parents weren’t the only ones out enjoying the slippery slopes. Some grandparents were even giving it go, including 80-year-old Arline McKeever, a retired school nurse who has had both of her knees replaced in the last year. “She’s a wild one,” said Kathleen McKeever, Arline’s daughter. “She’s one of those people who likes to enjoy life.” “We’ve been doing this stuff for years,” said Arline, who has a cabin in Groom Creek. When it comes to sledding, it may be best to wait for the another snowstorm to roll through later this season. The one predicted for this weekend is forecast to be mainly rain below 6,300 feet.

StaffSgtMcGraw 6 days, 10 hours ago Don't go to the pit off Senator Highway. YCSO Deputies will run you off because it's State Trust Land and without a permit you're trespassing. Upvote 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Votey_McVoteface 6 days, 8 hours ago You're absolutely correct! Thanks for commenting about this. I am all for people enjoying that spot if they have the recreational permit issued by the AZ State Land Dept. but very few do and many of the people that sled there leave behind a mountain of trash when they are done (broken sledding items, used diapers,beverage containers, etc.). A public safety issue also arises due to the limited parking that is available and the road conditions where vehicles often get stuck and have to have a tow truck get them out of their predicament. The overflow traffic into the Sweet Acres, Oak Knoll Village and Sherman Pines neighborhoods also creates considerable problems for residents there. That area often does not get plows going through as they are concentrating on Senator Hwy so those roads, even when they do get plowed are almost always icy and vehicles often slide off the roads into the culverts and also get stuck on the roadways themselves, blocking access for residents and emergency vehicles. If you want to sled, go to places that you are lawfully allowed to sled and where you do not create a public safety hazard. Or get the permit and tell YCSO you are permitted and clean up your trash. Unpermitted users should be cited with trespassing. The Courier should stop promoting this State Land area as a place to sled or enjoy the snow in their articles and video/photos each year. Damage occurs to the land there and to personal property of those going there and to the property of residents in the adjacent neighborhoods..

In the past, with piles of snow along the roads, cars have parked on the roads, blocking traffic.

If it is really illegal, let's hear it from authorities -- not trash-talk hearsay from a couple of anonymous posters who might just live up that way, and who might want to corner the market on the area's beauty. In other words, "bah humbug." Upvote 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Votey_McVoteface 5 days, 21 hours ago There is no bah humbug attitude from me. It really is illegal. State Trust Land is not public land. Check out the AZ State Land Dept. website. Nobody should have to hear it from authorities as they have an obligation to know where they can and can not recreate. There are signs there which say "No Trespassing" yet people ignore them. Call the State Fire office on Gail Gardner (it's been a while since I have talked to them but Russ and Chris are quite helpful and knowledgeable). No Trespassing! by Votey McVoteface Upvote 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Votey_McVoteface 5 days, 20 hours ago Folks risk personal injury and property damage to themselves and others while also requiring public safety employees to dedicate their time and risk injury themselves due to the unpreparedness and irresponsible actions of some of the people trying to recreate where they should not be. This incident had 2 YCSO vehicles at this site while at one of the two entrances to the neighborhood another vehicle was stuck in the roadway blocking access into and out of the neighborhood and had another YSCO vehicle there and that truck had to be towed out. Notice the icy conditions of the road in this pic. 4x4 vehicles often get stuck here and slide off the road as well and I have yet to see a person equipped with snow chains (other than myself), YCSO included. There are some steep streets in this neighborhood where serious injury and damage can occur. I would hate to see that happen to a family trying to have fun in the snow. Car meet culvert!

Southbound traffic did not stop while this was occurring (multiple cars, - I have pics of that too but I think you may realize at this point that I wouldn't lie to you about this stuff) and drove south in the northbound lanes even while the jeep was 1/4 - 1/3 of the way into the nb lane, creating the potential for an accident to occur. People seem to lose their ability to use common sense and disregard their own safety and the safety of others in less than optimal driving conditions just to play in the snow.

 A giant wave of store closures is about to hit the US Hayley Peterson Dec. 31, 2016, 8:09 AM 616,655 facebook linkedin twitter email print Rolling Acres Mall in Akron, Ohio. Nicholas Eckhart Retailers are bracing for a fresh wave of store closures at the start of the new year.  The industry is heading into 2017 with a glut of store space as shopping continues to shift online and foot traffic to malls declines, according to analysts. "I f you are weaker player, it's going to be a very tough 2017 for you, " said RJ Hottovy, a consumer equity strategist for Morningstar.  He said he's expecting a number of retailers to file for bankruptcy next year, in addition to mass store closures. Nearly every major department store, including Macy's, Kohl's, Walmart, and Sears, have collectively closed hundreds of stores over the last couple years to try and stem losses from unprofitable stores and the rise of ecommerce.  But the closures are far from over. Macy's has already said that it's planning to close 100 stores, or about 15% of its fleet, in 2017. Sears is shuttering at least 30 Sears and Kmart stores by April, and additional closures are expected to be announced soon. CVS also said this month that it's planning to shut down 70 locations. Mall stores like Aeropostale, which filed for bankruptcy in May, American Eagle, Chicos, Finish Line, Men's Wearhouse, and The Children's Place are also in the midst of multi-year plans to close stores.  Many more announcements like these are expected in the coming months. The start of the year is a popular time to announce store closures. Nearly half of annual store closings announced since 2010 have occurred in the first quarter, CNBC reports. In addition to closing stores, retailers are also looking to shrink their existing locations.  "As leases come up, you're going to see a gradual rotation into smaller-footprint stores," Hottovy said. Despite recent closures, the US is still oversaturated with stores. The US has 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, compared with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia — the next two countries with the highest retail space per capita, according to a Morningstar report from October. "Across retail overall the US has too much space and too many shops," said Neil Saunders, CEO of the retail consulting firm Conlumino. "As shopping patterns have changed, some of those shops are also in the wrong place and are of the wrong size or configuration." As stores continue to close, many shopping malls will be forced to shut down as well. When an anchor store like Sears or Macy's closes, it often triggers a "downward spiral in performance" for shopping malls, Morningstar analysts wrote in the report from October. The malls don't only lose the income and shopper traffic from that store's business. The closure often triggers "co-tenancy clauses" that allow the remaining mall tenants to exercise their right to terminate their leases or renegotiate the terms, typically with a period of lower rents, until another retailer moves into the vacant anchor space.  To reduce losses, malls must quickly find a replacement tenant for the massive retail space that the anchor store occupied , which is  nearly impossible  — especially in malls that are already financially strapped — when every major department store is reducing its retail footprint. That can have "grave" consequences for shopping malls, especially in markets where it's harder to transform vacant mall space into non-retail space like apartments, according to the analysts. The Morningstar report supports another recent analysis from Credit Suisse that said about 200 shopping malls are at risk of shutting down if Sears continues to close stores.  SEE ALSO: Sears and Kmart are closing more stores — see if your store is on the list NOW WATCH: Sears and Kmart are closing more stores — see if your store is on the list Loading video...

Iconic hip-hop group Run DMC has filed a lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Stores Inc., Jet.com and other retailers for utilizing their name without permission. According to TMZ, Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run DMC Brand LLC, is seeking at least $50 million of damages from the retailers and other defendants. According to the lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday, December 29, the infringing materials that have allegedly been marketed and sold by the mega retailers are "too numerous to properly list." The products include fedora hats and square-frame sunglasses that use the group's name in their titles or descriptions. Meanwhile, other products, such as T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items, use the group's famous logo. The group asserts that the giant retailers are "trading on the goodwill" of the band and confusing consumers by "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products with the logo." Thus, they make people believe that the band endorses their products. The lawsuit cites that the Run DMC brand is "extremely valuable," and it becomes the object of several licensing agreements, including a $1.6 million deal with Adidas AG. It also states that the brand has produced revenue in excess of $100 million from the intellectual property associated with "Run DMC" trademark since the band was founded in 1981. Both the companies and McDaniels' lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comments. © AceShowbiz.com More Run DMC News Run DMC to Be Honored With Lifetime Achievement Award at 2016 Grammys   Jan 14, 2016 Aerosmith and Run DMC Perform 'Walk This Way'   Jul 26, 2012 Run DMC to Reunite at Fun Fun Fun Fest in November   Jul 11, 2012 DMC Would Love to Be Lil Wayne's Opening Act   Apr 03, 2009 Metallica, Run DMC Made 2009 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees   Jan 15, 2009 More Recent Articles Baby No. 3 on the Way?

Honest Ed’s, Toronto's discount landmark, closes Saturday.  (Marcus Oleniuk/Toronto Star / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Edward KeenanColumnist Sat., Dec. 31, 2016 Towards the very end of Honest Ed’s long goodbye — more than three years after the store closing was announced, and about two weeks before its final checkout — we took the kids on a pilgrimage, introducing them to the longtime Toronto institution just so they could bid it farewell. “The best part of it was the signs,” my 5-year old daughter said when it was all done and we had exited into Mirvish Village to shop for comic books. And if she wasn’t 100 per cent right, by the end, she wasn’t far off. The signs, starting with the instantly recognizable 1,000-points-of-light marquee spelling out the name across the width of an entire blinking city block, defining the vista of the Annex for generations. And in around those light bulbs, those eccentrically punctuated, terrible puns: “Honest Ed’s a monkey! ‘You can buy his bargains for peanuts!!’” And down beneath: “Don’t just stand there, ‘buy something’!!” By the end, if we’re being candid, if you were actually looking to buy something, there were better places to do it, and plenty of them. Once upon a time, in a city whose retail landscape was dominated by staid WASPy surnames like Simpson and Eaton, Ed Mirvish virtually invented the discount retail store in this place, and it was a lifeline to generations of students and immigrants and people in plain old hard times. This is a story we know well by now — through roughly 41 months of retrospectives anticipating the store’s closing, we’ve all had time to reflect on the generous turkey giveaways, the long lineups for the door crasher giveaway sales, the business that boomed from one tiny storefront to take over the block and anchor a theatre and restaurant empire. By now, Dollarama is cheaper, Wal-Mart typically offers better quality merchandise and more consistent selection, and both of those conglomerates have many locations much closer to where today’s immigrant and impoverished populations typically live. It’s hard to imagine anyone is going to miss Honest Ed’s because they cannot get what they used to buy there somewhere else, for as good a price. Article Continued Below But my goodness, those places are not Honest Ed’s. They have the stuff, mostly better stuff, and they have the prices, but they don’t have the signs: “Come in and get lost” they said over the door, and if you did, you would. We wandered around inside with the kids for about an hour, up and down dusty stairwells, through rooms and into other rooms, across the bridge over the alley, poking our heads into rooms closed now that stock had been liquidated and consolidated. Ladies wear, sporting goods, housewares, antique oddities, groceries — hey, a dentist, an optometrist, a pharmacy … why not? It was a maze of a store like nothing you find in a mall, improvised through successive renovations and additions to create a feeling more carnival funhouse than merchandising science, with jokes and old theatre posters scattered wherever they would fit. Other stores had better stuff, at better prices, but Ed's had the hand-painted signs.  (Rick Madonik)   Eventually we came again to the signs — the interior ones this time, for sale as souvenirs. “Christmas Tea Towels $1.19 ea.,” “Men’s / Ladies / Teens Velcro Closure Fashion Shoes $4.99,” “Ladies or Misses Fancy Panties 99¢” and so on. Each of them hand painted by an employee of the store in red, blue and yellow — as all the interior signage was, right up to the very end. Each a unique piece of individual labour. You don’t find that at Wal-Mart. You don’t find that anywhere. This, this is what many of us will feel is lost when the doors finally close for the last time on Dec. 31. A place, a landmark, that was one-of-a-kind and custom made, from its blockbusting construction right on down to its price tags. You can buy the same stuff anywhere. Yet this store that sold it here was an eccentric reflection of its founder’s personality and humour, it’s own gradual evolution, the care and effort of its staff. Maybe I’ve noted this before — of Ed’s, of the now scrapped Captain John’s Seafood ship, of Sam The Record Man — but it seems an inescapable feeling for some of us as we watch the city change and grow, often in good, healthy ways: Something is shifting, something essential about what Toronto was is being replaced by something else, what Toronto will be. Ed’s is an especially large and glaring example of a city that was cheap and sort of tacky and mostly tacked together haphazardly, but was unembarrassed by it, and was practical and audacious in its grand ambitions at the same time. And Ed’s was an especially on-the-nose holdover from a Toronto full of places that offered an experience unique in the world. We don’t necessarily just miss these places we haven’t patronized for years for what they were, but for what they weren’t: generic outposts of the great global blah that makes eating or shopping or strolling a homogenous experience in major cities spanning the continent and much of the world. The residential apartment and retail store complex slated to replace Honest Ed’s promises to be something different from the glass-wall condo template that dominates much of the city now. We’ll see. It’s hard to believe it will be as different from anything else as what it is replacing. “There’s no place like this place, anyplace!” the sign on the corner of the building says, and for 68 years it wasn’t quite true, because there was this one place, right here. And now there won’t be. We bought one of those hand-painted signs as a souvenir, “Ladies and Misses Fashion Dresses $35.” The signs weren’t exactly the very best part, but it’s a fitting symbol of something worth remembering: it’s bright and direct and there is not another one quite like it in the world.

She has worked as a producer, writer and reporter at CBC bureaus across Canada since 2008. Related Stories Take a final tour of Honest Ed's with David Mirvish Community hopeful black heritage will remain in Mirvish Village Don't just stand there! Last chance to visit Honest Ed's Why losing Mirvish Village is like losing a piece of Toronto By its own admission on a sign on its pulsing, lit-up facade, "there's no place" like Honest Ed's, "anyplace." Now, after 68 years in business, the Toronto discount store that boasted about price-cutting, decades before Walmart, is closing. The building, with its famously bright signage and aggressive marketing of rock-bottom prices, was sold by the family of former owner and theatre mogul Ed Mirvish in 2013 to developer Westbank, which plans to rebuild the area. 'It's kind of sad' to see the store go, says Dwayne Batchelor, who has been coming to Honest Ed's since he was a child. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) Today is the last chance for customers to hunt for bargains at Honest Ed's, which has long sold everything from white socks to canned tuna, and has maintained a timeless presence as Canada's biggest city has evolved in countless ways around it. After 68 years in business, Honest Ed's closes its doors on New Year's Eve. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) "You could certainly go so far as to say that this is an iconic Canadian business," says Doug Stephens, founder of Retail Prophet. Like many Torontonians, Stephens' first experience in the store was as a child. "I remember it being some sort of fantastical emporium," he says. Stephens attributes its lasting success to the Mirvish family's involvement in the business as well as their sense of community, giving out free turkeys every Christmas to lineups of customers. "They had a really clear sense of who they were," he says. The store's prominent location at the midtown corner of Bloor and Bathurst streets also helped, he says. "You might argue that it bordered on garish, but it worked. Whether they intended it to or not, it became an iconic part of the city."  Torontonians capture photos of Honest Ed's famously garish sign as the retailer prepares to close. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) In its final 24 hours, the store's display tables are piled high with bits of its own history, as shoppers line up to purchase — or simply photograph — a piece of Honest Ed's. A big draw was the store's hand-painted sales signs advertising "Ed's bargains" such as ladies' "fashion tops" for a reasonable $2.99. Among the sparse bits of actual merchandise left, one woman found a coffee mug with the logo of another historic Toronto landmark, SkyDome, long since renamed Rogers Centre. The teller charged her 99 cents. Until now, it's been unlawful to remove these bags from Honest Ed's. Today, they're for sale. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) Now sifting through old store signs with his own young family, Dwayne Batchelor recalls how the store's commitment to bargains had a real impact on his childhood. "My parents were immigrants. They came from Jamaica, so this place allowed them to get things that they couldn't afford otherwise," he says. "It's kind of sad to see it being torn down, to be honest with you." To others, it was the glowing exterior of the building that has left its biggest mark. "It's going to be kind of sad that it's going to be dark," says shopper Michael Hopper. "In a way, it's like a theatre that's dimming its lights." The Toronto Transit Commission pays homage to Honest Ed's at its nearby Bathurst subway station with a display of the store's hand-painted signs. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) "People are so used to it being bright, and when you're driving from afar you know you're near Honest Ed's because it brightens up the corner," says Daiva Kryzanauskas. Having shopped at the store since she was a child in the 1960s, Kryzanauskas says she hopes the new development maintains some of the community feeling the store built in the neighbourhood. She says, "You won't have the big store to go to, but you can hang out where the icon was." 'It's going to be kind of sad that it's going to be dark,' says shopper Michael Hopper.

McDaniels says in his lawsuit that the rap act’s brand is “extremely valuable.” Comments aAFont Size One of the founding members of Run-DMC filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Jet.com, Amazon.com and other retailers Thursday, claiming the companies are selling products bearing the rap group's name without permission. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York by Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, one of the founding members of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand. The complaint accuses the companies of trademark dilution by "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products claiming to be Run-DMC styled products," while other items being sold directly infringe on a trademark registered in 2007. The lawsuit said the products are too numerous to list, but include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches and wallets. "It looks like they're attacking everybody all at once," said Martin Thoma, a principal at Little Rock brand leadership firm Thoma Thoma and author of Branding Like the Big Boys. "They want to force Amazon and Wal-Mart and any of these other e-retailers to strip any nonauthorized logo wear or products out of their website." Run-DMC was founded by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell in New York City in 1981. The influential group produced hits like It's Tricky and My Adidas. In 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. McDaniels said in the complaint the Run-DMC brand is "extremely valuable," producing more than $100 million in revenue based on music sales, publishing, concerts, merchandise and endorsement deals since the 1980s. Run-DMC has entered several licensing agreements for use of the trademark, including a $1.6 million endorsement deal with Adidas. The lawsuit claims the actions of the defendants have confused consumers into believing the group has endorsed their products and it also accuses the companies of diluting the Run-DMC brand. Mark Henry, a registered patent attorney with the Henry Law Firm in Fayetteville, said establishing that a mark is famous is key to qualifying for anti-dilution damages. "They're showing how famous it is, how distinctive it is, how it's recognizable and how it has value," Henry said after looking through the lawsuit. "They're meeting all the elements." [EMAIL UPDATES: Sign up for free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines] The lawsuit claims the retailers are "trading on the goodwill" of the group and have profited on the trademark for at least three years. Run-DMC will "suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage" if the companies do not stop selling the products because they're infringing on a trademark, causing confusion and continuing to utilize the mark in bad faith. In addition to Wal-Mart, Jet.com and Amazon, McDaniels identifies Vision World, Infinity Fashion and SW Global. The lawsuit said all three are Amazon business partners. Twenty additional companies are simply referred to as "John Does." McDaniels provided 13 pages of exhibits showing Run-DMC-labeled products being sold on Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Jet.com in the complaint. Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com this year. The items listed on Walmart.com include a Run-DMC soccer T-shirt, hooded sweatshirt and logo T-shirt sold and shipped by Minnesota's Rockabilia. Other products that appear on Walmart.com and are included in the lawsuit's exhibits are shipped and sold by Old Glory and Gravity Trading Inc. Wal-Mart did not return a message seeking comment about the lawsuit Friday. Neither did Christopher Brown, a Boston attorney who filed the complaint. Thoma said it's no surprise to see McDaniels take legal action against the companies. "The position of Run-DMC has to be to defend its trademark," Thoma said. "Anybody who registers a trademark does it because they understand the value of that intellectual property. A lot of times the only way to defend it is in the courts."

Photo by Dan Henry /Times Free Press. You would think Erlanger would have learned some lessons by now about management bonuses and the timing of them. But apparently not. Once again, dozens of Erlanger Health System's managers will divide about $3.1 million in "incentive pay," according to hospital executives. Word of the bonuses came one week after Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke pledged $1 million in city taxpayer money for a new children's hospital — a decision he reached after watching Erlanger's response to the Nov. 21 Woodmore bus crash, when nearly three dozen schoolchildren were rushed to the Children's Hospital emergency room. Six children were killed in the accident. "We had first responders, doctors, nurses, and administrators who poured their hearts and souls into caring for these children and their families," Berke said. But the hospital ER's crowded conditions meant critically injured patients and their families were forced to share a large common space "only separated by a curtain, where families could hear what others are saying, what's going on with a child." No one doubts the need for improved facilities at the East Third Street hospital, and in fact Erlanger is already in the middle of a campaign to raise $40 million for just the initial phase of the new hospital — an outpatient facility, not a new Children's ER. (The stated thinking is that outpatient offices drive revenue to help fund a new ER.) But doesn't anyone question what $3.1 million in top manager bonuses says to City Council members who still have to approve Berke's pledge? Does anyone question what $3.1 million in top manager bonuses says to Joe and Jane Public who are now being actively solicited for donations to this clear need? What does it say to Walmart stores that raised $195,586 for Children's Hospital just this month — the same month that Erlanger CEO Kevin Spiegel, for example, will receive about a 34 percent bonus on his salary of $800,386, or about $272,130 extra dollars? To be sure, Spiegel and his managers deserve kudos. After all, Erlanger was in dire financial straits when Spiegel arrived nearly four years ago. The hospital lost $36 million between 2008 and 2013, then earned $11.3 million in 2014 and $37.3 million in 2015. But it's worth adding here, too, that no small portion of the increased revenue Erlanger earned came from the fact that more people now have access to health care insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2015, Erlanger officials said the hospital boosted patient admissions by 9.4 percent and reported an increase in the number of surgeries by more than 7 percent. Where do we think that came from? It came from the jump in Tennessee residents who gained insurance. Erlanger did well. And so did the ACA — better known as Obamacare. The uninsured rate in Tennessee has fallen by 28 percent since the ACA was enacted in 2010, according to state and federal reports. We mentioned lessons Erlanger might have learned by now. Take for instance the one trustees should have learned in 2014 when they voted to pay out $1.7 million to 99 top managers. That vote came as an unsettling surprise to our local legislative delegation that had gone to the mat in Nashville and Washington for Erlanger to get $19 million in federal funding to save the hospital system from disaster. Local lawmakers went into hyperventilation mode and forced trustees to vote on the bonuses again in May. Ultimately nothing changed, of course, except that the hospital lost out on some other legislation they'd hoped lawmakers would pass for them. Just a few months later, Erlanger board members voted to pay out another $2.1 million in incentive pay to its then-top 124 executives for 2015. If you're keeping count, that's an average top manager bonus of about $16,900 in 2014, $17,200 in 2015, and $19,200 in 2016. But, hey, a couple of million here, another couple there and $3 million in a third year — that's chump change. Chump change for what could have been $7 million toward that new Children's Hospital instead became bonuses — a business expense defended with talk about fending off talent "competition." In the corporate world's top management levels, that may hold water. But most people work for salaries, not five-figure yearly bonuses. And frankly far too many Hamilton County residents don't even make in a year what those bonuses average. We truly hope Erlanger does well with its fundraising effort to build a new Children's Hospital, and we share the concern that the Children's ER facility needs vast improvement. But perhaps next year, the reward for those truly dedicated and truly already high-paid managers might be a multimillion-dollar boost to that cause itself — not to them.

(Photo: Jerry Lemenu, Special to the Fre) What's in a name? For Detroit terrorism suspect Sebastian Gregerson, apparently a lot, if his recent court filing is any indication. The 29-year-old defendant in a case involving grenades and explosives is trying to get the alias name "Abdurrahman Bin Mikaayl" deleted from his indictment, claiming he only used the name "on a whim" on  Facebook and that he uses his real name for everything else: his driver's license, paychecks, college courses, household bills and gun purchases. Not exactly, argues the federal government, which claims that Gregerson has used the alias "Abdurrahman" a lot more than he claims, and that the name connects him to the ISIL terrorist group and the crimes that he's charged with: having explosives and plotting to use them to kill people. Related stories: DETROIT FREE PRESS Indictment: Detroit man planned to kill with explosives DETROIT FREE PRESS FBI: CDs bearing radical cleric's name found in Detroit home "The defendant used this alias with social media and e-mail accounts that evidence his support of and identification with ISIL and which reveal communications with like-minded ISIL supporters," federal prosecutors wrote in a filing Friday, urging the court to let the alias stick on the indictment, which jurors will see. According to courtroom testimony, Gregerson converted to Islam more than a decade ago, after graduating from high school in Ann Arbor. He has worked at Target and Walmart, and taken courses at Henry Ford Community College. Gregerson, a gun enthusiast, military buff and married father of twins with no criminal history, has been jailed since July when authorities say he bought grenades from an undercover FBI agent at a Monroe gas station. The FBI started watching him after a tipster two years ago claimed that Gregerson had repeatedly expressed  support for ISIL, wanted to permanently move his family to ISIL-held territory and claimed to possess grenades. The tip triggered an investigation that led to an indictment, charging Gregerson with — among other things — obtaining  explosive materials with the intent of using them to kill and injure people. The indictment does not say who Gregerson allegedly intended to kill and injure and makes no mention of terrorism. But after Gregerson asked a judge to release him on bond and let him live with his family  pending the outcome of his trial — a request that is still pending  —  federal prosecutors started to disclose more details about his alleged ties to ISIL in an effort to keep him locked up. "The defendant is a supporter of the terrorist organization, Islamic State of Iraq and the levant (ISIL), and he acquired the explosives and other weapons to prepare to engage in violent acts aligned with ISIL," federal prosecutors wrote in a Dec. 22 filing. They also noted that Gregerson has been indicted in Virginia on charges that he bought two firearms in straw purchases. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors also are fighting to keep the alias "Abdurrahman" on the indictment, which jurors will see when the case goes to trial. According to the government's filing, Gregerson used the alias "Abdurrahman" in the following ways: * In numerous e-mail communications with ISIL supporters, Gregerson signed his e-mails, 'Abdurrahman,' " * He was known by friends and family as "Abdurrahman," including his wife, who called him "Abdurrahman" in text messages and had him listed in her telephone contact list as "Abdurrahman." * He created an e-mail account in the name of "Abdurrahman Gregerson" and sent several e-mails to ISIL supporters in which he praised ISIL actions and wrote in the subject heading of the e-mail "Allahu akbar" which means "God is great." In an e-mail sent March 19, Gregerson had the symbol of a smiling face in the subject line; the body of the e-mail was an article about an ISIL suicide bombing that killed 13 Egyptian policemen. "The defendant's Facebook posts also indicated the defendant's support for ISIL," prosecutors wrote. For example, prosecutors cited a Nov. 14, 2015 Facebook post — the day after the Paris terror attacks that killed 130 people — in which Gregerson "indicated ... that the attacks were legitimate and that the 'world is at war' " they wrote in court documents. According to court documents, Gregerson's public profile Facebook page in June 2015 used the name "Abdurrahman Bin Mikaayl" and displayed men on horseback, armed and dressed for battle, carrying the black ISIL flag. His Facebook profile page as of May 3, 2016, showed a single horseman carrying the ISIL flag. Gregerson's attorney, David Tholen, has long argued that the government is "overstating its case" and hasn't produced evidence that his client was planning a violent attack. He has argued that his client is a gun enthusiast and hunter who lawfully purchased his weapons. "Defendant denies ever stating that he wanted to move to an ISIL-controlled country or that he ever had grenades or a bazooka," Tholen has argued in court documents. "Possession of any grenades or bazooka was disproved when the government searched (Gregerson's) residence and found neither." As for his Facebook profile name, Tholen wrote: "He created it on a whim and has never used that name in any formal or informal interactions between institutions or individuals. 'Bin Mikaayl' is homage to his father and translates to 'son of Michael.' " And as for any comments or e-mails that Gregerson allegedly made about the conflict in the Muslim world, "while inflammatory," it's protected speech, Tholen wrote. And the government's claim that he possessed "grenade components is accurate but very misleading," he wrote. "Clearly, (Gregerson) possessed ammunition and the ammunition contained components which could be utilized to make explosives. However, (he) never attempted to make any explosives from dismantling his ammunition nor did he possess any manuals on how to do such things," Tholen wrote.

For the first time, it can ship grain directly from Ohio to feed the pigs that Smithfield slaughters at its Tar Heel, North Carolina, packing plant - the world's largest, processing about 32,000 hogs daily.   Smithfield now buys 65 percent of its animal feed directly from farmers, up from the 10 percent of feed it directly bought in 2010. The direct buying strategy aims to lower feed costs and could provide a model for other large meat companies that still largely rely on commercial grain handlers, such as Chicago-based Archer Daniels Midland Co. Grain can account for up to 60 percent of Smithfield's costs. The company's expenses in 2015 totaled $4.67 billion.   In 2014, Smithfield canceled a grain handling contract with CHS Inc, the largest U.S. farmer-owned cooperative, which had previously supplied a Smithfield feed mill in Yuma, Colorado. Smithfield has canceled contracts with other smaller grain handlers since 2010.   "They take the Walmart approach and go right to the source," said a CHS Inc employee who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. A CHS spokeswoman declined to comment.   Smithfield also aims to work directly with farmers to influence farm management, from crop rotations to fertilizer and fungicide applications that could result in higher-quality grain that speeds weight gain in hogs. Smithfield could have a say in the seeds that are planted for the grain to feed the hogs it slaughters to produce the pork it sells.   "In a dirt-to-fork story, you have to start with the dirt," said Joe Kerns, president of animal agriculture consulting firm Kerns Associates. "This is the first foray."   Smithfield, purchased by China's WH Group in 2013 for $4.9 billion, plans to continue reducing reliance on grain handlers, said Robbie Montgomery, Smithfield's grain origination manager. "That's key to our strategy, our farmer relationships. It's not us buying from a dealer; it's us buying from a farmer," Montgomery said.   Smithfield's push to go directly to farmers comes as ADM, Cargill and other leading grain handlers are facing sharp drops in corn and soy prices following record-large U.S. harvests. Handlers make money buying, selling, storing, transporting and processing grains around the world, typically earning small profit margins on each bushel they trade.   Trading fees for commercial grain handling can run to 20 cents a bushel in tight-supply markets, but drop to just a few pennies when grain prices are low. Juan Luciano, chief executive officer for ADM in an August conference call said weak margins in grain handling contributed to a 26 percent fall in profits during the second quarter, before revenues improved in the third quarter.   He did not mention Smithfield in particular, and ADM declined comment on its relationship with Smithfield. Cargill did not respond to requests for comment on Smithfield's efforts to bypass grain handlers.   U.S. farmers built up their elevator storage to better control their harvest, and hold back supplies when prices are low, cutting in to profits for handlers. In the last quarter of 2016, ADM and others have tried to make up reduced returns on grain trading in the U.S. by selling grain overseas and making money on storage of abundant U.S. supplies.   The Smithfield move alone is probably not enough to hurt the big grain handlers immediately, said Kerns, the agriculture consultant. Smithfield is a long way from quitting the big grain handlers altogether, and still relies on ADM and Cargill to crush soybeans into soy meal, an animal feed.   But such companies could lose substantial business if other meat producers follow Smithfield's lead, and smaller grain handlers are already feeling the impact. Smithfield in 2015 exited a 20-year relationship with MaxYield Cooperative in Algona, in northern Iowa. MaxYield previously supplied a Smithfield-owned feed mill in Algona that can grind 50,000 bushels of corn per day.   "They want control from the ground up," said Karl Setzer, MaxYield's risk management team leader, who was told by Smithfield that the company was not renewing its contract. Setzer declined to comment on how the loss of the contract affected MaxYield's business.   Smithfield buys about 150 million bushels of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum per year to feed its 16 million hogs, according to a Smithfield spokeswomen. "Smithfield has always been uneasy about their dependence on feed," said Chris Hurt, an agriculture economist at Purdue University who has advised the hog industry.   The company also is using a port it helped build in 2002, in Wilmington, North Carolina, to import feed from South America and Europe. It has imported soy from Brazil and Argentina and feed wheat from Europe when it is cheaper than supplies shipped out of the Midwest, most recently with a bulk vessel of Brazilian corn that arrived in June.   Smithfield's vice president for business development, Joe Szaloky, said the company has become a savvy buyer. "We think we can buy from farmers just as well as anyone else can," he said.

Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media Welcome back to Parental Advisory, where I answer all of your social media and IRL parenting etiquette questions. This week, let's acknowledge the tension that can arise when a friend has a new baby and seemingly falls off the planet. Here is one woman's example, but how many people have related to this feeling at some point in their adult lives? Question:  "I don't have kids, so I'm curious what the 'normal' or 'correct' etiquette is in this situation. My good friend of 20 years just had her first baby. Before she delivered, I told her I would be respectful and wait for her to invite me over to visit when she is ready. I bought a bag full of expensive baby gifts and tucked it away in my closet. She had the baby and she sent a few pics. I checked in every so often to see how she was feeling. Waited. Waited. Nothing. Several weeks went by and I had not heard from her, other than "we're doing good." So I started asking friends how long do new moms usually keep visitors away? I was told it can be up to two weeks. Friends suggested maybe she was waiting for me to ask to come by. Even though we discussed it, maybe she had baby brain and forgot our conversation. I started to get worried, I didn't want her to think just because I don't have kids, I am not interested or supportive of hers. After a month, it happened to also be Christmas time. So I texted her and said I had some gifts for the baby, would it be okay to come by and drop them off sometime in the next few weeks? She said it was fine. We made plans for me to stop by one day after work. She mentioned it had to be a specific day because she was taking the baby out of town that weekend to her mother-in-law's. I thought nothing of it. I got to her house (an hour and a half drive) and she was sitting on the sofa with the baby on a big pillow on her lap. I come in and sit down, we start chatting... She does not acknowledge the GIANT gift bag, nor does she offer to let me hold the baby (who is now six weeks old). I ended up sitting with the cat on my lap instead. An hour goes by, I say I need to get going, and ask her if she wants to open her gift. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WEIRD. She says, "I have the baby, so why don't you open it for me?" I said, "Why don't you trade me and I'll hold the baby for a few minutes?" She says, "Well, I know you don't like kids... Maybe I'll just put him on the sofa." I said, "Obviously I will love YOUR kid! I've been dying to hold him since I got here!" She says, "Okay, maybe just for a minute." And places the baby — pillow and all — on my lap. She opens the gift bag, looks over the little outfits I had selected with love and care, and mentions they may be too small. I wanted to point out that they were purchased before Snowflake was born and perhaps had I been able to come by sooner, it would not have been a wasted gift. Also, they were not Newborn size, they were 3-6mo. I did my best. She then proceeds to tell me all about the very expensive and extravagant gifts her other friends gave her, making my little outfits and stuffed animals look like Walmart clearance bin items. I asked her what she had been up to and she started complaining about how she just wanted time alone with her baby and all these people keep dropping by. She said, "Don't people understand, if I want you to come over, I'll call you and invite you over?!" She said she had not invited anyone over to see the baby yet, and the only people who had seen him were people who'd invited themselves. I asked her how long she felt she wanted to have with the baby before having company, and she said she wanted him to be on a set schedule, and sleeping through the night before people started coming over. I asked how long that takes, and she said (without blinking) "up to 6 months." So, I guess if I had not asked to come over, I was not going to hear from her for 6 months?? I drove home feeling like my best friend had been taken over by aliens. I guess we're not friends anymore. She made it pretty clear that our 20 years of sleepovers, vacations, proms, spa days, and movie nights have been forgotten in the wake of this 7lb. meatloaf. But really, is this normal? Will it pass, or is she just out of my life now? Is there really not enough room for both of us in her world? I don't understand how having a baby is a get-out-of-jail-free card for turning your back on the people who have stood by you and loved you your whole life. And I'm sure if I say anything, I'll get the ol' 'You need to understand I'm a MOTHER now.' Or, 'I have a BABY.' I'm trying to be a supportive friend during this new chapter in her life, like I have been through everything else. Why would a baby be any different?? And WHY IS SHE ACTING SO CRAZY??" — A. Answer: When a couple has a baby, they tend to fall into one of two camps: Either they're eager to introduce their little one to friends and family (and neighbors and coworkers too) within the first few weeks or they're a bit standoffish for the first few months. There's no magic formula, and the reasons for being standoffish can range from feeling paranoid about germs to being drained of energy and not knowing when to request that people come over. I have a feeling, based on your email, A., that your friend might be going through a bit of the latter. She doesn't sound depressed or even especially overwhelmed, but her mentioning that she'd rather have her baby on a sleep schedule before having guests over suggests to me that she might be a type A personality, and having a baby has thrown her into a world of accelerated chaos. She can't yet anticipate when the baby will cry, sleep, poop or eat (the four things babies are capable of doing), and it might be making her kind of nuts. Or maybe she's enjoying figuring out this whole parenting thing, but she'd rather do it without anyone hovering around her. For parents of preemies, having friends over is a huge deal because it means the baby is healthy enough to be around people, which can take some time. In the case of your friend, A., it sounds like she's the one getting used to the new adjustment. The baby is perfectly healthy, but your friend might be on edge and in need of some extended solo time. It's ironic, because within a year, she'll probably be posting things like this online: Image: STFU Parents That said, you're a great friend for being so supportive and wanting to be there for her. You've shown an interest in meeting the baby, holding the baby and giving the baby gifts, and you were willing to drive over an hour each way just to do so. She and the baby are lucky to have you in their lives. But no matter how much you want to show her you're interested, the way things will play out from here is (somewhat irritatingly) based more on her than it is on you. Here is my advice — pure and simple #RealTalk — based on my personal experiences with friends with babies, in the form of a handy list. How to deal with old friends who have new babies (especially if you don't have kids yourself): 1. Get the baby a gift. Do not expect the parent(s) to notice or take extra appreciation of the fact that you bought the baby the expensive shit. Unfortunately, parents only notice when you get the baby cheap shit (because the baby's skin is sensitive or the toy is made of cheap plastic, etc.). I'm not saying parents won't notice that the super-trendy socks you got their infant cost as much as a week's worth of groceries, but they will likely not say anything about it. I, too, buy pricey baby gifts for my friends and have learned that it's not worth asking myself if I should've just bought a single onesie from Target versus the 900 other items I purchased. I can only assume the gift will be appreciated, even if I'm never made aware of it. Some parents will handwrite thank you cards. Some will take pictures of their baby wearing the expensive socks you bought. Others will never mention your gifts again and you just have to live with that. Regarding when to give the gift: Always try to pass along the gift before the baby is born. After that, things get hectic, as you've learned, A., when trying to negotiate a time to come by. Pre-baby gifts are cherished and cause excitement. Post-baby gifts are cherished and cause some excitement, but not nearly as much excitement as parents feel when staring into the eyes of their young, perfect progeny. (Barf.) So try to get your gift in early. Also, when in doubt, size up. Newborn onesies last, like, 48 hours according to most new parents, so starting at 3 to 6 months for clothing size is smart. I have no idea why your friend said your 3- to 6-month options might be too big. In my mind, there's no way they're too big, so maybe she was just throwing a defensive remark your way out of resentment for having a visitor. That's pretty uncool, but since she's a hormonal new mom, you're supposed to forgive her. (Barf x 2) [P.S.: You don't have to forgive her if you don't feel like it.] 2. Speaking of hormones, postpartum depression can be harder for new moms to discuss than they let on. I have a large handful of friends who occasionally comment on the first year of parenthood as being shockingly depressing or hormonally difficult, but they certainly weren't acting that way (in person or online) during that first year because they weren't ready to admit it. If your friend experiences emotional ups and downs or seems to be pushing you away or ignoring you, it's always a possibility that she's feeling blue. It's also possible that you're feeling blue for your own reasons and need her for emotional support too. If that happens, just tell her so. You'll feel better. If she seems sad or irrationally angry, ask her about it. 3. Be prepared for your friend to find new-mom friends with whom she can take classes, schedule playdates and commiserate. You and your friend have shared history, including prom, sleepovers, first boyfriends, etc., and no one can take that away from you, but this baby stuff isn't the same. You can still be best friends, but your friend will inevitably form a posse of parents on whom she can rely for parenting-specific issues and/or babysitting trade-offs. It doesn't mean you're any less important to her; try to think of it more like someone who's in law school and now spends most of her time with classmates studying. Parents are only up their own asses and the asses of their children for the first few years or so. If your friendship has sustained 20 years already, you still have many more years of friendship to come down the line. 4. We should probably all accept that some parents are willing to have friends over to meet the baby sooner than others. Our expectations should be reduced to essentially nothing. Is this annoying? Hell, yes, it's annoying. You can't rely on people with newborn babies as much as you can rely people who don't have newborn babies — this is a fact, and it can be frustrating. But it's also reality, so try not to take a friend's disappearing act too personally. She might even be jealous of you getting regular eight-hour intervals of sleep and not dealing with milk-filled boobs or wiping a baby's ass half a dozen times a day. Of course, she'd never say this. She'd rather talk about how much she loves being a mom or imply that motherhood is superior to being childless. But the truth is, the amount of love that's gained by having a baby is in direct proportion to the amount of sleep that's lost. That inverse relationship is one you don't have to contend with, A., and I say savor and enjoy it. Besides, it might be worth celebrating that your friend isn't the type to post those obnoxious "visitation rules" signs on Facebook. Those people are the worst, and you can rest easier knowing your friend registers several notches above that. Image: STFU Parents 5. Finally, to address the real heart of your question — "Why do some parents act so CRAZY after the baby is born??" — all I can say is that some people pop out a kid and think the world should suddenly revolve around them, and some people don't. None of us can fully prepare for the changes our friends will go through when they become parents because it's hard to predict. I've had some friends turn into near-strangers. Others morphed into uptight, preachy jerks seemingly overnight, and now all they do is whine on Facebook about daylight savings time. I've also watched as some friends become more relaxed, more able to enjoy life and maybe even make more room in their lives for friends and family (kids or not!), which has been a delightful surprise. Hopefully, your friend will tell you how much she appreciates your gifts and the time it took for you to get them to her, A. If she doesn't, it'll be disappointing, but it doesn't have to be the end of your friendship. Some people just need time to adjust to parenthood and get back to their old selves again, while others keep changing until they're practically unrecognizable... and you won't want to be friends with them anymore anyway.

East Oregonian Published on December 30, 2016 4:58PM Last changed on December 30, 2016 8:55PM Hermiston’s new bus system is ready to pick up its first passengers on Tuesday. The HART — short for Hermiston Area Regional Transit — will run around the city from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. It is free and open to anyone. The route has 33 stops and is scheduled to stop at each four times during the day. Stops include the Stafford Hansell Government Building, Good Shepherd Medical Center, Wal-Mart, Safeway and downtown. Passengers can also connect to the Hermiston Hopper, which runs between Hermiston, Pendleton, Umatilla, Stanfield and Irrigon. The full schedule can be found on the city of Hermiston’s website at hermiston.or.us. The system is run by Kayak Public Transit in partnership with the city of Hermiston. It will be paid for by a combination of city general fund dollars and grants. The HART will not replace the senior and disabled taxi ticket program that the city also runs. Assistant city manager Mark Morgan said the city views the schedule and route as a “starting point.” The public transit committee will meet with Kayak Public Transit quarterly to make adjustments based on customer feedback. “Frankly, public transit is expensive, and this new service represents a major commitment of additional annual funding toward public transit by the city council,” Morgan said in a news release. “So please understand that we view these operating hours as a starting point for a public transit system that we hope will grow in to a long-term sustainable service for the community well in to the future.” Share and Discuss Guidelines User Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The caller claimed that he was now charged with drunk driving and that the other car involved had a pregnant woman inside. The victim was then put through to someone claiming to be the woman's attorney, who negotiated a $2,500 payment that was made in the form of a Moneygram obtained at the Mayfield Walmart and sent to a woman in Boston for processing. The $2,500 Moneygram was picked up within 10 minutes in Massachusetts, and police are now looking for leads in the scam. Identity theft, fraud; Shaker Boulevard: A resident, 66, reported Dec. 27 that someone had been making fraudulent charges on his Discover Card in recent months, all of which were negated after investigation. This was followed by bogus charges on his United Airlines credit card, which were also cleared by the company's frauds investigation unit. The latest notification came from Bank of America, which informed him that they still had a few questions about his Small Business Credit line recently opened for a landscaping firm in Florida. He told them that he had a few questions too, since he knew nothing about it. The man believes that the problems date back to security breaches of his personal information through the Veterans' Affairs Department, as well as his security clearance with the federal government. Identity theft, fraud; Gates Mills Boulevard: A resident, 64, reported Dec. 28 that fraudulent accounts had been opened in her name at The Gap, Home Depot and Amazon.com. She said that when she received a copy of her credit report, she found two telephone numbers that were not hers. Mutual aid, Fairmount Boulevard: Responding to a call for assistance from Beachwood police following a hit-skip accident at Richmond Road and Fairmount about 5:30 p.m. on Dec. 28, an officer pursued a light blue Honda Odyssey eastbound on Fairmount and attempted to make a traffic stop. But as the van was driving erratically while fleeing, the officer made note of the correct license plate number and abandoned pursuit when the suspect doubled back onto westbound Cedar Road and into heavier traffic. Runaways, Chagrin Boulevard: Staff at the New Directions drug treatment facility reported that two boys in treatment -- ages 15 and 16, from Avon Lake and Cleveland, respectively -- had left the facility around 10 a.m. on Dec. 29. Police learned they were returned by one of their mothers about four hours later. -- The same Cleveland boy, 16, had walked off from New Directions on Dec. 26 and was returned the next day by his mother. Found property, Lombardy and North Deer Creek lanes: Someone turned in a prescription bottle of Adderall found in the snow on or around Dec. 23. It was placed in the evidence room for safekeeping. Warrant served, South Woodland Road: A Cleveland woman, 45, was stopped Dec. 23 on a warrant for failure to pay fines. She was taken to the Beachwood Jail and released on personal recognizance with a Payment Ability Hearing to be scheduled in court.

These dividend giants have fallen on tough times, and that could spell opportunity for patient investors. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Dec 30, 2016 at 5:54PM Image source: Getty Images. Income investors have a strong preference for stocks that consistently hike their dividends. Since predictable cash flow is a priority, they pass over companies that can't show rising returns during the inevitable industry downturn. That's why many investors shop among the short list of Dividend Aristocrats, which are companies that boast an unbroken streak of at least 25 years of consecutive payout raises. A few members of that elite group have fallen out of favor recently and could represent solid long-term buys. Below, we'll look at the prospects for market-beating returns from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). Coca-Cola Coca-Cola is about as close as you can get to a recession-proof business. Through the world's largest distribution system, it slings nearly 2 billion servings of beverages around the globe each day. Its portfolio spans 500 brands, including four of the top five sparkling drink franchises on earth: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta, and Sprite. That unique market position has powered impressive income growth for investors as Coke raised its dividend in each of the last 54 fiscal years. However, the rate of growth is slowing: Coke's latest hike was just 6%, compared to 8% in 2015 and 9% in 2014. The beverage titan is struggling with weak volume growth due to consumers rejecting many of the core ingredients, including sugar, upon which it built its empire. It has responded by revamping its portfolio with products like Zero Sugar Coca-Cola, yet shares declined in 2016 even as the market surged higher. The recent installation of James Quincey as Coke's new CEO suggests the company aims to aggressively alter its cherished formulas so that all the industry's biggest growth isn't confined to rivals. Target Target's stock fell 2% in 2016, a year that saw the retailer hike its dividend by 7% to mark its 45th consecutive payout raise. Target is struggling even more than rival Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to find growth in a weak shopping industry: Customer traffic is down 1% over the last nine months while Wal-Mart has enjoyed a slight increase. Image source: Getty Images. The retailer has navigated through rough times like these before, though, thanks to a powerful pairing of price leadership in some product segments and premium offerings in others. That approach, which leans heavily on what management calls its signature categories (including beauty and apparel) leads to significantly higher profitability than peers. Its gross margin is 30% of sales, compared to Wal-Mart's 26%. Like most major retailers, Target's growth prospects are at least partially hobbled by the trend toward online shopping. Yet that's no reason for investors to ignore what, at 3.3%, amounts to one of the most generous dividend yields in the industry. Lowe's No matter what it does, Lowe's can't seem to break out of Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) long shadow. Despite a fast-growing store footprint, it trails its larger home-improvement rival in the key metrics of sales growth, profitability, and return on invested capital. It's no surprise, then, that shares fell by 6% in 2016, compared to a 2% gain for Home Depot and a 10% jump for the broader market. Image source: Getty Images. However, Lowe's dominates in the metric of dividend longevity. Its payout has ticked higher each year since 1961, and that streak includes the brutal three-year period around the housing market crises that forced Home Depot to pause its dividend raises. That makes Lowe's the only Dividend Aristocrat to represent the home-improvement industry, in part thanks to its more conservative capital allocation approach. The company allocates 35% of annual profits to dividends, compared to Home Depot's 50% target. Between the three choices, though, I'd bet on Coca-Cola at today's prices. Sure, it will take time for beverage portfolio changes to spark faster sales growth, but patient investors can collect a 3.3% dividend yield while they wait for those improved industry conditions. Its long business history, meanwhile, demonstrates that the drink giant has a knack for adjusting to shifting consumer demands. That challenge is made much easier by assets like a massive marketing budget and unmatched global distribution network. Short-term bumps aside, a decade from now Coke is likely to be selling well over 2 billion beverage servings each day and sending much of the profit back to shareholders.   Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Home Depot.

OKLAHOMA CITY - Investigators say a Christmas Eve fire that killed an Oklahoma City woman was an accident. As the victim's sisters come to terms with the tragedy, they also want to thank first responders for trying to help. Growing up, the sisters were inseparable. Their names even rhymed - Janae, Shanae and Tonae. They thought nothing would ever keep them apart until, a Christmas Eve fire that killed Tonae. "She pretty much kept the glue to all of us, keeping us all together. Very family oriented. Very family oriented,” said Janae Alexander. Tonae was the outgoing one. The first to introduce herself, to make you laugh and to help a stranger.  "Like we'll be at Wal-Mart or something and someone needs something or she'll like see a homeless person or something.” Janae said, “She's the type of person that she'll show so much compassion for someone she'll cry. She'll be like, ‘Sister I just want to help them so bad. What can we do?’" Shanae Alexander recalls the sisters’ long phone conversations. "She would just be like put me on the conference call. So, to know that we can't do those conference calls anymore is just heartbreaking,” said Shanae. Janae had spent the day with Tonae Christmas Eve. They shopped and joked around. Janae came back to her sister’s apartment moments after firefighters had removed her body. "You just don't see how she could just be gone in the blink of an eye when you had spent all day with that person. So, it was really hard and I was in denial,” said Janae. Tonae had been cooking and the family believes she had a medical issue and lost consciousness. The food caught fire, flames spread, and just like that Tonae was gone. Her sisters want to thank the firefighters and police officers who tried to help. "They consoled us a lot.” The sisters said, “They really did a really great job. I just wanted to thank them.  I know they don't get thanked in these types of situations." Going into the new year the sisters say they’ll miss Tonae’s kindness; her love for her family and friends; but most of all, they’ll miss her smile. "Her smile was so contagious.” Shanae said, “That even when I go through my phone or anything, any picture, you know she took she always had a big smile."

But the shortage isn’t limited to North Carolina stores. Nintendo recommends that consumers turn to retailers such as Target, Best Buy, Walmart and GameStop for the console, but searches on those retailers’ websites show that the various 3DS models are out of stock. In some cases, the cheaper 2DS model is also unavailable. In addition to these major retailers not having the 3DS in stock at stores within a 250-mile radius of North Carolina’s largest cities, including Raleigh, they’re also sold out online. Nor can consumers place a reserve order for when the system becomes available. Employees at local retailers say they’ve fielded many calls about the gaming system since before Thanksgiving and have faced their share of frustrated customers. But they don’t see an end in sight. Meanwhile, online retailers such as Amazon and eBay list inflated prices for the models of the 3DS they have, which run for about $200 at major retailers. Most systems available on Amazon are sold by third-party retailers, not Amazon. Consumers have taken to using inventory tracking websites such as instock.net to track when 3DS consoles arrive at local stores. But, according to one Target employee, even when Target stores get a shipment, they usually receive only one or two units per location. On Twitter and a few online forums, people questioned why there appears to be such a low supply of 3DS consoles since the gaming system isn’t a new release. The most recent model that isn’t a special edition was released last year. People speculated about an apparent trend on the part of Nintendo to create artificial scarcity for its products, though they noted that’s been reserved for new releases in the past. Some speculated that the popularity of the new Pokemon Sun and Moon games had driven up demand for the 3DS. But no one seemed to have any answers, and Nintendo isn’t supplying any. When asked about the shortage of 3DS consoles in North Carolina and across the country, a Nintendo of America spokesman provided a terse statement from the company: “We have nothing to announce on this topic.” Abbie Bennett: 919-836-5768; @AbbieRBennett Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:23 Intelligence officials confident Russians behind election attacks Pause 2:18 Clinton: Fake news 'epidemic' is 'putting lives at risk' 2:18 Low temperatures will follow snow as winter storm approaches the Triangle 1:01 Raleigh sled hunters find elusive ticket to ride 3:16 NC Gov.

"We're really excited to add them to our current mix," she said. PetSmart has stores in Chicopee and Enfield, Connecticut. Best Buy closed its Hadley store in the fall of 2015. While there is a Petco and Dave's Soda and Pet Food City nearby, PetSmart "is very interested in the Route 9 market," Gray said. "They saw the growth happening in the area." In addition to PetSmart, Planet Fitness will join the mall, moving from its current location near Walmart at Mountain Farms to space near JCPenney in March. Hannoush Jewelers is moving into a new space across the way as other mall tenants are being moved into that store's current space, Gray said. The mall has bolstered its entertainment component, which includes Cinemark and Interskate, with the addition of Autobahn Indoor Speedway, which opened in October. Autobahn is offering a special New Year's Day 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. event as well as New Year's Eve day event from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. [enhanced link] Interskate is offering an overnight skating party from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. on New Year's Eve for $19.95 that includes a balloon drop at midnight. Gray said "we see a lot of cycles" at the mall in terms of businesses coming and going. She said with the mix of retail and entertainment, "we're staying current, staying relevant with the market. I think the entertainment is a very nice complement to the existing retail." "We service UMass," she said. "When we make merchandising decisions, those things are factored in."

A repeat shoplifting offender is accused of going back to his old habits. Forty-one year old James Comstock has been arrested for larceny, criminal entry and shoplifting. Investigators with the Casper Police Department say from July through December 2016, there were numerous instances when Comstock would take items from either Casper Walmart store or Target, without paying. In some instances he would return the items fraudulently for a refund, and some of the items were being kept in a vehicle that was reported stolen from a dealership and was “filled to the brim” with an estimated $6,000 worth of shoplifted items and drug paraphernalia. Eventually Comstock was found sleeping in the storage units under construction on forest drive, with several items that allegedly had recently been shoplifted, and several items that had allegedly been stolen from the construction that was going on. Investigators have since collected various video evidence from the reported shoplifting instances. Earlier in December, Comstock had been released from jail after serving time in an unrelated matter.

Find The Full List Here BuzzWorthy 0 0 0 December 30, 2016 New Year’s Eve 2016 Hours: What Grocery Stores And Restaurants Are Open On NYE? Find The Full List Here Nathan Francis It’s New Year’s Eve, and if you’re looking to find out which stores or restaurants are open and which are closed, you might find it’s a difficult task. While many bars and restaurants stay open to give customers a place to have a nice meal and watch the ball drop, others choose to close down earlier and let their employees ring in the new year with friends and family. Many stores are the same way, with offering normal hours to squeeze the most out of the after-Christmas sales and others shutting their doors early. So if you’re planning on going out for New Year’s Eve 2016 — or just need to run a few errands — below you will find a list of what’s open and what’s closed as 2016 comes to an end. What’s closed (or closing early) on New Year’s Eve 2016 New Year’s Eve isn’t a federal holiday, but it does fall on a weekend this year, so all the government offices that are normally on weekday hours only will (obviously) remain closed on December 31 this year. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Many destinations will close early, however. Fast food restaurants like Burger King, McDonald’s, and Subway are open on New Year’s Eve during the day, but many locations close early in the evening (depending on ownership). The same is true of gas stations, with many closing down earlier in the evening. Below is a full list of stores that are closing early (via Al.com). Aldi — Closing 7 p.m. Best Buy — Closing at 7 p.m. Costco — Closing at 6 p.m. Fresh Market — Closing at 8 p.m. Home Depot — Closing at 7 p.m. Lowe’s — Closing at 6 p.m. Publix — Closing at 9 p.m. Starbucks — Closing at 9 p.m. Target — Closing at 9 p.m. Trader Joe’s — Closing at 6 p.m. Walmart — Closing at at 8 p.m. (Super Centers remain open 24 hours) Wegmans — Closing at 9 p.m. Most banks will also be open for shorter hours on New Year’s Eve, though again this isn’t unusual for a weekend anyway. The website GoBankingRates.com has a list of all the major banks you can find open on December 31. What’s open on New Year’s Eve 2016? With many grocery stores closing early, it can be a tight squeeze if you need to grab some last-minute supplies for a New Year’s Eve party. Luckily, there will be a few options for late-night shoppers, including some stores that are remaining open 24 hours. All Walmart Supercenters will be open 24 hours, as will select 24-hour locations of drugstore chains CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens. And those planning to go out for a meal can find New Year’s Eve restaurant hours below (via Patch.com). Applebee’s — Open until midnight Denny’s — Most locations open 24 hours Olive Garden — Normal business hours on New Year’s Eve Ruby Tuesday — Most locations open until 11 p.m. TGIF — Most locations open normal business hours Waffle House — Most locations open 24 hours Many other attractions are open normal hours on New Year’s Eve, including movie theaters. If you want to ring in the new year by watching one of the Oscar contenders or a holiday-season blockbuster, you’ll be able to do it pretty much anywhere. Most major movie theater chains will remain open normal hours, though smaller chains or independent theaters may vary. [Image by Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images] Museums and some theme parks in warmer locations are also open New Year’s Eve, though some may have abbreviated hours in the evening. There will likely be plenty of other local restaurants and stores open on New Year’s Eve 2016, but if you’re planning a nice meal or want to watch the ball drop at your favorite bar, it’s best to call ahead to make sure they’re staying open.

An employee was just arrested for selling empty gift cards and keeping money for herself.  Anyone who bought a gift card between December 9 and December 25 could be a victim. According to police, Samaria Williams was caught when a woman bought a nearly 400 dollar gift card and tried to use it the same day. The arresting officer says when people bought gift cards, Williams would quickly swipe her own card behind the register and give the customer a blank one. Then she would go shopping in the store on her break with other people's money. Loganville Police said the cashier was hoping most people buying gift cards wouldn't try to use them immediately. If enough time passed, security video would get erased, making it harder to prove she did it on purpose. If you gave someone a Walmart gift card from the Loganville store make sure that person checks the balance before they go shopping.  They can call this number on the back of the card to find out.  Hopefully you still have the receipt, but if not, Walmart says they will try their best to work something out for you.  Copyright WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation) 2016.

Iconic Hip Hop trio Run DMC has filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against Walmart and Amazon for the unauthorized use of their trademarked name. Associated Press reports say court documents list Darryl "DMC" McDaniels as the plaintiff in the suit, which accuses the brands of "improperly profiting" off of a wide range of merchandise bearing the trademark Run DMC name and logo. Specifically, the group says the brands are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" without permission to use the name. Subscribe to our daily newsletter for the latest in hair, beauty, style and celebrity news. The suit also claims the use of the name by the brands has "diluted" the Run DMC brand and made in excess of $100 million in revenue in the process. Run DMC is seeking $50 million in damages from Amazon, Walmart, Jet and several other retailers selling the product for profit.

Internet by Laura Hautala December 30, 2016 12:18 PM PST @lhautala Up Next CES is finally open: Here's what you missed Darryl McDaniels, member of hip-hop and rap group RUN-DMC, at the "Children Uniting Nations Second Annual National Conference" in Washington DC. McDaniels filed a trademark lawsuit against Amazon, Walmart and Jet.com on Thursday.Photo by Douglas Sonders, WireImage for BMF Media Group That RUN-DMC gear you bought online might not be legitimate. That's the claim of one of the hip-hop group's founders in a lawsuit filed Thursday in a New York federal court. The suit, filed by Darryl McDaniels, targets Amazon, Walmart and Jet.com and their partners for trademark infringement. "The products sold by the Defendants confuse the public as to the source of the products and suggests that RUN-DMC endorses the products," the lawsuit complaint alleges. "The Defendants are trading on the goodwill of [RUN-DMC]." The suit highlights the challenges online retailers face when they allow third parties to sell products through their websites. Amazon itself has filed a lawsuit in Washington state court trying to curb the sale of counterfeit items on its own platform. What's more, Apple said in October that around 90 percent of "genuine" Apple products being sold on Amazon were fake in a lawsuit filed in a northern California federal court against a third-party seller. However, Thursday's lawsuit claims Amazon sells and markets some of the fake RUN-DMC items itself in addition to fulfilling orders made to its partners. Amazon and Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walmart completed its acquisition of online retailer Jet.com in September. The counterfeit RUN-DMC items include shirts, patches, wallets, hats and glasses, according to the complaint. "The Defendants have earned substantial revenue due to their unlawful use of Plaintiff's trademark," the complaint reads.

Staff Report Share Comment Read Article 1 of 4 A crew from Costello Dismantling continue the demolition of the former Levine's building Nov. 1 in downtown Waterville. A hotel is planned in its place as part of downtown revitalization efforts. Staff file photo by Michael G. Seamans Burgeoning efforts at downtown revitalization in Waterville, the closure of Madison’s landmark paper mill and the killing of a Fairfield woman, allegedly by her husband, top the list of local news stories for 2016. Other top stories include an election in which Kennebec County voters opted to turn out a sitting sheriff for a deputy sheriff in neighboring Lincoln County. In the Fairfield killing case, Valerie Tieman initially was reported missing Sept. 9 by her parents, who live in South Carolina; but her body was discovered Sept. 20 on property where she had been living with her husband, Luc Tieman. A day later, police charged Luc Tieman with murder in connection with the killing. He initially told police she had disappeared from his pickup truck outside Wal-Mart in Skowhegan but later said she had died of an overdose when her body was found buried in Luc Tieman’s parents’ backyard off Norridgewock Road in Fairfield. In interviews with the Morning Sentinel, Tieman’s friends said he had been unfaithful to his wife and sought companionship with other women, telling them his marriage was ending around the time she disappeared. An autopsy report from the state medical examiner’s office says Valerie Tieman died of two gunshot wounds in the head. The report also said a bag of potato chips, a bottle of perfume and a note that “reportedly has an apologetic tone” were found beneath her buried body. Luc Tieman pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and his case remains pending. In Madison, about 214 employees were laid off after the Madison Paper Industries mill was closed in May. The mill’s parent company, UPM-Kymmene Inc. and Northern SC Paper Corp., announced the closure and cited as a main reason a decline in demand for supercalendered paper, the glossy magazine paper made at the Madison mill. On Friday, the company announced the sale of the mill to a joint venture of other firms. Meanwhile, downtown revitalization efforts in Waterville began to take shape, with the Harold Alfond Foundation and Colby College announcing they will infuse $20 million into projects to launch what eventually will become “tens of millions of dollars more” in downtown investments. Colby College bought five vacant, deteriorating buildings downtown as part of revitalization efforts, with plans to either tear them down or partner with investors to redevelop them — all in an effort to bring more people downtown to live, work, shop, eat, recreate — and boost the economy. Those efforts have involved the demolition of the former Levine’s store on Main Street, where a hotel is planned to be under construction in the coming year; and the razing of the former Elks building on Appleton Street, which will be a parking lot. Colby also plans to start building a residential complex next year for students and staff members on the northeast corner of The Concourse. On Election Day, voters went 33,387-31,644 for independent Ken Mason, of Readfield over the Democrat, Sheriff Ryan Reardon, of Oakland, for Kennebec County sheriff. Reardon, who has been sheriff since April, had succeeded Randall Liberty, who resigned to become warden at the Maine State Prison. Mason had been with the Augusta Police Department before going to Lincoln County. Reardon joined the Kennebec Sheriff’s Office as a patrol deputy in 2007 after more than a decade with the Waterville Police Department. Prominent people who died during the year included Kennebec County Probate Judge James Mitchell, of Vassalboro. His widow, former Maine Senate President and Speaker of the House Elizabeth Mitchell, was elected in November to replace him. In September, the VA Maine Healthcare Systems-Togus celebrated 150 years of serving veterans, making the occasion with a gathering that included Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald and Maine’s entire congressional delegation. In other news, two parents, Christopher Norwood and Karen Lea, were charged endangering their young children in separate incidents. A 2-year-old boy was rescued Sept. 17 as he was drowning in the Kennebec River, and an Amber Alert was issued for a 3-year-old Augusta girl on Oct. 4 when she disappeared after police and firefighters responded to a report of a medical emergency at a Sewall Street home. The girl was taken to the city police station later that evening. The boy was revived and later released from the hospital to “a safe location” designated by the state Department of Health and Human Services, according to Augusta police at the time.

(Drew Gurian/Invision/AP) The rap group Run-DMC filed a $50 million US lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group's name without permission. A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding. The group's hits include King of Rock, It's Tricky, and Can You Rock It Like This. In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honour. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. © The Associated Press, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines Suspect arrested in Fort Lauderdale airport shooting that killed 5 video Got the flu?

Share Adjust Comment Print Yikes! Mere hours away from your New Year’s Eve event and you’re short on elegant canapés. Don’t freak out, like I most definitely would: Consider some ready-made appies. Piping Cheez Whiz onto celery isn’t what I speak of (although I know of a cool professor type who would like nothing better, right John?) I talk of gourmet style appies dressed and ready to go. No cooking, no crying, no shame, often better-tasting than if you’d made them yourself. In some cases, that’s a certainty. I don’t make all my appies from scratch, especially at New Year. Then, I’m a charcuterie-seeking missile aimed at Oyama Sausage Co. at the Granville Island Public Market. Don’t bolt upon seeing a disheartening lineup on New Year’s Eve. Twenty minutes here will earn you many oohs and ahs later. Lately, I’ve favoured duck prosciutto and Serrano ham. Next, I walk over to Benton Brothers Fine Cheese and buy a couple of cheeses. Then I might stroll over to The Lobster Man and bag some beautiful oysters from the tank to serve on the half shell. I’ve served them with a grapefruit granita, but they’re perfect with lemon wedges, too. Another seafood treat I like, although it’s not for everyone, is fresh uni with potato chips (and a sparkling wine). Crazy, but I find it a perfect trinity. Since in Metro Vancouver there are many finely tuned palates belonging to chefs, I phoned some for store-bought appie suggestions. They’re a crazy busy lot, and do outsource at times. Rob Belcham, of Campagnolo restaurants, is a fellow Oyama Sausage fan. “They make unbelievable cured or smoked hams, which I get cut paper thin. I’ll get big chunks of pate de foie gras or country pate to serve with it and the best gherkins in the city, imported from France to serve with it.” Cioffi’s in Burnaby, J, N & Z Deli in East Van, Greco’s Specialty Foods in Surrey, D Original Sausage in Richmond, and Black Forest Deli in West Vancouver are other options for charcuterie. Oyama Sausage Co. on Granville Island.  Wayne Leidenfrost Belcham heads to Les Amis du Fromage for cheese. “One cheese I really love is the triple cream Pierre Robert. It’s super, super delicious. And I’ll get  a harder cheese, like Gruyere and aged Manchego, because they’re my favourite things to eat.” He pairs them with memrillo (quince paste), some dried fruits and toasted nuts. “Hazelnuts are great because they’re local.” He wouldn’t hesitate to serve the sausage rolls he recently tried from The Italian Bakery in Victoria. “People might turn their nose up at sausage rolls but then, with a little mustard, they’re hard to resist.” Vikram Vij (Vij’s, My Shanti, Rangoli restaurants) freely admits even he buys store-bought appetizers. “I use them all the time,” he says. He likes the Nanak brand of potato puffs for one. “They’re filled with cashews, and they look like Tater Tots. Quite delicious,” he says. (Nanak products are available at Choices, Real Canadian Superstore and Walmart.) Another favourite is Indianlife samosas and pakoras (frozen section of Whole Foods, IGA, Save-On-Foods, Choices, Meinhardt Fine Foods). “I don’t have the time to make the samosa dough. It’s like beef Wellington, and you have to get it flaky.” I have tried the samosas and agree — they’re great. Indianlife also has bottled chutneys and Indian spiced chips, and both of these companies are local. At Rangoli, you can buy frozen samosas and Indian kebabs for a little more than supermarket prices. And At Whole Foods and Choices you can get Vij’s Delhi-Licious Kettle Chips with Indian spices. Indianlife Samosas. Indianlife Pakoras. Hamid Salimian, culinary instructor at Vancouver Community College’s Culinary Arts Program, says there was a time when he bought a pre-made pizza shell and baked it in the oven topped with cream cheese and Boursin cheese (half and half), then add smoked salmon, chopped shallots and dill. “I cut it in triangles and squares and all of a sudden, you have canapés.” Hamid Salimian’s Smoked Salmon Pizza canapés. Could Salimian recommend some ready-made Middle Eastern foods? “Us Persians love eggplant dips, olive tapenade and hummus,” he says. “My partner likes to buy some pre-made hummus and doctor it up with puréed garlic, lemon juice and olive oil.” I’ve found really good hummus at Mitra, in Ambleside, and Whole Foods Markets does a Mediterranean platter with hummus, baba ghanouj, tabbouleh, falafel, dolmas, roasted red peppers, olives, feta, pita and crackers.  Let’s not forget the abundance of Asian foods. Clement Chan of Torafuku doesn’t do store-bought but thinks sushi from one of the Fujiya Japanese stores around Metro Vancouver is always a safe bet.  Chinese Restaurant Awards judge Lee Man is big on barbecued duck or soy sauce chicken from Hon’s, or steamed buns. “Chinese people wouldn’t expect you to have made that stuff at home,” he says. “You could buy a whole Peking duck, cut it into pieces and serve it with hoisin sauce and (put) green onions on top.”  Stores like T & T sell frozen dumplings and crispy onion pancakes that cook up quickly, he says. “When they’re puffy and crispy, they can topped with smoked salmon and cream cheese.” Barbecued duck from Hong Kong Barbecue Master, in Richmond. Quang Dang, of West restaurant, is a fan of fish cakes from FISH seafood store in Burnaby. “It just needs a little sauté in the pan.” Or go big, he suggests, and order a whole roasted suckling pig from Congee Noodle House. “Order in advance and you have a winner for a party.” And Les Amis du Fromage will put together a raclette or fondue party, providing food and equipment, he says.  Frank Pabst of Blue Water Cafe is another Oyama Sausage fan. He likes the duck and pork rillettes served with store-bought crackers. (For dessert he likes the frozen cream puffs from Costco. Just drizzle them with a dark chocolate sauce.) Ned Bell, the Vancouver Aquarium chef, is all about sustainable seafood and suggests a classic — thinly sliced smoked salmon with capers, crème fraîche with a touch of dill on toasted rye. James Walt of Araxi finds store-bought tart shells a huge timesaver; you can fill them with your own fillings (quiche, shepherd’s pie filling) but the no-work way would be to buy preserves (Langley’s Vista d’Oro preserves would be awesome) for filling. “Just fill and fire in the oven,” he says. Victor Jacinto, Granville Island Hotel chef recommends the duck prosciutto from Oyama Sausage matched with focaccia from Duso’s (also in the Granville Island Public Market) “It’s a beautiful thing,” he says. Here’s a few more lifesavers: The Gourmet Warehouse is a wonderland of gourmet food solutions. For instance, duck rilette from Hill’s Food — pull apart the meat, and put it on corn tortillas with cranberry sauce left over from Christmas. (Or buy a jar of Ann Kirsebom cranberry chutney there.) Proprietor Caren McSherry suggests buying the pre-made butter tart shells and filling with a mix of mascarpone cheese, a bit of horseradish and chopped baby artichokes, topped with balsamic “pearls” (sold there). Truffle popcorn kernels are popular; just pop them. A newsroom editor raves about a Tartine Tarts flatbread with caramelized onions, Gruyere cheese and crème fraîche from Gourmet Warehouse. It’s locally made, find it in the freezer section and just pop it in the oven and cut it up. At Terra Breads stores their Pecan Fruit Crisps and house-made spreads, like the sugarless balsamic fig jam or cranberry compote, are a no-brainer. Just add some goat cheese. You’ll also find an array of savoury focaccias there (herb and cheese works for me) that require zero work, except for cutting them into wedges. Terra Breads’ jars of spreads and dips. At Well Seasoned gourmet store in Langley, the Chunky Bacon Jam goes well atop locally-made Hardbite Potato Chips, topped with a spear of chive. Their chocolate “salami”, ready for slicing is well received, too. In Loblaw’s and Real Canadian Superstore freezer aisles, you can find some real time savers. Tuna Tataki with sustainable wild albacore tuna has been the season’s hit. Other popular items are Maple and Rye Cold Smoked Salmon, Olive Oil and Rosemary Focaccia Crackers, and Sustainably Sourced Wild Sockeye Salmon.  Seafood charcuterie with President’s Choice products. At Urban Fare, chef Ryan McDonald suggests Urbani Stuffed Risotto Balls, baked in the oven with your favourite tomato sauce. When crisped, skewer them and garnish with shaved Parmesan. He says Emmi Authentic Swiss Cheese Fondue Kit is great because you can have a fondue out in minutes and look like a pro. A jar of Wild Hibiscus Flowers in Syrup is a super impressive way to dress up sparkling wine at midnight. “Just drop one of these flowers in your glass and watch it bloom while it colours and flavours your drink,” he says. Costco’s frozen food aisles hold hidden secrets (other than the cream puffs Pabst loves). The company shared their “really hot” items for this season: Cuisine Adventures Spanakopita, Sum-m! Asian Appetizer Pack, Grande Gourmet Panko Breaded Shrimp, Grande Gourmet Coconut Shrimp with Sauce, Diamond Harvest Shrimp Ring, Cuisine Adventures Franks in A Blanket and Royal Asia Calamari. Tick, tick, tick. Better get a move on, unless you want your guests to be crunching on celery sticks with Cheez Whiz. mstainsby@postmedia.com   CLICK HERE to report a typo.

I have to admit, I used to think that way myself when I was in high school. On a typical evening my friends and I would walk around the mall. Then, when we got bored of that, we'd walk around Wal-Mart. The City of Cornwall however, has pulled out all the stops this holiday season to ensure that there are fun activities for young and old. Just last week someone told me that Cornwall was a hockey town and looking at all of the hockey related activities coming up, it must really be true that the people of Cornwall enjoy their hockey. This coming Monday, Dec. 19 a World Juniors Exhibition game is taking place here in Cornwall at the Ed Lumley Arena. The game will see Sweden facing off against Slovakia. Slovakia will be around Cornwall before the game and they will stay for a while after. Slovakia and Denmark will be honing their skills on a daily basis on the ice at the Benson Centre starting on Dec. 15. The full schedule of the practices is available at the Benson Centre and the practices are free to watch. If you want to get out onto the ice yourself, the Benson Centre has plenty of skating opportunities coming up. There is public skating at the Benson Centre on Friday and Wednesday nights and Sunday afternoons for $3 for adults, Seniors skating is Monday mornings and Friday afternoons and parents can take their tots for a skate on Wednesday mornings. On top of that, Tim Horton's is sponsoring Holiday Free Skates from Wednesday, Dec. 28 to Friday Dec. 30 from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. and again from Tuesday, Jan. 3 to Thursday, Jan. 5. By the way, public skating makes for a good winter date idea. If there are any up and coming hockey youths looking for a more competitive skating experience, the Benson Centre's Stick & Puck program is open to all future Gretskys aged 5 to 14. The program lets young stakers get on the ice in full hockey gear and practice fundamentals like passing, puck control and skating drills. Stick & Puck is from 9 a.m. to 9:50 a.m. every Saturday in December and continues in January, February and March. There is still more to come this winter season, especially with the great work that Cornwall's Canada 150 Committee is doing in Lamoureux Park. In January, sleigh/ wagon rides are going to be offered in the park and will continue until the end of February. There might not be any better way to see the transformation that Lamoureux Park has undergone for Canada's 150th birthday than from a horse drawn sleigh. So don't say that there is nothing going on in Cornwall. Get out there and enjoy all that our city has to offer.   × Your comment has been submitted. It will be moderated prior to its display.

Related Stories Second entrance to Midland Walmart... Wyevale man killed in altercation... The father of three was involved in an altercation in the parking lot of the Walmart Plaza, which ended with him being hit by a car. Stott was taken to Georgian Bay General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Jason Heffernan of London, Ont., was charged with second-degree murder. Stott’s death raised questions about the plaza itself. It is known to be extremely crowded and difficult to exit, as it only has one entrance. Relief is on the way, but not for a while. A second entrance has been on the town’s radar for some time, and it is requiring Hanson Development Group — which is building the Seasons on Little Lake development — to put in a second entrance to the plaza. But, it is likely it will not come into play until 2018 at the earliest. “It’s not just something that’s come up overnight. Something needs to be done there, but it all goes back to the people who own the property.” Mayor Gord McKay said the issue of a second entrance is in the hands of Hanson and the plaza owner. “It’s not just something that’s come up overnight,” he said. “Something needs to be done there, but it all goes back to the people who own the property.” Ian Burns is a reporter at The Mirror.

The Walmart-owned digital video service is offering 30 of the year’s best films for half price. This includes either SD or HDX formats, but at 50% off why wouldn’t you just get the HDX version? Some of 2016’s best films according to Vudu include Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Deadpool, Jason Bourne, Captain America: Civil War, and Star Trek Beyond among many other action and science fiction films. 2016 films for the kids include Finding Dory, Zootopia, The Jungle Book, The Secret Life of Pets, and Kung Fu Panda 3 among others. And, in the comedy genre they’ve included Daddy’s Home, Central Intelligence, and Bad Moms. The 50% off doesn’t apply to Vudu’s 4k UHD format, however. The company is still holding firm on selling 4k titles for the hefty sum of $29.99 (you can view an entire list of Vudu UHD titles here). Here’s a direct link to the Vudu 2016 Digital Movie Sale. Vudu recently started streaming a selection of ad-supported movies, as well as downloads for rented titles.

Darryl “DMC” McDaniels said that products sold by these stores are unlawfully using the group’s name on items of clothing. The former rapper, who owns a firm named Run-DMC Brand, made the allegations in a complaint filed in the US District Court in Manhattan. According to the lawsuit, the products include “glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and numerous other items,” TMZ reports. The lawsuit alleges that the mega retailers have improperly “profited from, diluted and harmed” the Run-DMC brand, which has generated more than $100 million in revenue since the 1980s. READ RELATED STORY: Denzel Flamed for Dismissing Notion of Colorism in Hollywood McDaniels said the brand was “extremely valuable” and noted the $1.6 million agreement with Adidas. That’s why Run-DMC is asking for $50 million in damages. The complaint said the defendants are “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products” in the group’s trademarked name. Run-DMC were one of the biggest rap acts of the 1980s, and their distinctive logo has become a fashionable motif on T-shirts. McDaniels said the brand had been legitimately licensed to various manufacturers, and Adidas itself was the subject of one of the group’s most successful songs. Amazon and Walmart have yet to comment on the lawsuit. McDaniels founded the group in 1981 with fellow rapper Joseph “Run” Simmons, who is now an ordained Pentecostal minister known as Reverend Run. The third member of the group, DJ Jam Master Jay, was fatally shot in a recording studio in Queens in 2002. The group’s hits include “My Adidas,” “King of Rock” and “It’s Tricky.” In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor.   Share this: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr darryl 'dmc' mcdanielsrun dmc Previous Article200th Live Donor Kidney Transplant Delivers New Life for the New Year Next ArticleRenee Lawless and 'The Have and the Have Nots' Season 5 Secrets   Show/Hide Comments Speak your Mind Cancel reply Follow Us Recent Videos Top Views Condola Rashad: Phylicia Rashad’s Daughter Engaged to Fellow Actor January 6, 2017 Lamar Odom Considering Reality TV Comeback, Watch Video Of Brawl At Ricky Harris’ Funeral January 6, 2017 Serial Killer Charles Manson No Model Prisoner During Decades in Jail January 6, 2017 Ciara Drops $15M Defamation Lawsuit Against Ex Future January 6, 2017 Jeanette J.

Drivers often overestimate the speed plows are traveling and do not allow time to slow down. Follow these tips to keep yourself, plow drivers and other travelers safe: • Be on the look out for TowPlows – a steerable trailer-mounted plow that is pulled behind a plow truck. The TowPlow can be rotated to one side of the truck, which significantly increases the plow width. The 26-foot-wide plow gives the operator the ability to clear more area of roadway in one pass. • Don’t try to pass the TowPlow when deployed, the operator will periodically rotate the TowPlow back in line with the truck to allow vehicles to pass. • Be aware that plows often work in pairs and trios. The snow cloud created by one plow may obscure additional plows in adjacent lanes. • When approaching a snowplow from the rear, reduce speed immediately. When approaching an oncoming plow, don’t crowd the centerline. • The plow operators know the road well and will pull over as soon as it is safe to do so. Be patient. Snowplows generally operate at slow speeds to properly clear snow and spread sanding materials. MOST POPULAR: Comments Viewed For the Record, Dec. 30... Local youths graduate f...

Warning, the video is NSFW. Subscribe to WIBX 950 on This was Walmart in North Utica 2-14-2016. The Utica police are called to the North Utica WALMART because of a massive fight. People were arrested. We only see a short portion of what actually went down. I’m not sure what exactly started this.  I’m not one for violence, especially out in a public like WalMart. All lives matter and we shouldn’t be fighting over anything. You can also hear the man on the ground while forcefully being held down by two officers say “I CAN’T” while the officers are saying “Put your hands behind your back!”.

Run-DMC filed a $50-million lawsuit Thursday accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group's name without permission. (Drew Gurian / Invision/Associated Press) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter The rap group Run-DMC filed a $50-million lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group's name without permission.  A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the suit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York.  The complaint said the defendants are “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products” in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items.  The lawsuit alleges that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it says has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s.  Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell. Mizell was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding.  The group's hits include “King of Rock, “It's Tricky,” and “Can You Rock It Like This.”  In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor.  Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Caption BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff’s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s.

(Photo Illustration by Liz Martin/The Gazette) George C. Ford The Gazette More stories from George Dec 30, 2016 at 10:50 am | Print View If you are planning to make a large purchase on Amazon.com, you might want to consider doing it before Sunday. The giant online retailer has notified the Iowa Department of Revenue it will begin to collect Iowa’s six percent sales tax on purchases made beginning Jan. 1. It already collects sales tax for purchases made by residents of 29 states and the District of Columbia. The company will start to collect sales tax in Nebraska on Jan. 1, too. “Honestly, Amazon contacted us and agreed to do this,” said Victoria Daniels, spokeswoman for the Iowa Department of Revenue. Amazon will not collect the local-option portion of the sales tax at this time, she added. Iowa law requires companies with a “nexus” in the state to collect sales tax for online purchases. That means retailers with a brick-and-mortar presence such as Barnes & Noble, Target and Wal-Mart must collect sales tax on their online orders. For retailers such as Amazon that do not have a physical presence here, the burden has been on the customer to send the state an equivalent use tax — though few actually do. But Amazon’s decision to collect sales tax in Iowa is not a deal-breaker for Jess Parizek of North Liberty. “It’s doesn’t bother me a bit,” Parizek said. “Amazon is easy for me. I work at the University of Iowa, so even though it’s 11 miles for me, it’s still a 45-minute commute. The last thing I want to do is go get groceries or swing into Target. “I have Amazon Prime, which allows me to pay for it and it comes to my door.” In addition, Parizek, who has friends working for UPS and the postal service, feels she is helping to keep them in business. “If I went into Target, I would have to pay sales tax,” she said. “I might walk up and down the aisles and walk out with $100 worth of stuff that I really don’t need.” Daniels said the Department of Revenue is not sure how much additional Iowa sales tax revenue will be collected by Amazon. “When we looked at the impact of federal legislation several years ago requiring online retailers to collect sales tax, we came up with a very conservative estimate of $18 million to $24 million,” Daniels said. “We know that Amazon is a large share of that market, so it could be slightly below the $18 million mark — not an insignificant amount.” While Seattle-based Amazon’s decision to charge sales tax in Iowa will bring more money to the state, Daniels said the real issue is one of fairness. “Our local businesses pay property tax, employ people and benefit from services in the community,” Daniels said. “Then you have these remote sellers who come in and take a market share away from our local businesses. “One of the original pieces of federal legislation (requiring online retailers to collect sales tax) was called the Main Street Fairness Act. The closest we got was in 2013 when the U.S. Senate passed the bill. “With the shift in the political makeup since then and the most recent election, people are speculating that the soonest it could happen at the federal level will be 2026.” Traditional retailers have complained for many years that online retailers such as Amazon and Overstock.com have an unfair advantage because they can undercut brick-and-mortar competitors on price by not collecting sales tax. Because e-commerce is such a relatively young industry, it has been hard to determine whether shoppers take the lack of sales tax into account when deciding where to buy. The Washington Post reported that shoppers spent 8.3 percent less for products on Amazon after their state began requiring e-commerce sites to charge sales tax, according to Ohio State University research of household spending data in 19 states. The researchers described that drop in spending as a “permanent decline” even though shoppers’ total spending remained essentially unchanged. Shoppers were spending the same amount overall on Amazon purchases, but because a portion of that tab was now going to taxes, the customer was getting less product for their money and Amazon was receiving less revenue from the sale. Charging sale tax had an especially chilling effect on big-ticket Amazon purchases of more than $250, the study found. On those transactions, Amazon sales declined 11.4 percent after the retailer began collecting the tax. WHO PAYS Amazon.com collects sales tax from customers in 29 states — Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin — and the District of Columbia. The online retailer has notified the Iowa Department of Revenue that it will begin collecting Iowa’s 6 percent sales tax on purchases beginning Jan. 1. It will not collect the local option portion of the sales tax at this time. Amazon.com does not have a nexus or physical presence in Iowa. The company operates fulfillment or sorting centers in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, according to TaxJar.com. l Comments: (319) 398-8366; george.ford@thegazette.com Your next Consumers articles Amazon.com to begin collecting Iowa sale ...

The group has filed a $50 million trademark infringement lawsuit against Wal-Mart, Amazon and other retailers. (Drew Gurian / Invision / AP) Rosemary Feitelberg | WWD Attorneys for the Run-D.M.C. brand have filed a $50 million lawsuit against Amazon Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Co., Jet.com and a few other outlets for trademark infringement and trademark dilution, among other things. First reported by TMZ Thursday, the legal filing was made in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint, which includes numerous images of Run-D.M.C.-inspired products as they appeared on Amazon’s and Wal-Mart’s respective sites, alleges that the retailers are advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple Run-D.M.C. styled products. Eyewear, hats, T-shirts, wallets and patches are among the items referenced, some of which are said to use the Run-D.M.C. trademark. The complaint charges that the products being sold “confuse the public and suggest that Run-D.M.C. endorses the products.” Homegrown in Hollis, Queens by Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell, Run-D.M.C. helped define hip hop culture in the Eighties. Mizell, better known as “Jam Master Jay,” was shot and killed in his recording studio in Queens in 2002. Simmons, whose brother is the serial entrepreneur Russell, is widely recognized as “Reverend Run.” Run-D.M.C. has a registered trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The lawsuit claims that the Run-D.M.C. brand has produced revenue in excess of $100 million from intellectual property tied to sales of music, concerts, merchandising and endorsement deals since its start in the Eighties. Run-D.M.C.’s legal team are citing trademark infringement and trademark dilution violations, and have requested a temporary restraining order to prevent employees from directly or indirectly “promoting, advertising, conducting, participating in and receiving or making any payments for any Run-D.M.C. product” being sold. Run-D.M.C.’s attorney Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen did not respond immediately to a request for comment Thursday, nor did executives at Run-D.M.C., Amazon or Wal-Mart.

Holiday Hours For Stores, Restaurants, Banks, Post Office As We Ring In 2017 Lifestyle 3 0 0 December 30, 2016 Anything Open New Year’s Eve & New Year’s Day? Holiday Hours For Stores, Restaurants, Banks, Post Office As We Ring In 2017 Cheryl P What time do stores close on New Year’s Eve and is anything open on New Year’s Day? If you’re searching for the holiday hours for your favorite retail stores, restaurants, the post office, or banking hours for the holiday weekend, you’re not alone. As we prepare to ring in 2017, “what’s open, what’s closed” is a popular online search, especially because January 1 falls on a Sunday this year. This year, the holiday weekend extends right through Monday, January 2 because it’s considered a federal holiday, which means some people have the day off. For others, it’s just another work day, especially for retail employees. Here’s a complete list of what’s closing early on New Year’s Eve and what you will find open on both New Year’s Day (Sunday) and on the day the U.S. Office of Personnel Management observes that holiday — Monday, January 2. The Times Square ball is getting ready to rise above New York City before it helps bring in 2017!! pic.twitter.com/cypb0OZ9aN — Good Morning America (@GMA) December 30, 2016 Post Office, Banks, and Government Offices It’s business as usual for most banks and the U.S. Post Office on December 31, but keep in mind that New Year’s Eve falls on a Saturday, so closing times may be earlier than normal weekday hours. Most USPS branches close at noon on Saturday, but mail will be delivered according to the normal schedule. Go Banking Rates reports that at least 16 banks will be open on New Year’s Eve, but you can expect most banking institutions to be closed on Sunday, January 1 and Monday, January 2. Monday is a federal holiday due to New Year’s Day falling on a Sunday, so most government offices will be closed on January 2, including the IRS, DMV/RMV, and the Department of Social Security. Retail Store Holiday Hours Whether you need food for your New Year’s Eve party or a new dress to wear out to dinner, most retail stores will close between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Saturday night. According to Balance, Macy’s will close at 7 p.m., Kohl’s is open until 9 p.m., and JCPenney will close at 9:30 p.m. Walmart stores will stay open until 8 p.m., but their Superstores are open around the clock. Expect to find doors to your local Target and Best Buy stores locked at 9 p.m. Missing an ingredient or two for your NYE party appetizers? Most grocery stores close at 6 p.m., but Albertson’s and Whole Foods will be staying open later than most with a 10 p.m. closing time for both supermarkets. Time reports that most stores and malls will be open on New Year’s Day, with normal Sunday hours in place for popular big-box retailers like Walmart, Toys R Us, Best Buy, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe’s. Restaurants Open New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day Lets put significant pressure on ourselves to have a fun New Year's Eve!! #ecards pic.twitter.com/QFtGbWO2 — FuckenEcards (@Ecards17) December 27, 2012 Going out to eat is a big deal for many people who would rather have someone else do the cooking before they countdown to 2017. Most chain restaurants, including Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral, Hometown Buffet, Maggiano’s, The Melting Pot, In-N-Out, IHOP, Red Robin, and Outback Steakhouse, will be open on New Year’s Eve, but it’s always a good idea to call ahead as hours vary by location. It won’t be hard to find something to eat on New Year’s Day, with far more restaurants open on the first of the year than were open on Christmas Day. However, if your idea of a show-stopping meal is some fast-food grub at Chick-fil-A or Chipotle, Fortune reports that both restaurants will both be closed on January 1, although some franchises may be open. Again, give them a call to be sure. In addition to the restaurants that are open on New Year’s Eve, Fortune lists dozens of popular eateries that will open their doors on the first day of 2017, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Chili’s, Five Guys Burgers, KFC, Sonic, Taco Bell, and Bob Evans. And if you need some caffeine to help with your hangover, most Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts will be open for business on New Year’s Day.

The group's lawsuit against Walmart and Amazon alleges the retailers’ actions have “harmed RUN-D.M.C. in its business.”   (KRISTA NILES / The Associated Press File Photo)   By Kevin McCoyUSA Today Fri., Dec. 30, 2016 Amazon, Walmart and other retailers are being sued for $50 million for allegedly infringing on the trademark of iconic rap and hip-hop group RUN-D.M.C. The stores “are trading on the goodwill” of the band and confusing consumers by “advertising, manufacturing, selling and distributing multiple products” that erroneously imply the group endorsed the merchandise, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Examples include old-school black-frame glasses often sported by Darryl McDaniels — best known to fans and music lovers as D.M.C. — one of the band’s founders and the trademark’s owner, the lawsuit charged. He owns 200 pairs of similar glasses, “the better to see what’s going on in the world,” according to an entry on the band’s official website. An exhibit filed with the court complaint also showed shirts, hats and other merchandise like some worn by McDaniels, Joseph “Reverend Run” Simmons, and Jason “Jam Master J” Mizell when the trio shot to music and cultural stardom from their 1980s start in the Hollis, Queens neighbourhood of New York City. The band members, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009 for a string of hits that include “It’s Like That,” “My Adidas,” and “You Be Illin’,” no longer perform together but are widely considered as rap elder statesmen. Mizell died in an unsolved 2002 shooting. Article Continued Below “The number of infringing materials” allegedly marketed and sold by the companies “are too numerous to properly list,” according to the lawsuit, which alleged the retailers’ actions have “harmed RUN-D.M.C. in its business.” Along with Amazon and Walmart, the court complaint targets retailers Jet.com, Vision World, Infinity Fashion and SW Global. All are Amazon business partners, the lawsuit alleges. The companies either could not be reached or did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. Christopher Brown, a Boston-based attorney who filed the case, similarly did not return a message seeking comment.

Run-DMC says in the suit that it has made $100 million on trademarked products over the years, including a $1.6 million sneaker deal with Adidas. “The brand is extremely valuable,” the suit said. Neither Amazon nor Walmart had an immediate response to a request for comment. Run-DMC was formed in Queens, N.Y., in 1981 by Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell. Mizell was shot and killed at his studio in 2002.

Run-DMC Suing Online Retailers, Including Amazon and Walmart, For $50 Million Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Run-DMC Suing Online Retailers, Including Amazon and Walmart, For $50 Million Image courtesy of run-dmc December 30, 2016 10:06 am EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc it's tricky lawsuits trademark infringement run-dmc amazon walmart Run-DMC might have broken up 14 years ago, but the name and the musical legend live on in the world of licensed, endorsed merchandise. Unfortunately, according to a new lawsuit, the Run-DMC name also lives on in infringing merchandise being sold by major online stores. Run-DMC co-founder Darryl “D.M.C.” McDaniels filed suit late Thursday in a New York federal court, NBC News reports. The complaint alleges that Amazon, Walmart, Jet, and others are “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products” that use the group’s trademarks without permission. The smaller merchants named in the suit are all third-party vendors that use the Amazon Marketplace to reach consumers. The knockoff clothes and accessories have “diluted” and “harmed” the “extremely valuable” Run-DMC brand, the complaint continues, and the retailers selling the goods have “improperly profited” from those sales. The legendary hip-hop group was founded in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons, and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell. The trio officially broke up in 2002 after Mizell was shot and killed outside his recording studio. McDaniels is the plaintiff filing the suit, and he’s not the first to claim that online infringement is rampant. Counterfeit items are a scourge of the modern e-marketplace. When consumers can’t pick up an item and examine it or its packaging closely, it’s even harder to tell the authentic from the fake. And with stores like Amazon and Walmart accepting basically anybody as a third-party merchant, consumers can have a difficult time distinguishing the reputable from the underhanded. The higher-profile a brand is, the more plentiful its unauthorized copycats. Apple, for example, estimates that 90% of the ‘Apple’ chargers being sold on Amazon are knockoffs — not just infringing but also potentially very unsafe. The problem has been growing for years, and while Amazon has promised improvements in the new year and tries to respond to customers who’ve purchased fakes or brands that feel they’re being infringed on, clearly Run-DMC feels the company did not act quickly enough in this case — and neither did competitors Walmart or Jet. Whether fakes are being sold — and whether they’re doing $50 million worth of damage to the existing Run-DMC brand and its official merch deals — will now be sorted out by the court.

However, most of us don't get irritated to the point of using our irons as weapons. Yet, that's exactly what happened in Sarasota, as an 83-year-old Florida man went after a car salesman with a golf club. (Warning: NSFW language.) https://twitter.com/WFLAJohn/status/814543483843117056 According to the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office, Linsey Owens became upset when arriving to a dealership thinking he had received a scratch-off prize. Owens was given a $5 Walmart gift card, with an employee explaining he needed to purchase a car to claim a bigger prize, the report says. Owens was then asked to leave. “[Owens] became irate that he had to purchase a vehicle in order to claim the prize and got into his vehicle,” the report stated. Owens hit another employee with his White Honda. He then proceeded to retrieve a golf club from his trunk and swing at a salesman. “It was surreal, I couldn’t believe this was happening,” said the victim to WFLA.com. He then left the scene.

Man, 83, accused of attacking salesman with golf club Associated Press | SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) — An 83-year-old Florida man is accused of attacking an event salesman at a car dealership after getting angry over the prize he was awarded during a promotion. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune (http://bit.ly/2if9PuQ ) reports Linsey D. Owens is charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon following the Wednesday evening incident. A police report says Owens was presented with a $5 Wal-Mart gift card at a Sarasota car dealership promotional event. He apparently argued with employees and left without the card. He returned and bumped his car into Robertson, then grabbed a golf club and hit Robertson on the face and arms. Authorities say Owens wanted a larger prize advertised on the promotional fliers, not the gift card. A lawyer for Owens wasn't listed on jail records. ___ Information from: Sarasota (Fla.)

Vermont news: Breaking, in-depth and investigative coverage of politics, business and public affairs Home Projects About Tipster Commentary Data   Categories  Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics   Year in Review: Bennington businesses, government and schools saw changes in 2016 Dec. 30, 2016, 9:57 am by Jim Therrien Leave a Comment New plans for the Four Corners and the Greenberg Block will revitalize the downtown and bring in housing and businesses, say a group of local investors. Photo by Holly Peczynski/Bennington Banner BENNINGTON — News coverage in 2016 was dominated for long stretches by the discovery of PFOA contamination in wells in Bennington and Pownal, and by efforts to merge local school districts under provisions of Vermont’s Act 46, which encourages district consolidations. Proposed new State Board of Education rules for private schools accepting public school tuition, downtown and regionwide development plans; alternative energy projects, legislative elections and untimely deaths also generated considerable coverage. Contaminated water Extensive testing of private and public well water sources began in the county early in 2016, after similar PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) contamination was found in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. As in nearby New York communities, factory sites there considered the likely source of the chemical — a manmade substance widely used for many years in creating Teflon and other consumer products, which later was discovered in water supplies near similar sites in a number of states. RELATED STORIES Year in Review: Top education stories of 2016 Year in Review: The top environmental stories of 2016 Year in Review: Top Rutland County stories of 2016 Year in Review: Top Windham County stories of 2016 Year in Review: Top criminal justice stories of 2016 Year in Review: Top health care stories of 2016 Suspected sources in Southwestern Vermont include a former Chemfab mill in North Bennington and a former Warren Wire/General Cable factory in Pownal. Both sites are now owned by successor companies. As in the nearby New York towns, the discovery prompted a flurry of well water testing and blood testing for residents believed to have been exposed to elevated or high levels of PFOA. Short-term filtering of water supplies and long-term efforts to extend municipal water lines to affected properties have been ongoing for most of the year. Thus far, water lines have been extended to 10 Bennington properties, with a much larger line extension project in the design phase, and more than 500 wells have been tested and about 250 individual well filtration systems installed. In North Bennington and Bennington, the current factory property owner, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, hasn’t accepted responsibility for the contamination but has provided funding for water filtering units, bottled water and other costs and is in talks with the state Department of Environmental Conservation over future expenses. The planned larger water line project is estimated by the state to cost approximately $30 million. In addition, a group of property owners in the affected areas is suing the company in U.S. District Court over alleged damage to their properties because of the contamination, and other suits are expected in state courts over alleged health effects stemming from exposure to PFOA. In Pownal, an underwriter has paid for a temporary filtering plant at the Pownal Fire District No. 2 well site. The district has about 450 customers and water is supplied by a well drilled in the 1990s just east of the parking lot of the former wire factory on Route 346. A search is on to find a replacement well in another location. Tests also are being conducted of water in private wells in sections of Pownal and North Pownal. The state has had talks over the long-term costs with the firm, American Premier Underwriters, of Cincinnati, which has taken on the liability for the property. The company has agreed to cover certain expenses in the ongoing process, state officials said, but has not accepted liability for the contamination. Merging school districts Committees studying whether and how local school districts might consolidate under Act 46 guidelines formed in both the Northshire and Southshire areas of Bennington County, but only the Manchester region effort has made progress. A 17-person committee with representatives from nine towns worked throughout 2016 on an agreement to form a single district with a single school board. That plan, to create what would be called the Taconic and Green School District, was approved by the group in November and approved by the State Board of Education in late December. It will now go before individual annual town meetings in the spring with the goal of approving the new district and it newly elected school board by July 1. The towns are Manchester, Dorset, Londonderry, Danby, Sunderland, Mt. Tabor, Landgrove, Peru and Weston. In the Bennington area, Southwest Vermont Supervisory Union towns formed an Act 46 study group but it disbanded in late summer without reaching a consensus on how to merge local districts, including Bennington, Pownal, Shaftsbury, North Bennington and Woodford. An informal exploratory committee later was formed to study possible consolidations but no agreement has yet been reached. Private school rules Rule changes governing private schools that receive public tuition funding set off a firestorm of protest and intense lobbying after they were proposed by the State Board of Education. Opponents in the Northshire area contended the changes would force private schools to operate more like public schools and take on added expenses, which could lead to the closure of some and loss of school choice. BOE members, who were barraged by scores of opponents speaking Dec. 12 against the proposal during a hearing in Manchester, contend the rule changes would not force onerous changes on private schools but would provide greater accountability for the expenditure of public funds for private school tuition. Talks are ongoing to revise the language in the proposed rules to make them acceptable to both sides before the next stages in the rule adoption process, expected to play out during 2017. Downtown turnaround? The historic Putnam Hotel and surrounding buildings at the Four Corners intersection at the heart of downtown Bennington became a major economic development focus during 2016, after an ambitious redevelopment project was announced. It is estimated to cost up to $50 million in private and public funding and would renovate space in six buildings, totaling about 200,000 square feet, and include four acres near the buildings. A local group called the Bennington Redevelopment Group, which includes representatives from local businesses, colleges, the hospital and local residents, is expected to decide by early 2017 whether to move ahead with a purchase of the parcels and buildings. In Manchester in September, about 60 leaders from the public and private sectors throughout region met to address the issues of economic development, tourism and marketing, and collaboration and coalition building across community lines. The event was organized by the Shires of Vermont Regional Marketing Organization and the Bennington Area Chamber of Commerce. A follow-up summit was held in late November, and the entities involved are working to create a regional marketing and development strategy in 2017. Alternate energy Energy projects underway or completed during 2016 included the 15-turbine Deerfield Wind project on U.S. Forest Service land in Searsburg and Readsboro, which went to a groundbreaking in September after more than a decade in the planning and permitting stages. The project remained controversial throughout, and the groundbreaking and Gov. Peter Shumlin were protested and picketed as the ceremonial shovels went into the ground at a site off Putnam Road. The wind towers are being erected in two sections on either side of Route 8. The eastern section is near an existing smaller wind project, completed in 1998. Pownal saw one 2.2-megawatt solar array nearing completion in December off Northwest Hill Road and a .5-megawatt array expected to be completed off Dean Road early in 2017. Another .5-megawatt solar project is under consideration near the town wastewater treatment plant, also off Dean Road. And what will be the county’s largest hydropower facility is under construction in North Pownal at a former factory dam and hydro site on the Hoosic River. Developer Bill Scully, of North Bennington, expects the revitalized power plant, capable of generating 500 kilowatts of electricity at capacity, to be brought online in the spring. Elections In electoral news, the county saw two new state representatives elected in November: Linda Joy Sullivan, D-Dorset, and Brian Keefe, R-Manchester. Sullivan is replacing Rep. Patti Komline, R-Dorset, who did not seek re-election, and Keefe and Rep. Cynthia Browning, D-Arlington, were elected in a three-candidate race for two seats in the Bennington-4 District, in which incumbent Rep. Steve Berry, D-Manchester, was defeated for another term. Untimely deaths On a sad note, the body of Bennington College student Hadil Marzouq, 21, was found by searchers in the Dorset quarry on Dec. 21, after she was reported missing three days earlier. The woman, a native of Palestine, had drowned, authorities said. In November in Shaftsbury, State Police reported two men were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide. Police said Trevor Gardner of Hoosick Falls, N.Y., had driven to the residence of Olanda Fitz, of Shaftsbury Hollow Road, and shot him in the chest, before shooting himself following a dispute. In criminal justice news, two Vermont men pleaded guilty in November in a New Hampshire court to dispensing heroin to a Manchester man who had overdosed and died. Daniel Fogg, 27, of West Townsend, received a sentence of six and a half to 14 years in prison, though a year of the minimum was suspended. Francis Mayhle III, 25, of Peru, was sentenced to serve 12 months. The heroin was dispensed in November 2015 to Dakota “Cole” Kilburn, who later died. The sale occurred in New Hampshire.

Krista Niles/AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Last Updated Dec 30, 2016 9:42 AM EST NEW YORK -- The rap group Run-DMC filed a $50 million lawsuit in New York accusing Wal-Mart, Amazon, Jet and other retailers of selling products that traded on the group’s name without permission. A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. Amazon patents a warehouse in the sky The complaint said the defendants are “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products” in the group’s trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited from, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons, Darryl “DMC” and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding. 2017 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees include Tupac, Pearl Jam The group’s hits include “King of Rock, “It’s Tricky,” and “Can You Rock It Like This.” In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor.

Another Year That Shouldn’t Have Been: 64 Times Companies & Employees Embarrassed Themselves In 2016 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Sections Return to Top Keep Your Free Frog Imitation Is Not The Sincerest Form Of Flattery Employees Behaving Badly What's Customer Service Got To Do With It? What's In An Insult? Taking It Seriously Marketing Gone Wrong Forgetting The Law Another Year That Shouldn’t Have Been: 64 Times Companies & Employees Embarrassed Themselves In 2016 Image courtesy of Ron G December 30, 2016 9:15 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Why'd you do that? fail 2016 in Review campaign apologies apologize Just like last year (and, honestly, every year), 2016 was rife with stories about companies and their employees treating customers badly, going too far with bad jokes on social media, and then issuing semi-apologies while making claims about “taking it seriously,” or sometimes “very seriously.” It’s been yet another year of derogatory, mean-spirited messages scrawled on receipts, ads that suggested “maybe ‘no’ doesn’t really mean no,” strange things showing up in food orders, ripped-off designs, wrong numbers, errant pranks, goofs, gaffes, and screw-ups — so many that we certainly missed more than a few. Regardless, without further ado, here is Consumerist’s list of stories that make us go “Wait.. What?” Keep Your Free FrogImage courtesy of 10 News Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter From spiders to lizards to weasels to heads of snakes and rats, customers found the most unexpected — and often disgusting — things in their food this year. 1. Can I Get The Dead Baby Weasel On The Side?: A nurse practitioner in England ended up with a dead baby weasel in her salad, and she was not pleased. The supermarket where the woman bought the salad, Walmart-owned ASDA, offered a £5 voucher ($7.22), later increasing their offer to £100 after tests showed that the animal was indeed a… dead baby weasel. 2. Ants Are Protein, Right?: A Pittsburgh Burger King customer claimed in January that he found his sandwich was topped with something moving: ants.  3. There’s Something About Bugs: Sour cream, butter, chives, cheese: all acceptable topping for a baked potato from Wendy’s. Something that’s not acceptable, though, bugs. Yet, an Indianapolis customer says she was chowing down on a spud when she noticed what she believed were bugs underneath the potato. 4. Finding It A New Home: The tale of “Green Fruit Loop” the lizard is fit for the big screen: She ended up bundled up in some tatsoi greens, then was refrigerated, putting her in a hibernation-like state. The family who purchased the greens found GFL alive, and brought her to their child’s kindergarten class where, we assume, it lived happily ever after. 5. Snake Head Recall: Food is recalled every year for a variety of problems: salmonella, pieces of plastic, undeclared soy. But this recall of canned green beans in Feb. 2016 was initiated after a church group found a snake head among the veggies. 6. More Rat Head, Please!: A New York woman claimed in September that her daughter was traumatized after allegedly receiving a fried rat head with her Popeyes chicken. 7. Would You Like The Receipt In The Bag Of Meth?: An 11-year-old GameStop customer got quite the surprise with his video game in September when he found a baggie full of methamphetamine placed inside. 8. Is Marijuana A Spice?: In October, an Ohio woman claimed the Wendy’s french fries she ordered for her daughter came sprinkled with marijuana. Officers who responded to the complaint said they opened the bag and smelled a “strong odor of marijuana” and saw “green leafy vegetation” on the fries. 9. Limited Time Offer — Free Levers: A California woman’s daily ritual of visiting McDonald’s for oatmeal came to an abrupt end in September when she said her meal included the lever from the hot water machine used to make the breakfast item. 10. A Gross Duo: Back in August, McDonald’s was on the receiving end of several complaints when customers at two locations reported finding gross stuff in their food: worms wriggled out of a burger, and a snail was found in the bottom of an iced tea cup. Imitation Is Not The Sincerest Form Of FlatteryImage courtesy of Lane Bryant/Shantell Martin Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Copying an artist in order to make a profit for yourself is not a good idea, especially now that the people whose work is being copies can now share the evidence with the world instantly online. 11. “You Are You,” Unless You’re Lane Bryant: In September, New York artist Shantell Martin claimed that Lane Bryant ripped off her “You Are You” design, plastering it on a white T-shirt without permission. The shirt was later removed from the company’s website and Instagram page. 12. Two-Time Imitator: Last year, McDonald’s apologized to a pair of photographers after modeling a Twitter campaign on their work, but the Golden Arches didn’t learn its lesson. This time British animator Cyraik Harris claimed that a new McDonald’s ad campaign featuring talking cows was nearly identical to a video he posted on YouTube in 2010. 13. Adorable Dogs: Artist Lili Chin of Doggie Drawings claimed in October that Kohl’s was selling pajamas, socks, and other clothing times using her drawings of Boston terriers. 14. Not Zara’s Designs: Independent artist Tuesday Bassen posted side-by-side comparisons of her work and suspiciously similar ones being sold by Zara. The retailer allegedly told the woman that there was a “lack of distinctiveness” in her designs. 15. That’s Art, Not Graffiti: McDonald’s faced yet another accusation of stealing someone else’s work in October, when the estate of deceased artist Dash Snow claimed the company brazenly swiped one of his signature designs to use as fake “graffiti” decor at some of its eateries. Employees Behaving Badly Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter From pepper spraying dogs to opening millions of unauthorized bank accounts, 2016 was rife with examples of employees behaving badly. 16. The Wells Fargo Fake Account Fiasco: A years-long investigation into the opening of unauthorized Wells Fargo accounts in customers’ names came to a head this year, when federal and state regulators ordered the bank to pay more than $185 million in refunds and penalties related to two million fake accounts. 17.FedEx Is The Worst Landscaper: A Texas woman said in February that a FedEx truck ripped up her yard when it drove onto her lawn and got stranded. To make matters worse, the tow truck that eventually extricated the truck caused even more damage. 18. No Drinking & Flying: An American Airlines co-pilot was arrested on the tarmac in March after he failed a breathalyzer test. Not only was he grounded for the night, but so were the passengers whose flight was canceled as a result. 19. Not The Dogs: Those who deliver mail and dogs don’t exactly have a great relationship. But pepper spraying two 20-pound dogs? 20. Flying Under The Influence: It was revealed in April that a JetBlue pilot had been arrested months earlier after a flight from Florida to New York for allegedly flying under the influence of alcohol. A random breathalyzer test found his blood-alcohol content was .11. 21. What’s In My Cart?: After engaging in a bit of back and forth with Amazon’s customer service department over receiving the wrong version of a textbook, an Irish man sent the book back. But when he returned to the site later, he found an oversized sex toy in his shopping basket. Because he hadn’t put “The Hulk 10.25-inch Huge Dong Black” in his cart, he immediately suspected an Amazon customer service rep had taken the negative feedback to heart and had retaliated. 22. Real Labor Pains: A New York City couple reported in January that after the pregnant woman vomited on the sidewalk, their Uber driver refused to give them a ride to the hospital. To make matters worse, the driver charged the couple $13 for the privilege of being stranded. What’s Customer Service Got To Do With It?Image courtesy of (frankieleon) Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Some companies just never learn that customer service should be a top priority. 23. Pay Your Bill: Power company Reliant continued to text a Dallas family updates about their power usage, which somehow increased after a tornado destroyed the home. 24-26. Where’s My Kid?: First, American Airlines allegedly failed to notify a North Carolina family about a significant change in their 11-year-old daughter’s flight, only learning that her plane never landed at its destination because the girl called her parents. Then, an unaccompanied minor flying on JetBlue from the Dominican Republic got mixed up with another kid and ended up in Boston instead of New York City. And most recently, parents say that United Airlines left a 12-year-old girl on her own after her flight arrived in Houston. 27. Zip Your Lips: An American Airlines passenger traveling from the Dominican Republic to Miami says a flight attendant told him to “shut up and don’t talk to me again” over a confrontation about sold-out pasta. 28. Does Vomit Have DNA?: A New York city woman swore off using Uber, claiming in March that a driver accused her of barfing in his car, staging the photos of someone else upchucking to collect a $200 cleaning fee. 29. Too Short To Ride: A JetBlue passenger claimed in May that she wouldn’t be allowed to fly from Boston to Seattle because her shorts were too short. While the airline didn’t apologize for the situation, it did reimburse the woman for the replacement cost of the clothing she had to buy. 30. A 45-Hour Ride: Most Uber rides are under an hour. But a Chicago man was charged $573 for a 45-hour ride over a 23-mile area that he never actually took. What’s In An Insult? Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter No matter how many employees make headlines each year for leaving rude and racist comments for customers, a new crop of idiots pop up to take their place. 31. Here’s A Pizza & An Insult: A Papa John’s franchisee in Denver apologized in July when a teen was surprised to find a racial slur printed on his box. 32. Facing The Consequences: A Sonic Drive-In carhop in Fort Worth, TX, was fired in October after writing an offensive word on the receipts of two customers dining together. 33. “CHAIR” Is Not A Person: A wheelchair-using couple were insulted when a restaurant that identified them on their receipt as “CHAIR.” The owner of the restaurant said she meant no offense with the receipt. 34. Just Stay Home: A waitress in South Carolina received a note, written on a napkin, chastising her for working in the first place, and that she should be home tending to her husband and kids — even though she has neither of these things. 35. Tips Are Only For Citizens: In August, a Virginia restaurant customer not only refused to tip her waitress after a meal, but also left a note on the receipt that implied the server was not a citizen and therefore somehow did not deserve a living wage. 36. Twitter Rants Not Advised: You can say just about anything you want on Twitter, but you shouldn’t do so and think you can keep your job: a Texas Roadhouse employee in Colorado was fired in July after Tweeting that “If we had a real life purge I would kill as many Mexicans as I could in one night.” 37. No Inside Jokes: A few servers at a Virginia restaurant apparently have a fun time mocking customers. While it’s in jest and done in the privacy of the kitchen, some comments — including “I have a small penis” — made it onto a customer receipt in May. 38. What Did I Do To You?: It’s bad enough when a trip you’ve been planning for months unexpectedly gets canceled, it’s even worse when someone working for Expedia writes a “F—k You” message in your itinerary. 39. Judging Your Consumption: Starbucks apologized after a barista wrote “Diabetes here I come” on a man’s grande white mocha. The man, whose two sisters have Type 1 diabetes, wrote his own message — “2 of my sisters are diabetic, so … not funny,” — on the cup and returned it to the worker. Taking It SeriouslyImage courtesy of Amish Hacker | YouTube Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Each year companies do something that warrants a great big “we’re sorry.” While these apologies are generally warranted, the reasons why they’re needed in the first place can often be perplexing. 40. Never Okay: A San Antonio mattress store apologized in September after posting a video on Facebook advertising a “Twin Towers Sale” that parodied the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. In the ad, which aired prior to the fifteenth anniversary of the terror attacks, two workers stand in front of two mattress “towers” an American Flag, before the mattress towers are toppled in apparent shock over the sale. 41. The Comcast Demolition Derby: Comcast issued an “our bad” apology earlier this month when a tech crew in Indiana was recorded apparently disregarding drivers who ran off the road or collided while trying to get around the repair truck parked in the icy street. 42. Veteran Doesn’t Eat Free: Back in November, Chili’s offered veterans a free meal. However, one Texas veteran recorded an interaction with a Chili’s manager who called into question his military record and took away the man’s to-go box, saying he hadn’t proved he was a veteran. 43. Bae Interns Gotta Drink: Companies trying to attract a younger employee pool often try to be “hip,” and often fail, but not as gloriously as when Microsoft referred to interns as “bea” and invited them to have “lots of dranks.” The company subsequently issued an equally embarrassing apology. 44. New Slogan Gone Bad: Alaska Airlines apologized in January after coming under fire for using the phrase “Meet our Eskimo” in its rebranding campaign. 45. Bloody Mail: Getting mail is great. Getting mail covered in blood is not. The United States Postal Service issued an apology to residents of the town of Olean, NY, who complained about getting mail stained with blood. 46. Where’s The Cheese?: The presence of cheese is implied in the name “Mozzarella Sticks,” but McDonald’s early attempts at selling the cheesy appetizer didn’t go well, with the company having to apologize for serving up pockets of fried air. 47. Not For Kids: A California movie theater apologized in June when it accidentally played a trailer for Sausage Party (an R-rated, expletive-laden dark comedy featuring self-aware food facing imminent, violent death by human) to a bunch of people there to see Finding Dory (an under-the-sea, feel-good family flick). Oops. Marketing Gone WrongImage courtesy of @online_shawn Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter To sell a product, companies generally create a marketing plan around the item using ads, displays, and social media campaigns. While the hope is that these efforts will pay off with lots of sales, sometimes things go south. 48. That Won’t Sell A Laptop: Home shopping network QVC said it was looking into the matter when a Consumerist reader watching the channel saw a laptop being hawked with the assistance of racist comments on the screen. 49. I Am Not Chipotle: A D.C.-area attorney was inundated with text messages from people seeking free burritos from Chipotle. The mix-up occurred when people accidentally added another digit to the six digit text code. 50. Prank Gone Wrong: Google quickly disabled its April Fools’ Day joke after the “Mic Drop & Send” button, which inserted an animation of a Minion (from the Despicable Me movies) dropping a microphone muting any email thread replies, caused a few problems for Gmail users. 51. Wrong Place: Facebook accidentally activated its safety check feature in March, asking people on the other side of the world from an incident to confirm they were safe. 52. What Were You Thinking Walmart?: It’s not uncommon for retailers to create eye-catching displays to sell products. But a Florida Walmart’s “We Will Never Forget” American flag tribute — complete with the World Trade Center towers — made entirely of Coca-Cola products didn’t go over well, as one might expect. 53. “No” Is Not Maybe: Forever 21 pulled a mens’ shirt that suggested “Don’t Say Maybe If You Want To Say No” after customers accused the retailer of making light of rape. 54. Violently Ill: Meal replacement startup Soylent pulled its new-to-market nutrition bars after receiving reports from customers who became ill after consuming the snack. A week later, the company also pulled its meal replacement powder citing similar illnesses. 55. Pulled Costume: A month before Halloween, Disney pulled a boy’s costume for a Polynesian character in the movie Moana, after receiving backlash from Pacific Islanders who compared it to blackface. 56. One Hot Toy: Toys “R” Us pulled a rideable Tonka Mighty Wheels Ride-On dump truck from stores in November after a family says the toy exploded and caught fire in the back of their truck on the way home from the store. 57. Creepy Peeping: Halloween decorations are supposed to be a bit scary, but a Peeping Tom adornment from Home Depot was just downright creepy, leading the retailer to pull the item from its shelves. 58. Massachusetts or Maryland, What’s The Difference?: Geography is hard. Or at least it appears hard for Walmart. Customers tipped off the retailer to its very obvious mistake in selling University of Maryland T-shirts bearing an image of the state of Massachusetts. Forgetting The LawImage courtesy of (Lucia Sanchez) Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Each year, without fail, companies seem to forget that mothers can nurse their infants however and wherever they choose, and that service animals are allowed to fly on airplanes alongside their owners. 59. Put It Away: An Ohio museum clarified that mothers are welcome to nurse their children on the property after employees told a visiting woman that she had to stop breastfeeding in March. 60. Everyone’s Gotta Eat: While dining with her family at a local Pizza Hut an Ohio woman says she was asked to leave after she began to nurse her three-month-old son at the table. 61. Get Off The Plane: American Airlines apologized in November when an Illinois family claimed they were kicked off a flight because a flight attendant thought their service dog was too big. 62. Guided Out Of The Restaurant: A Popeyes restaurant in Brooklyn used its “no pets” policy to kick a blind man and his guide dog out of the establishment in November. 63. Uber Unfortunate: Uber has been called out in the past by blind customers and advocacy groups for the blind for drivers who refused to transport service animals. That continued in July when an Orlando driver was arrested for allegedly driving away from blind passengers with guide dogs. 64. You Can’t Fly: An army veteran sued American Airlines in October after the carrier’s employees allegedly wouldn’t allow her to board a plane from Kansas to Mississippi with her licensed service dog.

Next summer, a solar eclipse will darken southern cities like Charleston and Nashville for a few minutes. By Emily Smith and Doug Criss CNN (CNN) -- Moaning about 2016 is soo last year. If you're ready for a little positivity, here's a bunch of cool stuff we can all look forward to in 2017. Bring it on! (But not like, too much. Some people are still feeling kinda fragile.) 1. A solar eclipse Next summer, a solar eclipse will darken southern cities like Charleston and Nashville for a few minutes. If you don't live in the South, no worries! The natural blackout will be visible with less intensity in other major cities. If you want visit these spots, NASA has you covered. Just don't forget to wear your sunglasses! 2. Moon adventures -- for real! Humans continue their leap in space, and Google is leading a moonshot effort. The company is rewarding three privately-funded teams who reach Earth's moon by 2017. The requirements: A team's rover must travel 500 meters on lunar grounds and send back high-definition footage. You know, because pics or it didn't happen. Oh, and besides lunar glory, there is a $20 million grand prize on the line. 3. The return of TV favs There's important, big-dog TV coming down the pike. We'll get Season 7 of "Game of Thrones" and, after a five-year hiatus, a Season 9 of "Curb Your Enthusiasm." Season 6 will be the last season for "Girls," and in the streaming realm, Season 2 of "Stranger Things" will crawl out of the upside-down. In reality news, the former host of the "Celebrity Apprentice" is a little tied up with his new job, so new host Arnold Schwarzenegger will get to step into his shoes. 4. DeLoreans The future is back! The DeLorean Motor Company is letting buyers reserve their timeless vehicle online. The famous car was basically its own beloved character in the 'Back to the Future' saga. The manufacturer is running late on production but expects to crank out a car per month sometime in 2017. 5. Superfast trains Are super speedy trains in our near future? One company, Hyperloop One, envisions trains traveling as fast as planes, but without the turbulence. The company will test their fastest trains in 2017, with even bigger things to come. "The goal," they say, is to move "cargo by 2020 and passengers by 2021." 6. Drones EVERYWHERE Drones are going to BIG. They'll be everywhere! No really, everywhere. Google could soon make it rain with beer and pizza as they prepare to drone-deliver food from the skies to your doorsteps through the developing 'Project Wing.' Amazon will expand on its nascent drone operation in the UK, and mega-retailer Wal-Mart wants to use them too, to help maintain inventory in its warehouses. 7. Attainable 'Hamilton' tickets Being one of the cool kids is about to get a whole lot easier. The record-setting Broadway sensation "Hamilton" is going national, which means you won't have to travel to New York or Chicago, spend a million dollars, wait five years and barter your firstborn just to see it. Here is a list of stops. Good luck, they'll still probably sell out in a matter of seconds. Oh well, there's always 2018. 8. Sequels, sequels and more sequels Who says Hollywood needs fresh, original ideas when they can make bucketfuls of money trotting out old ones? Get set for new entries in durable movie franchises like Spiderman ("Homecoming"), the X-Men ("Logan"), Alien ("Covenant"), Thor ("Ragnarok"), Pirates of the Caribbean ("Dead Men Tell No Tales"), Transformers ("The Last Knight") and The Fast and Furious ("The Fate of the Furious"). And of course we'll all take yet another trip to a galaxy far, far away when "Star Wars Episode VIII" takes over theaters (and the world) at Christmas. There will be a touch of sadness with this one, however, due to the death of Carrie Fisher. She had finished shooting her scenes for this one, so it will at least give fans one last chance to say goodbye. 9. Dave Chappelle Netflix and chill is over. It's about to be Netflix and laugh until you cry. After dropping his Comedy Central contract in 2005, the comedian is delivering a new stand-up comedy special on the streaming juggernaut. He's also releasing two unseen shows from his personal vault. 10. New music and collabs Yes, 2016 took so many of our music legends. But some of your favs will still be putting out new music. The Arcade Fire says its new album will drop in the spring, and it's about time. Eminem will also get a strange bedfellow in...Adele? Yes Slim Shady and the 10-time Grammy winning singer will reportedly team up on his new album, his first since "The Marshall Mathers LP 2" in 2013. Oh, and and we'll get "More Life" from Drake, which he considers more of a playlist than an album. Whatever, just give it to us! 11. The book everyone's been waiting for The sixth book in George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series -- which "Games of Thrones" is based on -- could come out in March. It's called "The Winds of Winter," and Martin promises to open it with two big battle scenes."The Winds of Winter" will also quickly resolve several cliffhangers left over from the end of the last book, "A Dance with Dragons." We're waiting, George! 12. A head transplant (?!) Yeah, you read that right. A not-so-mad scientist plans to conduct the first human head transplant. Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero says he has a volunteer -- a man suffering from a muscle-wasting disease -- so all he needs now is a body. The details of how the surgery will go down -- like how they'll get a body -- are a little hazy, but Canavero says it'll involve 150 people, 36 hours, really cold temperatures, bio-compatible glue and a diamond knife. Best. Craft project. Ever. 13. Nintendo's next big thing Everybody seems hyped about the Nintendo Switch. It's the first video gaming system that lets you, well, switch effortlessly between playing games on the big-screen TV in your living room or the tablet in your hand. The price for the Switch, due out in March, hasn't been released yet, but all the cool kids on the internet are geeked up about it. Nintendo is, too: The company experienced lackluster sales of its Wii U back in 2012, so it's really counting on the Switch to make a big splash. 14. The Kennedy assassination files For decades, endless conspiracy theories have swirled around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But some details could add context to the tragic events of November 22, 1963 when undisclosed files on the case go public. There's a catch: The man presiding over the office Kennedy held, President-Elect Donald Trump, will have the power to order these files sealed, if he so chooses. 15. Weird milk Who needs cows? Not a California-based tech start-up called Perfect Day. It's promising to put bottles of milk made without cows on store shelves by the end of the year. Perfect Day says making milk without the cow is a lot like crafting beer: It involves fermentation and yeast (and probably a little imagination). The company also says making milk this way is better for the environment, since the technique involves using less land, water and energy. 16. Surfin' in The Eddie It's the one sporting event in the world that usually gets canceled by the weather. The Eddie is an invite-only Hawaiian surfing contest that takes place off of Oahu's famous North Shore. Organizers only run it when conditions are right -- when the waves are at LEAST 20 feet high -- so the contest has only happened nine times in 30 years. The waiting period for the current contest runs until February 28, so everybody's got their fingers crossed that the big waves will come. 17. Virtual reality (just in case things get bad again) 2017 could be the year that virtual reality finally gets real and fulfill all those promises that were made to us back in the 90s. The Samsung Gear VR (which works with Galaxy phones) seemed to make the biggest splash with the masses this year, and that won't change going into next year. But the Daydream View from Google will probably make big strides next year too, as it becomes available to work with most Android phones. And Microsoft will put out a number of Windows-10 compatible VR headsets in the next couple of months, so consumers will have a ton of good choices.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive From the Pastor: The day that Christmas died Friday Dec 30, 2016 at 8:29 AM The so-called “War on Christmas” has been prosecuted for the past few years around the United States. Shayne Looper The so-called “War on Christmas” has been prosecuted for the past few years around the United States. It started with community leaders removing nativity scenes from town squares because of complaints from non-Christians, mostly atheists. Then came Walmart’s notorious instruction to employees to wish people “Happy Holidays” rather than “Merry Christmas.” Last year, when Starbuck’s changed the design of their holiday cup (which changes every year), some people saw it as another sneak attack on Christmas. Whether any of this denotes a war on Christmas is a matter of debate. Non-Christians think their Christian counterparts need to stop being so paranoid, and some Christians agree. The popular Christian author Rachel Held Evans made light of Christians who feel persecuted because someone wished them a happy holiday rather than a merry Christmas: “You are not being persecuted,” she wrote. Yet others disagree, claiming that the “War on Christmas” is just one battlefield in a larger war on Christianity. Is there really a war on Christmas? It is hard to be sure. We may be witnessing an intentional assault on Christmas or we may just be seeing the collapse of Christian traditions generally, brought on by stress or old age, crumbling like a medieval cathedral. That is just the kind of thing Malcom Muggeridge predicted in his prophetic lecture series from 1978 titled “The End of Christendom.” As Christendom collapses under its own weight, valued traditions will inevitably fall with it. Whether we are currently living through a “war on Christmas” may be up for debate, but there can be no debate that Christmas has been victimized by war in the past. It was on December 25, 1647, that Christmas was reportedly killed. “Christmas” (probably an assumed name) was a demonstrator in Ipswich, England, who had taken to the streets to protest a law passed in June of that year that made the celebration of Christmas a punishable offence. “Christmas” was reportedly killed by police in the ensuing riot, just as Christmas had been reportedly killed by an act of Parliament in the House of Commons. In London on that same day, a crowd of laborers decorated the water tower with holly and ivy. When the police ordered them to disperse and they refused, troops were sent in to quell the riot. On that same day in Canterbury, where Christmas celebrations were an integral part of the city’s identity, rioters smashed the windows of shops that opened on Christmas Day. The war on Christmas had begun 80 years earlier in the anti-popish Kirk of Scotland. There was a truce in the early 1600s, but it broke out again with a furor in the 1630s. In 1642 there was a genuine civil war between the king and Parliament, in which the royalists upheld the celebration of Christmas and the Parliament, led by Cromwell and others, rejected it. The fascinating thing is that both sides, the pro-Christmas demonstrators and the anti-Christmas legislators, insisted that their views represented a biblical perspective. Unlike the current so-called “war on Christmas,” this one was being waged by so-called Christians. The celebration of the birth of Christ had become the occasion of violence against Christians, and had done so without any help at all from antagonistic “heathens.” If we are indeed going through another war on Christmas, it is hardly the first. Christmas has been attacked by Puritans in England, by atheists in France (who referred to it as “Dog Day” after the revolution), by Soviets in the wake of Red October, by Chinese communists and many others (including, incidentally, the City of Boston during the late 17th century). What should people who care about Christmas do when they see its importance being challenged? They should remember the distinction between Christmas and the event it celebrates. Throughout history, the celebration of Christmas has been marked by absurdities from within and violence from without. It has experienced the ebb and flow of popularity. But the event it commemorates stands undiminished. No assault on Christmas can ever undo what has been accomplished through the birth of Christ. And that’s something to celebrate. — Shayne Looper is the pastor of Lockwood Community Church in Branch County.

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed in the Southern District of New York. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than 100 million US dollars (£81.2 million) in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, McDaniels and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group was officially disbanding. In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honour.

The closure left 264 people out of work, and the store paid a huge percentage of the already poor city’s sales taxes. The city has already struggled to pay its bills, from city workers to meals for prison inmates. The city is much older and poorer than Alabama as a whole. The city Council isn’t even sure how devastating the loss is: the council hasn’t passed a budget since 2014 and didn’t perform an audit of the city’s finances last year.

Some of these reductions were the results of branch closures – the company has closed more than 60 this year, with plans to close at least 100 – and some were through hiring freezes. There were also about 260 layoffs nationwide in January, hitting Birmingham and Montgomery the hardest. Even with the reductions, though, Regions employs more than 22,000 people. bn Birmingham gets a leather bar Birmingham got a unique new concept this year: Spike’s Leather Bar, a bar catering to the leather and fetish community in Birmingham.

Birmingham voted in 2015 to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, but it wasn’t to become effective until July 2017 after some incremental changes. But the plans got muddled this February when the state legislature passed a bill blocking cities and counties from setting minimum wages. When the bill was introduced, Birmingham passed an ordinance to speed up its timeline, but the state blocked it before it could take effect. Several protests were organized around the Birmingham area, many at fast foot restaurants, to fight for higher wages. In April, the Alabama National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Greater Birmingham Ministries filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court alleging that blocking the minimum wage hike violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

(Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer) Chinese-owned pork giant Smithfield skips middlemen in grain supply chain By Michael Hirtzer • Reuters Dec 30, 2016 (…) Andrew Harrer Signage stands outside of Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.'s Smithfield Foods Inc. headquarters in Smithfield, Va. , on Tuesday, June 29, 2016. (Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer) CHICAGO  •  Smithfield Foods Inc., the world's biggest pork producer, is buying grain elevators and purchasing grain directly from farmers, a move that hits grain handlers already reeling from multiyear lows in corn and soybean prices. The Virginia-based company bought two Ohio grain elevators in September. For the first time, it can ship grain directly from Ohio to feed the pigs that Smithfield slaughters at its Tar Heel, N.C., packing plant — the world's largest, processing about 32,000 hogs daily. Smithfield now buys 65 percent of its animal feed directly from farmers, up from the 10 percent of feed it directly bought in 2010. The direct buying strategy aims to lower feed costs and could provide a model for other large meat companies that still largely rely on commercial grain handlers, such as Chicago-based Archer Daniels Midland Co. Grain can account for up to 60 percent of Smithfield's costs. The company's expenses in 2015 totaled $4.67 billion. In 2014, Smithfield canceled a grain handling contract with CHS Inc., the largest U.S. farmer-owned cooperative, which had previously supplied a Smithfield feed mill in Yuma, Colo. Smithfield has canceled contracts with other smaller grain handlers since 2010. "They take the Walmart approach and go right to the source," said a CHS Inc employee who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. A CHS spokeswoman declined to comment. Smithfield also aims to work directly with farmers to influence farm management, from crop rotations to fertilizer and fungicide applications that could result in higher-quality grain that speeds weight gain in hogs. Smithfield could have a say in the seeds that are planted for the grain to feed the hogs it slaughters to produce the pork it sells. "In a dirt-to-fork story, you have to start with the dirt," said Joe Kerns, president of animal agriculture consulting firm Kerns Associates. "This is the first foray." Smithfield, purchased by China's WH Group in 2013 for $4.9 billion, plans to continue reducing reliance on grain handlers, said Robbie Montgomery, Smithfield's grain origination manager. "That's key to our strategy, our farmer relationships. It's not us buying from a dealer; it's us buying from a farmer," Montgomery said. Impact on grain handlers   Smithfield's push to go directly to farmers comes as ADM, Cargill and other leading grain handlers are facing sharp drops in corn and soybean prices following record-large U.S. harvests. Handlers make money buying, selling, storing, transporting and processing grains around the world, typically earning small profit margins on each bushel they trade. Trading fees for commercial grain handling can run to 20 cents a bushel in tight-supply markets, but drop to just a few pennies when grain prices are low. Juan Luciano, chief executive officer for ADM in an August conference call said weak margins in grain handling contributed to a 26 percent fall in profits during the second quarter, before revenues improved in the third quarter. He did not mention Smithfield in particular, and ADM declined comment on its relationship with Smithfield. Cargill did not respond to requests for comment on Smithfield's efforts to bypass grain handlers. U.S. farmers built up their elevator storage to better control their harvest, and hold back supplies when prices are low, cutting in to profits for handlers. In the last quarter of 2016, ADM and others have tried to make up reduced returns on grain trading in the U.S. by selling grain overseas and making money on storage of abundant U.S. supplies. The Smithfield move alone is probably not enough to hurt the big grain handlers immediately, said Kerns, the agriculture consultant. Smithfield is a long way from quitting the big grain handlers altogether, and still relies on ADM and Cargill to crush soybeans into soy meal, an animal feed. But such companies could lose substantial business if other meat producers follow Smithfield's lead, and smaller grain handlers are already feeling the impact.

MaxYield previously supplied a Smithfield-owned feed mill in Algona that can grind 50,000 bushels of corn per day. "They want control from the ground up," said Karl Setzer, MaxYield's risk management team leader, who was told by Smithfield that the company was not renewing its contract. Setzer declined to comment on how the loss of the contract affected MaxYield's business. Buying direct Smithfield buys about 150 million bushels of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum per year to feed its 16 million hogs, according to a Smithfield spokeswomen. "Smithfield has always been uneasy about their dependence on feed," said Chris Hurt, an agriculture economist at Purdue University who has advised the hog industry. The company also is using a port it helped build in 2002, in Wilmington, N.C., to import feed from South America and Europe. It has imported soy from Brazil and Argentina and feed wheat from Europe when it is cheaper than supplies shipped out of the Midwest, most recently with a bulk vessel of Brazilian corn that arrived in June. Smithfield's vice president for business development, Joe Szaloky, said the company has become a savvy buyer. "We think we can buy from farmers just as well as anyone else can," he said.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The hip-hop stars' handlers claim bosses at the companies have used their iconic logo on products without permission. The Run-DMC brand officials have filed a lawsuit accusing the retailers of advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing products with the logo, which has led fans to believe the band endorses the merchandise, including hats, T-shirts, and wallets. They are asking for $50 million (£40.7 million) in damages, reports TMZ.com.

Hot Topics: U.S. Presidential Election News Local Heroes Where We Live My Classic Car The Alphabet Print   Email   Font Resize TJX ignored the internet -- and won Sentinel & Enterprise Updated:   12/26/2016 07:03:19 AM EST Shopping carts sit in the parking lot outside a T.J. Maxx store in Peoria, Ill., last summer. Bloomberg photo / Daniel Acker Sentinel and Enterprise staff photos can be ordered by visiting our SmugMug site. By Kim Bhasin and Lindsay Rupp Bloomberg When Kimberly Dulude steps into a T.J. Maxx store near her job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she likes to begin perusing a clearance aisle in the back. Then she works her way up to shoes. Beauty is next, and so on until she gets to the front. The 29-year-old does buy stuff online all the time -- just not from TJ Maxx. The store, she says, provides the thrill of the hunt. "I kid you not, I could spend hours in there," said Dulude. There's been much talk this holiday season about the utter dominance of e-commerce. Cyber Monday set a record for online sales, racking up $3.45 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights. The National Retail Federation said more people shopped online throughout Black Friday weekend than in physical stores. And the clicks continued past the weekend: Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores and Amazon.com turned what was once just a discount day for online sales into weeks of bargains. But there are some stores bucking the trend. Take T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, owned by parent company TJX Cos. in Framingham. They're a rarity in the retail universe: stores that don't care about online sales because their businesses are based on the real-life retail experience. Inventory shifts regularly, so no visit is the same -- the promise of discovering great items on the cheap is what draws shoppers inside. Advertisement Companies like TJX and competitors Ross Stores Inc. and Burlington Stores Inc. have a team of buyers that pick up excess items on the wholesale market -- anything from cashmere sweaters to copper mugs. TJX alone works with more than 18,000 vendors, including manufacturers and retailers, to scoop up stylish stuff in bulk and resell it at a steal. With more than 2,500 U.S. stores, the company is also adept at tailoring merchandise being offered to local trends. If you love retailers like HomeGoods or Marshalls but don't live near one, you're out of luck, because online they only sell gift cards. T.J. Maxx sells some clothing and accessories on its website, but the experience is very different than sifting through racks for a one-of-its-size item. "They're not worried about it at all," said Mickey Chadha, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service who considers the T.J. Maxx's online penetration negligible. "The product is right at the right price. Online is only as good as the product." A representative for TJX declined to comment on the company's strategy. Executives have repeatedly stated on conference calls with analysts that they view e-commerce as a supplement to its shops, a way to drive real-life traffic. Though TJMaxx.com launched back in 2013, e-commerce sales remain at only about 1 percent of total sales and had an "immaterial impact" on growth last year, according to a January filing. "While it's a small part of our business, we see it as highly complementary to our physical stores," TJX Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said in May. "We are being methodical in how we grow this business." It's working. Shares have more than doubled over the past five years and revenue is up more than 30 percent during the same time period. TJX's 10 brands hauled in nearly $31 billion in sales last year. When stores like T.J. Maxx do it right, they leave their shoppers filled with feelings of adventure and serendipity, said Jordan Rost, vice president of consumer insights at Nielsen, a research firm. Even an unsuccessful trip to a discount store can reinforce the thrill of the hunt. The instincts driving customers into parking lots is similar to those shopping online, Rost said. They're searching for deals and the best item to fill some broad want or need without a target in mind. As shoppers across generations and demographics become more focused on value than ever before, the excitement of finding something on sale has an even broader appeal. Millennials who grew up relying on e-commerce for all their needs are coming through the doors, too.  "Younger consumers are really open to that kind of open-minded approach to shopping, not necessarily coming in with a specific brand or product in mind," said Rost. "Discovery is part of the experience."
