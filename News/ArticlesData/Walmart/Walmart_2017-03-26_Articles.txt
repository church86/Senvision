The update is part of Walmart's  "Disc-to-Digital" service, which allows customers to bring in physical media their local Walmart and have them transferred onto cloud storage. Both iOS and Android users can use the Mobile Disc-to-Digital, which supports nearly 8,000 films from Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. They are also hoping to add more from other distributors, as well.  Jeremy Verba, General Manager of Vudu, said, "The average movie collector owns nearly 100 DVDs and Blu-rays. We know these customers have invested a lot into building their physical movie collections. As more and more customers create digital libraries, we are constantly looking for ways to help them unlock additional value from the movies they already own." He added, "Like Walmart, at VUDU we're always striving to save our customers time and money. Our Mobile Disc-to-Digital service is a key part of Vudu's broader effort to make digital entertainment access simple and convenient." Vudu is available for iPhone and iPad, and the Mobile Disc-to-Digital update will be live at 12:00 p.m. EDT.   Filed Under: vudu, ios, walmart Share this: Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Weekend Box Office 1.

Family sues Lake Hallie Officer shot, killed woman last spring after she swung hatchet around shoppers at Walmart posted March 25, 2017 12:00 a.m. | updated March 25, 2017 9:26 p.m. (CDT) email article print font size - + by / Chris Vetter. bio | email Leader-Telegram staff Staff file photo by Pamela Powers | Enlarge - Lake Hallie police respond on April 8 to Walmart, 2786 Commercial Blvd. An officer shot and killed a woman as she charged at him with a hatchet, according to an investigation. The woman’s family has filed a lawsuit against the village. CHIPPEWA FALLS — The family of a 25-year-old woman who was shot and killed last April by a police officer at the Lake Hallie Walmart store has filed a lawsuit against the village, the police department, Northern Wisconsin Center and several insurance companies. Melissa Abbott was a resident at Northern Wisconsin Center, a state-operated facility for persons with disabilities and mental diseases. On April 8, Abbott was at Walmart, 2786 Commercial Blvd., when she began swinging a hatchet around other shoppers in the store. The Chippewa County dispatch center received a call at 5:11 p.m. about a “disorderly female who refused to leave the store.” Lake Hallie police Officer Adam Meyers arrived at the scene. Meyers shot twice, striking Abbott in the leg and abdomen. Abbott was taken to a nearby hospital, where she died. In May, then-District Attorney Steve Gibbs issued a 12-page ruling, saying that Meyers “acted in self-defense and that his belief that he reasonably believed his life was in danger, or that he was likely to suffer great bodily harm, when Ms. Abbott refused to follow orders and charged officer Meyers with a hatchet.” Gibbs concluded his report by stating the evidence clearly showed the shooting was self-defense, and there is no reason “to establish a basis to charge officer Meyers with a crime.” The lawsuit, filed by River Falls attorney Dean Rohde, disagrees with Gibbs’ assessment of the incident. Rohde wrote that Meyers’ conduct and actions were “excessive and unreasonable, without lawful justification or reason, and was designed to and did cause specific and serious physical harm, pain and suffering and death.” He added that her death was caused by “the negligence of the village of Lake Hallie and/​or its agents and employees.” Rohde filed the lawsuit earlier this week in Chippewa County Court, seeking a 12-person jury to hear the case. Rohde is requesting a jury award punitive damages, that Lake Hallie, the police department, and Northern Wisconsin Center “provide necessary training, personnel and resources to adequately protect the constitutional rights of citizens and patients of the Northern Wisconsin Center,” and that the defendants pay all attorney fees and other associated costs. The defendants have 45 days to respond to the lawsuit. The case has been assigned to Judge James Isaacson. Lake Hallie village President Wayne Walkoviak didn’t return calls for comment. The lawsuit is specifically filed against Lake Hallie, ABC Insurance Co., the Lake Hallie Police Department, Officer Meyers, DEF Insurance Co., Northern Wisconsin Center and its director Jacqueline Neurohr, GHI Insurance Co. and Walmart Stores. Abbott was living at Northern Wisconsin Center on the east side of Chippewa Falls. Gibbs’ report includes interviews with workers at the facility who had accompanied Abbott on the trip to Walmart. Several other shoppers and Walmart employees also were interviewed. Abbot has threatened to kill the staff at Excel Treatment Center and wrote in her journal a desire that “when the cops get called I will grab their gun and there will be a shootout between me and the cops.” Meyers, who has been employed as a Lake Hallie police officer since Oct. 8, 2008, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, which is standard protocol.

Al Powers/Invision via AP | Caption Loading... Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen March 26, 2017 —Gamers no longer have to look far or travel wide for the latest video games. But the availability of blockbuster titles at WalMart, on Amazon, or downloadable directly from consoles or other devices continues to undercut one of the most recognizable names in the industry. After it reported fourth quarter sales declines in almost all of its segments on Thursday, GameStop announced it will close in 2017 at least 150 of its 7,500 retail stores worldwide. The Texas-based video game seller will instead open more of its other successful stores, which includes cellphone retailers such as Spring Mobile, and its Collectibles business, which includes the clothing and novelties retailer ThinkGeek. GameStop’s closing of between 2 and 3 percent of its storefronts is the latest example of brick-and-mortar stores' suffering from online competition. To meet the lightning-fast expectations of Millennials and Generation Z (those born between 1996 and 2010), some big-box stores are reinventing themselves, turning their superstores into distribution centers where customers can retrieve online orders rather than wait for them to arrive in the mail. But GameStop faces a challenge unique to its industry: the ability to download games directly from a Playstation 4, Xbox One, smartphone, or tablet.      "Not only are they getting hammered by the online retailers and big box that have an inherent cost advantage through no retail real estate footprint or a much larger footprint that they can leverage with other products, but the movement to mobile-based games is creeping up mightily," Larry Perkins, chief executive and founder of SierraConstellation Partners, told USA TODAY. The sum effect was a drop in sales across almost all of GameStop’s segments. The company reported on Thursday that its hardware sales declined 29.1 percent during the fourth quarter, and new software sales fell by 19.3 percent during the same period, according to a press release. The retailer blamed weak sales of certain blockbuster video games released during the critical holiday period, as well as “aggressive console promotions by other retailers” on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday. Video game trivia: How much do you know? "We encountered stiff headwinds as we completed the third year of the console cycle," said GameStop chief executive Paul Raines, according to USA TODAY. But the headlines over the weekend were nothing new for the mainstay in the video game industry.  The retailer and others like it have suffered blows from both online competitors and consoles and other devices that have made games available directly online. For decades, video games were available on physical media like discs and cartridges, wrote Michael McGrail, chief operating officer at the financial consultant Tiger Group.   Now, he wrote in 2013, “gamers download and stream content on the fly rather than head out to malls to buy games sealed in shrink-wrapped plastic.” “Retail observers already cite a parallel trend — the downloading of digital books and movies — to help explain the demise of brick-and-mortar chains such as Blockbuster and Borders [Group],” he continues. “While it would certainly be premature to declare ‘game over’ for video game retailers, it is nonetheless true that recent trends for these stores have not been encouraging.” Xbox and Playstation, for instance, now have digital stores on their consoles — the Xbox Marketplace and the Playstation Store — which allow gamers to purchase and download titles directly from them, sidestepping GameStop. GameStop has seen success with its Technology Brand and Collectibles stores. In its report on Thursday, it said its Technology Brands business posted a 44 percent increase in sales during the fourth quarter, and its Collectibles business rose 28 percent. It plans to open 65 Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores. But GameStop’s apparent struggles resemble those of big-box stores and other traditional retailers. J.C. Penney, for example, announced in February that it plans to shutter up to 140 of its department stores after a poor holiday season, joining names such as Macy’s, Sears, and Kohl’s, The Christian Science Monitor previously reported. But other retailers are attempting to reinvent themselves in the face of a shifting consumer landscape. Earlier this year, WalMart announced its plan to invest more in its e-commerce operations in an effort to fend off competition from Amazon. The big-box store installed mobile payment systems for checkouts and established new online pickup and grocery services, the Monitor previously reported. WalMart paired these changes with a round of investments in e-commerce companies such as Jet.com, and a planned expansion of warehouses for online sales, in what market analysts describe as a model geared toward "the consumer of the future,” namely Millenials and Generation Z. "These generations are constantly connected and inhabit an online environment where events happen in real time without them having to wait, and where social media enables them to dictate terms," London analysis firm Ovum wrote in a report this year. "However, by 2026, instant gratification … will have evolved into expectations of a seamless shopping experience across an increasing range of connected devices, in which immediacy and convenience are paramount." Target announced this month plans to implement a similar model, offering a separate store entrance that includes self-checkout aisles and a counter for in-store pickups of online orders.

Nearly one-fifth of those purchases — 19.4% — are made at a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) location. The second-most popular venue to purchase these products is a traditional food store (16.6%), and Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) stores are third with a 12.1% share. Most of the purchases are made in a brick-and-mortar store; only 3.1% of personal care products are sold online. GenX shoppers make 37% of purchases, followed by millennials who make 24% of all purchases. The data were reported earlier this week by research firm TABS Analytics, based on a February survey of 1,000 consumers on their purchases of seven types of products: hair care, deodorant, personal wash, mouthwash, toothpaste, feminine care and adult incontinence. Cosmetics and skin care products were not included in the study. The researchers noted several key findings from the survey: Amazon, Walmart.com and Target.com represent 82 percent of online personal care transactions in the $1.2 billion dollar e-commerce market. CVS, Walgreens, and Dollar Stores combined have 24.7 percent of all purchases. Target’s share [of] personal care purchases is dominated by millennials and high-income consumers. Personal care consumption peaks among consumers in the $60,000 – $74,000 income range with 26 percent being heavy users. Founder and CEO of TABS Analytics, Dr. Kurt Jetta, said: Walmart, traditional food stores and Target are the clear winners in the personal care market with almost 50 percent of all estimated purchases. Unlike what we see in beauty where online sales is a key driver, online sales in personal care products is relatively unimportant coming in at just 3.1 percent of market share. Online sales of beauty products account for 9% of all sales of cosmetics and skin-care products. One final note: earlier this year Nielsen published a report on demand for premium products. The survey’s respondents said they would consider buying premium hair-care products (27%), body-care products (26%) and oral-care products (26%). More details on the TABS Analytics study are available at the company’s website.

Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the US have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. Those stumbles aren’t dissuading Airbnb Inc., however. This week the home-sharing pioneer announced that it’s changing its local brand name in China and doubling its investment there. By any measure, the opportunity is immense. In 2015, Chinese travelers spent nearly $500 billion, and the government expects that number to more than double by 2020 as the country’s middle class expands. But capturing a major piece of that market will require Airbnb to navigate a far more tangled thicket of cultural issues than what confronted Uber and other tech companies in China. And judging by its efforts so far, it probably won’t be up to the task. In theory, China should be one of the world’s biggest and best markets for home-sharing. Chinese travelers took 2.2-billion domestic trips in just the first half of 2016, up nearly 10.5 percent year-on-year. Yet China has only four hotel rooms for every 1,000 people, compared to 20 in the US. And thanks to China’s housing boom, about 50-million empty homes are scattered across the country just waiting (in theory) for paying visitors. But that doesn’t mean Chinese will jump on the opportunity to rent out their properties or stay in someone else’s home. The biggest barrier is establishing trust between owners and renters. In recent years, Chinese consumers have been confronted by scandals ranging from tainted fast food to dodgy pharmaceuticals. They chronically complain of poor-quality goods and misleading marketing or labeling. And they’re highly suspicious of small vendors. So renting a room from a stranger advertising on the internet won’t come naturally. Homeowners, meanwhile, have their own concerns. Many of China’s vacant properties are purchased as investments, and most affluent homeowners—especially those with desirable vacation rentals—will hesitate to open their doors to poorer tourists, who constitute most Chinese travelers these days and who would be the most likely to forgo a hotel. That reluctance is only heightened by the near-constant stream of news reports about misbehavior among Chinese travelers at home and abroad. Bridging this gap in trust will be difficult. But there’s some evidence that local companies—which are more familiar with local customs and concerns—are figuring it out. For example, Tujia.com, China’s biggest home-sharing site, takes the ambitious approach of managing each of the 400,000 properties on its site (or hiring a third party to do so). That includes hotel-like services, such as housekeeping, as well as conducting due diligence to confirm that listings are accurate. That doesn’t just improve the experience for renters; it also expands the number of properties available by giving owners—many of whom live far away from their investments—less upkeep to worry about and more peace of mind. Airbnb, with its paltry 80,000 listings in China, hasn’t made any such effort, focusing instead on self-starting younger travelers. Where Tujia arranges for home cleaners, Airbnb’s new investments are focused on curated “Experiences,” such as tours of local landmarks, that can be purchased alongside a room. That kind of thing won’t be enough to overcome the cultural barriers inhibiting home-sharing in China. And so far, there’s little evidence that Airbnb is savvy enough to come up with a more appealing approach. On Wednesday, shortly after the company announced its new Chinese brand name—Aibiying—social media users were widely mocking it as nonsensical and hard to pronounce. It’s not all bad news for Airbnb. China’s growing tourism market means that even a niche player focused on adventurous young travelers has a big opportunity. Equally important, outbound travel is growing, and Airbnb’s three-million global listings will remain the best home-sharing option for Chinese who want one, a fact conceded even by its Chinese competitors. When it comes to winning China’s local home-sharing market, however, Airbnb should probably check out early.

clock menu more-arrow When Someone Is Gone, But Their Clothing Remains Of all the items you can find yourself newly in possession of when a parent or loved one dies, few are as fraught with intimate meaning as clothing. by Jess Bergman Mar 26, 2017, 10:02am EDT tweet share pin My father was not a fashionable man. By the time I was a teenager, his Jerry Seinfeld mullet was more than a decade past its expiration date. He dressed in what was not so much a uniform as variations on a single theme, comprised of a few non-negotiable staples. Jeans, light wash, were purchased primarily at Walmart; flannel button-downs were worn tucked in or open, over T-shirts; the T-shirts themselves were often from Hard Rock Cafés throughout Asia, relics of his father’s (my grandfather’s) extensive business travels and un-ironic love of kitsch; and sneakers, always white, were worn well into the process of their own disintegration. This is all to say that clothes had never mattered to my dad, and so, after he died suddenly in 2011, it didn’t seem that they should matter to me. Or at least that’s what I told myself when I opted out of joining my family in cleaning out my dad’s home — a necessary postmortem process that nonetheless seemed daunting, if not downright ghoulish. I did not feel equipped to make decisions about which of his possessions should be kept and which discarded, and so I returned to college shortly after his funeral. The only item it would have occurred to me to keep — the University of Pennsylvania baseball cap he wore every day, not content to broadcast his pride in me through words alone — was cremated along with his body. In the end, a single garment was chosen for me: a Philadelphia Flyers T-shirt so comically large that it’s more dress than shirt, and more sack than dress. It is the confused whitish gray of cigarette ash, with a ragged hem that skims the tops of my knees. The lettering is so faded that in parts it threatens to flake off completely. A curling, wrinkled tag sewn into its sweat-stained collar identifies the shirt as belonging to the now-defunct brand TRUE-FAN SPORTSWEAR. It’s not so much vintage as, well, old. It is, in short, the kind of shirt appropriate for little more than sleeping in, though naturally, this hasn’t dissuaded me from making a few ill-fated attempts at wearing it outside of the house, hanging over leggings or stuffed lumpily into high-waisted jeans. It’s possible that in a 24-year history of questionable sartorial choices, I have never owned a less flattering garment. I will never throw it away. Of all the items you can find yourself newly in possession of when a parent or loved one dies, few are as fraught with intimate meaning as clothing. While photographs are, by nature, as Susan Sontag writes, already “memento mori,” clothes and accessories aren’t made for posterity, but for people; what to do with them can prove a greater challenge for the recently bereaved. This is in part a result of clothing’s symbolic power, but also in part a reflection of material reality. On the one hand, clothes play an important role in our identity construction — they are the way we make ourselves legible to the world before we’ve even opened our mouths. “My mom loved to shop and put a lot of thought into what she wore,” Kristen Martin, a college writing instructor who lost her mother to cancer at 12, told me. “Her personality is imbued in the clothing and accessories she left behind. I think that's why some of the things I've inherited from her feel so weighted for me — they're the remains of her that I can still access.” On the other hand, clothes are also literally porous. They live against and around our bodies and are physically, demonstrably changed by them: stretched out or stained, torn or mended, cried on or slept in. As material texts scholar (and my former professor) Peter Stallybrass writes in Worn Worlds: Clothes, Mourning, and the Life of Things, “The magic of cloth... is that it receives us: receives our smell, our sweat, our shape even. And when our parents, our friends, our lovers die, the clothes in their closets still hang there, holding their gestures, both reassuring and terrifying, touching the living with the dead.” In other words, clothes retain something of the bodies that once animated them even after those bodies are gone. The uncanniness of these traces can be too much for some people to bear at the height of their grief. “If it is the presence of the dead that is evoked, this can be comforting, healing,” JM Simpsons writes in “Materials for mourning: Bereavement literature and the afterlife of clothes,” but “if it is the manner of their death, or the fact of their absence that is underlined, it is deeply distressing.” When Kristen’s father died of cancer two years after her mother, some of her aunts had a sweatshirt of his made into a smaller one for a teddy bear. But the choice of garment wound up undermining its comforting intentions. “He only wore that sweatshirt once he became extremely ill, which isn't the way I thought he would want to be remembered,” Kristen explained. Like the clothes of the dead, [grief] is something you get used to wearing, until it becomes difficult to remember a time before it was yours. Jamie-Lee Josselyn, a creative writing instructor at Penn whose mother died by suicide when she was 12, also attests to struggling with a difficult inheritance. One of the few items of her mother’s that she kept was a necklace: a simple opal pendant on a delicate gold chain. For a while, she wore it daily, but, Jamie-Lee tells me, the prospect of losing or breaking it eventually started to feel like its own kind of grief: “I had assigned so much meaning to it. This pendant was the thing of hers I'd carry forward with me. It was sort of too much to bear.” Now, she wears it only when she wants to. If the mutable nature of these items can sometimes overwhelm, they also, in a sense, contain their own antidote. The ability of clothing to be changed by its wearer does not expire, even if the body that once filled it has. A jacket that belonged to your dead parent is not the same as one fished out of a pile at Goodwill, but both will, in time, lose the contours of their original wearers and begin to take on your own. “A lot of things that once felt like they were primarily my mom's have come to feel like they're really my belongings, simply because I wear them so often,” Kristen said. A once-daunting red Coach waist belt that her mother had saved up to buy has become an accessory like any other, valued as much for its utility as any emotional weight it may carry. It has become something of a cliché in its own right to point out that the conventional wisdom about grief leaves much to be desired, especially in its insistence on linearity. But it is true that grief does not abate with time so much as it changes shape, takes up space in your life differently. Like the clothes of the dead, it’s something you get used to wearing, until it becomes difficult to remember a time before it was yours. These days, my room is littered with objects that once belonged to my father: a middle-school portrait, a wedding album, a handful of vintage cameras in various states of disrepair. Though it comforts me to be near them, they all carry about them a whiff of elegy. These things that he once owned are static: They speak not to the fact that my dad once lived, but that he died. His shirt, though, tells a different story. My mom used to say that my father and I were “cut from the same cloth:” two peas in a pod alike in interests, in shyness, in neuroses. In the five years since his death, the ratty Flyers T-shirt has long since ceased to smell like anything other than the plain Tide I buy at my corner bodega. Wearing it won’t return my father to me in any meaningful sense, but pulling it on can still feel like some kind of reunion: We were, after all, both made in his image.

A banner year for billionaires has lifted the fortunes of female moguls around the globe. An all-time high of 2043 people made the ranks of Forbes’ World’s Billionaires, 227 of whom are women — a jump from last year’s 202 and a record for women billionaires. They make up 11% of the list and have a collective net worth of $852.8 billion. The majority of the richest women in the world inherited their money. For the second year running, France’s Liliane Bettencourt is the world’s wealthiest woman with a $39.5 billion net worth. The cosmetics heiress’ fortune is $3.4 billion more than a year ago, but that was only good enough to secure her a spot at no.14 on the list, down from no.11 last year. Bettencourt owns a third of L’Oreal with her children; her father, Eugene Schueller, founded the company in 1907 and passed away in 1957. The 94-year-old, who suffers from dementia, has been mired in a legal battle against former confidante and photographer Francois-Marie Banier. In 2016, Banier was ordered to pay a $400,000 fine and relinquish $90 million in assets by a French appeals court, after he was found guilty of swindling Bettencourt in 2015. Banier is appealing the decision, while Bettencourt is appealing the reduced damage payment. The second richest female in the world is Alice Walton, who is worth $33.8 billion, $1.5 billion more than last year, but slips a spot in the yearly rankings to no.17 in 2017. The only daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, Alice has not taken an active role in the family business but is the wealthiest woman in America, primarily thanks to her share of Wal-Mart stock and hefty dividends payments. She is one of four Walton women in the ranks, who altogether are worth a combined $49.5 billion. The others are her sister-in-law Christy Walton, the widow of her brother John, and her cousins, Anne Walter Kroenke and Nancy Walton Laurie. More on Forbes: The World’s Billionaires List 2017 Rounding out the world’s top 10 richest women is a group of heiresses who may not be personally well known but who make their fortunes from big and beloved brands. That includes Jacqueline Mars, worth $27 billion, whose grandfather Frank Mars founded the world’s largest candymaker, Mars Inc., in his kitchen in 1911; Maria Franca Fissolo, worth $25.2 billion, whose father-in-law created the spread that became Nutella, and whose late husband, Michele Ferrero, built the Ferrero Group into a snacks powerhouse with Ferrero Rocher, Kinder Chocolate and Tic Tacs brands under its umbrella; and Steve Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, whose $20 billion fortune comes from her shares in Apple and Disney. The woman who had the best year was Gina Rinehart. The iron ore magnet’s net worth jumped $6.2 billion to $15 billion, making her the richest person in her country and no. 69 in the world, a big jump from her spot at no. 127 a year ago. Unlike all the other women ahead of her, Rinehart also has bragging rights for actively building her fortune. Rinehart took her late father’s bankrupted estate and rebuilt it into something much larger. Her massive Roy Hill project, a world-class iron ore mine in Western Australia, has shipped 30 million tons of iron ore in its first 14 months of production.

Hong Kong’s Zhou Qunfei, the world’s 17th richest woman, takes the crown as the richest female self-starter; her $7.4 billion fortune makes her the 186th wealthiest person in the world. Born and raised in a poor rural Chinese village, Zhou lost her mother as a child and was raised by a father who suffered injuries from an industrial accident. She reportedly quit school at 16 years old to look for work, and landed in a watch lenses factory that gave her shifts lasting 16 to 18 hours a day. Zhou eventually started her own watch lenses manufacturing business, and expanded to making glass covers for cell phone screens in the early 2000s. Apple’s introduction of the iPhone in 2007 increased the demand, and her glass cover manufacturer Lens Technology is now a major supplier to both the Cupertino giant and Samsung. Zhou first became a billionaire after Lens Technology went public on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2015. She still runs the company as CEO and owns more than 80% of its stock. While women as a percentage of the world’s wealthiest has not changed much over the years, self-made women are making their mark. The proportion of self-made women on Forbes’ World’s Billionaires list has nearly tripled from a decade ago from 1% to 2.7% this year. They now account for one in four women billionaires, up from 21% last year. Of the 56 self-starters who built their own fortunes, 15 are newcomers including Vietnam’s Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao (net worth of $1.2 billion) and Japan’s Yoshiko Shinohara (net worth of $1.1 billion), who are the first self-made female billionaires in their respective countries. The United States, which boasts the most billionaires in the world, has 74 women billionaires, while Germany and China are a distant second and third with 28 and 23 women billionaires respectively.

This major decision of the companies to boycott advertising with YouTube came after Wall Street Journal found that Google's automated program placed their ads on five videos containing racism, terrorism and other unsavoury contents. Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. All these brands decisions of boycotting YouTube shows that Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos is seriously in question even after the tech giant apologised for the same and announced the steps taken to ensure it doesn't happen again in the future. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a blog post earlier this week. The other companies in the list of boycotting ads with Google include, reported Associated Press. AT&T has gone a step further, as it has not only pulled ads from YouTube but has said that it's effectively pulling ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages According to analysts and experts, if Google fails to attract the advertising clients, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

Maybe you're a fan of Britain's biggest grocer, Tesco? Or perhaps you prefer the budget retailers - Aldi or Lidl - or a posh store like Waitrose. Wherever you shop, there are probably a whole host of reasons, be it location, pricing or your favouring of certain own-brand products. It could, however, come down to supermarket logos. You see, extensive research has discovered the colours of shop logos helps persuade shoppers to head in and fork out hard-earned cash. And, as the Birmingham Mail reports, supermarket logos are certain colours for a VERY good reason. Asda ASDA was formed in 1965 by the merger of Asquiths and Associated Dairies. The merged company was named ASDA Stores Ltd. Initially, the company had an orange logo - as seen below - but the green typeface we have come to know and love was introduced in 1985. Over the years, the logo has become brighter and brighter in its shade - until 2015, when Asda launched an almost lime green version. The rebrand saw the company boast clearer references to parent company Walmart. The changes included the addition of the 'spark' to the top left corner, which is also used by its parent company Walmart. The new green logo in the mid-80s was used to create more upmarket and tastefully decorated stores with soft pastel colour tones, dropped ceilings and zoned areas. Read More This is why Aldi workers scan your shopping so fast at checkouts Sainsbury's Sainsbury's, meanwhile, has always been orange. Ever since the supermarket was first launched, the retailer has used the title "J Sainsbury" with various fascias. But a store in South London began the new-look navy and orange identity and, after it was deemed a success, other supermarkets followed suit. Over time, the navy hue - dubbed "Greenwich Blue", owing to the location which kick-started the brand identity - has been dropped. Interestingly, though, the colour has been met with controversy. Sainsbury's was forced to reconsider plans for a store in a coastal town in Essex after residents voiced their concerns about the firm's orange logo. Frinton-on-Sea has its own shop front design guide , apparently, which states that "colours should be muted". In a marketing experiment which attributed three words to each colour used by prominent companies, orange attracted connotations of "friendly, confidence and cheerful." So that may be why they use it. Tesco Many experts think Sainsbury's used an orange logo to stand out on the high street and in retail parks. Why? Well, because a jaw-dropping 33 per cent of retailers use the colour blue - and 29 per cent use red. One of them to use both, of course, is Tesco. The current version of the Tesco logo was introduced in 1996 The Tesco logo borrows from the basic colors of the British flag. The red colour in the logo represents prosperity and happiness, while the blue colour depicts excellence and trustworthiness. Morrisons (Photo: PA) Morrisons re-launched its logo last year. The new motif features a tree growing out of the letter I, lower case lettering - often perceived to be friendlier - and the words 'Since 1899', the year the supermarket was established. It was tested at a store in Leeds and has now been extended to some Morrisons Local branches. The move followed a similar re-branding in 2007, which saw the company ditch its existing branding and strapline, in favour of a more modern brand image. The rationale behind the decision was the need for Morrisons to attract a wider national customer base, capitalising on its acquisition of Safeway.

That point was driven home by merger talks in recent weeks between Albertsons Cos., the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain, and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc., whose 250-odd stores are known for fresh produce and organic offerings. The preliminary discussions may not lead to a deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. For Albertsons, which may be beefing up ahead of an initial public offering, taking Sprouts private and adding it to the portfolio would mean a deeper push into foods that appeal to a growing segment of shoppers. Longtime staples like cereal and canned soup have struggled as health-conscious consumers pursue less-processed options. That’s pushed organics into the mainstream, with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. expanding into a market long dominated by Whole Foods Market Inc. and other niche stores. Albertsons seems ready to jump deeper into the lettuce patch. “They’re looking to add some sex appeal,” said Roger Davidson, an industry consultant. “A lot of their stores tend to be boring, standard supermarkets. If they don’t do something, they’re going to continue to struggle.” Fresh produce is a draw to brick-and-mortar stores, even as online ordering has devoured swaths of the retail landscape. With Amazon intent on pushing into the business despite its struggles with delivering fresh food, grocers are increasingly focused on the quality of fruits and vegetables. An Albertsons takeover of Sprouts could help convince investors that there’s demand for shares of a giant U.S. grocery chain this year, Davidson said. The company, backed by Cerberus Capital Management LP, operates about 2,300 U.S. stores, including the Shaw’s, Safeway and Acme chains. The company almost went public in 2015 before pulling the IPO because of turbulence in the stock market. The offering has been on hold almost 18 months. Cerberus, which manages more than $30 billion in private-equity holdings, distressed debt, credit assets and real estate, first invested in Albertsons in 2006 and then bought stores in 2013 from Supervalu Inc. Albertsons more than doubled in size in 2014 when it acquired Safeway Inc.in a deal valued at about $9.2 billion. The company has a presence on the East Coast, but its stores are mainly west of the Mississippi River. Sprouts has more than half of its outlets in California and Texas, two of the most competitive U.S. markets. Sprouts is “one of the few high-quality growth platforms remaining in grocery and a concept we believe will continue to take market share,” Chris Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a research note. Winnie Lerner, a spokesman for Albertsons, declined to comment. With the IPO in limbo, Albertsons has struggled to find growth. Food deflation has battered the industry over the past year, weighing down sales and prompting price wars that have eroded profit margins. Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain, in the fourth quarter posted negative same-store sales for the first time in more than a decade. Its shares have plunged 15 percent this year. Albertsons faces pressure from both ends. It needs organics to appeal to more affluent customers concerned with health. But its current stores aren’t quite cheap enough to draw low-end customers who shop at dollar-store chains or Wal-Mart. The price war has gotten even more intense with the German chain Aldi expanding rapidly in the U.S., not to mention the planned arrival of European competitor Lidl this year.

SHARE Your Town, March 26, 2017 By Tammy Gemaehlich Saturday, March 25, 2017 An ode to Kmart. My dear friend … we go way back. We met in the summer of 1980. I was new in town and lived a few blocks away. I had just started my new job in The Daily Sentinel circulation department and needed some office attire, on a very limited budget. You were nearby and had exactly what I needed, thus began a long, enduring friendship. A Gibson’s store was catty-corner from you, in the Red Cliff Pointe Shopping Center, where PartyLand was and now dental offices reside. Gibson’s later moved across the street to the spot where Hobby Lobby was and soon a Planet Fitness will open there. The former Hastings was a Safeway in 1980. Believe it or not, there was a McDonald’s in that parking lot too. Directly eastward was a Furr’s Cafeteria with its long dinner lines snaking out the door. The fried okra was to die for. It’s now A Taste of Heaven Catering. Walmart had only been invented a few years prior and was still a mostly Southern state attraction. In 1980, the now North Avenue Walmart property was a popular drive-in movie theater. During the years I’ve been in Grand Junction, Kmart, you’ve always been there. I pass you every day on the way to work. So much merchandise … so little time. We bought our patio table from you a few years back and overnight, the back yard transformed into a blissful retreat where we listen to chirping birds while sipping morning coffee, and star-gaze in the evenings as a concert of crickets serenades us. My garden frog statue, bought with accumulated Rewards points, greets me when I come up the walk, and you wouldn’t believe the compliments I get when I wear the cardigan I got on clearance a few years ago. This past Christmas, I visited you for some new winter pajamas, and I noticed something was off. Way off. There was so much inventory, carelessly piled about, and I began to wonder if … no! Not you! When official word of your closing came in January, it was a big blow. I’ve tried to visit every few weeks since the news broke but each time I leave, discounted goods in hand, my heart feels heavier. Today is your last day, old friend, and I grieve the ending of our brick-and-mortar friendship. May your blue light never fade. Thanks for the memories. ■ Speaking of memories ... the Montrose High School class of 1967 will have its 50-year reunion Aug. 25-27 in Montrose.

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube -- an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2 million other third-party websites.

Echele uses a wheelchair and has been a greeter at Walmart for 25 years. Firefighters say he’s expressed a great deal of interest in firefighting.  That prompted several of the firefighters to coordinate a surprise with the store’s managers.  They arrived at the Eureka Walmart and made Echele an honorary firefighter, taking him on a ride. “This was amazing,” said Echelle.  “I was shocked.” He was joined on the truck by his mother.  The two were moved to tears over the invitation by firefighters.  The truck traveled to Echele’s neighborhood where he was greeted by some of this neighbors. “I’ve been a fan of the fire service ever since I was a kid and never really outgrew it,” said Echele.  “So, to be able to meet and interact with all these guys is amazing.” “It means a lot to us too,” said Lt. Steve McKinney, Eureka Fire Protection District.  “It’s very important for us to have community members like him backing the Eureka Fire District.” Firefighters say Echele has routinely expressed support for them.  They told him he was welcome to visit their fire station anytime he wants.

Celebrity News 18 0 0 March 26, 2017 How Does Joy-Anna Duggar’s Wedding Registry Compare To Her Sisters’ Registries? Treva Bowdoin Joy-Anna Duggar’s wedding registry has been revealed, and it has one notable thing in common with those of her older sisters. As People reports, 19-year-old Joy-Anna Duggar and 23-year-old Austin Forsyth have created a public wedding registry on Amazon. Their wedding gift wishlist includes a lot of practical household items that many married couples ask for like cookware, kitchen gadgets, linens, and towels. Joy-Anna also learned a valuable lesson from her married sisters: If you add restaurant gift cards to your wedding registry, you’re likely to get them. Joy-Anna Duggar and Austin Forsyth’s wedding registry includes ten $50 gift cards for Red Lobster, Olive Garden, and other Darden restaurants. All 10 of these gift cards have already been purchased, but the couple still needs three of the four $25 Cracker Barrel gift cards that they asked for. Their registry also includes four $25 Panera Bread gift cards. Congratulations to @tlc_countingon‘s #JoyAnnaDuggar & boyfriend Austin Forsyth, who just announced their engagement https://t.co/h8uLJemAaC pic.twitter.com/VUWL3SPfic — ET Canada (@ETCanada) March 3, 2017 Joy-Anna Duggar’s older sisters are also big fans of restaurant gift cards. Jinger did not have any public wedding registries, but Jessa and Jill both made headlines by letting the world see their Amazon registries. Jessa Duggar and her husband, Ben Seewald, were clearly planning on eating out quite a bit while they adjusted to life as a married couple. Their wedding wishlist included gift cards for the following eateries: P.F. Changs, Panera Bread, Buffalo Wild Wings, Subway, Steak ‘N’ Shake, The Cheesecake Factory, Applebee’s, Papa John’s, Starbucks, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Burger King, Domino’s, Cold Stone Creamery, Outback Steakhouse, Bleu Monkey Grill, Chili’s, T.G.I. Friday’s, Ruby Tuesday, Red Robin, Noodles & Company, and Jason’s Deli. Jill Duggar and her husband, Derick Dillard, asked for gift cards for Qdoba Mexican Grill, Papa John’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, P.F. Changs, Domino’s, Panera Bread, and Applebee’s. Joy-Anna Duggar and her sisters likely included so many gift cards on their wedding registries because they’ve discovered that their fans love buying gift cards for them. As In Touch Weekly reports, so many Duggar fans have inquired about sending gift cards to Jessa that she decided to specify which stores she would like to receive gift cards for. “For readers who have asked about sending gift cards to the Seewalds, Jessa told us that her favorite stores are Target and Walmart,” read a 2015 post on the Duggar Family Blog. Jessa also made sure that the cards would end up in the right place by providing fans with an address to send them to. However, the information was deleted after the Counting On star was criticized for trying to get free stuff from her admirers. Jessa Duggar, husband Ben Seewald, kids congratulate sister Joy-Anna Duggar on engagement https://t.co/xq7i0qJUV6 pic.twitter.com/bpELBhvSot — Us Weekly (@usweekly) March 7, 2017 Joy-Anna Duggar hasn’t pulled a Jessa by encouraging fans to buy stuff for her, but perhaps she and Austin Forsyth are hoping that fans will see their public wedding registry and purchase gifts for them. However, it’s unlikely that the couple’s admirers will gift them with the priciest items that they’re asking for: a $600 miter saw, a $450 mixer, a $300 table saw, and a $300 juicer. Unlike Jessa and Jill, Joy-Anna doesn’t want any expensive electronics. Jessa’s registry included a $900 Apple MacBook Air Laptop and an iPad Mini, while Jill asked for an iPad and a $400 Yamaha digital piano. To increase his chances of getting more of the gifts listed on his three different wedding registries, Derick Dillard shared links to them on social media. “In April, Dillard tweeted the link to the couple’s multiple registries at places like Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Walmart,” a 2014 Bustle report reads. “I’m not sure why else he would make that public, unless he was hoping that fans would get the gifts?” Jill (Duggar) Dillard and husband Derick ‘are so happy to be back in Central America!’ https://t.co/sWTF3g1xW4 pic.twitter.com/2l08gJSL6Y — People Magazine (@people) February 28, 2017 Jessa Duggar was also registered at Bed Bath & Beyond, but so far only one registry has been found for Joy-Anna Duggar and Austin Forsyth. The Duggar girls’ registries offer some insight into their different personalities. Joy-Anna is the outdoor lover, asking for gifts like sleeping bags, hiking boots, and camping tents. Jessa is the glamour girl who worries about her image, with E! News reporting that one of her registries included a $140 hair straightener and a Weight Watchers Glass Body Analysis Scale. She also asked for a pink hair dryer, according to Us Weekly. Jill Duggar had the most eclectic wedding registries. According to New York Daily News, she and Derick Dillard asked for guns and ammo, boxes of breakfast cereal, neon-colored duct tape, a Foosball table, a football, and a basketball. One of their registries included instant noodles. What do you think about Joy-Anna Duggar’s wedding registry? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

The rap-obsessed 21-year-old had fired two rounds at the Phi Gamma Delta house before pointing the firearm at fraternity members and pulling the trigger, according to Norman, Oklahoma, police. A 'malfunction' caused the gun to jam, possibly saving the lives of the men, as Valentin fled the scene and was later found dead in an apparent suicide, 100 yards away from the house.  Scroll down for video  Vincent Valentin, 21, was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he allegedly fired shots at Oklahoma University's Phi Gamma Delta house on Wednesday  According to police, the university student drove his pickup truck through the house's backyard fence (pictured) and fired two shots at the building before turning the weapon on fraternity members The gun jammed and Valentin fled the scene on foot. He was later found dead 100 yards away from the Phi Gamma Delta (pictured) house in Norman, Oklahoma  Valentin was a student of the university, studying English. He was an aspiring rapper and producer and obsessed with hip-hop stars such as Lil Wayne, Drake, Future and DJ Metro Boomin. Hours before his death, he tweeted he had let Satan 'reincarnate inside' him, it was 'doomsday' and that because he was bullied, he would have to 'murder everyone'.  Video courtesy of News 9 Oklahoma  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next University of Connecticut forces Delta Gamma and Kappa Sigma...

Share this article Share Valentin had run into trouble with the law previously, including domestic violence issues with an ex-girlfriend, but she didn't want to press charges, reported KFOR.   Before Valentin was seen at the fraternity house, police were alerted to an incident at Walmart around 11pm where Valentin was whacking bushes outside the store with a hatchet, according to a police report. Valentin was an aspiring rapper and producer. He tweeted hours before his death that because he was bullied he would have to 'murder everyone'  The student had also allegedly pulled the firearm on a Walmart employee shortly before he headed to the fraternity house. Norman police recieved a call to that incident around 11pm When a store employee confronted him, the student pointed a gun at the staff member, the report continued.  Shortly after Valentin was reported being at Walmart, police were called to the Phi Gamma Delta house.  Valentin posed with a photo of a gun on March 8 and posted the image to Twitter Valentin allegedly fired two shots at the house, causing members to confront him.  He then pulled the gun on the men but the weapon wouldn't work, according to police.  Norman Police Public Information Officer Sarah Jensen said to KWTV: 'There was some sort of malfunction that prevented the gun from firing, thankfully.'  She added that Valentin threw the hatchet at the fraternity men before fleeing the scene on foot.  Police are still investigating the ties Valentin had with the fraternity. Jensen said: 'We know there was a prior relationship with them, as a group, and there were some issues that had come up and they believe this could have somehow contributed to this incident.'  KFOR reported that Valentin had given the fraternity an one-star ranking on Facebook, a possible clue to how the incident began. A witness told KWTV: 'I heard a loud crash. The guy opened the door and cocked the gun. He started firing the gun into the air.' On Twitter, Valentin posted a photo of himself with a gun on March 8, he caption the photo: '6 God but GS I'm the gun squad'.   Valentin was obsessed with rap and looked up to industry stars such as Drake, Lil Wayne, Future and DJ Metro Boomin Read more: Frat shooting suspect tweets about murder, bullying before OU incident | KFOR.com Police Say Suspect's Gun Jammed In OU Fraternity Shooting - News9.com - Oklahoma City, OK - News, Weather, Video and Sports | Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

I'm trying to move from fast fashion into maintainable-over-years items (as well as figure out this aesthetic) and would love any guidance. I received some great advice re: clothing on the Green just before coming out as a trans woman in 2014. From 2014-2016 I explored a lot of different shades of femme, especially vintage dresses, punky outfits, etc. The bright, expressive aspects of femme presentation were really important to me and got me through a lot of tough situations, but as I've become (way, way) more comfortable in my skin, I find myself settling into a more lowkey femme/tomboyish space and feeling really comfortable about that. But I'm also realizing that much of my wardrobe either doesn't match my style any more, doesn't fit well, or is stuff that is poorly made and deteriorates rapidly. This imgur album is a snapshot of where I'm at right now. My black jacket/hoodie (from Modcloth, pre Walmart acquisition) and the leather boots (Frye Engineer boots) have both lasted almost three years and been wonderful companions/are probably the best example of long-term durable stuff I own. But they kind of nudge my style more in the queer punk direction than I'm feeling these days. I'd like to find more items that are, for example, more suited for hiking and more of an outdoorsy and/or relaxed aesthetic (but more interested in like somewhat fitted women's flannel than oversized menwear, for example). I still want to wear bright colors, but in articles that are comfortable and practical and durable. I have been buying lots of tops from the Gap and Loft but am disappointed with the quality of both of them/keep regretting the things I occasionally buy -- my only plaid right now, the blue from the imgur album, is a Gap top that is already falling apart, for example. I recently picked up the turquoise hoodie and a couple of more durable tops from REI and was super impressed with the quality. I think it's a good place to get more items from, but I want to be more strategic about which types of items to grab from them -- for example, I don't have a vest right now, is REI a good place for that or way overpriced? What about a light/rain jacket? I've always bought pants from the Gap but am interested in getting a new pair from elsewhere -- I haven't actually been able to wear anything other than leggings/sweats for months due to recovering from a surgery, so this is a purchase I'd definitely like to focus on. I guess shorts too, because of summer. Finally, shoes. Oof. I find shoes to be really hard. Any good suggestions for durable but not-entirely-uncute shoes to think about? Any ideas you have at any degree of specificity - specific store for an item, ideas for learning to mend and maintain clothes better, etc - would be lovely. I don't have a big budget, but I feel like if I reframe clothes buying around getting quality, comfortable, durable, well-fitting pieces gradually that will last years it will be more affordable in the end. Thank you! posted by elephantsvanish to Clothing, Beauty, & Fashion (23 answers total) 13 users marked this as a favorite   Have you checked out Patagonia? Very high quality, outdoorsy, women's stuff is feminine cut without being clingy/sexy. Also fair trade and the company has great business practices. I've been really happy with their clothes. I'm wearing a pair of cords from them right now! Not cheap but if you sign up for emails they have a lot of sales. I've been trying to go higher quality, ethical clothes and I feel like they fit the bill. posted by john_snow at 9:16 AM on March 26 [1 favorite] I discovered in the last few years that places like Nordstrom/Bloomingdales/J Crew have a discount cadence that goes full price/40% off/65%+ off. This means I've been able to buy a lot of higher end clothing at Gap prices by putting things on wishlists and then snagging them when then go deep discount. Depending on what size you are, I found that Uniqlo has great prices for shorts and a pretty decent range of lengths - but they run small. My personal style is a little more femme and a little less outdoorsy than yours is, but I have found I got a lot of mileage from coming up with the shapes I want to wear and using them as a template. This year it means I'm wearing a lot of super comfortable and cute Adidas sneakers with flowy skirts and t-shirts or minidresses. If you think about proportion in what you are wearing, that will help allow for more comfort in cute shoes. I wear a lot of sneakers - Asics tigers are one of my favorites for comfort and color range - plus you can find them sometimes very deeply discounted on Amazon. posted by Nimmie Amee at 9:16 AM on March 26 [1 favorite] I basically live in outdoorsy clothes and have moved to investing in higher-quality pieces that look and feel better and last longer. I just got a pretty turquise puffy vest from Patagonia that was so spendy but so cosy and fits nicely (not at all boxy). I would also recommend tops from Smartwool if you don't mind merino- they have bright, pretty colours and also are fitted nicely. For work, I wear Icebreaker skirts & dresses - again, expensive, but I've basically circulated through the same few pieces for years and they've held up beautifully, and also, it feels like wearing sweatpants to work but still professional enough for my very casual office. Also, Ibex has cute tops (again, if you don't mind merino, which obviously I love). All of these are perfectly functional for a hike (well, maybe not the dresses but I have biked and paddled in a Patagonia morning glory dress! I'd recommend that one hands down, except I've heard they've changed the design). For care, I wash all my merino separately with a mild detergent and hang to dry. No issues with fading/shrinkage even with things that are years old and worn often. I hope this helps! posted by bighappyhairydog at 9:29 AM on March 26 [1 favorite] 3rding Patagonia especially because you mentioned maintenance and mending. They have a robust repair program. Well, their maintenance and repair guides are worth bookmarking no matter what brand of clothes you end up getting. REI is great and they sell Prana which is one of my favorite outdoors brands. Some of their clothes look like camping clothes but others just look like... clothes. Like I have the Halle pants which are a little more hiking-looking but I also have the Brenna pants that just look like skinny jeans. And I find with a lot of the outdoorsy brands you can pick and choose this way too--they have some t-shirts with hippie prints or skirts with technical details, but they also have stuff that looks more basic, and you can mix and match however you want. I also really like Athleta, which is a Gap company but higher quality in my experience, but a lot of their clothes lean a little more urban/athleisure as opposed to rugged/outdoorsy. But for example, they have great skirts that don't look too girly/feminine so they go really well with the Prana/REI brands. posted by mama casserole at 9:39 AM on March 26 Queer femme here. Most of my outdoorsy clothes come from Ibex, REI (check sales and outlet), Eddie Bauer, or Lands End. Title 9 is another great place to look, especially for dresses. My lazy femme look is usually jeans/tshirt /hoodie, with sneakers or boots, but t-shirt femme cut and often brightly colored. posted by gingerbeer at 9:43 AM on March 26 [1 favorite] My favorite fitted women's flannel of late has come from J Crew/Madewell (their frequent extra 40% off sale promotions make it surprisingly cheap, and if you're a student or teacher you can get an extra 10% off in store), and LL Bean's signature line. For a long time, all of the women's clothing at Bean's was pretty much just pink versions of their men's clothing, and the fits were awful, but the signature line is actually flattering and seems (so far) to be quite well-made and durable. It's a little pricy, but their guarantee is fantastic. Jeans and shorts are tough because so much depends on your shape--I buy most of mine at Madewell, and they're pretty durable but they fit really differently than any I've tried at the Gap. If you're at all into thrifting, though, good shorts are surprisingly easy to thrift (unlike jeans). Wolverine's line of 1000 mile boots are just as durable as they say, and mostly very cute, but also stupid expensive. I bought mine on sale online, and paid around $150, rather than the $500 they're supposed to cost. Perhaps worth looking around for a sale? posted by dizziest at 9:48 AM on March 26 What is your shoe budget and what is your shoe size? I am an AFAB person with big-feet-for-an-AFAB person, and for many years, long before I switched to men's clothes, I wore the cuter kind of men's shoes because of quality and fit. (So littler shoes rather than chunky ones, shoes with broguing or other cute details, shoes in colors rather than black, etc. In general, people did not know that these were men's shoes.) When I get new shoes, I often get them from Yoox, which stocks, basically, small Italian brands. Quality varies widely and the search function is sort of meh, but if you keep an eye out for sales, things can be quite cheap. (Don't pay full price on there.) I think I got some women's shoes in a 42 once, too. So I have a pair of shoes sort of like these that would be pretty cute with skirts and tights, I have a pair of high quality blue suede chelsea boots that I got on clearance for $78, etc. They also tend to have fashion-y/cute Italian sneakers. I second the Wolverine 1000 mile recommendation with additional suggestions: Sometimes Sierra Trading Post has irregular ones; it's worth checking out eBay for these; and if you do get a pair and will be wearing them in wet or snowy weather, it is worthwhile to get a cobbler to put on a sole cover. Wet weather will weaken the leather soles and they will wear away sooner. This is true of all leather-soled shoes. Also, if you get a pair of boots or shoes that you like but that does not have a rugged sole, you can have a cobbler put on a thicker, chunkier sole cover. This won't transform a summer shoe into a winter boot, but I often do this with dressier boots with smooth soles so that I can wear them in icy winter conditions. posted by Frowner at 10:14 AM on March 26 [1 favorite] Shoes: how do you feel about Chacos? These are the standard summer shoe among outdoorsy women I know. They're expensive for sandals, but I wear mine for pretty much six months straight (hiking in them sometimes) and they're ten years old and probably okay for another year-ish. Also, 2nding Sierra Trading Post for outdoorsy clothes at a discount. The selection is variable and it's worth paying attention to the reviews, some stuff winds up on discount for a reason. They do have regular sales and shipping deals and a decent return policy. posted by momus_window at 10:37 AM on March 26 (A quick point of clarification - women's shoes have always driven me nuts because "cute" and "durable" are pretty much in opposition. This is what originally, lo these many years ago, drove me to wear Italian men's shoes, which tend to be as durable as usual men's shoes but not drab and blah. In fact, if you're looking for cute flats, you can often find Italian men's loafers in colorful suedes, etc, that are functionally indistinguishable from women's but don't, like, fall apart in the rain.)) posted by Frowner at 10:39 AM on March 26 Also - and sorry for so many posts - I forgot about Camper shoes. I don't know what your definition of cute and sporty is, but I feel like they have some particularly cute and sporty shoes this season, like these fuschia nubuck oxfords, this bright royal blue riff on a sports sandal, the maroon slightly dressed up hiking boots, the minimalist sneakers with the multicolored soles, etc. They have a really good range this spring, although to my mind the better styles are further down the page. I used to get Camper shoes years ago and the quality is good. You can sometimes find them on sale at Nordstrom Rack or Yoox, and the sizing is very consistent as long as you know your European size. posted by Frowner at 11:00 AM on March 26 [1 favorite] I dress a lot like you and my wardrobe is almost exclusively from Eddie Bauer. posted by BrashTech at 11:09 AM on March 26 For summer shoes, I'd recommend the old queer lady classic: Birkenstocks! Super comfy, durable, and repairable. I'm also too femme for the standard Arizonas, and I find if you go to a shop that specializes, or look online, there are lots of cute options. Many people like the ones with the toe post. I have a pair of the Larisa model, which I like because you can mix it up occasionally by removing the t-strap. posted by snorkmaiden at 11:25 AM on March 26 Keen for shoes. Sandalis for cute yet functional sandals. Order now they take 4-6 weeks but they come in sizes 35-48 or something like that. And are much, much better quality than you'll find in stores. If you have small enough feet you can get a ton of feminized versions of classics like Chacos, Birkenstocks etc which are basically just like the mens but the straps are more decorative. And I don't know how tall you are but some of the brands here make all their womens clothes in teeny-short (Smartwool, Ibex, Prana). I don't know anyone over about 5'4" or maybe 5'6" who buys their stuff regularly. Clothing that more comfortably fit tall and broad shouldered women but have the same vibe are Mountain Hardware, Eddie Bauer tall, REI tall, Athleta tall, Champion, Nike, Backcountry's namebrand line (they keep changing the name but it's BC or Stoic usually) and Big Agnes (which is not a plus sized line). Patagonia, ArcTeryx etc are hit and miss for me, usually I have to size up to get stuff to fit and it's not always comfortable to wear. posted by fshgrl at 11:42 AM on March 26 [1 favorite] Love your style! I like a skinny jean and I've been happy with these Rohan jeans for a skinny jean look that I can wear hiking and such. Their other clothes are cute too, made of functional fabrics, and often on sale. posted by a sourceless light at 12:53 PM on March 26 And I don't know how tall you are but some of the brands here make all their womens clothes in teeny-short (Smartwool, Ibex, Prana). I don't know anyone over about 5'4" or maybe 5'6" who buys their stuff regularly. I'm the one who mentioned Prana, I'm 5'9" and even wear their regular length pants (granted I have a long torso and I never wear shoes with any sort of heel). Their regular inseam is 32" and they also offer many of their pants in tall lengths which is 36". Athleta has talls too. posted by mama casserole at 1:20 PM on March 26 Aesthetically I came in to suggest Eddie Bauer, and as far as hard-wearing basics that seems to have not totally abandoned its reputation for durability, L.L. Bean. I have literally never had to let go of an L.L. Bean item because it wore out...only because I was fucking tired of it after 10 or 15 years. posted by drlith at 1:22 PM on March 26 [2 favorites] Also, don't be afraid to check out eBay once you get a sense of the brands you like if you're looking for a sweet spot between price and durability. posted by drlith at 1:29 PM on March 26 ahhhh this is so helpful!! just wanted to quickly add my height: I'm 5'11". I don't own many specifically Tall items, but am frequently dancing on the edge/have had several tops shrink past the point of wearability, unfortunately. but yay so many ideas! posted by elephantsvanish at 1:38 PM on March 26 Sierra Trading Post ftw; through them and 6pm I've discovered the same thing, that clothes made by brands that focus on hiking/outdoorsy pursuits is almost shockingly well made in comparison to gap&etc crap and though the price point is high it's made up for in construction and style. My favorite brands that I now scope out sales for are Aventura, Royal Robbins, Prana, Fossil, GH Bass, Lucky, Neon Buddha, Woolrich. Royal Robbins especially does awesome colors and patterns in durable fabrics and good construction techniques with an eye for feminine detail without resorting to cliche. GH Bass does great shoes with a history of colorful gender neutral footwear that they usually live up to. Fossil's got a bajillion and one accessories that are classic and functional but they also do a few totally goofy cute things a season that are just adorable but won't disintegrate if rained on. Lucky does a huge range but if you can filter by fabric content their things made of linen cotton silk & other natural fibers are durable but with lovely patterns and generous cuts, and you can find a lot on deep discount at department stores and outlets. Woolrich outerwear is incredible and their stuff is made to last. posted by Mizu at 4:55 PM on March 26 Your favorite outfit looks pretty much just like mine and I buy most of my shirts at J Crew. posted by potrzebie at 6:36 PM on March 26 Also, Jane is adorable. At least her feet are! posted by gingerbeer at 9:56 PM on March 26 Eddie Bauer, definitely. Quality is generally pretty good, and they have a lifetime guarantee on their clothing, so if an item goes crappy/shrinks beyond wearability/whatever after a few washes, you can take it in to any Eddie Bauer store and they'll take care of you. Try their tall sizes. It's a revelation if you've been wearing things that are *a bit* short your entire life. (I'm 6'1" and 35 years old, and didn't start buying talls until my early 30s.) posted by nosila at 12:54 PM on March 27 [1 favorite] > just wanted to quickly add my height: I'm 5'11".

I'm 5' 10" and am outdoorsy and I'm wearing my new DuluthFlex Fire Hose Slim Leg Cargo Pants right now and I love them so much that I USE CAPS TO TALK ABOUT THEM.

Opinion Viewpoints Death penalty opponent should quit as prosecutor | Opinion Jac Wilder VerSteeg State Attorney says her office won't seek death penalty Privacy Policy I have two words for all those who are praising Aramis Ayala, the newly elected state attorney in Orange and Osceola counties, for announcing that her office will not seek the death penalty against any defendants in her jurisdiction: Kim Davis. Davis is the clerk in Rowan County, Ky., who decided that her office would not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that such couples have a constitutional right to get married, Davis said that signing licenses would force her to violate her religious faith. Davis defied a court order requiring her to sign the licenses and went to jail for contempt of court. Here are two more words: Roy Moore. Moore is that Alabama Supreme Court chief justice who was removed for telling that state's probate judges to ignore federal rulings on same-sex marriage. Moore previously had been kicked off the bench for refusing to remove a huge sculpture of the Ten Commandments from the judicial building.

The Sun Sentinel Editorial Board discuss a bill that will require elementary school students to have 20 minutes a day of recess. It's a safe bet that a lot of people who like the stance that State Attorney Ayala has taken did not like what Clerk Davis and Justice Moore did. And vice-versa. Yet it seems to me the principle is the same. If you are a public official whose personal beliefs conflict with your ability to fulfill the legal requirements of your job, then you should quit. Ayala's decision was controversial because under normal circumstances her office would prosecute Markeith Loyd, who is charged in the recent murder of Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton and Loyd's pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon. According to news accounts, Lt. Clayton had approached Loyd outside a Walmart. Loyd shot her once, then stood over her and kept firing. He is charged with murdering Dixon several weeks earlier. When Ayala said she wouldn't seek the death penalty, an outraged Gov. Rick Scott took the case away from Ayala's office and assigned it to Lake County State Attorney Brad King. I believe there are crimes for which the death penalty is appropriate. Those include treason, mass murder and other particularly heinous crimes. Killing a pregnant woman and executing a police officer would qualify. That said, death penalty opponents raise compelling objections. The advent of DNA evidence has proved that juries, more frequently than any of us suspected, can convict the wrong person. It also seems beyond dispute that the death penalty is sought and imposed in ways unfair to minority defendants. Such arguments against the death penalty are gaining ground in public opinion. But they have not yet led Florida's Legislature to outlaw capital punishment. Courts have forced the state to add safeguards — such as the recent revision requiring a unanimous jury recommendation before imposing a death sentence — but they have not declared the death penalty unconstitutional. So the death penalty remains legal in Florida, and state attorneys have a duty to seek it in appropriate cases. Ayala can't claim the voters who elected her support her no-capital-punishment stance because she did not run on that issue. You could argue there might be no harm done since Scott quickly reassigned the case to King. But Ayala is challenging his authority to do so. King has not said whether he would seek the death penalty for Loyd. He gives every indication that, if he keeps the case, he will make that decision only after giving it the serious consideration it deserves. But if King is allowed to handle the case, seeks the death penalty and gets it, won't Loyd argue that Scott stacked the deck against him? That argument would be bolstered if the transfer to King is approved but the governor does not bring in outside prosecutors in every case that conceivably could merit the death penalty. If the governor does not or cannot, there would be some murderers in Orange and Osceola Counties that do not face capital punishment while Loyd does. That imposes a different and unfair standard on Loyd. In essence, Ayala's decision has given Loyd a defense against capital punishment ever being imposed. That could add years of public expense to an inevitable appeal and inflict heightened anguish on the victims' surviving family. If Ayala — or Davis or Moore or any other public official — wants to take a stand on principle, that can be admirable. But if your principles won't let you do your public job, then quit.

Penney There's something to be said for being the last man (or store) standing. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Mar 26, 2017 at 8:00AM The financial resurrection of J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) has been nothing short of remarkable. As sales went into free fall in 2012, the retailer's demise seemed imminent, but with the departure of CEO Ron Johnson, the company managed to survive. And though it may not be thriving, the department store chain is certainly much better off today than just a few years ago. However, 2017 is looking to be another difficult year for retail. But as they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and that could be especially applicable to J.C. Penney. Image source: Getty Images. Malls are becoming ghost towns Like ailing rivals Macy's (NYSE:M) and Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), which has accelerated its collapse with numerous self-inflicted wounds, J.C. Penney faces major retail headwinds. One one hand, off-price retailers are siphoning customers away, and on the other, e-commerce continues to grab market share. Many retailers have realized that traditional malls will not be seeing a rebound, thus beginning the process of closing down stores. Macy's, for example, closed 66 locations last year and plans to close 34 more in the future. It currently has 700 stores in operation, down from 840 just five years ago.   Sears is an even worse position and reduced its store count by 242 last year, bringing the total to 1,430 locations -- five years ago, it had over 4,000 stores. Other retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target have either announced store closings or are reducing their square footage by investing in smaller formats. Although J.C. Penney resisted calls to follow suit with its own closures, even management realized there were no other options. Last month, the company announced it would close almost 140 stores, or about 14% of its base, by June, giving it about 900 remaining locations. Image source: J.C. Penney. A retail apocalypse Consumers just aren't shopping at malls the way they used to. According to data compiled by the industry watchers at ShopperTrak, retail store foot traffic has plunged 57% between 2010 and 2015, and real estate research firm CoStar says annual department store retail sales have tumbled 28% since their peak in 1999. It estimates nearly one billion square feet of retail space will need to be "rationalized" over the next few years. The decline in shopper traffic can be seen in just how many mall-based retailers are downsizing or have declared bankruptcy in the past year alone. The Limited went under this past January, while Aeropostale, American Apparel, Pacific Sunwear, and others failed last year. According to the The Deal, "The number of large-liability retail Chapter 11 filings (at least $250 million in liabilities) nearly doubled in 2016 and that trend shows no signs of slowing down." Indeed, Moody's has warned that some 19 retailers are at risk of defaulting on their loans, including Sears, True Religion, Nine West, Gymobree, and more. Fashion retailer Bebe just announced it was closing all 170 of its stores, transitioning to an online-only model as a means of staving off bankruptcy. Giving customers what they want This is why J.C. Penney's pain might not stop with the store closures it recently announced. The retailer is scrambling to adapt to how consumers now shop and look for products. For example, it found that one of the top things people searched for on its website was appliances, so it is adding them to more of its stores. Image source: J.C. Penney. The company also announced that it is expanding home services offerings for homeowners looking to remodel and upgrade their homes. It will partner with companies like Trane and Samsung as a middleman for homeowners seeking out heating and cooling systems, bathroom remodeling, whole home water solutions, smart home devices, and more. It used to provide such services to customers, and reentering the market lets it further diversify away from apparel. And as a smaller retailer focused on the home, it has the potential to come out on top if companies like Sears do go under. The old-line retailer is still a force in the appliance business, for instance, even though it has lost significant ground to competitors. But J.C. Penney could pick up those customers if Sears goes bankrupt as many suspect will happen soon. J.C. Penney has also shored up its balance sheet, but after a less-than-stellar Christmas shopping season, the business is not where management wants it to be. Still, with the future looking bleak for many of its financially weaker rivals, J.C. Penney may turn out to be one of the last major department stores standing. If that proves to be the case, investors can expect better times ahead. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Moody's.

Officers arrived at the Wal-Mart in the 4900 block of Garth Road around 12:40 a.m. Monday after reports of two small children left alone in the store's parking lot. Investigators said the children, ages 1 year and 3 months old, were fastened into car seats while sitting in a red Ford pick up truck with the windshields and engine running. Police reached out to the stores managers, who had store employees attempt to find the owners of the truck. Investigators said the couple emerged from the store carrying groceries about 20 minutes into the search. The couple approached the officers and identified themselves as the children's parents, 18-year-old Verenice Moran and 23-year-old Yonatan Vazquez. The parents claim they were inside the store for about 15 minutes, but police said it was at least 40 minutes. Moran and Vazquez were arrested and taken to the Baytown Jail. Meanwhile, their children were given to a family member. The Harris County District Attorney’s Office has charged the couple with abandoning or endangering a child.

Here are other cases of foreign objects in food that prompted recalls.   ( Joe Raedle | Getty Image ) Advertisement Oklahoma-based OK Food, Inc., which produces ready-to-eat-chicken including Wal-Mart's Great Value brand, issued a recall of nearly 1 million pounds of its breaded chicken following reports from consumers of metal objects found inside the meat. Inspection at the processing plant revealed that the objects were from a metal conveyor belting. No case of injury or illness from eating the product has been reported so far but five customers have filed complaints. "The problem was discovered on March 21, 2017 after OK Foods Inc. received five consumer complaints stating that metal objects were found in the ready-to-eat chicken products and by FSIS inspection personnel during verification activities," the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said in a statement. It isn't the first time that a foreign object has been found inside food. Several food companies have also issued recalls because of potentially dangerous foreign objects that are in (or possibly got into) their food products. Glass Fragments Glass fragments appear to commonly contaminate and pose potential safety concerns for packaged food and beverage products. In January this year, for instance, glass hazards prompted one of the largest craft brewers in the   United States to issue a recall of some of its bottled beer. Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., recalled the products as a precautionary measure because the packaging flaw can potentially cause injury to its consumers. In April last year, the Food and Drug Administration warned consumers that there may be shards of glass in 8-ounce jars of All Nice! sliced peaches and mixed fruits that were distributed at Walgreens store. The contaminants could cut or injure consumers if ingested. Sweet Leaf Tea Company also recalled bottles of tea products in 2015 over concerns that a glass breakage incident that occurred during a filling process may have entered some of the bottled products. Plastic Pieces In November 2015, Campbell Soup Company also recalled some of its SpaghettiOs Original cans because the affected products have tiny red plastic pieces inside it. The plastic pieces came from some parts of the can's lining. Metal Shavings A month prior to Campbell's recall, Hormel Foods also announced removing some of its Skippy peanut butter from store shelves because of the possibility that some jars have small metal shavings that were detected through a magnet check during routine cleaning. Wood Materials Huisken Meat Company also recalled some of its Sam's Choice Black Angus Vidalia Onion items over concerns that they have wood materials that came from an ingredient and was found during production. Between 1972 and 1997, the Health Hazard Evaluation Board of the FDA evaluated about 190 cases of sharp or hard foreign objects in food. While these objects pose risks, certain objects rarely cause serious damage. "The Board found that foreign objects that are less than 7 mm, maximum dimension, rarely cause trauma or serious injury except in special risk groups such as infants, surgery patients, and the elderly," the FDA said. "Hard or sharp natural components of a food ( e.g. bones in seafood, shell in nut products) are unlikely to cause injury." TAG Food, food recall © 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

(ADR) (RHHBY) Stock Is Weathering the Healthcare Storm Is Realty Income Corp (O) the Best REIT Right Now? View All Posts Kroger Co’s (NYSE:KR) numbers are very impressive. It’s the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., which breaks down to about 2,800 grocery stores, 1,400 fuel centers, 785 convenience stores and 350 cheese shops in 35 states and the District of Columbia. Last year, it did $115 billion in sales. Source: Nicholas Eckhart via Flickr (Modified) To keep this operation going is no simple task. The grocery business is a notoriously low-margin business. Given the energy costs associated with keep food frozen or fresh or refrigerated properly, as well as having big, well-lit stores that are constantly being stocked, it’s hard to imagine how smaller chains can even exist nowadays without the economies of scale the big stores — Safeway Inc (NYSE:SWY) or Publix Super Markets Inc (OTCMKTS:PUSH) for example — have. But the biggest number that has hit KR prices recently is a fraction: -0.7%. That is the same-store sales growth reported earlier this month. Since the report, the stock has lost about 12%. KR Stock in Trouble? Analysts have been concerned that increasing competition and newer competitors like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) are going to start to hurt KR’s business. And this number is a reflection that their fears are now being realized. Another concern has been the stock’s 22% slide over the past 12 months. But the former concern over market share has had the latter effect on the stock. These are not observational concerns, the performance simply demonstrates the abstract concern. It also has been hurt by investors either looking for bigger dividend yields or sexier growth stocks. The fact is, the grocery store sector has been very competitive (if unsexy) for more than two decades, and KR stock has been a winner over this major transition, not a loser. And Kroger is not sitting around, waiting for its competitors to set the challenges for it. KR stock is an innovator and it’s continuing to improve its brands as well as its market share. Along with that -0.7% number, there were also some very positive signs in the Q4 numbers. For example, total sales increased 5.5%, above analysts’ expectations. Profits for the quarter were also above expectations. Another reason the grocery chain’s same store sales aren’t as impressive as you may expect is, they took 35 of their best performing stores out of their list as they upgrade and renovate them. This has been going on for the past 12 months. And oddly enough, it was expected to hit same store sales by — drumroll please — 0.7%. The point is, there is plenty to like about KR stock, and right now, it’s a bargain for long-term investors looking for a rock-solid company that provides a safe, if uncompelling, dividend.

This time, though, it seems federal authorities have been complicit. Recently, federal authorities in Brazil announced they would investigate several companies, including meatpacking giants JBS and BRF S.A. These companies are accused of bribing licensed inspectors to approve rotten meat products for international sale and export. Given that not only companies but also government are allegedly involved, this has the potential to become one of the worst food-fraud scandals in modern times. The investigation, dubbed Operation Weak Flesh, began more than two years ago, and is still not finished. More than 40 companies and several bureaucrats are involved. This is a textbook case of economically motivated food adulteration. Various animal parts were used as substitutes for more expensive ingredients or products. Any suspicious smells were allegedly camouflaged through the use of acid, a food-safety nightmare. It appears these products were delivered to schools, hospitals and other institutions. Even Wal-Mart is a buyer and has requested an explanation about the risks involved. As we often see in food-fraud cases, every company involved, including JBS and BRF S.A., is denying all allegations. Brazilian meat-product exports account for well over $14 billion annually and are distributed to many parts of the world, including Asia and Europe. With this scandal, that figure could decrease significantly. Shares of both JBS and BRF S.A. decreased in value by 10 per cent over a few days. Given the current political and economic climate in Brazil, this could not have happened at a worse time. The economy is going through one of the deepest depressions in its history. The scandal will not only affect Brazil, but strikes yet another blow to the global livestock industry. It will give more ammunition to those opposing the industrialization of agriculture and the perceived undesirable role of agribusinesses. Increasingly, consumers in the industrialized world are reducing their intake of animal protein. Nonetheless, firms in the agrifood sector do exist to make our food systems more efficient, and food more affordable. Society has benefited from the role of corporations in the sector, whether we realize it or not. Ethics must play a key part in safeguarding the moral contract the industry has with citizens. Even if most companies operate by upholding shared values with consumers, there are those who spoil it for everyone else, which is shameful. Policies are there to protect the public, but ill-designed regulations can also often lead to market failures, compounding the fallout. In Brazil, licensed companies have a direct influence over who can inspect their facilities. Inspectors are only human, and can therefore be morally compromised. Encouraging whistle-blowing as a solution is both difficult and a recipe for a disaster. Had a proper regulatory framework been in place, this latest Brazilian scandal could, in all probability, have been prevented. Ironically, JBS operates the same plant involved in the infamous XL Foods recall in 2012, in Brooks, Alta. At the time, Canadian inspectors were not diligent enough and were not asking the company to make proper changes, where it had been found in breach of federal regulations. Maintenance was frequently deferred. Sound familiar? We did learn from the XL Foods incident and made changes to how we manage our inspection force. Interestingly, though, JBS bought the plant while the recall investigation was ongoing. This speaks to the culture of the industry, driven by unmeasured egotism and pride. It took decades for Brazil to convince the world its meat products were worthy of consideration. Operation Weak Flesh, however, could destroy this reputation. This scandal has impelled some countries to call for sanctions on Brazilian meat products, with some already implemented. Canada, as one of Brazil’s main competitors in the livestock industry, will likely gain from all of this. Canadian ranchers are aware that they could reap benefits from Brazil’s controversy. But let’s hope arrogance won’t make our sector complacent again, as we saw with mad-cow disease back in 2003. If nothing else, we must learn from what has happened in Brazil. Our own livestock and meat scandals in Canada were a cakewalk compared to what is going on in Brazil. But with food fraud, given how complicated these cases can be, we can never be too careful.   Sylvain Charlebois is a professor of food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

By Eric Uhlfelder Biography August 24, 2013 July Hedge Funds: Best, Worst, Biggest Mariko Gordon recently set a personal record: She passed through five airports in a single day. A stickler for detail and a believer in active money management, Gordon spends a lot of time checking out companies firsthand, usually working 12 hours a day, six days a week. She's a veritable whirling dervish, trying to keep pace with the stocks of small, striving companies that tend to move around as much as she does.. Thankfully, the ones Gordon has put in her firm's portfolios usually move up in price, as evident in the extraordinary results she has racked up since she started Daruma Capital Management 18 years ago. Between July 1995 and this past July—with just three down years—Daruma's Small-Cap Composite portfolio's annualized rate of return has been 13.06%, 4.4 percentage points a year better than its benchmark, the Russell 2000 (see table, Leaving Its Benchmark in the Dust). Most of the money Daruma handles is in separately managed accounts. The strong, long-term results have helped push Daruma's total assets to $2.2 billion, which also includes a three-year-old $118 million small/mid-cap portfolio and the two-year-old Daruma Ginkgo fund, a $335 million hedge vehicle that gives smaller investors lower-cost access to the same portfolio. Ginkgo investors can choose a flat 1% annual management fee or a 0.75% fee plus 10% of the amount by which the fund beats the index (if it does). It has a $1 million minimum. Enlarge Image Close Gordon's small-cap portfolios contain just two- or three-dozen names. A favorite is Insulet. Matthew Furman Gordon, 51, credits her success to a fascination with how businesses work, a passion she developed while living over her parents' Hertz rent-a-car franchise in Pointe-à-Pitre, the economic capital of the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. "Between the time I was 2 up until I was 10," she recalls, "I would watch my parents work and wanted to learn what they were doing all day." Hardwork and ambition are family traits. Her mother's family emigrated from Okinawa in Japan to Hawaii to work on a plantation, ultimately buying a farm there, and her paternal grandfather rose from messenger to partner at a Wall Street brokerage firm. These examples led Gordon to emphasize management skills in rating stocks. After graduating with a literature degree from Princeton, she started out crunching numbers for New York asset manager Manning & Napier. She refined her focus by joining small-cap investor Chuck Royce in the late 1980s, after he had adopted a value orientation at Royce & Associates. He gave her a chance to manage a portfolio and taught her how to "cross-examine management." But where Royce liked to own hundreds of stocks, Gordon "preferred the thrill of watching over a small number of positions." So when she started Daruma (the Japanese name of the founder of Zen Buddhism) in New York, she was bent on running a concentrated portfolio of 25 to 35 companies. This approach demands discipline because every position must carry its own weight. Gordon's eight-person investment team searches for small-cap domestic companies whose business models are both efficient and easy to understand. The group not only seeks solid management but industry-pricing power. A value investor, it looks for opportunities in misunderstood, beaten-down stocks, where there's upside potential of at least 50% within two years.

People with Type 1 diabetes can stick it on their skin (like a nicotine patch) to receive three days of insulin. Being the first to market gives the firm a distinct advantage in potentially serving a large segment of the 1.5 million Americans with the disease. This spring, Gordon saw a buying opportunity when Insulet shares fell to $25 because of the Food and Drug Administration's protracted approval process of the OmniPod at the same time the company was trying to cope with the hefty expense of shifting production and marketing focus from a bigger pump to the smaller version. With FDA approval now secured, Gordon thinks the OmniPod will push Insulet into the black by the end of this year, with revenue growth averaging 20% a year. As demand grows, the smaller system will enjoy lower production costs, helping drive gross margins from 44% in 2012 to the mid-60s in 2016. In early August, the stock topped $30, and Gordon expects it to hit $38 by 2015. Of course, not every Daruma investment works out so well.

Digital Trends Home > Deals > Take pictures in 4K with the Panasonic Lumix… Take pictures in 4K with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K, now $560 from Walmart By Lucas Coll — March 24, 2017 1:03 PM Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: If you’re in the market for a compact digital camera, Walmart has the high-end Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K on offer for a 30 percent discount, which brings the price down to $560. The DMC-LX100K shoots photos and video in 4K Ultra HD and earned the Reader’s Choice Award from Digital Photography Review in 2014 with reviewers naming it the best high-end compact digital camera released that year. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K packs a cropped 13-megapixel Four Thirds sensor which lets this little camera punch well above its weight when it comes to power and image quality. The 24-75mm F1.7-2.8 Leica DC lens provides a shallow depth of field and makes it easy to achieve artistic bokeh effects which create a defocused blur around the subject of your photo. The eye-level 2,764-dot Live View Finder ensures picture stability and color clarity, while the Eye Sensor AF and Depth from Defocus functions rapidly focus the lens for quick point-and-shoot photo-taking in virtually any environment. More: Panasonic’s LX100 is a 4K pocket rocket with the heart of a bigger camera Along with still photographs, the DMC-LX100K can record up to 15 minutes of continuous 4K Ultra HD video and can take pictures or film in three different aspect ratios — 16:9, 4:3, or 3:2 — with a quick adjustment of the lens barrel. Video can also be recorded in 1080p for up to 30 minutes if desired. Manually operated rings and dials for adjusting zoom, focus, aperture, exposure, and shutter speed give you precise control of your photography. The camera features a 3-inch 921k-dot rear monitor on the backside and comes with an external flash attachment. The current lowest price from other retailers for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K is around $700 but the sleek black model is available from Walmart for just $560 for a limited time. For professional and hobbyist photographers alike who are looking for a digital 4K camera that can fit in a pocket, the DMC-LX100K packs big power in a small 4.5-inch package. Buy it from Walmart for $560

The company's shares slid more than 12% in afternoon trading Friday. GameStop reported a 13.6% drop in global sales to $3.05 billion compared to a year ago. The company blamed weak sales of certain blockbuster games during the holiday period and "aggressive console promotions" from its competitors. The company saw a 29% drop in new hardware sales while new software sales fell by 20%. GameStop's struggles with video game sales come as the company faces increased competition from competitors such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. In addition, more players are purchasing games online, whether for traditional consoles or for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. While video game sales fell, Gamestop reported a 44% sales increase in its Technology Brands business, which includes cellphone retailers such as Spring Mobile. The company's Collectibles business also saw growth of 28% due to strong interest in Pokémon merchandise. Another possible boon for the company is the release of the Nintendo Switch, which GameStop indicates has continued to sell out since launch. The company also expressed enthusiasm for Microsoft's upcoming Project Scopio console. While the company intends to close the doors of some of its video game stores, GameStop plans to open 65 Technology Brands stores and 35 Collectibles stores this year.

"A week after Google apologized for running customers' advertisements alongside objectionable videos, triggering a change in policy, its YouTube site is still rife with examples that are angering more big advertisers and causing some to cut spending with the tech giant," reports the Dow Jones Newswire. Reporters from the Wall Street Journal spotted ads from Microsoft, Amazon, and Procter & Gamble appearing on hate videos -- and thus indirectly funding them. An anonymous reader quotes their report: Asked about the Journal's finding that their ads were still appearing with such content on YouTube as of Thursday night, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dish Network Corp. said Friday they were suspending spending on all Google advertising except targeted search ads. Starbucks Corp. and General Motors Co. said they were pulling their ads from YouTube. FX Networks, part of 21st Century Fox Inc., said it was suspending all advertising spending on Google, including search ads and YouTube. Wal-Mart said: "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values." An executive at one of the affected companies complained that Google "had assured us over the past few days that our brands were safe from this type of content. Despite their assurances, it's clear they couldn't give assurance." google youtube advertising ← Related Links → SAS Mocked For Recommending 60% Proprietary Software, 40% Open Source YouTube Says Content Owners Made $1B Last Year -- So Music Labels Should Stop Complaining Google To Revamp Policies, Hire Staff After UK Ad Scandal YouTube Loses Major Advertisers Over Offensive Videos Terrifying Anti-Riot Vehicle Created To Quash Any Urban Disturbance Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos More | Reply Login Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Washington Center. It is for young people from age 15 to 25 who are looking for jobs. Many prospective employers were represented at the event, including Walmart, Country Fair, Splash Lagoon, and educational institutions like Edinboro and Mercyhurst Universities and Triangle Tech. There were also orientation classes and mock interviews to teach young people how to prepare for an interview. "My thought is if you keep the kids busy, you'll keep them out of trouble," said Sonya Arrington, MATV founder. "By providing them with a job, it not only helps them, but it helps the household. It will also teach them responsibility and giving back to the community. Whatever I can do to help these kids stay out of trouble, that's what I try to do it." In all, 15 vendors were there. Some students were hired on the spot, especially for summer jobs.

Here we’ll explore each factor and its impact on keyword value. Let’s get to it! The 3 Components To Keyword Research Component #1: Search Volume How often is your keyword searched? Valuable keywords are frequently searched. The greater the search volume, the more traffic the keyword can bring. Use Google’s Keyword Planner to estimate search volume. Enter your target keyword, its variations, plurals, and other related keywords. Estimate the amount of traffic your site would get if you ranked for each keyword and its variations. If you target “denver chairs” you’re also targeting “chairs denver”, “chairs in denver,” and maybe even “denver chairs store.” Why? These searches yield similar search engine results. With one web page, you can target multiple related keywords if they fall under a single topic. Include all variations and document your search volumes in a table. Target Keyword Search Volume Notes Chairs Chairs - 110,000 Seats - 33,100 Note: When you search Google for “chairs” you find nothing for “seats.” For this reason, don’t include “seats” in your search volume. Chairs Denver Chairs Denver - 10 Denver chair - 40 Include all variations! Barstools Denver Bar stools Denver - 480 Denver barstools - 30 Apparently “bar stools” is more frequently searched than “barstools.” Sofa Denver Sofa Denver - 210 Denver sofa - 70 Now that we’ve got an idea of search frequency, let’s move on to component #2. Component #2: Competition Which domains rank for your target keyword? If your competition is Wikipedia, Best Buy, and WalMart, your chances for success are slim to none. Compare your domain authority using MozBar (it’s free) with websites that rank on the first page for your keyword. When you activate the MozBar plugin, search Google for your keyword, and the search engine results page (SERP) will look like this. Is there room for your domain? If your website’s domain authority is 5, don’t target keywords that are dominated by websites with domain authorities in the 80’s and 90’s. Find something in your range. Note: When gauging competition, check their title tags. If the competition doesn’t have a title tag that matches or closely relates to your target keyword, there is space for your content. Don’t mistake this for a sure ranking, but note this search isn’t as heavily targeted as other search terms. Now we have a better understanding of our keyword targets... Keyword Search Volume Competition Chairs 110,000 Very High Chairs Denver 50 Medium Barstools Denver 510 Low Sofa Denver 280 Low Component #3: Relevance For obvious reasons, your target keyword must relate to your business. Here are some questions to consider. ● How well-aligned is your keyword with your target audience? ● Is the person searching your keyword ready to buy? ● How much would this customer benefit you? Is the nature of their search broad and topical? Or is it specifically related to your product or service? ● Are they searching for your most expensive item? Or a low-cost service? Answers to these questions can help you gauge your keyword’s relevance. Here’s how we gauged the relevance for each of our original keywords. Keyword Search Volume Competition Relevance Chairs 110,000 Very High High Chairs Denver 10 Medium Very High Barstools Denver 480 Low Very High Sofa Denver 210 Low Very High Keyword Research And Content Prioritization Now that we’ve considered each attribute, let’s prioritize our keywords and content. The priority estimation draws from each component: search volume, competition, and relevance. Keyword Priority Estimation Explanation Chairs 1/10 Competition is way too high. As a store with several locations, you can’t compete with Target, Overstock, and Wayfair Chairs Denver 5/10 Search volume is low, but consider local results. Google this keyphrase and you’ll find local results front-and-center. Local results are fed by Google My Business. If you haven’t already, create/beef up your listing. Barstools Denver 9/10 There’s a lot of opportunity here! A solid number of searches, low competition, and high relevancy. Make sure you have a webpage on your site that targets this keyword! If you have your products online (which you should!) incorporate these keywords into your title tag. Sofa Denver 8/10 More opportunity! Beware, however, this SERP currently has one domain in the top 3 spots. Multiple domains on the same SERP are grouped together. Given the current state of the SERP, the highest you could get is #4, unless you jump this domain to the #1 spot. How To Create A Content Schedule Create a content schedule with target keywords for each piece of content. Use the attributes and notes discussed in this article. Gauge the potential value and competition of your keywords, and use this gauge as a benchmark to prioritize your content. Let this guide your organic search campaigns. It’s easy to get sidetracked with ideas that sound good, but for organic search growth, they must pass the logic test. Other Influencing Factors Remember, quality content alone doesn’t necessarily translate to content marketing success. It’s a huge factor, but consider these others... Link Profile Websites need links to rank. Not every page needs a plethora of links to rank, but in most cases a website’s domain needs links to rank. Keyword Niche Websites that publish numerous pieces of quality content on the same topic are often looked as a “trusted source” for that topic. This can affect keyword ranking. SERP Landscape Certain searches lend themselves to different results. Local searches often display local results ported over from Google My Business listings. Some searches contain Google AdWords ads, leaving fewer clicks to organic search results. Conclusion The most important ranking factors are your content and your links. Test each of your target keywords with each of the three components listed in this guide. Such planning will put you well on your way to successful content marketing and website growth.

(Aaron Lynett/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Man wanted in stepson’s death fled 2,000 kilometres before arrest: police Add to ... Paola Loriggio ST. CATHARINES, Ont. — The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 2:20PM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 5:58PM EDT Comments closed Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print An Ontario man accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson and badly injuring a banker with whom he’d once had professional dealings managed to flee 2,000 kilometres over four days before being arrested, police said Wednesday. Niagara regional police Chief Jeff McGuire said the nationwide manhunt for 43-year-old Justin Kuijer, which began in St. Catharines, Ont., came to a peaceful end in the parking lot of a Walmart in Kenora, Ont., around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. A member of the public who had heard of the search for Kuijer recognized the van in which the man allegedly fled. Six provincial police officers responded to the tip and arrested the former roofing company owner without incident, McGuire said. Kuijer had been the subject of a Canada-wide warrant on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of his stepson, Nathan Dumas, but McGuire said the man will in fact be charged with first-degree murder in the boy’s death, as well as attempted murder in the attack on the bank employee. McGuire credited steady media exposure and public vigilance for Kuijer’s arrest, saying the end of the manhunt can help a devastated community begin to heal. “It’s because of those efforts that Kuijer is in custody today, and the community is safer than it was before his arrest yesterday,” he said at a press conference. Outside a St. Catharines sandwich shop owned by Nathan’s grandparents, flowers and stuffed animals formed a makeshift memorial for the slain boy. Residents walking by expressed rage at the attacks and relief that a suspect had been caught. Ken Chipman, who was walking his dog near the school Nathan attended a short drive away, said news of the attacks had left him “really upset.” “I thought it was horrible,” he said, adding he was glad the search for Kuijer was over. McGuire provided few new details on Kuijer’s alleged crimes or on the massive manhunt, citing the need to keep certain details confidential. But he did provide insight on how police began their investigation. Police were first summoned to a RBC branch in St. Catharines on Friday morning after reports of an assault. Officers found an employee suffering from stab wounds, he said. McGuire confirmed that the woman, who has not been named, had worked with Kuijer on financial matters in the past. Witnesses reported seeing Kuijer fleeing the scene in a dark grey van, which enabled police to connect the attack at the bank to another call they were fielding at essentially the same time, he said. Across town, in a home above the family’s sandwich shop, police said a relative discovered that Nathan had been critically injured. The boy was rushed to hospital with undisclosed injuries and died the next morning. Police learned that the van in which Kuijer allegedly fled the bank was registered to the address where Nathan was found. McGuire said the dual attacks had a wide-ranging impact across St. Catharines, a small city in the heart of Ontario’s wine country. He read a note from a staff member at the school Nathan attended which outlined the grief experienced by staff, parents and fellow students. Another anecdote from McGuire highlighted the national scope of the hunt for Kuijer. “One of the detectives answered the phone, and it was two officers sitting on the side of the TransCanada Highway in Alberta to say they that they’re out looking for our man,” he said. McGuire said Nathan’s mother and the RBC victim were “elated” at news of Kuijer’s arrest, but were asking to have their privacy respected in the wake of the attacks. The bank employee remains in hospital but is expected to make a full recovery, he added. Kuijer will be returned to the Niagara region on Wednesday in advance of a bail hearing scheduled for Thursday. The next day, Nathan’s family plans to lay the boy to rest at a funeral in neighbouring Thorold, Ont. “Nathan was truly a kind, loving boy with a big heart, full of compassion for everyone and everything. He was always quick to help anyone who may have been in need,” reads an obituary for the boy. “As the polite young gentleman he was, he never missed an opportunity to open a door, give a gift or come to the defence of a good friend. Nathan truly felt the joy of giving, never looking for anything in return. There are no words to express the unbearable heartbreak we feel in his loss.” Nathan is survived by his mother and younger siblings, the obituary states, adding that his little brother looked up to him as a “best buddy” while his baby sister will be told growing up “what an amazing big brother she had” — with files from Michelle McQuigge in Toronto.

For those concerned about societal collapse or impending disaster, two South Carolina lawmakers have a plan. It includes community ammo depots and tactical weapons training. State Reps. Josiah Magnuson, R-Campobello, and Jonathon Hill, R-Townville — both from tiny towns in the Upstate Bible Belt — are in the process of setting up what they call the "Virtue Solution Project," a group that is seeking to either save America or survive a societal collapse, which they both believe is likely coming. The organization is a mixture of religious ministry, grassroots political organizing and disaster prepping. At its core, their movement hopes to save the country by reshaping it to their interpretation of the Founding Fathers' ideals. They are advocating that their followers, and offshoot groups, form their own communities that will no longer have to rely on corporate America or the "tyrannical" federal government. They are encouraging neighbors to support "principled men" — such as themselves — who are willing to nullify laws and court rulings they don't agree with, like abortion, gay marriage, gun restrictions and federal standards for driver's licenses. For their members who are not in political office, they advocate doing their part by finding their way onto juries in order to acquit people charged with crimes they personally believe are "unjust." If that doesn't work, they will have "community preparedness centers," where there will be access to "reading material, tools, food storage, ammo, and more." The centers will be there when the economy collapses, a natural disaster occurs, a foreign nation attacks, the federal debt dooms the country or an electromagnetic pulse wipes out the nation's infrastructure. All are scenarios they have considered. It's also at these "micro hubs" that neighbors and fellow members of their "militia" will be able to learn about spiritual leadership, first aid, farming techniques, renewable energy sources, and setting up "perimeters" and other "tactical defense" strategies. "There's probably going to be a lot of little crises, but there will eventually come a point where there is a major disaster of some sort in our country, in all likelihood," Magnuson said during one of the lectures he gave in the past year and downloaded onto YouTube. "We need to be ready for that, and that will give us an opportunity to have a fresh beginning." Magnuson, 25, was first elected last year. He is already in the process of developing one of these so-called "lighthouses" or "islands of refuge" near Campabello on a roughly 1-acre tract of land just off U.S. Highway 176. He says the handful of other people involved at this point are planning other groups near Pickens, Simpsonville, Charleston and across the border in Georgia. According to documents published by the group online, their long-term goal is to "train and equip one million neighborhood leaders" that are willing to "build a fresh beginning for America." Magnuson said his center in Campobello — an old barn that was purchased by an LLC he set up late last year — will start out as a coffee shop, but will hopefully grow into the vision that he and Hill have developed. "It's serving two purposes," Magnuson told The Post and Courier. "As we build that strength, it prevents doomsday, and on the other hand, if we don't succeed, then this provides, like, lifeboats. "I think all Christians understand that there is a prophetic element to this, living in the end times and so forth," he said. Professors who have studied religion, politics and similar conservative Christian organizations say the ideas behind Magnuson and Hill's plan aren't new. Some aspects of their proposal resembles militia groups in the Western United States. Other material produced by the state lawmakers looks like that of Christian nationalist groups. "The way I would describe this group is the John Birch Society meets prepper-culture, combined with a kind of Christian restorationist sensibility and expressed in a business PowerPoint kind of way," said David Sehat, a history professor at Georgia State University. "That seems to me to sum up the group, which is super weird, also super interesting and super disturbing in some ways." But the oddest part of the entire group, several academics said, is that it is founded by two elected officials, in this case serving in the high halls of the state Legislature. Hill, 32, said people shouldn't read too much into the group's material because they are only in the infant stages of developing their ideas. The point, he said, is not to scare people, it's about self-sufficiency and providing for your neighbors. During the early gatherings of the group that have been posted on Youtube, Magnuson made it clear he is not advocating for an armed insurrection. "We're not saying that everybody should go and pick up guns and go have a revolution," he said. According to their campaign websites, both Hill and Magnuson were home-schooled, and both grew up with fathers who were pastors. Hill is now a self-taught webpage developer, according to his campaign website. He ran the Anderson Tea Party from 2009 to 2012 and was elected to office in 2014. Magnuson was just elected during the recent 2016 election, and studied for two years with Oak Brook College of Law, a school for "aspiring Christian attorneys." The first-term lawmaker was also the founder of several Christian groups when he was younger, including the Young Christian Leaders' Alliance, for which he drafted a constitution. Magnuson also operated a blog where he shared photos of trips to the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Ky. He warned his followers about big businesses like Lockheed Martin, General Motors and Wal-Mart, which he said was "encouraging the progress of the coming union of Canada, the United States, and Mexico." Magnuson and Hill see their "virtuous" communities as the answer to government overreach. Part of their solution is to limit the need for government by having the people in their select communities and churches provide social services instead of the government. In one of his lectures, Hill raises the question of any government role in public education. "There's nothing wrong with education," he said. "We can talk about whether it's government's role to fund that or control that." His idea of public education is a one-room schoolhouse where parents choose the teacher. "That's the way it worked back in the day," he said. "And then we got away from that and now we basically have career politicians and bureaucrats on a school board that are running things. It's no longer the parents." Other members of their group took that anti-government sentiment further. Patricia Wheat, a speaker who took part in their lectures on more than one occasion, raised questions about the legitimacy of state and local police. "Police are employees of a corporation. They are employees of a city. They are employees of a county. SLED officers and Highway Patrol are employees of the state, but they are employees of a corporation," Wheat said. "They only have authority within that corporation, and that authority is questionable as far as I'm concerned." "However, militia have authority under the Constitution of the United States, of the State of South Carolina and the Bible," she continued. "Which one overrides?" Wheat's comments, Hill said, were the result of "like-minded people thinking out loud," and that he and Magnuson found her comments "objectionable." "She would be an example of one of those individuals that goes much further towards anarchy than we are comfortable with," Hill said. On the group's webpage, they link to a commercial for the Peacekeeper app, which allows people to contact their neighbors with an alert if they want them to respond to an emergency instead of police. "This isn't some type of political overturning movement," Magnuson said. "It's more of a political and economic replacing movement." Until their replacement movement takes hold, however, the two lawmakers are working to counteract the current political system in the House of Representatives by trying to nullify laws they determine are unconstitutional or morally evil. Magnuson has sponsored bills that would allow local government to enact laws mandating transgender individuals use the bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate or would define "personhood" as a fertilized egg, effectively nullifying court decisions upholding access to abortions. On their website, they give the example of a bill that Hill previously helped to sponsor that would prevent state employees from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On their Facebook page, the group held up the trial of the Bundy Brothers, the armed anti-government protesters who took over a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, as a good example of jurors refusing to convict people for laws they believe are unjust. "Whether or not you agree with the Bundys, this is clearly a victory for the jury system, and demonstrates its power to protect courageous citizens!" they wrote. While Magnuson and Hill explicitly advocate against calls for secession, several professors said some of their movement's language and ideas are similar to those in the former Confederacy. Michael McVicar, a professor of religion at Florida State University who studied the South Carolina group Christian Exodus during the early 2000s said, "When you start talking about nullification, that old Confederate ideology is just percolating right under the surface."

It includes community ammo depots and tactical weapons training. State Reps. Josiah Magnuson, R-Campobello, and Jonathon Hill, R-Townville - both from tiny towns in the Upstate Bible Belt - are in the process of setting up what they call the "Virtue Solution Project," a group that is seeking to either save America or survive a societal collapse, which they both believe is likely coming. The organization is a mixture of religious ministry, grassroots political organizing and disaster prepping. At its core, their movement hopes to save the country by reshaping it to their interpretation of the Founding Fathers' ideals. They are advocating that their followers, and offshoot groups, form their own communities that will no longer have to rely on corporate America or the "tyrannical" federal government. They are encouraging neighbors to support "principled men" - such as themselves - who are willing to nullify laws and court rulings they don't agree with, like abortion, gay marriage, gun restrictions and federal standards for driver's licenses. For their members who are not in political office, they advocate doing their part by finding their way onto juries in order to acquit people charged with crimes they personally believe are "unjust." If that doesn't work, they will have "community preparedness centers," where there will be access to "reading material, tools, food storage, ammo, and more." The centers will be there when the economy collapses, a natural disaster occurs, a foreign nation attacks, the federal debt dooms the country or an electromagnetic pulse wipes out the nation's infrastructure. All are scenarios they have considered. It's also at these "micro hubs" that neighbors and fellow members of their "militia" will be able to learn about spiritual leadership, first aid, farming techniques, renewable energy sources, and setting up "perimeters" and other "tactical defense" strategies. "There's probably going to be a lot of little crises, but there will eventually come a point where there is a major disaster of some sort in our country, in all likelihood," Magnuson said during one of the lectures he gave in the past year and downloaded onto YouTube. "We need to be ready for that, and that will give us an opportunity to have a fresh beginning." Magnuson, 25, was first elected last year. He is already in the process of developing one of these so-called "lighthouses" or "islands of refuge" near Campabello on a roughly 1-acre tract of land just off U.S. Highway 176. He says the handful of other people involved at this point are planning other groups near Pickens, Simpsonville, Charleston and across the border in Georgia. According to documents published by the group online, their long-term goal is to "train and equip one million neighborhood leaders" that are willing to "build a fresh beginning for America." Magnuson said his center in Campobello - an old barn that was purchased by an LLC he set up late last year - will start out as a coffee shop, but will hopefully grow into the vision that he and Hill have developed. "It's serving two purposes," Magnuson told The Post and Courier. "As we build that strength, it prevents doomsday, and on the other hand, if we don't succeed, then this provides, like, lifeboats. "I think all Christians understand that there is a prophetic element to this, living in the end times and so forth," he said. Professors who have studied religion, politics and similar conservative Christian organizations say the ideas behind Magnuson and Hill's plan aren't new. Some aspects of their proposal resembles militia groups in the Western United States. Other material produced by the state lawmakers looks like that of Christian nationalist groups. "The way I would describe this group is the John Birch Society meets prepper-culture, combined with a kind of Christian restorationist sensibility and expressed in a business PowerPoint kind of way," said David Sehat, a history professor at Georgia State University. "That seems to me to sum up the group, which is super weird, also super interesting and super disturbing in some ways." But the oddest part of the entire group, several academics said, is that it is founded by two elected officials, in this case serving in the high halls of the state Legislature. Hill, 32, said people shouldn't read too much into the group's material because they are only in the infant stages of developing their ideas. The point, he said, is not to scare people, it's about self-sufficiency and providing for your neighbors. During the early gatherings of the group that have been posted on Youtube, Magnuson made it clear he is not advocating for an armed insurrection. "We're not saying that everybody should go and pick up guns and go have a revolution," he said. According to their campaign websites, both Hill and Magnuson were home-schooled, and both grew up with fathers who were pastors. Hill is now a self-taught webpage developer, according to his campaign website. He ran the Anderson Tea Party from 2009 to 2012 and was elected to office in 2014. Magnuson was just elected during the recent 2016 election, and studied for two years with Oak Brook College of Law, a school for "aspiring Christian attorneys." The first-term lawmaker was also the founder of several Christian groups when he was younger, including the Young Christian Leaders' Alliance, for which he drafted a constitution. Magnuson also operated a blog where he shared photos of trips to the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Ky. He warned his followers about big businesses like Lockheed Martin, General Motors and Wal-Mart, which he said was "encouraging the progress of the coming union of Canada, the United States, and Mexico." Magnuson and Hill see their "virtuous" communities as the answer to government overreach. Part of their solution is to limit the need for government by having the people in their select communities and churches provide social services instead of the government. In one of his lectures, Hill raises the question of any government role in public education. "There's nothing wrong with education," he said. "We can talk about whether it's government's role to fund that or control that." His idea of public education is a one-room schoolhouse where parents choose the teacher. "That's the way it worked back in the day," he said. "And then we got away from that and now we basically have career politicians and bureaucrats on a school board that are running things. It's no longer the parents." Other members of their group took that anti-government sentiment further. Patricia Wheat, a speaker who took part in their lectures on more than one occasion, raised questions about the legitimacy of state and local police. "Police are employees of a corporation. They are employees of a city. They are employees of a county. SLED officers and Highway Patrol are employees of the state, but they are employees of a corporation," Wheat said. "They only have authority within that corporation, and that authority is questionable as far as I'm concerned." "However, militia have authority under the Constitution of the United States, of the State of South Carolina and the Bible," she continued. "Which one overrides?" Wheat's comments, Hill said, were the result of "like-minded people thinking out loud," and that he and Magnuson found her comments "objectionable." "She would be an example of one of those individuals that goes much further towards anarchy than we are comfortable with," Hill said. On the group's webpage, they link to a commercial for the Peacekeeper app, which allows people to contact their neighbors with an alert if they want them to respond to an emergency instead of police. "This isn't some type of political overturning movement," Magnuson said. "It's more of a political and economic replacing movement." Until their replacement movement takes hold, however, the two lawmakers are working to counteract the current political system in the House of Representatives by trying to nullify laws they determine are unconstitutional or morally evil. Magnuson has sponsored bills that would allow local government to enact laws mandating transgender individuals use the bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate or would define "personhood" as a fertilized egg, effectively nullifying court decisions upholding access to abortions. On their website, they give the example of a bill that Hill previously helped to sponsor that would prevent state employees from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On their Facebook page, the group held up the trial of the Bundy Brothers, the armed anti-government protesters who took over a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, as a good example of jurors refusing to convict people for laws they believe are unjust. "Whether or not you agree with the Bundys, this is clearly a victory for the jury system, and demonstrates its power to protect courageous citizens!" they wrote. While Magnuson and Hill explicitly advocate against calls for secession, several professors said some of their movement's language and ideas are similar to those in the former Confederacy. Michael McVicar, a professor of religion at Florida State University who studied the South Carolina group Christian Exodus during the early 2000s said, "When you start talking about nullification, that old Confederate ideology is just percolating right under the surface." ___ Information from: The Post and Courier, http://www.postandcourier.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Ideas Search Search Sign In democratsGovernment Watchdog to Investigate Trump Travel Costs societyThis Game of Thrones Wedding Theme Is Fit for a Targaryen Queen Congress7 Things to Know About House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes viralMeet 'Sax Bae.' the Drake-Covering Musician Who the Internet Can't Stop Crushing On Ezra Bailey—Getty Images Business Small Business Growth Has Stalled and That’s Bad for All of Us Jayson DeMers Mar 23, 2017 Ideas DeMers is the founder and CEO of AudienceBloom. Small businesses drive our economy — and yet, they’ve gone missing. Historically, we’ve come to expect the creation of around 600,000 new businesses a year. While the Great Recession took those numbers down, economists anticipated we’d grow back to those previous figures. Instead, we’ve hovered around the 400,000s. Only a fraction of those new businesses end up surviving beyond a year or two. This is a problem. Though the number has fluctuated, the percentage of new jobs created by small businesses has hovered around 40 to 60 percent for a couple decades. Startups and small businesses also tend to be more agile, enabling them to innovate more. And the turnover rate is actually a good thing — it keeps fresh ideas and fresh talent in circulation. Also, well, every new big business has to first start as a small business. Small businesses aren’t facing a major crisis — at least not yet — but there’s definitely something stopping us from creating and nurturing more small businesses. Here are some of the major contributing factors: 1. Exaggerated fears. Have you heard that 60 percent of restaurants close within their first year of opening? It’s easy to believe, especially with anecdotal evidence: You see a lot of restaurants opening and closing in your area, confirmation bias takes hold, and you end up believing that restaurants are an exceptionally risky business venture. Related Careers & WorkplaceWhy Leaders Fail to Stop Bad Behavior Careers & Workplace Why Leaders Fail to Stop Bad Behavior The real number, however, is closer to 20 percent. Yes, 60 percent actually close within three years of business. But one of the biggest problems is banks refuse to lend money to restaurants because they perceive more risk than there is, which leads to an ongoing cycle of limited capital, which leads to business failure. This same principle applies to a number of different industries, and even to entrepreneurial experience. New entrepreneurs are inexperienced, and are less likely to get funding. But because they never get funding, they never have the chance to gain entrepreneurial experience. 2. Walmartization. Americans are increasingly favoring chains and big businesses over small and local businesses, in a process known colloquially as Walmartization. Large chains have had the time to develop highly efficient processes and have the resources necessary to build infrastructure that maximizes profits while minimizing consumer costs. Consumers, in turn, rely on those businesses for the cheapest possible goods and the most familiar brand image. Go to any Walmart in America, and they’ll likely have the product you’re looking for, going for a reasonable price. Heading to a small business becomes a gamble. As chains become more popular, they get more money to spread even further. The cycle spreads. Entrepreneurs struggle to get the opportunity to start their own endeavors. 3. Lumped funding. Venture capital has been on the rise for more than a decade, peaking in 2015 with $63.3 billion dollars in investments — and 2016 was impressive, too, with $47.1 billion in investments. Looking at the total dollar values alone, it’s easy to think that this is actually a “golden age” for startups and entrepreneurs. The vast majority of this funding, though, pools in a small number of potential businesses. Venture capitalists and angel investors tend to gravitate toward the ideas and businesses with the greatest possible chance of success — and understandably so. Yet startups with more tenuous models, or those covering less familiar territory, hardly ever get a slice of the pie. This means fewer total businesses get the funding they need to grow, with a minority of exceptional businesses getting a ton of capital they probably didn’t badly need in the first place. 4. Millennial barriers. With the overabundance of articles about millennials’ professional habits, preferences and even personality traits, it’s easy for contradictory information to circulate. Some claim that millennials are starting more businesses than previous generations, while some claim they’re starting fewer. The reality is, millennials are starting lots of businesses worldwide — but in America, they’re started by a small percentage of the generation. Most millennials are interested in becoming entrepreneurs, but aren’t able, for one reason or another. As one of the most significant reasons, millennials are burdened with crushing amounts of student debt and are forced to take whatever jobs they can to cover those debts as they try to build a life. The last thing they want to do is take a massive financial risk that might result in even more debt. A lack of encouragement for millennials to take the plunge compounds this effect. Can we recover? We’re not approaching crisis-level figures yet. But there is a shortage of the entrepreneurial motivation and conditions that small businesses need to develop. There’s no “quick fix” that can address all these factors at once. But we can shop at more small and local businesses, to encourage their economic development. We can improve our education system to not only encourage more entrepreneurship and risk-taking, but avoid long-standing college debt that prohibits new business development. We can also avoid reserving our investment capital only for the surest bets, taking risks ourselves to support the worthy risks of others. In all likelihood, this is a temporary “down” period in an ongoing cycle of fluctuations. Yet the sooner we’re able to climb out of it, the stronger our economy is going to grow.

Picture: BOBBY/YIP REUTERS Last week’s announcement that China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) would buy 75% of US oil major Chevron’s South African business comes after a fairly dramatic year-long process during which a couple of the unsuccessful bidders made the news for the wrong reasons. First, the leaders of SA’s Strategic Fuel Fund had to resign after they announced the fund’s intention to make a bid for the Chevron assets with what the Department of Energy described as "complete disregard for governance processes". Then another set of bidders ended up in a New York court when Swiss-based oil trader Gunvor sued private equity house Cerberus for failing to pay its share of the costs incurred in their failed joint $650m bid for the Chevron SA assets. Along the way, it emerged that Sasol had tried its hand, as did another big global oil trader, Vitol. Chevron, which sells fuel under the Caltex brand name in SA, finally opted to take Sinopec’s $900m offer for its South African and Botswana assets. It is a highly significant deal for both parties and one SA should welcome. China's Sinopec buys 75% of Chevron’s South African assets It is the largest global acquisition for Sinopec, a state-owned oil and petrochemical company that is number four on the Fortune Global 500 list and is the world’s second-largest oil refiner. The South African deal puts Sinopec in the ranks of international oil companies such as Exxon Mobil or Royal Dutch Shell, says the Financial Times. For SA, the deal will be the largest acquisition by a Chinese company since the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bought into Standard Bank for $5.5bn in 2007, and it has the advantage of being a sale by one multinational to another – probably the first time control of a company in so strategic a sector has transferred between two multinationals. This means no funds flow out of SA, as they would have if a domestic company had bought the stake. More important, though, is that the Sinopec deal can bring capital, technology and expertise to the South African fuel industry at a critical time. SA’s refineries have to upgrade to "Clean Fuels 2" and, although the move has been delayed because of a deadlock between industry and the government on how the sizeable costs will be recovered, it cannot be delayed forever. In its announcement last week, Sinopec made it clear it is more than willing and able to do and pay for what is required, highlighting its "vast experience designing and implementing effective solutions to upgrade legacy systems and facilities". It has also committed to maintaining the local workforce and the black economic empowerment partners, as well as keeping the Caltex brand for five to six years and to "contribute to the development of the indigenous oil industry". Chevron SA has the largest share of SA’s downstream fuel market after Engen, with a refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban and 820 Caltex-branded service stations countrywide. Together with the Botswana operations, it will provide a significant platform from which Sinopec can pursue its South African and southern African expansion ambitions. The deal is subject to approval by SA’s competition regulators and although there clearly are no considerations in this regard, foreign buyers such as Walmart and AB InBev have in the past been given the runaround on public interest issues by the Competition Commission and Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel. We trust pragmatism will prevail this time around. This is particularly so given SA’s professed commitment to its ties with the Brics countries and its keen interest in cementing relations with China. Whether and how smoothly Sinopec’s bid goes through the regulatory hoops will be a test case of whether SA genuinely welcomes foreign direct investment by China.

The Alcatel A30. Photo via Amazon. An expansion of Amazon’s discounted smartphone program for Prime members is at the center of a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles last week. Pay Per Swipe, a Los Angeles-based mobile advertising company that builds apps to put ads on smartphone lock screens, sued TCT Mobile, an entity that shares an Irvine, Calif., address with phone maker Alcatel, for breach of contract and unfair business practices, among other charges. Pay Per Swipe alleges that TCT broke a non-disclosure agreement and used confidential information about lock screen ad products the two firms worked on together for its own gain. TCT allegedly used that information to land a deal with Amazon to be part of its discounted smartphone program and cut out Pay Per Swipe entirely. Pay Per Swipe is not suing Amazon itself, just TCT. In court documents, Pay Per Swipe says it is a competitor with Amazon on lock screen ad-supported products. One of the phones offered through Amazon’s discount program is built by Blu, a chief competitor of Alcatel. “Essentially they were playing both sides of fence,” Joshua Haffner, an attorney for Haffner Law, representing Pay Per Swipe, said of TCT. “They had our confidential info, and they were planning out strategies to go with entities other than Amazon, specifically knowing that Blu, their competitor, had a phone and Amazon was doing it. And then all the sudden they had a deal with Amazon. When did this deal arise?” The lawsuit also sheds more light on a deal announced by Amazon Thursday night to expand the discount smartphone program for Prime members to include the unlocked Alcatel A30 and Moto G5 Plus. According to Pay Per Swipe’s suit, Amazon and Alcatel will manufacture 500,000 phones sold on Amazon with Amazon lock screen ads. Court documents valued the deal at $50 million. The lawsuit does not mention the G5 plus. Pay Per Swipe is seeking damages related to breaking the NDA, as well as a cut of TCT’s deal with Amazon. Amazon announced the discount smartphone program last year. It is supported by personalized offers and ads on the lock screen. Users can tap to find out more about the advertised products or access their phones to dismiss the ads. Amazon uses the ad revenue to offset the cost of the discounts. The Blu R1 HD 8 GB was one of the first phones offered through the promotion at a price of $49.99 to Prime members, which is $50 off its retail price of $99.99. The Alcatel A30 is priced at $59.99 for Prime members ($40 off retail). Amazon said it does not discuss business arrangements. GeekWire also reached out to Alcatel and its parent company, China-based TCL Communication. We will update this post if we hear back. TCL is mentioned in Amazon’s press release about the discount Alcatel phone. Here is what TCL Communication North America’s President and General Manager Steve Cistulli said about the deal, according to the release. “Adding this device to Amazon’s Prime Exclusive Phones program is an exciting evolution of our relationship and ensures that even more consumers have access to our feature-rich and value-packed smartphones.” In court documents, Pay Per Swipe claims that Cistulli signed an NDA in September 2016. At the same time, the two firms were discussing an idea to sell Alcatel phones with Walmart lock-screen ads because “Walmart was always looking for a way to beat Amazon.” The companies later produced prototypes for Best Buy and Hilton Hotels. According to court documents, Pay Per Swipe found out about the Amazon-Alcatel deal in February. Haffner, the attorney for Pay Per Swipe, said he was curious how long the deal had been in the works. The timing of Amazon’s announcement of the discounted Alcatel phone also raised concerns with Haffner. “It just seems like the timing of it, I don’t know, but it makes me suspect it was almost in response to our lawsuit,” Haffner said. “I don’t know that but it raises that suspicion in my mind.” Nat Levy is a staff reporter at Geekwire covering a variety of technology topics, including Microsoft, Amazon, tech startups, and the intersection of technology with real estate, courts and government.

Photo: Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images On Monday in Kentucky, President Trump described his overhaul of the American health-care system as an irritating but necessary chore. “We want a very big tax cut. But we cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare,” Trump explained. “We gotta get this done before we can do the other.” The president has voiced a similar sentiment several times in recent weeks. Unable to make a substantive case for a health-care bill that does the opposite of virtually everything he promised it would, Trump has taken to insisting on its grim necessity. But after a week of negotiating with the recalcitrant reactionaries of the House Freedom Caucus, the president no longer believes that throwing 24 million people off their health care is a prerequisite for cutting his own tax rate. The idea that Trump had to repeal Obamacare before slashing taxes was never his own. It was Paul Ryan’s. The House Speaker insisted on this sequence because his dream of passing permanent regressive tax cuts depends on it. To avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, Republicans must pass their tax plan in the form of a budget-reconciliation bill — a type of legislation that can pass with a simple majority in the upper chamber. But budget-reconciliation bills cannot increase the budget deficit outside of the ten-year period after they’re passed. This means that Republicans can either put a ten-year time limit on their tax cuts — as they did under George W. Bush — or they need to find a way to make their tax cuts revenue neutral. That latter gambit may sound impossible. And it probably is. But it’s a bit less impossible if Republicans repeal Obamacare first, as Jonathan Chait has explained: The Republican plan to repeal Obamacare would eliminate all the taxes that were raised to help pay for the benefits — about $1.2 trillion over the next decade. This would lower the baseline of tax revenue, meaning that Republicans would need to design a tax code that raises $1.2 trillion less in revenue in order to be “revenue-neutral.” That makes it crucial for them to repeal Obamacare before they cut taxes. Still, even with that $1.2 trillion handicap, it’s highly unlikely that Republicans can keep their tax package revenue neutral. The House’s plan to do so involves revising the corporate tax code in a manner that disadvantages major importers like Walmart — a move that several Republican senators have declared dead-on-arrival in the upper chamber. Thus, the only reason why Trump had to put Obamacare repeal at the top of his legislative docket was to keep Paul Ryan’s naïve dream of permanent tax cuts alive for a little longer. Instead of beginning his presidency by pushing the GOP’s heinously unpopular vision for health-care reform, Trump could have notched an easy win on (temporary) tax cuts. And the president is finally realizing all this. Per the New York Times: Mr. Trump has told four people close to him that he regrets going along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s plan to push a health care overhaul before unveiling a tax cut proposal more politically palatable to Republicans. He said ruefully this week that he should have done tax reform first when it became clear that the quick-hit health care victory he had hoped for was not going to materialize on Thursday, the seventh anniversary of the act’s passage, when the legislation was scheduled for a vote. The president regrets listening to Ryan. And the Speaker is on the cusp of humiliating defeat as the House moves to vote Friday afternoon. Steve Bannon smells blood.

The pair wrote love letters to each other and saved them as draft emails on his classroom computer before going on the run.  The new video posted by Wayne County News points out 'appearances can be altered but voices are distinguishable.'  Thomas helps her brother sew a confederate flag in a new video that emerged in the hopes of helping people identify her voice. It is likely her hair has been dyed  The day before the pair disappeared, Cummins was filmed on surveillance footage buying dark brown women's hair dye. The footage shows Thomas showing her brother how to sew a confederate flag. Amber alerts are in place in their home state and in Alabama but police say the pair could be anywhere. Before they vanished, they left romantic letters for one another on Cummins' classroom computer at Culleoka School. They included one message from Cummins to the underage girl which began: 'I saw you standing next to your backpack this morning.'  Scroll down for video  Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas left love notes for each other on his classroom computer at Culleoka School in Columbia, Tennessee, before vanishing. The pair are pictured in the classroom, above, in January  Elizabeth, 15, and Cummins, 50, have not been seen since March 13. A warrant has been issued for his arrest and there are Amber Alerts in place in Tennessee and Alabama  The note went on to describe parts of the teenager's body, investigators told WAAY. 'They would write the message and let it save as a draft. The other person would log in, read the message and then delete it and then write another message that was saved as a draft,' Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper said.  'If you read them you would immediately recognize you are reading messages between two people who have a romantic interest in each other.' Last week, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation released a photograph of the pair taken in Cummins' classroom in January.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Man, 38, is found shot dead inside his South Dallas...

Another student at the school reported seeing them kissing on the lips in the same classroom on January 23 but Cummins, who describes himself as a 'Jesus freak', was allowed to carry on teaching.  Police in Maury County began investigating the report but he was never arrested. School board staff did not immediately tell Elizabeth's family about the allegations. It was only when an officer went to their home to investigate them that they realized what had been alleged by the other student.  Elizabeth changed her Instagram biography before she vanished to describe herself as a 'wife'. She also added a ring emoji to the description  Cummins visited a Walmart in Columbia, Tennessee, the day before he vanished with the girl. He was filmed on surveillance cameras buying dark brown women's hair dye  The dark brow hair dye teacher Tad Cummins was seen buying (right) and Elizabeth (left) Another student at the school reported seeing the pair kissing on the lips on January 23 but Cummins was allowed to continue teaching  A reported sighting of the pair was made in Corpus Christi, Texas, last week but so far it has led to nothing  Instead of removing him from teaching, staff removed Elizabeth from Cummins' class. They were however found together alone in his classroom again weeks later and he was suspended.  Elizabeth, who is one of ten children, littered social media with posts about romance and love and started calling herself 'wife' on Instagram.  She made several references to a 'mission' that was 'almost complete'.  On March 13, she told family she was going to spend the day with a friend. One of her siblings has since revealed that the teenager told them to call police if she did not return home that night.  Authorities believe she may have gone willingly with Cummins, who they say has been grooming her for sex for some time.  Cummins was seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day the pair disappeared It does not diminish the danger she is now in - police say he is armed with two handguns. Other staff at the school have joined the duo's families in making desperate pleas for them to return safely.  This image of Elizabeth was taken on March 13, the day she vanished.

As the president of the American Federation of Teachers — the national union affiliated with Cornell Graduate Students United — Weingarten praised Cornell graduate workers and urged them to vote for unionization on Monday and Tuesday. In an address to graduate students gathered at Hasbrouck Community Center, Weingarten assured the group that the AFT would not try to diminish local autonomy. Instead, she said, it would be a group that would support graduates if they needed it. Weingarten highlighted the diversity of locals that are affiliated with the AFT. She said the 3,500 locals “are as different as they can be,” and pointed out that the AFT is still growing, especially since the election of President Donald Trump. She said that when the first travel ban was announced, she and her partner went to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City to protest with hundreds of others. While on her way, she said she got a call saying that a professor at CUNY — who belonged to a union affiliated with the AFT — was unable to enter the United States because of the ban. Through working with a variety of people including U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the professor was able to come home, an event which Weingarten said was an example of the union having someone’s back. “If you vote to organize and ratify a union this Monday and Tuesday, you will never, ever, ever, ever see me ever telling you what to do,” Weingarten said. “What you will see is a union throughout this country who will have your back every single day, for the issues that you champion, for the people that you represent and for the country that we want to be.” “That is who a union is these days. That is who a union needs to be these days. That is what, if you vote for a union, that is what the graduate students/workers at Cornell will be,” she added. Weingarten then turned to more local issues, and in what she said was “the only political piece I’ll say today,” criticized Prof. David Collum, chair of the chemistry department, who sent out an email to his colleagues calling graduate student unionization “an existential risk to Cornell’s graduate program.” “Look, I went to this school. I went to the school of labor relations at this University. So personally I am really offended that somebody who has a lot of power, and who has tenure and who has voice would actually say in a university that has an ILR school here, that having real labor relations is an existential threat,” Weingarten said. “Don’t tell me that they’re an existential threat when we have on this campus, and what makes this campus a great campus, what makes it a land-grant university is having an ILR school,” she continued to applause. In an interview with The Sun, Weingarten highlighted CGSU’s position as what she called a bottom-up organization and criticized Cornell’s administration for its behavior during the campaign. “This is not top-down,” she said of the unionization campaign. “When the boss tries to make it that way, that is the boss attempting — whether the boss is a university president or whether the boss is the head of Walmart — it is the boss trying to create fear and polarize in the same kind of way as Donald Trump tries to polarize.” Weingarten also condemned what she called a “whispering campaign” whose effects she said she saw even since she arrived earlier that morning. Earlier several graduate students spoke about their struggles with having kids as a reason for their support for CGSU. They spoke about the “exorbitant” cost of childcare in Ithaca and pointed out that even though at times things might be alright, a union is necessary for when things go wrong. “What I’ve experienced with fellow grads and friends who are nervous about unionization is this notion that ‘well we’re okay already,’” said Anaar Desai-Stephens, grad, with her child in her arms. “But sometimes that falls through, that relying on these individual links with our advisors, our departments is really tenuous at best.” She added that many changes around campus that benefited her, such as the ability to pump on campus, were things that happened because of collective advocacy around campus. “Asking for a union is not a sign of our privilege, it’s a sign of our solidarity,” Desai-Stephens said. Jane Glaubman, grad, thanked Weingarten and praised the relationship between CGSU and the AFT. “They always say the union is an outside force coming in,” she said. “Our union was inside people, it was grad students who started a union, but we needed help, and AFT came through and they’ve done a fantastic job.” About Josh Girsky Josh Girsky is a member of the Class of 2019 in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Related With Vote Approaching, CGSU Explains Relationship With National Union By Anna Delwiche March 25, 2017 At an information session CGSU hosted for graduate students, Michael Durney, grad, questioned the portrayal of the administration as a “rich, uncaring” group. 9 thoughts on “AFT President Randi Weingarten ’80 Rallies With Grads Before Major Vote” Philippe Lemoine on March 27, 2017 at 3:16 am said: Since the AFT would get approximately $1 million in dues taken from our wages each year, it’s hardly surprising that Mrs. Weingarten want us to vote in favor of unionization, but it doesn’t mean that we — as opposed to the AFT — would actually benefit from it. The problem is that CGSU is making the case in favor of unionization dishonestly by cherry-picking the evidence and neglecting to mention crucial information. For instance, it makes a lot of the situation at Oregon State University where graduate students obtained a higher stipend, but there are other universities where it didn’t go that well. The only study I was able to find on the effects of unionization for graduate students concludes that it has no effect on net compensation and doesn’t affect the probability of getting coverage for students and their dependents. CGSU also claims that, if we don’t like the offer Cornell makes us, we can just vote against the contract to reject it. But as long as the National Labor Relations Board, which is going to be filled with people appointed by Trump, rules that Cornell bargained in good faith, the administration can just implement its last offer whether we like it or not. If anyone is interested, I wrote a post on my blog where I explain these points and many other things, which I encourage you to read before you vote. I made sure to provide evidence for every single factual claim I make, so that anyone can check that what I say is true. I really wish there had been a real debate so that people were able to get more information about this. Reply ↓ Jason on March 27, 2017 at 8:58 am said: The mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act—the process of reason—must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred. Ayn Rand (Someone you were probably taught to hate most likely) Reply ↓ Alex on March 27, 2017 at 10:24 am said: If you are unsure about the union or have a feeling against it but don’t want to upset your union friends – VOTE NO! Make sure to vote! This is a decision so permanent and in my opinion destructive that it is better to vote no than end up stuck with a bad union. The union could have been TA only, for example, rather than include RAs who really should be opposed to this. This can only hurt research productivity, and frankly the value of a Cornell PhD. The union likes to cite the Rogers study to claim that no adverse effects of unions have been found, but taking a look at it, it is at least irrelevant or even flawed and biased. The study only looked at four non-union universities, none of them private. The students who responded were self-selecting and the response rate was not very high, and they were mostly TAs, and only 27% RAs. The fields were almost entirely English, History, and Psychology, with 20% CS and no science or engineering. The respondents were generally non-international. This is very different from Cornell’s graduate population. The non-union mean stipend was $15k, so far from Cornell’s that it makes it hard to extrapolate the results to our case. All of the unionized schools surveyed had been unionized for a long time. This would ignore instabilities which could come from enhanced negative effects for the years after the union establishes. Additionally the bias is clear in their questions. For example, they ask ““Do you regard the pay and benefits you receive from your assistantship as adequate given the AMOUNT OF WORK you do?” (emphasis added here). This biases the answerer to think of the pay as being in exchange for a service, but the stipend was never intended to be a salary in exchange for labor, but rather to help cover annual expenses. It should have been phrased “… adequate to live on?” or just left out altogether. This is just an example. Surveys have to be taken with a grain of salt, because it’s easy to get any result you want or leave out data showing the opposite. Meanwhile, it is obvious that the union is promoting a hostile environment already at Cornell (just look at the front page outrage the union stirs up against a professor sending a rather mild private email). Reply ↓ David Collum on March 27, 2017 at 2:05 pm said: My two cents: please vote. It is important. That is my real name, BTW. Rumors that I am a despicable human being have not been substantiated…but the jury is out I guess. Reply ↓ Hateful bigot on March 27, 2017 at 4:18 pm said: I fully support the unionization effort. There is no better way to teach leftist grad students how pernicious unions are. So, yes please. Vote to unionize, pay your dues, and learn a lesson or two about reality that you won’t get inside the Cornell bubble from your left-wing professors. Reply ↓ Hateful bigot on March 27, 2017 at 4:31 pm said: We may be witnessing the dying gasps of unions. Friedrichs vs. California Teachers Association was deadlocked last year, and it’s going to get a redux with Gorsuch on the court. Abood is going to get overturned, and unions will have to earn their keep. Good times. Reply ↓ Hateful bigot on March 27, 2017 at 4:33 pm said: I am ready to bet $5 that the unionization vote will pass, proving that factory workers at the Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and Boeing in South Carolina are smarter as a whole. A graduate degree doesn’t mean cow excrement. Reply ↓ Paying your salary on March 27, 2017 at 8:33 pm said: Hey Randi – nice touch with the blue jeans and t-shirt. Did you tell them about your house in the Hamptons, and the millions you have made off the back of the workers? Reply ↓ acturg on March 28, 2017 at 1:01 am said: All one has to do is read book “Class Warfare” by Steven Brill to see first hand the poor job Ms. Weingarten has done for NYC public school students. Hope those who are swayed by her words do their own independent due diligence. Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

TV Grace And Frankie Find Shows Grace And Frankie wants to talk to you about masturbation By Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya @KaylaKumari Mar 26, 2017 8:00 PM B Grace And Frankie Grace And Frankie B Grace And Frankie "The Focus Group" Season 3 , Episode 3 Community Grade (7 Users) A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D+ D D- F Your Grade A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D+ D D- F ?   Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. The ménage-a-moi has arrived on Grace And Frankie, and it’s got glow-in-the-dark control buttons, a soft-grip sleeve, easy-to-adjust angles, and a quiet buzz. The purple prototypes of Grace and Frankie’s first vibrators instantly become a great prop in the world of this show, and Grace and Frankie waste no time before trying them out. It gets the job done, and Grace and Frankie both wake up with a pancake breakfast after a night of multiple orgasms and zero arthritic pain. The episode starts from this fun and happy place. “Orgasms and pancakes with all the fixings? Best day ever!” Frankie declares, and I’m inclined to agree. But once the episode gets into its central conflict, everything starts to feel less organic and more like an episode of television trying to set up the pieces. After self-testing the product, Grace tells Frankie it’s time to bring in a focus group to get some outside opinions. She asks her friend Arlene to bring over some friends, neglecting to tell her anything about the product, and Arlene shows up with her prayer group. It’s a classic sitcom setup, with Grace and Frankie having to tip-toe around the buttoned-up church ladies before finally just coming out with it and talking to them about masturbation. They leave in a huff, and Grace wonders how they’re ever going to reach their target audience when much of their target audience doesn’t want to talk about sex and masturbation. While Grace and Frankie do occasionally use euphemisms for orgasm and sex, it’s usually for comedic effect. They’re far from ashamed of discussing their bodies and desires like these other women are. Grace admits that she used to be one of those church ladies, but we’ve seen her grow beyond the buttoned-up days of her recent past. Though Grace probably wouldn’t admit it, Frankie’s presence in her life has definitely been a big part of her evolving sense of sex positivity. As it turns out, Arlene ended up taking home one of the vibrators, and she returns at the end of the episode to collect more for her prayer group, who apparently called her to tell her they were interested. I like the suggestion that even religious older women do indeed masturbate, which tracks with Grace And Frankie’s inclusive outlook on human desire. But because we don’t see this shift in the women’s attitudes, because it all happens off-screen and with very little explanation, it’s tough to swallow. It feels very convenient for the plot. Grace raises all these interesting questions about shame, but the episode doesn’t actively engage with them. Instead, the church ladies just admit they want to use vibrators, and everyone moves forward. It’s too neatly wrapped up. At the insistence of their friend Peter, Robert and Sol audition for a local production of 1776. Their subplot here interestingly gives new meaning to their cute but fluffy subplot last episode. Suddenly, Sol’s erratic dance moves and Robert’s Pirates Of Penzance singalong turn out to have been foreshadowing this precise moment. But even though the episode ends on a nice note for Robert and Sol, with Robert securing the leading role and Sol pledging to fulfill the role of supportive husband after not landing any parts, this storyline is stilted. I think that largely has to do with Peter. Supporting characters on Grace And Frankie are usually marked with distinct quirks, and that’s certainly true for him, but he’s so wholly obnoxious that he’s a jarring presence on this show full of imperfect but endearing characters. His line about Wal-Mart greeters is particularly bad. Maybe the show is offering a critique of a specific kind of wealthy white person (as it sometimes does with the main characters even), but Peter just doesn’t work, and he seems more one-liner than character. For a while, that’s how Brianna felt, too. Even though she has always been my favorite non-Grace/Frankie character on the show, Brianna was mostly good for jokes and little else. Not only do the writers seem acutely aware of that this season, but the character’s storyline within the show reflects it. Mallory literally accuses Brianna of being a mean joke machine. She no longer wants to put up with Brianna’s digs at her family. It’s a genuine revelation for Brianna, who startles when Mallory says there’s something wrong with her. It weighs on her for the rest of the episode, leading to a great scene between her and Grace where Grace more-or-less confirms Mallory’s accusations. Grace and Brianna have a similar coldness to them, and both are sort of disturbed by Mallory’s four kids. If anyone can give Brianna useful advice on how to open herself up more, it’s Grace. She pushes Brianna to be nicer to Mallory’s kids, and the sisters don’t necessarily fix everything between them in the end, but Brianna does make earnest attempts to be better. Of all the characters, Brianna’s emotional arc in this episode is the strongest. She’s evolving but in a way that feels right for the character. Stray observations Frankie picks all the peas out of her fried rice. The purple vibrators have been a huge part of the season’s promotional campaign, so it was exciting to finally see them on the show. Brianna promises to impart all the wise lessons she was taught by Frankie to Mallory’s children when they grow up, including how to roll a tight joint.

What’s the story? John Cena has been a face since a very long time. This has been the case mostly due to Cena’s overwhelming popularity and extraordinary merchandise sales. Cena is termed as “the face of the WWE” and rightly so, but that might have not been the case had he turned heel at some point. According to an interview with PWTorch, ex-WWE writer Kevin Eck revealed that creative had planned a Cena heel turn in 2012 but Vince McMahon had called it off. In case you didn’t know... John Cena has been the face of the company since quite a long time now. He is a record 16-time World Champion and has accomplished almost everything that a WWE Superstar can.  However, in 2010, a few sections of the fans became very vocal about Cena’s overused character and often started a “Cena sucks” chant during his matches. Cena with the fan who showed up at multiple tapings with the same t-shirt caption The hardcore wrestling fans lambasted his gimmick and criticised his repetitive move set. They demanded an immediate heel turn as they felt that a babyface Cena was being shoved down their throats. In spite of all the reactions, WWE stuck to the “Superman” gimmick for Cena. The company earned a number of deals using Cena’s popularity and took various steps to maintain the sellability of their most valuable commodity. The heart of the matter Ex-WWE writer Kevin Eck discussed how the creative almost got approval from Vince McMahon to turn Cena heel in 2012. He was quoted as saying the following: “We were very close. We had Vince sign off on it at one point and Cena was on board to do it.  We started making plans for it and then Vince got cold feet “. He further added, “we had signed an exclusive Cena merchandise deal with Walmart”. Eck stated that the main reason for Cena not turning heel was because Vince McMahon felt that they didn’t have anyone to replace Cena. Punk was over with the fans back then but according to Eck, McMahon felt that he wasn’t the right replacement. Also read:  WWE News: Stephanie McMahon wanted to book John Cena as a heel in the past Randy Orton was another big Superstar but due to his hatred for fans, he wasn’t considered as well.  Sheamus was rising at that time and Eck said that there were serious efforts put in to make Sheamus the next top babyface at one point but the booking decisions taken by Vince McMahon did little to help the cause. What’s next? John Cena is set to face The Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania 33 with his girlfriend Nikki Bella in a mixed gender match. There are reports suggesting that Cena will take a hiatus after ‘Mania to fulfil his other commitments. Author’s Take Cena has transitioned into a part-timer and takes up various projects outside WWE.  With such a schedule, it is difficult for him to lead the company as the top face. He has found his place successfully in the entertainment industry and could be on the verge of making a successful career transition similar to the Rock. In 2012, McMahon believed that there was no direct replacement for the Cenation leader but it is not the case now. New promising talents such as Reigns, Rollins and Balor have emerged who show potential to be the torchbearers of the WWE for many coming years. I have a feeling that a John Cena heel turn will still happen sooner than later.  Send us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com Recommended Fetching more content...

Maggi, a former state governor and a billionaire soy farmer, has told a Senate Committee that his main concern is that China and Hong Kong have not yet taken a definitive stance on their bans of meat from Brazil, the world's biggest producer of beef and poultry. China and Hong Kong are the top two importers of Brazilian meats, in 2016 buying nearly one-third of the $US14 billion ($A18.3 billion) worth of meat that Latin America's largest economy exported. Maggi, speaking before a joint Senate committee, told lawmakers that if the government does not take quick action to tamp down the scandal, it could take Brazil up to five years to recoup the global market share it would lose. The minister added that before the police investigation was made public earlier in March, Brazil typically exported $US64 million worth of meat a day, but that figure dropped to $US74,000 on Tuesday. The two-year investigation dubbed "Weak Flesh" has lodged accusations against more than 100 people, mostly health inspectors, for taking bribes and allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents, or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all. The investigation by Brazil's federal police comes amid a sprawling three-year investigation into billions of dollars in political kickbacks paid by construction giants to win contracts with state-controlled firms, especially oil company Petrobras. Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland and South Africa have all announced partial or all-out bans on Brazilian meat imports, following measures similar to those taken by China, the European Union, South Korea and Chile. The industry took a domestic hit on Wednesday, as Walmart Brasil said in a statement that it had suspended the sale of all products from 21 processing plants named so far by police as being under investigation. The Brazilian government had already banned exports from those 21 plants - but allowed them to continue production and sales to the domestic market, a move that has angered some watchdog groups. "Is the health of a Brazilian consumer not worth the same as that of a foreigner?" said Sonia Amaro, head of institutional relations at the Proteste consumer protection group. "Brazilian industry has a history of this, of offering inferior or dangerous products to domestic customers while sending better goods overseas." Maggi and other government leaders have aggressively tried to assure the public that this is not the case and that the meat supply does not pose any health risks. They say the problems uncovered by police are isolated events, that those involved will be fired, and that the investigation focuses mostly on corruption, not tainted products. But Rafael Alcadipani, a professor of organisational studies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, rejects the government's argument. He said too little was known about the findings of the ongoing investigation, and that corruption was possibly a worse finding than batches of rotten meat. If inspectors were paid to not do their jobs, it is impossible to know if putrid products entered the market, Alcadipani said. "Because Brazil has the world's biggest meatpackers, those businesses have huge influence with the government, so the government will go to all lengths to protect them," he said. "Officials are clearly trying to focus attention away from the central question, which is whether or not there is systematic corruption in the sanitary system. Only allowing the investigation to play out will answer that." Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty. What to read next When is a $300 dryer not a good deal?

News sign-up Google 'can't guarantee' ad safety News, 27 March 2017 Google "can't guarantee" that ads on YouTube - and other platforms it uses to serve client messages - will not appear against inappropriate content, according to a leading executive from the company. Eric Schmidt – the Chairman of Alphabet, the holding group that houses Google – discussed this issue, which has recently seen major US marketers from AT&T to JPMorgan suspend ads on YouTube, during an interview on Fox Business. "We match ads and the content. But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," he said. "Because the ads come from everywhere, every once in a while an ad will come in – that someone was trying to sneak it in, if you will – [and] get underneath our rules and violate our terms of service. "So we can't guarantee it, but we can get pretty close." Schmidt outlined some steps the organisation has taken to address this situation. "We've had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time. So I think we're going to be OK," he said. More broadly, the former Google CEO suggested concerns about pairing ads and content – as with fake news – represents a "ranking problem" which requires a certain type of solution. "It should be possible for computers to detect malicious, misleading and incorrect information – and, essentially, have you not see it," he said. "We're not arguing for censorship. We're arguing: just take it off the page. Put it somewhere else. Make it harder to find." Having originated in the UK, the pressure to achieve this aim is rapidly ramping up in the US, where blue-chip marketers like Verizon and Johnson & Johnson have joined the ranks of companies pressing for tighter brand safety measures, along with PepsiCo, Starbucks and Walmart. And Bob Liodice, President/CEO of trade body the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), similarly called for greater protection in this area. "Several" of the ANA's members, he reported, have suspended ads on YouTube and Google websites.  "Their concerns for their brands' well-being is rational, appropriate and warranted. [The] ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members. No marketer should ever place its brand at risk," he said. Liodice also linked the debate to wider failings observable across the digital space. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that [the] ANA – and others – have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity. A dearth of trust and a need for verification lie at the heart of these problems," he said. According to the Financial Times, GroupM, one of the world's biggest media buyers, is also now demanding premium space on Google properties at a discounted price. Rob Norman, Chief Digital Officer for GroupM, said that "constant dialogue with Google" had included the possibility of reduced rates for premium advertising inventory to offer brands more security and avoid them appearing next to inappropriate YouTube content. An equity research team at Liberum, the investment and brokerage firm, estimates that over 250 advertisers have now pulled their ads from YouTube.   Data sourced from Fox Business, ANA, MediaPost; additional content by Warc staff Sign up for daily news Latest News Vietnamese FMCG brands squeezed out News Newsbrands' context drives profit for advertisers News Global internet adspend to pass TV Opinion Life after adtech?

In discussions about how to deal with the fear and alarm ignited by Donald Trump, no word has been used more frequently than “normalize.” Democrats and progressives engage in almost daily protest rallies to defy Trump’s agenda. But perhaps the most successful component of the anti-Trump movement has been its willingness to challenge his legitimacy. The popular slogan and hashtag “#Not My President” doesn’t mean that people think the November election results were rigged, but that Trump’s Electoral Vote majority doesn’t translate into a popular mandate and that his views and policies don’t reflect the popular will. The anti-Trump movement refuses to “normalize” a president whom they view as an authoritarian, even a neo-fascist, who violates that basic norms of democracy and the rule of law. By poking fun at Trump and exposing his narcissism, conflicts-of-interest, and pathological lies, his opponents are undermining his credibility and destabilizing his presidency as much as any marches and demonstrations. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted February 18-22 found that Trump's job approval rating stood at just 44 percent — a record low for a newly inaugurated president. Only 34 percent of Americans considered Trump to be honest and trustworthy. Just 18 percent said Trump had the proper temperament to be president, while 55 percent ranked his temperament as poor. A Quinnipiac University Poll conducted March 16-21 found that Trump’s approval rating had dipped even further – to just 37 percent. Particularly worrying for Trump is that is support among his base is slipping. In the past two weeks – in the midst of controversies over Trump’s ties to Russia and his claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower -- approval among Republicans dropped from 91 to 81 percent. Among white voters it declined from 49 to 44 percent. The support among men dropped from 49 to 43 per cent. The effort to not normalize Trump isn’t a conspiracy. It involves separate but overlapping components that, when viewed together, reflect a powerful effort to withhold from Trump the things he craves most: public approval and esteem. Entertainment: Five nights a week, CBS “Late Night” host Stephen Colbert mocks Trump with jokes that depict him as a bumbling buffoon. Comedians Bill Maher, Samantha Bee, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver taunt Trump on a weekly basis, with no pretense to be even-handed. “Saturday Night Live’s” sketches eviscerate Trump each week, none more than Alec Baldwin’s uncanny impersonation and acerbic barbs directed at the Trump. Trump can’t stand the stings. In December, Trump tweeted: "Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad.” In January, five days before his inauguration, Trump still couldn’t contain himself, tweeting: “@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!” These reactions expose his inability to laugh at himself, a characteristic of all narcissists. This year’s Golden Globes, Grammy, and Oscar award shows included fusillades of scorn directed at the 45th president. Meryl Streep’s six minute condemnation of the president at the Sunday night Golden Globe ceremony—without once mentioning his name—so got under Trump’s skin that in a series of tweets before dawn Monday, he called Streep, who has more Academy Award nominations than any other actor in history, "one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood”— a gesture that revealed the magnitude of his vanity and the thinness of his skin. At the Grammy awards, several artists used their time on stage to rebuke Trump. Pop star Katy Perry, not known as a political performer, debuted a new song, “Chained to the Rhythm,” wearing a white pants suit (in honor of Hillary Clinton) and an armband with the word “Persist” on it (in honor of Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to be silenced by Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell), while telling the audience “No hate!” The hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest performed “We the People” while Busta Rhymes said, “I just want to thank President Agent Orange for perpetuating all of the evil that you’ve been perpetuating throughout the United States. I want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban.” While a sign saying “No Wall No Ban” flashed in the background, rapper Q-Tip joined them on stage holding the hand of a young woman wearing a hijab – a straightforward attack on Trump’s anti-Muslim policies. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January, the rock band Green Day released its music video for their “Troubled Times.” It features an animated Trump-like figure wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat while spewing hateful rhetoric, images of the Ku Klux Klan, scenes from the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements, and contemporary protesters holding signs that read “Make America Hate Again” and “No Border Wall." The video ends when someone pushes a red button and the screen morphs into a mushroom cloud. The Media: In his previous gig as the host of the Colbert Report on Comedy Central, Colbert coined the word “truthiness” not only to mock Fox News’ claim to be “fair and balanced” but also to jab at the mainstream media for trying its traditional “he said/she said” approach to reporting in which all claims are given equal weight, regardless of their validity. Since Trump took office, the mainstream media have become bolder about calling out his lies and distortions. Now, the media is prepared to challenge Trump’s comments that are outright falsehoods. Rather than simply report what Trump says—making journalists little more than transcribers—the media have increasingly questioned the veracity of president’s statements, starting with his claim that the crowds at his inauguration were the largest in history. After Trump said (during a January 11 press conference) that the public doesn’t care about his tax records, the media reported on a new Pew poll revealing that two-thirds of Americans want the president to release his returns. When Trump claimed that he had received more electoral votes than any Republican since Ronald Reagan, the media quickly reported that he was wrong. On January 23, following Trump’s claims that he would have won the popular vote if three million people hadn’t voted illegally, the headline on the New York Times front-page story read: “Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers.” In the past, the Times might have headed the article “Trump Repeats Assertion” or “Trump Repeats Claim” but in an unprecedented move, it called a lie a lie. Having broken that barrier, the Times headline writers were free to tell the unmitigated truth. In March, after Trump tweeted that Obama had ordered a wiretap on Trump Tower, the headline in the next day’s Times read “Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones.” The Washington Post headlined its story, “Trump, citing no evidence, accuses Obama of ‘Nixon/Watergate’ plot to wiretap Trump Tower.” After the nation’s two leading papers changed the norms of journalism, other news outlets felt more comfortable doing so. The Chicago Tribune and Washington Post have each initiated regular columns devoted to fact-checking Trump’s statements and exposing his lies. The media watchdog site Politifact has been working overtime to keep track of the validity of Trump’s assertions. It has discovered that through mid-March, 70 percent of Trump’s statements were “mostly false,” “false,” or “pants on fire” outright lies. Since Trump’s inauguration, the media has ratcheted up its investigative reporting about Trump’s business empire, his ties to Russia, and the right-wing affiliations, regulatory abuses, and outlandish views of many of his cabinet nominees and advisors. NPR, for example, created a team devoted to covering Trump’s conflicts of interest. Media coverage of Trump’s links to Putin and Russian businesses has put the president on the defensive since he took the oath of office. At a March 13 press briefing, NBC's Pete Alexander got into a heated exchange with Trump spokesperson Sean Spicer, raising questions about Trump tweeting things without proof "When should Americans trust the president?” Alexander asked Spicer. “Should they trust the president, is it phony or real when he says President Obama was wiretapping him?" Trump’s twitter tirades reveal that by doing its job, the media are getting under his thin skin. At 6:40 am on February 15, for example, Trump tweeted: “The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” Forty minutes later, he was back on twitter, proclaiming: “Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?). Just like Russia.” Two days later he tweeted: “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” The following week he was still fulminating on the same topic: “FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!” Sports: But it isn’t only the liberal entertainment and media institutions that are challenging Trump’s legitimacy. In February six members of the New England Patriots said they wouldn’t accompany their teammates to the White House later this year, where the Super Bowl champions will be honored by Trump. Also in February, Baltimore Orioles Vice President John Angelos announced that he would refuse to allow Trump to throw out the opening game ball. This year’s Super Bowl featured commercials promoting diversity and tolerance – a not very subtle criticism of Trump’s attacks on immigrants, Muslims, and others. Budweiser’s commercial eulogized its founder, Adolphus Busch, an immigrant from Germany, who was told, upon reaching this country, that he was "not wanted here." Coca-Cola’s ad revealed a montage of young Americans singing "America the Beautiful" in different languages, with the tagline,. "Together Is Beautiful." The ad for 84 Lumber, a little-known construction supplies firm, showed a Hispanic mother and daughter making their way north to the U.S. border, where they encountered a large wall. It's A 10, a hair-product company, warned viewers that we're "in for four years of awful hair." Consumer Boycotts: Some activist groups are directly going after Trump’s corporate allies and even trying to undermine Trump’s own business empire. Last year Color of Change initiated a campaign to persuade corporations not to sponsor the Republican convention. A number of the big firms – including Coca Cola and Microsoft – backed out in response to the pressure campaign. This year, Color of Change, MoveOn and several other groups launched an anti-Trump social media campaign, #GrabYourWallet, which is urging consumers to boycott corporations with ties to the Trump. Its website listed companies owned by the Trumps or that are actively supporting or doing business with the Trump family. It not only targeted Trump’s golf courses and hotels, but also stores that stocked Trump-branded merchandise, including Ivanka Trump’s line of clothing and shoes and companies that advertise on the Celebrity Apprentice television show, that Trump is still executive producer of. This boycott list includes Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, Zappos, Bloomingdales, Bon-Ton, Burlington Coat Factory, Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, Dillards, Neiman Marcus, Sears and T.J. Maxx. The #GrabYourWallet activists have also targeted the CEOs who sit on Trump’s business advisory council. The first domino to fall was Uber. A separate online petition sponsored by the Independent Drivers Guild, which represents nearly 50,000 Uber drivers in New York City, called on Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign, saying that Uber was built on a "foundation of hard work by immigrant workers." In early February, for the first time in its history, downloads of Uber’s app on iOS were surpassed by those of its chief competitor, Lyft. A few days later, Kalanick resigned from the president’s business advisory council. The group’s next targets include Disney, Tesla, Wal-Mart, and Pepsi, whose CEOs also sit on Trump’s business group. Yale students, alumni, and faculty are currently pressuring the university to give back a $150 million gift from alumnus Stephen Schwarzman, chair of the private-equity Blackstone Group, who is serving as chair of Trump’s business advisory group. A new online group, Sleeping Giant, targeted consumer-oriented companies that advertised on Breitbart News, the right-wing white supremacist website run, until last year, by Steve Bannon, who chaired Trump’s campaign and is now his chief political advisor. The tech-savvy Sleeping Giant activists created a Twitter account that allowed consumers to send screenshots to companies who might have been unaware that their ads were appearing next to Breitbart’s offensive content. Over 1,000 companies – including Allstate, Kellogs, Air Canada, and Nike -- dropped their ads on the Breitbart site. So did AARP, Duke University and other advertisers that unwittingly found that their brand was being promoted on the toxic propaganda site. Closer to Trump’s home, Nordstrom – the nationwide department store – told his daughter Ivanka that it would no longer sell her clothing line. The company claimed that it did so because the brand wasn’t selling, not make a political statement, but the president wasn’t buying it. “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom," Trump tweeted in February. "She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Mental Health Professionals: The comedians’ ridicule, the Super Bowl ads, the criticism by sports figures, and the attacks on Trump’s corporate allies and his daughter’s own business operation not only contribute to Trump’s declining favorability, polls show, but also drives Trump crazy. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the constant ridicule directed at Trump brings to the surface or deepens his existing mental instability. In fact, a growing number of major news outlets, as well as the Columbia Journalism Review, have run columns, new stories, and broadcast segments interviewing psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who raise questions about Trump’s emotional health, sanity, and fitness to serve as president. In 1964, opponents of Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater mocked his slogan, “In Your Heart You Know He’s Right,” with a slogan of their own, “"In Your Guts You Know He's Nuts." That year, a magazine called Fact published a poll of 2,417 psychiatrists, the majority of whom said that Goldwater was "psychologically unfit" to be president. In addition to the survey, the magazine published 38 pages of psychiatrists' comments, which including calling Goldwater a dangerous lunatic," "paranoid" a "counterfeit figure,” and “emotionally too unstable,” as well as saying that he had an "impulsive quality" and a "Godlike self-image." In response, the American Psychiatric Association revised its code of ethics, saying that it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures they have not examined in person. It became known ever since as the “Goldwater rule.” Since then, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have been wary of diagnosing presidential candidates and presidents. But this year, many of them decided to break the Goldwater rule and talk publicly about the condition of Trump’s mind. Last month, for example, 33 prominent mental health experts signed an open letter to the New York Times warning that Trump’s mental state “makes him incapable of serving safely as president.” Trump’s “words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize,” they wrote. They noted his tendency to “distort reality” to fit his “personal myth of greatness.” The added that “Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions.” Their letter warns that Trump’s "grave emotional instability" makes him “incapable of serving safely as president." Explaining why they decided to break from the Goldwater rule, the mental health professions explained that “This silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time. We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer.” The letter to the Times reflects the growing willingness of mental health professionals to make public statements, including interviews with the news media, about Trump’s psychological condition and his fitness to be president. Of course, it is impossible to assess the impact of all this ridicule and lampooning of Trump on public opinion. The accumulation of mockery may simply reinforce existing views of the president rather than change minds. Trump haters enjoy the scorn because it confirms their assessment. Trump supporters ignore the taunts or view them as evidence of the condescension of the bi-coastal liberal elite. But for Americans in the middle, the constant bombardment of anti-Trump satire, investigate reporting about his business failings and corruption, and the exposure of his penchant for lying can only serve to lead them to question Trump’s fitness for the job. One challenge for the anti-Trump resistance movement is to raise the political costs for Republicans who remain loyal to the president and his unpopular policies. Typically, when a president’s poll numbers plummet, members of his party in Congress seek to distance themselves from his agenda. In normal times, Trump’s sinking credibility would undermine his ability to advance his policy ideas and inflict harm on Republicans in the House and Senate running for re-election next year. But, as we’re learning about Trump, nothing about him is normal. _______ About author Peter Dreier is E.P.

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said that the committee plans to move on tax reform in the spring. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady: Tax reform bill to move this spring By Robert King (@rking_19) • 3/26/17 2:56 PM Robert King Healthcare Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/headshot-robertking.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More The House aims to take action on tax reform this spring and plans to include a controversial border tax on imports, according to a top House lawmaker. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said on Fox Business Sunday that the Ways and Means Committee, which he chairs, plans to move on tax reform in the spring. He said that the goal is to go bold and significantly lower the U.S. corporate tax rate to compete with other countries. "We've got some work to do," he said. "I think we have momentum on the policy." The pivot to tax reform comes a few days after the House pulled a major bill to gut Obamacare due to insufficient support from conservatives and moderates. Republicans were hoping to get $1 trillion in savings from gutting Obamacare. Brady said that while tax reform could be difficult, Republicans should prepare to go bold since tax reform happens so infrequently. "We decided since this was just once-in-a-generation we can't go mediocre, we can't shoot for the middle of the pack," Brady said, referring to improving the U.S. corporate tax rate compared to other countries. He said that currently, America is nearly dead last in tax rates and he wants to "leapfrog America" to go near the top. The U.S. has the third-highest corporate tax rate in the world at nearly 40 percent. Brady also hinted that a border adjustment tax would likely be part of the reform package in an effort to raise revenue. A border adjustment tax is a tax on imported goods and a tax break for exported goods. However, major retailers such as Wal-Mart oppose it because they say it will lead to higher prices. Also from the Washington Examiner McConnell warns Obamacare 'regretfully' will stay in place 'at the moment' "We are just going to see how that works out," McConnell said. "We believe it will not work out well." By Susan Ferrechio • 03/28/17 3:42 PM Brady said that it is "a given anyway" that a border adjustment tax will be included, and not just because it generates revenue to pay for the tax cuts. "We want to make sure there is a level playing field between foreign products and made-in-America products here as well as abroad," he said. "It eliminates any tax incentive to move any jobs or headquarters overseas." But so far the White House hasn't explicitly endorsed a border adjustment tax. Brady wasn't worried of any rift with the White House over border adjustment. "We have so much in common with the Trump administration," he said. Also from the Washington Examiner Chuck Schumer: Neil Gorsuch faces 'uphill climb' The New York Democrat was referring to the 60 votes Gorsuch's nomination needs to overcome a filibuster.

The evening of Feb. 23, a police officer spotted a black 2003 Pontiac Bonneville driving through Hampton Township. The vehicle matched the description of a Bonneville linked to the recent passing of counterfeit bills, so the officer initiated a traffic stop on Ridge Road east of Scheurmann. The driver, 25-year-old Nicholas S. Stevenson, did not have a driver's license, but said he was driving his 27-year-old girlfriend to Meijer. Though it was her car, she was not driving as she was pregnant and experiencing contractions, she told the officer. The officer determined Stevenson's license was suspended, with four prior suspensions or revocations. Stevenson handed a plastic baggie of marijuana and his wallet to the officer, who found three fake $100 bills inside, court records show. Two of the bills had the same serial number. Police: Bay City man steals Frisbee and batteries from Walmart, then threatens deputy with knife and gets Tased Stevenson told police he passed a bogus $20 and $100 at the McDonald's on Center Avenue, a fake $20 at the Marathon gas station in Essexville, and another fake $100 at the McDonald's on Washington Avenue in Bay City. He said he used his home printer to make the bills, printing them on resume paper, court records show. Stevenson on Thursday, March 23, appeared in Bay County District Court for arraignment on single counts of uttering and publishing counterfeit bills, second offense possession of marijuana, and second offense driving on a suspended license. The first charge is a five-year felony, while the other two are misdemeanors. The Michigan Department of Corrections discharged Stevenson on Sept. 3. His criminal history includes convictions of assault with a dangerous weapon, assaulting police, possessing marijuana, fleeing and eluding police, and attempted uttering and publishing. Stevenson is scheduled to appear for a preliminary examination at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 6.

Even before the Republican health care bill died Friday, President Trump badly needed a legislative win after two months of self-inflicted wounds, stumbles and legal setbacks. And while the factors that have been in Trump’s favor will still be there in the near future — he remains popular with his base of supporters, he’s got a GOP majority in Congress and his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, is expected to be confirmed — he needs to start putting political points on the board soon or the 44-seat House majority he enjoys is likely to shrink during next year’s midterm elections, analysts said. Advertisement “He off to a slower start than the last three presidents,” said John Frendreis, a professor of political science at Loyola University who has researched the first 100 days of presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt. “The last time we saw someone who came into the White House who was truly an outsider was Jimmy Carter, and he struggled for a number of months to get things straight. And I think we’re seeing that in Trump,” Frendreis said. Trump seemed to concede a bit of that inexperience after the health care bill was withdrawn Friday, saying “We learned a lot about loyalty, and we learned a lot about the vote-getting process.” And then he blamed the Democrats for the bill’s failure, without mentioning that he did nothing to woo their support. “Trump is learning on the job,” said James Thurber, founder of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University and author of “Rivals for Power: Presidential-Congressional Relations.” “The president doesn’t know the legislative process,” Thurber said. “It’s obvious by his statements. He hasn’t thought through separation of power. They have gotten nothing done so far in Congress.” While his approval ratings are the lowest for any president this early in his first term, his core supporters like Saulo Londono, Republican Party chairman in Butte County, are sticking by Trump for a simple reason: Londono feels that the president is trying to fulfill his campaign promises. Advertisement “There’s something fresh about that — that somebody is going to do what they said they were going to do,” said Londono, who lives in Chico. “Whether you agree with him or not, he said he’s going to build the wall, or get rid of Obamacare, and that’s what he’s trying to do. He tried on health care. I, and a lot of his supporters here in Butte, are willing to give him some space to do what he said he’s going to do.” But voters may not be as forgiving next year. Typically, Frendreis said, midterm voters cast ballots on two factors: How the economy is doing and what they think of the president. While the media and the public often measure early presidencies using the mythical yardstick of what is accomplished in the first 100 days, the reality is that few chief executives since FDR have accomplished much during that period, said Jon Schaff, a professor of politics at Northern State University in South Dakota, who has researched the first 100 days of presidencies. The keys to relative success during that period are strong majorities in Congress — Frendreis calls Trump’s four-vote Senate margin “relatively weak” — and a crisis, which Trump has yet to encounter. President Barack Obama not only was backed by 59 votes in the Senate and 255 Democrats in the House through much of his first term, but the country also was in the worst financial crisis since the Depression when he took office. “Things tend to get done when there’s a crisis happening,” Frendreis said. “Obama was able to get the stimulus passed because the financial markets were melting down and Congress wanted to do something.” Advertisement And while critics say Trump doesn’t have a well-defined legislative agenda, as a candidate, he clearly outlined what he wanted to accomplish in his first 100 days during an October speech in Gettysburg, Pa. Some of those “first day” promises that sounded powerful and attractive on the campaign trail — to “label China a currency manipulator,” to end foreign trading abuses, to cancel billions of climate change funds for the United Nations — haven’t happened. Others, like canceling all federal funding to sanctuary cities, are tied up in the courts. What was supposed to be the administration’s easiest political lift — a sweeping tax cut package — is up next, say Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But it has its challenges, especially for Republicans who oppose new taxes of any kind. It relies on a 20 percent “border-adjustment tax” that levies taxes on imports but not exports. The intention of the tax is to encourage companies with offshore operations to bring them back to the U.S. and hire more American workers. But major retailers, including Walmart, Kohl’s and Target, oppose it because they say it will force them to raise prices. That price increase will hit many of the blue-collar former Obama voters who backed Trump in November. Republicans in Congress who didn’t want to be seen as stripping health care from millions of Americans and so stayed away from the now-dead American Health Care Act, may also be reluctant to be seen as reducing the buying power of their constituents. So, even though he promised a flurry of action in the early days of his administration, Trump hasn’t signed one significant piece of legislation so far — Sunday is day 66 of the administration — something his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama had already accomplished or were on their way to at the same juncture. The result: The president’s personal approval rating is in a slump — only 43 of Americans surveyed approve of his job performance so far, according to a synthesis of major polls by RealClearPolitics.com. Obama’s lowest RealClear approval rating was 40 percent, but that was midway through his second term. Still, analysts say that it is still too early to put much stock in the administration’s early stumbles. Clinton’s first few months were plagued by such a scattershot approach that his budget director, Leon Panetta, said at the time that the president must do “a better job of picking and choosing the battles he wants to go through.” “We tend to exaggerate the importance of the first 100 days. What happens is not indicative of what happens over a term,” politics professor Schaff said. “But it is fair to say he’s had an unusually low legislative output. There’s not anything that he can say, ‘Here’s a success.”’ TOPICS: Politics Want to see what readers are saying about our stories? Check out the conversations on Boston.com's Facebook Page Tips?

During an invite-only event at its MARS Conference in California, Amazon showcased its Prime Air tech as a drone descended from the sky to drop off a box filled with a handful of sunscreen bottles. While the order was planned ahead, the delivery reportedly took place without any intervention from humans. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT Watch the drone in action here: The flight purportedly marks the first time ever Amazon has publicly experimented with airborne delivery in the US – all previous tests were conducted on private properties. Back in December last year, the ecommerce behemoth triumphantly completed its first-ever drone delivery in the UK. In celebration, CEO Jeff Bezos took to Twitter to share the achievement with the rest of the world. Meanwhile, Amazon is hardly the only company devoted to pushing forth drone delivery to the masses. Earlier in February, UPS made a big leap in the same direction as it delivered its very first drone-assisted package in Tampa, Florida. Google, Walmart and Domino’s have also expressed ambitions to venture into drone-powered deliveries. Who do you think gets there first? Place your bets down in the comments. Erratum: This piece initially wrongly stated the drone flight had taken place in Florida. We’ve since corrected the piece to reflect the accurate location of the experiment, which was California. via The Verge Read next: Meet Nadia, the scarily ‘human’ chatbot who can read your emotions AmazonCESInsights Share on Facebook (402) Share on Twitter (264) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Before they vanished, they left romantic letters for one another on Cummins' classroom computer at Culleoka School. They included one message from Cummins to the underage girl which began: 'I saw you standing next to your backpack this morning.'  Scroll down for video  Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas left love notes for each other on his classroom computer at Culleoka School in Columbia, Tennessee, before vanishing. The pair are pictured in the classroom, above, in January  Elizabeth, 15, and Cummins, 50, have not been seen since March 13. A warrant has been issued for his arrest and there are Amber Alerts in place in Tennessee and Alabama  The note went on to describe parts of the teenager's body, investigators told WAAY. 'They would write the message and let it save as a draft. The other person would log in, read the message and then delete it and then write another message that was saved as a draft,' Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper said.  'If you read them you would immediately recognize you are reading messages between two people who have a romantic interest in each other.'

Share this article Share Last week, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation released a photograph of the pair taken in Cummins' classroom in January.  They appeared in the image talking over his desk. Another student at the school reported seeing them kissing on the lips in the same classroom on January 23 but Cummins, who describes himself as a 'Jesus freak', was allowed to carry on teaching.  Police in Maury County began investigating the report but he was never arrested. School board staff did not immediately tell Elizabeth's family about the allegations. It was only when an officer went to their home to investigate them that they realized what had been alleged by the other student.  Elizabeth changed her Instagram biography before she vanished to describe herself as a 'wife'. She also added a ring emoji to the description  Cummins visited a Walmart in Columbia, Tennessee, the day before he vanished with the girl. He was filmed on surveillance cameras buying dark brown women's hair dye  The dark brow hair dye teacher Tad Cummins was seen buying (right) and Elizabeth (left) Another student at the school reported seeing the pair kissing on the lips on January 23 but Cummins was allowed to continue teaching  A reported sighting of the pair was made in Corpus Christi, Texas, last week but so far it has led to nothing  Instead of removing him from teaching, staff removed Elizabeth from Cummins' class. They were however found together alone in his classroom again weeks later and he was suspended. On March 12, the day before the pair disappeared, Cummins was filmed on surveillance footage buying dark brown women's hair dye. Elizabeth, who is one of ten children, littered social media with posts about romance and love and started calling herself 'wife' on Instagram.  She made several references to a 'mission' that was 'almost complete'.  On March 13, she told family she was going to spend the day with a friend. One of her siblings has since revealed that the teenager told them to call police if she did not return home that night.  Authorities believe she may have gone willingly with Cummins, who they say has been grooming her for sex for some time.  Cummins was seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day the pair disappeared It does not diminish the danger she is now in - police say he is armed with two handguns. Other staff at the school have joined the duo's families in making desperate pleas for them to return safely.  This image of Elizabeth was taken on March 13, the day she vanished. She appears to be carrying clothes One has offered a $5,000 reward while local lawmakers have spoken directly to him, warning: 'It's time to man up'.  Elizabeth's mother spoke to DailyMail.com last week in an exclusive interview to share her fears.  She labeled her daughter's captor 'disturbed' and said she worried Elizabeth would either end up pregnant or dead. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the hunt for the pair, has received hundreds of tips but none have come to fruition.  One reported sighting of the pair was made in Corpus Christi, a coastal city in south east Texas, last week.  They were reported to have been seen in the tiny town of North Beach which sits just 160 miles from the Mexican border.  Nothing ever came of the tip-off and police have not clarified whether they believe it was credible or a case of mistaken identity.  Anyone with information of their whereabouts is urged to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. Police are asking anyone who sees a silver Nissan Rogue with a license plate of TN 976-ZPT to call 911 immediately.  Read more: Emails between allegedly kidnapped teen and former teacher reveal 'romantic interest,' says DA - ABC News Share or comment on this article e-mail 93 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

Google has been under fire from advertisers and politicians (Source: Getty) Lynsey Barber Top ministers have laid into Google, Facebook and Twitter, saying they must do more to tackle content which promotes terrorism and extremism. Foreign minister Boris Johnson labelled them "disgusting", telling the Sunday Times: "They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.” Meanwhile home secretary Amber Rudd, writing in the Telegraph, warned the tech firms must do more in the wake of the terrorist attack on parliament. Read more: Google will hire "significant numbers of people" to review content "Each attack confirms again the role that the internet is playing in serving as a conduit, inciting and inspiring violence, and spreading extremist ideology of all kinds," she said. "But we can’t do it by ourselves. We need the help of social media companies, the Googles, the Twitters, the Facebooks of this world. And the smaller ones, too: platforms such as Telegram, Wordpress and Justpaste.it." Both ministers called on the firms to take a more proactive approach to finding extremist material. None of the tech companies proactively look for such content, acting only when thy are alerted by others who have flagged it. But they have also been criticised for not acting fast enough to remove it when issues have been raised. "They need to develop new systems and algorithms to detect this stuff and remove it. They are not acting when they are tipped off," said Johnson. Rudd said: "We need them to take a more proactive and leading role in tackling the terrorist abuse of their platforms. We need them to develop further technology solutions. We need them to set up an industry-wide forum to address the global threat." She will meet with the firms this week to ask them to do more. Read more: Google's top boss in Europe has apologised to its advertising clients It comes as the advertising boycott of Google spread further, with several US brands pulling their spending from YouTube. Numerous brands in the UK pulled advertising last week after adverts were found next to extremist content. PepsiCo, Walmart, Starbucks joined AT&T, Verizon and Volkswagen over the weekend. Late on Friday Moody's warned the loss of notable advertisers from YouTube is credit negative for parent company Alphabet, but does not impact its AA2 rating. Google has promised to better tackle such content and give advertisers greater controls over where they appear, but stopped short of saying it will proactively police it. More than 400 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt is the most high-profile tech executive yet to weigh in on the matter. He told US media late last week that it may not be able to guarantee that adverts won't appear against offensive content.

Khia was born with a rare congenital heart condition called double outlet right ventricle and has an additional defect called transposition of the greater arteries. Khia is undergoing her fourth open-heart surgery at the beginning of April. It will be her 18th surgery overall. (Roger Werth/The Daily News via AP) LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) — Khia Romo is like any other 8-year-old girl in Longview, Washington. She likes to play outside, spends time with friends and attends school. But, she's undergoing her fourth open-heart surgery at the beginning of April. It will be her 18th surgery overall. "I don't want to see her go through it, but at the same time I want it to be over with and done so she can be back at home and get on with her life and enjoy herself," said Mike Romo, Khia's father. Khia was born with a rare congenital heart condition called double outlet right ventricle and has an additional defect called transposition of the greater arteries. The two main arteries of her heart are reversed and there is a hole in the wall separating its two main pumping chambers, or ventricles, causing it to pump oxygen-poor blood to her body. Only 1 in every 10,000 babies is born with the disorder, according to Seattle Children's hospital. It is serious, but treatable with surgery. Khia's family said they knew about her condition about a month before she was born. In the last surgery, done four years ago, doctors inserted a small heart valve to reduce pressure on her heart. However, the valve is failing, and doctors need to insert an adult-sized valve that can grow with her body as she ages, her father said. Khia and her family — her parents and three sisters — moved to Longview three years ago from Utah to handle a family member's Ilwaco estate. At the time, they thought Khia's third open-heart surgery, done when she was 4, would be her last. And living at sea level, with its oxygen-rich air, would benefit Khia as well, her dad said. But at Khia's last appointment, her annual echocardiogram found that her heart wasn't getting enough blood flow. At first, doctors thought they could fix the problem in a heart catheterization lab, but later they determined she needed a fourth open-heart surgery to replace the valve put in four years ago. Calcium build-up on the current valve is blocking the flow of blood, causing dangerous pressure within the heart. Her mother, Maria Romo, said she is dreading the post-op period when Khia will endure breathing tubes, numerous IVs and heavy sedation in the Intensive Care Unit. "When I was pregnant with her, we knew she had a heart condition, but we didn't know what was going to lie ahead. And now I know what I'm going to have to look at and I know what I'm going to see, and I don't want to have to look at it again," Maria Romo said with tears in her eyes. "This last procedure, she's waking up from anesthesia and she told me I'm not just her mom I'm her best friend. And so now my best friend has to go through something again. It makes me want to hit a wall." The urgency and cost of the surgery prompted the family to set up a donation fund at Red Canoe bank, as well as start a Go Fund Me account on their Facebook page. They said most of the costs are covered by their insurance, but some aren't. The family struggles financially, as Mike is on medical leave from being a Walmart customer service supervisor due to intestinal problems. Maria works two jobs, at Burger King and at Claire's in the Three Rivers Mall, to help pay the bills. The family said they'll be planning a play-date with friends before and after Khia's surgery to keep her in good spirits. Khia loves company and since she's finally school age, this is the first time she's had friends to help support her, her mother said. Khia said she's nervous about the surgery and wishes it didn't have to happen again. However, she said she's glad to have her family there to help her out. "No more after that, after I do my last one" Khia said, looking up from her IPad. "You might never have a last one," her sister closest to her in age said jokingly. Khia will have to take heart medication and blood thinners for the rest of her life, and her condition could complicate any pregnancy she may have one day, her mother said. Khia has also had dental surgery because some of her medications eroded her teeth, her father said. The family said the siblings all play well together, despite Khia's condition, and know she can't take hard blows to the chest. Khia has difficulty running and swimming, but knows when to give her heart a rest, her mother said. The family has worked hard to find activities they all enjoy, such as taking Khia to the circus so she can see the elephants, her favorite animal. Khia's surgery will take place the first week in April at Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland. The family said having new doctors and surgeons has been hard, but they're getting through it. "We're kind of going into it blind. We don't know these surgeons or any of the staff that's going to be working with her, so that part's rough," Mike Romo said. Khia's cardiologists and other medical professionals at Doernbecher's were unavailable to be interviewed. Maria said it's hard to see her daughter go through open-heart surgery again, especially now that Khia is older and can understand more about her situation. She said she still puts her finger to Khia's nose every night to check her breathing, a habit that developed after Khia's first surgeries. Despite the many surgeries Khia has already withstood, the anxiety and worry will be the same this time around, Maria Romo said. "It's always going to be the same, no matter how many they've had, one to 17 to 100, it doesn't matter. The feeling is always same," Maria Romo said. "It doesn't get easier, it gets harder." The Romos say they feel they were given the responsibility to care for Khia for a reason. Her mother said she believes God entrusted Khia to her and the rest of the family. Mike said he's anticipating the day Khia comes home from the April surgery and is recovered so that the family can take time to enjoy themselves and not worry — at least until Khia has her next echocardiogram. "All those precious moments are sacred and (don't) ever take anything for granted, things aren't ever promised," Mike Romo said. "Nobody ever wants to watch their kid go through anything like that. Kids shouldn't have to, they don't deserve it. No child out there does. For those that have healthy children that don't know the struggle, (they're) the ones that should really count (their) blessings because it truly is rough." ___ Information from: The Daily News, http://www.tdn.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Marsh said it doesn’t comment on the status of specific locations but acknowledged in an emailed statement that the cutthroat grocery industry is prompting the company’s decision to further reduce its footprint. The Fishers-based chain has not paid monthly rent at the locations since fall, per lawsuits filed this year by property owners. They’re attempting to collect a total of at least $480,000 in unpaid rent and property taxes, in addition to other expenses. The chain has steadily shrunk since Florida-based Sun Capital Partners acquired it in 2006 for $88 million in cash and the assumption of $237 million in debt. Marsh, which had 120 groceries when the deal closed, now has 67. Closing the six locations where it has halted rent payments would accelerate that trend, reducing the store count to 61. Story continues below gallery 1 of 2 Dillon Howard “We are working hard to operate our business effectively in a highly competitive industry, and that means making difficult decisions about a few stores that are no longer viable,” Marsh said in its statement. “Although store closures are part of the normal course of operations in the grocery and retail industries, we are making every effort to reduce the impact on our community, customers, and employees,” the company continued. “This includes working to find positions for our associates at other Marsh store locations. Our overall goal is always to serve customers well and put our company in the best position for future success and growth.” Told about Marsh’s statement, one landlord had a sarcastic response. “It’s gratifying to see the owner of a longtime Indiana tradition taking care of their employees and communities,” said Erik Jansen, part of a Seattle-based ownership group that has sued Marsh over nonpayment of rent at its strip center at East 21st Street and North Post Road. “I trust they will be as respectful of their landlords that have kept that stewardship with them.” Another landlord suing Marsh is Kovacs Enterprises LLC, which owns the Marsh-anchored strip center at Madison Avenue and Stop 11 Road the south side. The store closed Saturday. Also, the Marsh store in the Nora Corners shopping center off East 86th Street will close on April 8, Marsh officials announced last week. Neither Kovacs nor its attorney responded to messages from IBJ seeking comment on the lawsuit. But in court records, Kovacs and the other property owners assert they brought their cases after Marsh fell at least two months behind on rent. Veteran grocery analyst David Livingston said Marsh’s trail of unpaid bills reflects that it is an “ineffectual operator.” “The fact that it’s a multiple number of cases would indicate that there’s probably some cash-flow problems,” said Livingston, who runs DJL Research in Waukesha, Wisconsin. “I just don’t know of any viable company that arbitrarily starts to withhold rent.” Marsh, founded by the Marsh family in 1931, has struggled to compete in recent years in the face of withering competition from Kroger, Meijer, Walmart and other larger chains. Except for the closing of the southside store, locations where lawsuits say Marsh is no longer paying rent are concentrated on the east and west sides. The addresses are 2135 N. Post Road, 7481 Shadeland Ave., 6243 E. Washington St., 5104 N. Franklin Road, and 35 N. Lynhurst Drive. Marsh is also facing an unpaid-rent lawsuit filed by the landlord for a Shelbyville store that closed in 2011. Court documents say Marsh stopped paying on its lease in December, after failing for years to find a tenant to assume its obligations. Veteran bankruptcy attorney Henry Efroymson said the company’s actions suggest financial pressures are escalating. “It’s sort of a recipe for a potential bankruptcy,” said Efroymson, a partner with Indianapolis-based Ice Miller LLP. “The fact that there are several payment defaults on leases would just confirm that suspicion.” Prior to the Saturday closing at Madison Avenue and Stop 11 Road, Marsh had closed a store near Keystone Avenue and 53rd Street, opened in 1957. It was the then-Muncie-based company’s first location in Indianapolis. The store was down the street from a newly opened Meijer. Marsh said in July that it has been boosting its competitiveness with an aggressive store-renovation program. It said it upgraded 25 stores over the last two years and that another 20 were in the planning stages. But not all contractors have been paid for their work, according to mechanic’s liens filed by contractors, further illustrating Marsh’s financial problems. Local mechanical contractor DEEM LLC filed liens in December and January on unpaid bills totaling $63,706. Other lien filings include Edwards Electrical & Mechanical on Shadeland Avenue, seeking to collect $32,730, and Gordon Plumbing Inc. in the Castleton area, on unpaid bills totaling $26,401. Sun, with more than $9 billion in capital under management, has the financial firepower to rescue Marsh if it chooses. But private equity firms, like any investor, aren’t prone to put in additional cash unless they’re confident they’ll earn a return on it. Private equity firms typically seek to sell off the companies they buy within six years. But Sun’s underinvestment in the stores has left it unable to attract a buyout offer from a competing chain, Livingston said. “That ship has sailed,” he said.

According to KTLA, the decision to close the stores was taken following a sharp decline in sales in the previous year. GameStop’s decision of closing down several of its stores also resulted in a sharp drop in the share prices of the company with shares falling more than 12 percent on Friday afternoon. In fact, across 2016, shares of GameStop fell by more than 31 percent. Digital downloads killed 150 GameStop stores https://t.co/MHoF3rMIhZ pic.twitter.com/IVLeVxDKax — Engadget (@engadget) March 26, 2017 GameStop reportedly owns over 7,500 brick and mortar retail stores across the world – with more than 4,400 stores in the U.S alone. While the company did not say the exact number of stores that would be closed, company officials put out an estimated figure of 2 percent to 3 percent of its stores. This means at the most, at least 190 GameStop stores would be affected by the decision. According to GameStop CEO Paul Raines, the decision to close their stores was not an easy one. The company is, however, forced to do so because, in the fourth quarter of 2016, sales of video games hardware from GameStop fell by more than 29 percent while the sales of new software saw a 19.3 percent decline. “We encountered stiff headwinds as we completed the third year of the console cycle,” Paul Raines said. This also resulted in a sharp decline in the company’s sales figure — registering a good 13.6 percent drop in total sales when compared to 2015. In 2016, GameStop only managed sales of $3.05 billion. According to the company, many of the blockbuster video games on sale at GameStop encountered weak sales even during the height of the holiday season. This, according to the company, was chiefly due to the aggressive console promotions made by other retailers including Target and Walmart. In fact, GameStop went on to add that the overall video game category had become weak as consumers move towards purchasing games from digital stores or online retailers like Amazon. Another reason for GameStop’s misfortune is the fact that both Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles, the primary devices that drive the gaming market, have not seen a major update for quite some time. According to GameStop, this puts off several users from upgrading their consoles and creates a lag in business for retailers like GameStop. https://t.co/Bkiml3C1qA : #GamStop #Sales – GameStop shares plummet on reports of lost sales pic.twitter.com/kSNMByoZp2 — WEBURE (@WEBUREcom) March 26, 2017 However, in spite of the very gloomy sounding numbers, GameStop still managed to post a 44 percent increase in sales for its Technology Brands business. This wing of the company includes cellphone retailers like Spring Mobile. GameStop also did fairly well with its collectibles business division which owns the ThinkGeek brand. Sales at ThinkGeek surged by more than 28 percent in 2016 alone. Meanwhile, GameStop’s Chief Financial Officer Rob Lloyd also went on to announce that starting this year, the company will no longer share quarterly earnings. “We believe that providing only annual guidance will reduce investor distraction as we continue to diversify the company and seek to maximize long-term shareholder value.” While it remains unclear if GameStop’s decision to close down some of its brick and mortar stores would change the fortunes of the company, it is certainly not the only offline retailer that is struggling to compete with e-commerce stores – primarily Amazon. Other players in the offline field – including JCPenney, Macy’s and Staples – have all announced several store closures in 2016-17. In fact, just earlier this week, Sears – the owner of Kmart – indicated that it had “substantial doubt” whether Kmart would survive through 2017. Note that at this time, GameSpot is yet to announce the details of the stores that would be affected by the company’s decision. In fact, we do not know for sure whether all these stores are in fact in the U.S. or not.

Gowen Sr. ‘Outstanding Citizen’ works for betterment of city, county By Carol Rolf/Contributing Writer This article was published March 26, 2017 at 12:00 a.m. Comments aAFont Size PHOTO BY WILLIAM HARVEY Jim S. Gowen Sr. of Newport is the recipient of the 2016 Jackson County Outstanding Citizen Award from the Newport Area Chamber of Commerce. He is chairman of the board of directors at Merchants and Planters Bank. He is shown here in his office with that award, bottom right, and with his display of shot glasses that he has personally collected from all 50 states, left. The Newport Area Chamber of Commerce honored Jim S. Gowen Sr. at its recent banquet by presenting him with the Outstanding Citizen Award. “I was surprised,” said Gowen, 73. “It was quite an honor to receive it. “I received it once before and never thought I would receive it again,” he said. “After receiving it this time, I looked back and found the plaque that I received in 1994. That was 22 years ago.” Introducing Gowen at the banquet, on March 2 at the Newport County Club, Julie Allen, chamber director, said the 2016 Outstanding Citizen Award “is presented to an individual who truly embodies everything a town looks for in a model citizen.” Allen said Gowen “has spent many years leading and developing projects that have produced industrial growth, sparked business development and spurred tourism.” She said Gowen “has visited every state in the country but proudly hangs his hat in downtown Newport.” A lot may have changed in Jackson County since the chamber honored Gowen with that first award, but his involvement and dedication to the city and county have not. He moved to Newport in 1983 to become president and senior lending officer at Merchants and Planters Bank and quickly became involved not only in his new business, but also in his new hometown. “This is home. One thing I like about this community is that you had better not tell us we can’t do something because we will prove you wrong,” he said, laughing. “Just look at this downtown park we are developing; we are doing it all with local money. If we are able to get an art complex … a museum … we will have the only such facility in northeast Arkansas,” Gowen said. “We already have Depot Days and PortFest,” he said, referring to two annual festivals. “We already have a lot of things going, but we want to be able to attract tourists the year around. “I’m real active on several committees in Newport and Jackson County.” He is a founding member of DRIVE (Downtown Revitalization and Improvement Volunteer Effort), which is a small group of leaders determined to revamp the downtown section of Newport. He helped create a master plan for the renovation of the area and has worked to secure funds to implement the plan. Gowen also serves on the Jackson County Commission and Economic Development Fund and has been involved with Rotary Club International and the Newport/Jackson County Industrial Bond Board. “It is really vital that Newport and Jackson County become a tourist attraction,” Gowen said. “That would help with our economic development. Tourism is a big, big industry. “We have a master plan to develop the downtown park, which will include a stage and a veterans memorial. As soon as we can get it built, we already have commitments from three different groups to provide entertainment on the stage once a week from April to October.” Gowen said the stage and park would also be utilized during the annual Depot Days Festival. “DRIVE has also acquired a doll collection of more than 7,000 dolls. We are looking for a building that could become the permanent home of that collection,” he said. “We already have the Arkansas Rock ’n’ Roll Highway 67 Museum downtown,” he said, adding that the museum attracts visitors from all over the world. “Jon Chadwell (director of the Newport Economic Development Commission) is looking at an old building that he would like to see renovated and turned into an art museum that could be used for the annual Delta Visual Arts Show,” Gowen said. “That event was just held in February and attracted 2,500 to 3,000 people to Newport and featured 185 artists. “Developing an art museum would be a $2 million to $3 million project.” Gowen said the DRIVE group would also like to see the development of a project to honor the late Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., who opened his first five-and-dime store (a Ben Franklin franchise store) in Newport. Gowen said Jacksonport State Park is another tourist attraction for Jackson County. PortFest 2017 will be held at the state park June 10 and will include a variety of events, including a large lineup of tribute bands. Gowen was born in Wynne in Cross County, the only child of Scott and Evelyn Gowen. He graduated from Wynne High School in 1961 and attended Arkansas State University. “I didn’t graduate. I went for two or three years, and then I had to go to work. I went to work at a bank in Forrest City,” he said. “It so happened that a state bank examiner came to examine our bank, and he talked to me about becoming a bank examiner. I was just a kid,” Gowen said. “I sent in my resume, and it sat on somebody’s desk for quite a while. I gave up,” he said. “Someone came through town and stopped at my dad’s service station, where I worked on Saturdays, and said, ‘I recognize you.’ “It wasn’t too much longer after that, and I received a call from them and got a job as a bank examiner. I worked as a bank examiner for several years in Little Rock.” Gowen left that job and moved to Clinton, where he was president of Clinton State Bank for several years. He also served as president of the Clinton Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors during his time in that city. “I came to Newport in October 1983 and went to work for Merchants and Planters Bank as president and senior lending officer,” he said. He is now chairman of the board of directors. “This has been a wonderful experience for me,” he said, adding that when he came to the bank, it had two branches with total assets of $46.9 million. “The bank has grown through the years. We are now in five counties — Jackson, Independence, Prairie, Woodruff and White. We have 11 locations and assets exceeding $250 million. “We offer full banking services and have a full trust department as well,” he said. “Many larger banks have trust departments, but not many small community banks offer that service. The trust department is a super department, and it adds to our bottom line. “A few years ago, we bought an insurance agency. We now offer insurance and investment services through this independent agency.” Gowen said one of the best things about Merchants and Planters bank is “our largest shareholders are our employees.” “There is no controlling interest,” he said. “Employees have the option of buying stock in the company. This gives our people something for their retirement.” Over the years, Gowen has been active in the Independent Community Bankers of America, a national trade association for community banks. In 2014, he was named Banker of the Year for the Midwest Region of the Independent Community Bankers of America. Gowen has served on several ICBA committees and boards, including the education committee, and as chairman of ICBA securities. He has also been on the Arkansas Community Bankers Board of Directors for more than 15 years. He is a strong supporter and longtime board member of the Barret School of Banking in Memphis and is on the advisory committee of the Northeast Arkansas Higher Education Charitable Foundation, an organization dedicated to expanding higher-learning institutions. Gowen and his wife, Nita, have been married 22 years. They live in downtown Newport. “This is a second marriage for both of us,” he said. “Between us, we have three children.” Their son, Jim S. Gowen Jr., 48, and his wife, Cindy, live in Newport, with their son, Scott, 12. Jim Jr. is president and CEO of Merchants and Planters Bank. Jim Sr. and Nita’s older daughter, Tammy Jennings, 50, and her husband, Dr. Larry Jennings, live in Marshall. They have two daughters — Alex Coffman, 26, who lives in Jonesboro with her husband, J.A. Coffman, and their 2-year-old daughter, Blair; and Zoe Jennings, 22, who attends the University of Central Arkansas in Conway. Alex and Zoe both work at Bear State Bank — Alex, in Jonesboro, and Zoe, in Little Rock. The Gowens’ younger daughter, Denisha Young, 45, and her husband, Chance Young, live in Monticello with their 3-year-old daughter, Chloe. “We have a great family,” Jim Gowen Sr. said.

It is very disappointing that the Express-News allows its obvious bias against our president to raise its ugly head every opportunity it gets. In doing so, you promote the damaging and divisive hatred that has taken over our country. Shame on you! You have a professional duty to help maintain and encourage self-control and polite discourse. Your publication does not promote maturity or patriotism. Adele Barnett Nepotism in action Re: “Ivanka to get classified info,” Nation Briefs, March 21: I wasn’t aware that we elected Ivanka as part of Trump’s entourage, nor is she technically a government employee. According to her attorney and ethics advisor, Jamie Gorelick, Ivanka will not have an official title, yet will get a “ West Wing” office, government-issued communication devices and security clearance to access classified information ...” Scary … Nepotism at its highest. Anne Turner There you have it I think we all have finally found common ground with the new health care proposal. The three main things which we can all agree as the most important are: 1. We would rather have people die than provide them health care. 2. We want the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and his family to have the best insurance available. 3. It is more important to give rich people tax breaks than it is to make sure all families can go to the doctor. As George Bush would say, mission accomplished. Mark Porter Scary scenario I tried to imagine the dilemma of a missile launch officer who might, one day, receive a launch order from the president. The launch officer, while preparing the deadly projectile, recalls that this order comes from a man who claimed he lost the popular vote because of 3 to 5 million votes cast illegally. He recalls this man tweeting about an attack on Sweden. He recalls this man claiming that then-President Obama had tapped his phone during the election. He has to ponder the deadly seriousness of the order he has just received. Has the order been thoroughly vetted? Should he wait for further verification? This is what happens when we wonder if a president, the leader of the most powerful, dynamic and respected nation in the world, has the temperament for the job. Will our country be all right? Bobby Riley Indeed an angel With all the turmoil going on these days, it’s nice to know we still have good people in our community who will do the right thing. My wife called me yesterday in a panic after she couldn’t find her wallet while trying to check out at a local Walmart. She had previously made a purchase at a nearby Dollar Tree, so I suggested she go back there to see if it may have been found. Before she could get to the store, I got a call at home from a lady who had found the wallet in the parking lot. Vicky looked us up online based on my wife’s driver’s license information and contacted me to arrange for retrieval. She and her mom waited patiently for my wife to arrive and made the exchange. Thank you, Vicky … you are indeed an angel! Oh by the way, Vicky is African-American and we are Caucasian, proving once again that real goodness is colorblind. Jim Whitmore, New Braunfels Wide world of sweat Re: “Clump bias together,” Henry McLeish, Opinion, March 19: I agree with the letter writer on his suggestion that certain sections of the paper be offered as separate subscriptions “for those who don’t want, need or respect” the material. I would subscribe to Section A that would include the op-ed pieces, however, because I enjoy and learn from the content therein. I don’t always agree, but I come away feeling as if I’ve had a provocative conversation with educated, intelligent people. The section subscription I would decline, and would really, really appreciate it if it were offered as such, is the Sports section. I’ve had it with sweaty, hairy armpits, ugly, scraggly beards, gun show ads, escort, er, companion service ads, and whatever else constitutes the predominantly sweaty guy world glorified in the Sports section. True, I don’t have to look at it, but I’m not happy having to pay for it. Françoise Wilson, Kerrville Campaign pledges Re: “Britain’s Brexit and America’s Trump” Editorial on March 19: The final sentence of Henry McLeish’s long diatribe against Britain and, in part, the U.S., refutes his entire elitist argument. Putting the people’s interests first is what both Prime Minister Theresa May and President Donald Trump campaigned upon and, once elected, are endeavoring to carry out. John Flanagan Let them eat cake What I find most distasteful about the current health care repeal is that Congress (and we, the people) appear to have forgotten that members of Congress can exempt themselves from the very legislation they expect others to follow. And they can create their own health care programs for themselves and their families. Instead of lecturing the people on the importance of making good lifestyle choices, getting better paying jobs, and saving for future health care needs, I say Congress should waive use of their own personal health care policies until all their constituents have full medical coverage.

GameStop revealed in its recent earnings report that total global sales were down 13.6 percent to $3.05 billion. Drilling down deeper, the company said hardware sales slid 29.1 percent while sales of new software dropped by 19.3 percent. Pre-owned sales outperformed new video game sales which were down 6.7 percent compared to the year-ago quarter although one can’t help but wonder if this metric is a result of its own questionable employee guidelines. GameStop noted that the fourth quarter was significantly impacted by weak sales of certain AAA titles as well as aggressive console promotion from other retailers on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Increased overall competition from stores like Best Buy and Walmart in addition to continued encroachment from digital marketplaces have also impacted retail sales, one would think. The company said it is planning to close between two and three percent of its stores worldwide, or at least 150 or so locations, over the course of 2017. At present, GameStop operates more than 7,500 stores across 14 countries. GameStop took a beating on the stock market Friday with shares falling 13.61 percent on the news. As of writing (mid-Saturday), they’ve regained just 0.63 percent of their value.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Linda Davidson. 1 of 2 By Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan Denton Record-Chronicle The Washington Post Published: 25 March 2017 11:53 PM Views divide neighbors in rural Valley View VALLEY VIEW -- At 4:30 a.m. on a windy Monday, Tamara Estes swallows vitamin B12 for energy and krill oil for her arthritic fingers. Even with her nightly Ambien, she is always up before the sun, getting ready for a job that reminds her of what infuriates her about America. She drives a school bus on a route that winds through a North Texas neighborhood filled with unauthorized Mexicans. She picks up nearly 100 of their children and drops them off at public schools funded by American taxpayers. By her. One immigrant family lives in the house next door, and in the dark hours before dawn, they are also stirring. As the father leaves for his job at a construction site, the mother is scrambling eggs and scooping them into warm tortillas. They have been working in America for two decades without legal status, but their four children were born here and are U.S. citizens -- or, as Estes and President Donald Trump call them, "anchor babies." The eldest, Rainier Corral, 15, emerges from his bedroom carrying a book bag and a trumpet case. He's a 188-pound rock of a kid who plays lineman on the high school football team, a top-notch student who wants to study mechanical engineering at Texas A&M University. Rainier's family has always believed in the promise of America, where they saved enough to buy their own home and their kids go to good schools. But now that Trump is threatening to deport millions -- and even change the law that gave their children U.S. citizenship -- they are filled with fear. Estes, meanwhile, is filled with new hope. For years, she has felt she was living the American Dream in reverse, her life sliding backward, in part, she believes, because unauthorized immigrants take good jobs and drive up her taxes. Now she thinks her life will improve because Trump is promising to "take our country back." This is what divides them at the dawn of the Trump era: For the president to keep his promise to millions of working-class white voters like Estes, he is threatening millions of working-class immigrants like the family next door. Frustrated It's 20 miles to the school-bus depot and, as Estes drives, she flips on conservative talk radio, where she gets most of her news. She tunes to KSKY-AM (660) and Mark Davis, who is praising Trump, trashing liberals and making Estes nostalgic for better days. "I wish we could go back to a time when we could live, not just exist, when everything wasn't a struggle," she says. Estes is 59, divorced and earns $24,000 a year. With four days left to payday, she has $118.72 in her checking account. She earns a bit too much to qualify for most government assistance but too little to buy health insurance. When she broke her arm last year, she wrapped it in a $15 drugstore brace and popped ibuprofen for a month. The way she sees it, life is easier for unauthorized Mexican immigrants than for taxpaying, working-class white Americans. As her life has gotten harder, she believes the fortunes of "illegals" have been rising, and that she's paying for it. Little galls her more than "anchor babies," who are entitled to government benefits, including Medicaid, public schools and food assistance. Estes resents paying for their safety net when she feels she has none. "I can't seem to pull my status back up where it was 20 years ago," she says. "Some of it's my fault. Some of it's not." The United States has been granting "birthright citizenship" to babies born on its soil, regardless of their parents' legal status, since just after the Civil War. Congress and the states adopted the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868, primarily to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves. Over the past three decades, every other developed economy in the world except Canada has abandoned or restricted birthright citizenship amid rising flows of immigrants and refugees. But in America, it remains. In 2014, 7 percent of U.S. births -- about 275,000 babies -- were to parents illegally in the United States, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. In Texas, unauthorized immigrants accounted for a quarter of deliveries paid for by Medicaid in 2015 -- more than 54,000 babies -- according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The cost to taxpayers: $116 million. Defenders of birthright citizenship say that integrating immigrants is part of what makes the United States exceptional and that denying these babies citizenship would create a huge new underclass of people living outside the law. Critics say it encourages unauthorized immigration and drains public resources. Everywhere Estes looks, she's reminded that her country is changing. White enrollment in Texas schools recently dipped below 30 percent. Hispanics are the new majority; Pew estimates that more than 13 percent of Texas students are the children of undocumented parents. Estes wants a better-paying job but says it's hard to get one these days if you speak only English. Increasingly, the first question in any job interview is, "Habla espaÃ±ol?" So when Trump started talking about deporting unauthorized immigrants who "compete directly against vulnerable American workers," Estes went to his rallies and stuck a Trump sign on her lawn. She has come to be known as the "Trump Lady" on her school bus, which on this Monday morning approaches its first rider, a tiny kindergartner wearing a purple backpack. "Love you!" the little girl says in English to her Spanish-speaking mother. For two hours, Estes picks up dozens of children. They chatter in the seats behind her in Spanish, a language she doesn't understand. She boils inside about her tax dollars paying for their education. But she likes the kids, and she can't afford to lose this job. So she smiles and says, over and over: "Careful on the stairs." "Have a good day, y'all." Worried As Estes heads to work, Rainier is in the kitchen next door, checking his phone for news. "Quieres caf?" his mother, Azucena Reyes, 34, asks him, as she stirs eggs on the stove. "No, thanks," he says in English, waving off coffee to check the Young Turks news site on YouTube, where today's headline is "Trump's Deportation Force Unleashed." Rainier was born four months after Reyes, then 18, entered the United States on a tourist visa hoping to give her child a better life than the one he would have faced in her poor mining town in Durango, Mexico. He has always felt fully American, no different from his white classmates. But now, in this county that voted 83 percent for Trump, he suddenly hears people spitting out: "Go back to your own country," or "Go mow a lawn." Rumors about deportations are flying. Reyes heard from a friend that immigration agents were arresting people at Wal-Mart. Others say it was at a different store. Or at roadblocks. The family stays home more often now but still went to church the day before, joining 1,400 others at a Spanish-language Catholic Mass. Their pastor says many more are choosing to skip Mass, worried that federal agents might stake out the church. Reyes is worried, too, but said she and her family agreed to be interviewed for this story because they want people to better understand the immigrants who are being threatened with deportation. Amid so much "uncertainty and fear," she says, "I hope we can do some good." What's happening now doesn't seem fair to Rainier. Americans hire the unauthorized to build their houses, pick their crops, mow their lawns, wash their dishes. They're happy to take the hard, low-paying jobs nobody else wants. In return, they'd like to live without fear of being deported. Rainier says families like his are being targeted for problems they have not created. "Most of them are just normal people that are trying to get a better way of life," Rainier says. "It's one thing to deport people who have criminal records -- that's fine. It's another thing to deport families that haven't done anything wrong." Most economists do not blame unauthorized immigrants for the decline of the U.S. working class. They argue that immigrants boost the nation's fortunes by filling undesirable jobs at low pay, cutting the cost of many goods and services. Rainier's parents have worked for years cleaning homes, working in a glue factory, installing bathroom partitions, nailing baseboards. Four years ago, they pooled their life savings to buy their little house, paying $40,000 in cash at a foreclosure sale. They now pay $1,700 a year in property tax. They file federal returns on income of about $30,000 in a good year, including withholdings for Social Security and Medicare -- benefits they are unlikely ever to receive. Nationwide, unauthorized immigrants pay about $11.7 billion a year in state and local income, sales and property taxes, including about $1.5 billion in Texas, according to the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. And more than 4 million people who do not have Social Security numbers -- most of them unauthorized immigrants -- file federal tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Rainier's family has been trying for two decades to become legal. Since 1997, his father, Nicolas Nevarez, 38, has had an application pending for a resident visa through his father, an unauthorized worker granted U.S. citizenship under Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty program. Last year, the U.S. issued only 801 visas in his category -- a Mexican married adult child of a U.S. citizen -- out of a waiting list of more than 204,000. His lawyer tells him to be patient. "I'm trying to do everything right," Nevarez says. "But 20 years?" Nevarez and Reyes have no health insurance and constantly worry about getting sick, although their children are eligible for Medicaid. When Rainier needed knee surgery last year, it was fully covered. Many jobs Estes grew up in Dallas, in a grand home with a built-in pool. She even had a horse. Her mother died when she was 4. She lived with her father, a small-business owner who drove a red Thunderbird convertible. Her father died when she was 19. She quickly married and, by 26, was divorced and had two kids. She has worked a lifetime of jobs that have paid less and less. She was a scrub tech at a medical clinic, a courier carrying blueprints for a developer, a shuttle driver for a casino. Years ago, she moved an hour north of Dallas, where she could afford a tiny house on a two-acre plot carved from a vast expanse of wheat fields. Now she is almost 60, raised in upper-middle-class comfort and living in working-class stress. Estes regrets not going to college and becoming a veterinarian. On the radio, she hears that good jobs for people with only a high school diploma have been stolen by globalization and automation: China and robots. She knows that it may take Trump more time to bring those jobs back. But she's thrilled that he is moving on his promise to kick out the "illegals." By the time Estes finishes her route and arrives home, the sun has already set. Her headlights splash across her little house, and her dogs start barking. She breeds Doberman pinschers for extra cash. Minutes later, Nevarez pulls into his driveway. The daily routines are similar in these two small, prefabricated houses on a flat road paved into the prairie. Both families raise chickens and dogs, work long days for little pay and pray for better at church on Sunday. In four years, the neighbors have barely spoken. Once, Nevarez and some other Mexican immigrants helped Estes dig a grave for one of her dogs. She seemed friendly enough. But then the Trump sign appeared on her lawn, and the distance between them grew. Estes says her opposition to "illegals" isn't personal. When she needs help around the house, she says, her Hispanic neighbors offer before "my white neighbors do." She doesn't want the kids on her bus to think she is heartless for supporting deportation raids. But she says something has to change. She flips on the TV. She has recorded eight hours of inauguration coverage on C-SPAN and a two-hour History Channel documentary on Trump, which she now starts watching. "They are losers! They are babies!" Trump is shouting. She laughs. He sure is entertaining. Trump's booming voice fills her small house: "The working class is going to strike back!" "Yes," Estes says. "Yes!"

Governor after governor proposed what they considered the answer to upstate's economic woes, but program after program came up short. Gov. Andrew Cuomo was determined to change that when he took office in 2011. Cuomo has increased state subsidies, launched several bold initiatives and crisscrossed the state to announce state-funded projects he frequently described as "game-changers." "The past four years we have focused on upstate New York and economic development like never before," the governor said in his 2015 state address. The upstate economy remains sluggish, however. Job growth for the state as a whole wasn't too far off the national average, 9.6 percent for New York compared with 11 percent nationwide, between December 2010, the month before Cuomo took office, and December 2016. But most of that job growth occurred downstate. The number of jobs upstate has increased by only 2.7 percent during the Cuomo years. What's more, 88 percent of the net jobs added upstate have been in low-wage sectors, led by restaurants and bars, employment data shows. "The policies Cuomo says are focused on upstate and he claims have improved upstate were not the right policies and have not worked," said E.J. McMahon, research director of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative watchdog group. Investigative Post, ProPublica, and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism teamed up to assess the state's economic development efforts since Cuomo took office in 2011. The work included developing a database to track nearly 16,000 subsidy deals involving 12 of the state's largest economic development programs and local industrial development agencies. An analysis of employment data, interviews with dozens of public officials and others, and a review of reports and audits of subsidy programs conducted by the state comptroller and watchdog organizations indicate the state's substantial investment in the upstate economy has not generated many jobs. The research also found that economic development programs suffer from a lack of transparency and objective analysis to determine their effectiveness. Indeed, the state does an arguably poor job of vetting subsidy recipients to determine their history of compliance with federal and state regulators. Some companies have also used their influence to tap into a variety of subsidy programs, or placed executives on decision-making bodies that help determine how tax breaks and other forms of assistance are awarded. The upstate economy has long suffered from a loss of both population and the manufacturing jobs that were once its bedrock. Experts note that economic development deals can only go so far in counteracting those forces. That hasn't stopped elected officials from trying. Both state and local economic development agencies have ramped up spending on subsidy programs since Cuomo took office. In the last fiscal year the total subsidies hit a record $8.6 billion, according to a calculation by the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group that tracks state spending. The governor has also introduced a handful of bold economic development programs, several of which failed spectacularly. His decision to empower former SUNY Polytechnic president Alain Kaloyeros to manage several upstate, big-ticket projects built at taxpayer expense has mired Cuomo's administration in scandal, culminating in criminal charges against developers and state officials, including Kaloyeros. It's also left many planned developments in limbo. The Start-Up New York program, which Cuomo said would "supercharge" the upstate economy by creating tax-free zones for businesses locating near college campuses, has been widely criticized for meager job creation despite heavy state spending to advertise it. Furthermore, the investigation found that New York under Cuomo continues to pursue costly trophy projects. In fact, no state in the nation has helped finance more of these megadeals. Empire State Development, the state's primary economic development agency, declined requests for an interview with ESD President and CEO Howard Zemsky or another senior official. Growth in subsidies While Cuomo has worked to slow the pace of state spending since taking office, the cost of state and local subsidy programs has grown. The value of subsidies awarded at the state and local level rose from $7.9 billion for fiscal year 2011 to $8.6 billion for the most recent fiscal year that concluded last March. The state's share of that grew from $3.7 billion to $4 billion during that period. Cuomo's proposed state budget for the upcoming fiscal year calls for $644 million in additional economic development spending and $1.5 billion in tax credits. The sheer number of subsidy programs helps explain New York's largesse. There are property and sales tax abatements. Discounted power programs. Cash grants. State budget allocations to build and equip facilities for companies. And a growing number of state tax credits. The Tax Reform and Fairness Commission empaneled by Cuomo reported that the number of state tax credit programs had grown from nine in 1994 to 50 in 2013, the year it issued its report. Relatively few companies reap most of the benefits from these programs. "A small number of taxpayers account for the vast majority of tax credits claimed," the commission reported. A report issued about the same time by ALIGN, an economic justice research and advocacy organization, found that only 4 percent of businesses receive subsidies, many of them large, out-of-state corporations such as Target and Walmart. The state's penchant for costly projects also contributes to New York's high spending on subsidies. A database maintained by Good Jobs First, a national subsidy research organization, indicates that of 306 projects that received at least $50 million in public subsidies since 2000 no state has earmarked more for these so-called "megadeals" than New York. The Empire State committed $11.8 billion for 24 megadeals, followed by Michigan ($9.9 billion) and Louisiana ($9.6 billion). No other state spent more than $4.1 billion. Only a half-dozen of New York's megadeals took place downstate. The six costliest deals benefited businesses located upstate and include Alcoa in Massena, GlobalFoundries near Albany, and SolarCity in Buffalo. Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, said megadeals are "guaranteed losers for taxpayers." The government can never hope to recoup its investment through increased tax revenues, he said, shifting the tax burden for public services to other taxpayers. So why do megadeals remain popular? "They're catnip for politicians," LeRoy said. Major effort's woes Cuomo's boldest initiative attempted to turn the state's traditional approach to economic development on its head by going even harder after megadeals. To that end, Cuomo sought to replicate a model used by Kaloyeros to develop a nanotechnology sector in the Albany region. It's an unusual approach that involves taxpayers shouldering the cost of building and equipping advanced manufacturing facilities for a company recruited in exchange for job guarantees. The task of exporting the Albany model across Upstate was entrusted to Kaloyeros and two state-affiliated nonprofit corporations he controlled. Problems soon ensued. The two development corporations, citing their nonprofit status, contended they were exempt from the state's Open Meetings and Freedom of Information laws. The development corporations also maintained they were not required to follow state procurement policies. The outcome? Developers who were major Cuomo campaign contributors were awarded lucrative contracts with hardly any competition. Last September, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed criminal charges of bribery and bid-rigging against Kaloyeros, top former Cuomo aide Joseph Percoco, and private developers in Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany.

By then, the wheels had fallen off several other deals he brokered across upstate. Projects in Rochester, Utica and Dunkirk have been delayed, scaled back or shelved altogether. Meanwhile, a $15 million facility built outside Syracuse to serve as a filmmaking hub stands all but unused. Mixed results Start-Up New York, another of the governor's marquee initiatives, has also floundered. State officials said the program, which allows companies to operate tax-free for 10 years by locating near university campuses, would lure businesses to upstate. The governor said it would "give New York an edge like never before" in attracting companies. But Start-Up New York created just 408 jobs in its first two years of operation, despite the state spending more than $53 million dollars to advertise it. In the coming budget year, the governor proposes rebranding the program, reducing the number of jobs companies must promise to create and revising the eligibility criteria to focus more on genuine startups. State officials still say the program will create around 4,000 new jobs over the next few years. Another of Cuomo's new initiatives, a system of 10 regional economic development councils that compete for state funding, has played to mixed reviews. A 2015 report by the Citizens Budget Commission found that inadequate reporting made it almost impossible to tell how well projects were doing. Of the fraction of projects for which employment figures were available, none created as many jobs as promised, the report found. Another report in 2016 found that although all 10 regions prioritized manufacturing in their development plans, six still lost manufacturing jobs between 2010 and 2015. "The results suggest it may be time for REDCs to rethink their strategies," the report concluded. Brian McMahon, executive director of the New York State Economic Development Council, disagrees. "Overall, I think the REDCs have been effective," he said. "They have worked because they brought together opinion leaders to talk and develop strategies around economic development." LeRoy, of Good Jobs First, said the combination of high spending and modest job growth, warrants New York an overall grade of "D minus." "Just because you throw money at the problem doesn't mean you solve the problem. The question is, are you spending the money the right way?"

John Heller/Post-Gazette Ten-year-old Brooke Koutsogiani creates slime at her home in Peters Township. By Anya Sostek / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Brooke Koutsogiani has an Etsy shop, nearly 1,000 Instagram followers, a designated work space and a corporate logo. She’s 10. And selling slime. The Peters fourth-grader is one of thousands of teens and tweens leading a gooey resurgence of the substance first manufactured as a Mattel toy in the 1970s. While slime has had many sticky subplots in American culture, from “Ghostbusters” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” to umpteen Nickelodeon shows, this iteration is prettier and fancier — often homemade with the help of YouTube videos. Brooke, like many other kids, isn’t just making slime but also selling it — to her friends, door-to-door in her neighborhood and online through her slimeyomg Etsy shop, where she offers varieties such as scented gingerbread slime, birthday cake slime and lilac-scented cream cheese slime (all non-edible). The start of the current slime craze has been hard to pinpoint. Leen Nsouli, who tracks sales of office supplies for the NPD Group, a New York-based market research company, wonders if some of it might have been kicked off by the “Ghostbusters” reboot last summer. Whatever the initial impulse, she said, slime has taken off on social media, noting that there are more than 2 million #slime posts on Instagram. How-to slime videos are in abundance on YouTube, including one with more than 2.5 million views from “Dance Moms” star and former Murrysville resident Mackenzie Ziegler (Maddie’s little sister). The ingredients in a basic slime recipe are glue, borax and water, with optional additives such as shaving cream, lotion or food coloring to change its appearance, smell or consistency. Slime is a “non-Newtonian fluid” formed when the long polymer chains of molecules in glue combine with borax, creating “bonds between the chains that lock them up so they can’t bend as much,” said Katie Brunecz of the Carnegie Science Center, which hosted about 200 kids for a “Slime Sleepover” last weekend. In Moon, sisters Peyton and Emma Perry demonstrate the process in less than 5 minutes on their kitchen island, mixing glue with a borax and water solution, adding lotion and glitter, and kneading the goopy slime with their fingers until it begins to hold together. Their first attempt at making slime in December was a failure, possibly because they tried to use regular laundry detergent instead of borax. But in January, while her mom and 13-year-old Emma were out at the Twenty One Pilots concert that she was deemed too young to attend, 10-year-old Peyton tried again at her grandmother’s house, with much more success. And she was hooked. “It was the funnest thing I ever felt,” she said, while stretching and popping a white “stretchy slime.” Once Peyton got the hang of it, she began selling slime to her classmates at Moon Area Middle School. And that got her older sister’s attention. “At first, she was making it on her own,” said Emma. “Then I figured out she was actually making money.” The two have made about $70 in profit so far, brainstorming ways to make their product stand out from the other kids at their school also selling slime. They have bought fancy cases for their $5 slime ($2 will get you slime in a plastic bag) and embellishments like googly eyes for their “monster slime,” red glitter for their top-selling “Valentine’s slime” and special luminescent paint for their “glow-in-the-dark slime.” Emma often markets their slime on Snapchat. “It’s fully customizable,” she said. “If you want red slime with glitter we will do that for you.” “Business-wise, they’ve learned a lot,” said their mother, Debby Perry, a publisher of websites including Macaroni Kid. “And they’re working together.” Money from the slime fad isn’t just going into the pockets of grade-schoolers. Sales of liquid Elmer’s glue, widely regarded as the best glue for slime production, more than doubled in retail stores in the last four weeks of 2016 compared to the same period the previous year, said Caitlin Watkins, a company spokeswoman. Sales of all types of glue were up nearly 40 percent in the first three weeks of February compared to those weeks last year, said Ms. Nsouli of the NPD Group. That demand has made glue hard to find on store shelves. Giant Eagle, for example, is recommending that customers seeking to purchase glue call ahead to ensure availability. “Like many retailers, we have recently noticed increased demand for glue that has impacted the overall availability of the product,” said company spokesman Dick Roberts. Peyton recounted going from Walmart to Walgreens to CVS in search of glue, with little success. She finally was able to stock up at Kmart, though she thought twice before letting a reporter in on that secret. “No one had hit them yet,” she said. “It was like glue heaven.” Elmer’s has increased production of its most popular slime-making glues, while other retailers also try to capitalize on the phenomenon. “We’ve Got You Covered ... In SLIME!” tweeted Office Depot’s corporate account on Thursday. Michaels has installed “Slime Headquarters” on aisle endcaps, with displays sporting glue and slime mix-ins like beads and glitter. All that slime has become a distraction in some schools, such as Ross Elementary School in the North Hills, where the principal noted the popularity of it among “kids with an entrepreneurial spirit” in an email newsletter asking parents to keep it at home. Though there have been scattered concerns about the toxicity of borax, the medical director of the Pittsburgh Poison Center said that hasn’t been much of an issue here. “We don’t see a lot of patients or kids with kids presenting with adverse effects,” said Michael Lynch, noting that it shouldn’t be inhaled or ingested. “It’s not a common toxic exposure.” Brooke, the Peters fourth grader, first tried to make slime this fall after she heard about it from a friend of her 12-year-old sister. That effort was unsuccessful, also perhaps for lack of borax, but Brooke kept at it, finding success with her own recipe developed just by feel. “I showed all my friends and they were like, ‘Make me some, I need some,’ ” she said. And so her Peters slime factory began. Brooke whips up a batch of slime nearly every day, in a designated spot in her basement that her parents directed her to after they were tired of seeing trails of slime in bathrooms, and after a failed experiment making an entire gallon at once did a number on the dining room carpet. When she started selling it, she came up with the name slimeyomg and downloaded an app to make herself a logo. Her father, John Koutsogiani, helped her calculate costs to set a slime price of $1 per ounce. She’s been donating her profits to the United Way, in part because her parents pay for her slime supplies, which include eye shadow for a tint with a pearl sheen, Japanese clay for her thick “butter slime” and foaming hand lotions for scent. As for the longevity of the slime craze, Ms. Nsouli wonders if the popularity of slime may wane as the weather gets warmer and outdoor activities take precedence. As for the Perry sisters in Moon, the end of slime is hard for 10-year-old Peyton to imagine. “Nooooo,” she said. “I love it.” To that, her 13-year-old sister shrugged. She’ll be into slime, Emma said, “as long as we keep selling.” Anya Sostek: asostek@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1308.

Gonzaga breaks through to the Final Four, eliminating last reason people had to discount the program Originally published March 25, 2017 at 8:24 pm Updated March 26, 2017 at 2:46 pm The one thing missing from the Zags’ resume as a college basketball power was a spot in the Final Four, something the Bulldogs took care of by running through Xavier. Share story SAN JOSE — With a minute to go and Gonzaga’s long-awaited but oh-so-elusive regional title finally, blissfully secure, Mark Few pulled his starters out of the game, en masse. Then he hugged Nigel Williams-Goss, and all the emotion of this Zags breakthrough hit him with the force of a Przemek Karnowski screen. “Tears, absolute tears of joy,’’ he would say afterward. Few went down the line of players, hugging each one, thanking them for the sacrifices they had made, the “leap of faith,” in the case of transfers such as Williams-Goss, Jordan Mathews and Johnathan Williams, who gave up points and minutes to join Gonzaga. Saturday National semifinal, East champion vs. Gonzaga (36-1) at Glendale, Ariz., TBA And Few had one other message that he whispered to each jubilant player as they were in the process of celebrating the Zags’ 83-59 romp over Xavier: “We might as well win it all.” Related story Gonzaga advances to first Final Four, blasting Xavier in West Regional final Everything is possible for a Gonzaga team that looked every bit the powerhouse that many were unwilling to concede them to be. All day, Few said, he had a good feeling, quietly confident that this was the team to get them to the promised land. He couldn’t help but reflect on the start of his Gonzaga journey, 28 years ago, long before Dan Monson started the Zags on one of the most unlikely rises in NCAA history in 1999, and before Few brought them to even greater heights in his 18 years as Monson’s successor. “My first year on the staff, we won four Division I games,’’ he said incredulously. “I mean, this wasn’t even possible. And each year, we got better and better, and then we got really, really good.” And now they’re legitimately great, no longer having to apologize for the conference they play in or the myth that they can’t win the big one. Xavier coach Chris Mack paid tribute to Gonzaga, lauding a defense that held one of the hottest teams in the tournament to 35.5 percent shooting, and an offense that can beat you from the outside if, as the Musketeers did, you try to take away the inside muscle of Karnowski and fellow 7-footer Zach Collins. “Sometimes,’’ Mack said, “you just lose to a better team.” That sentiment could be put on a continuous loop for a team that is now 36-1, its lone blemish a 79-71 loss to BYU. It’s enough to make a fellow dream as Gonzaga heads off to Phoenix for a semifinal matchup with either Florida or South Carolina. “I’m so impressed with how Villanova did last year,’’ Few said. “And we’re going to take the same approach. But these guys don’t know any different. That’s how they’ve been all year. Basically, we’ve had about five or seven minutes of not very good basketball, where we got away from what we’ve done against BYU, or we’d be looking at 37-0 right now.” Most Read Stories The results are in: Here's where the new Dick's Drive-In will be Prosecutor reviewing sex-abuse allegations against ‘Deadliest Catch’ star Sig Hansen Elon Musk’s SpaceX on brink of `Wright Brothers moment’ with reused rocket Best way to slow aging? Exercise, but not just any kind Richard Branson celebrates Virgin Atlantic’s entry to Seattle market, tears into Alaska Air3-course dinners for $32 starting April 2. When Xavier hit a six-game losing streak in February, Mack held a ritual in the locker room during practice one day. He gave each player a calendar of February, and then threw each page in a trash can and burned it. The ashes were placed in an urn purchased at Wal-Mart, and hauled to each practice and game as a reminder to look forward, not backward. Gonzaga can now symbolically burn all the postseason disappointments of prior years, even though it was never fair to have them obscure the monumental achievements of the program. Certainly, the roll call of past players — the Dickaus and Morrisons and Turiafs and Olynyks and Pangoses and Bells — who fell just short was front and center as the Zags went through the happy ritual of cutting down the net. Guard Josh Perkins went on the radio after the game with Matt Santangelo, now one of their broadcasters after playing on the ’99 team that first put Gonzaga on the map. “I told him, ‘Man, your team started this for us,’ ’’ Perkins said. “Without them, some people might not be in the locker room.” “Our culture is just so strong,’’ Few said. “And this was a culture win and a culture statement, and I couldn’t be prouder.” Gonzaga’s players, one after another, said they couldn’t be happier for Few, who no longer has to endure the endless questions about getting to the Final Four. Few has been steadfast in saying that he wanted to do it for his players, past and present, not for himself. But there was no question the victory was deeply felt. “Now that we’ve delivered on it, I mean, it’s just a total, total feeling of elation and happiness for these guys,’’ he said. “It just makes your heart warm to like 350 degrees Celsius or something. Maybe it’s Fahrenheit. It’s been awhile since I’ve been in class.” Gonzaga guard Silas Melson watched Few’s postgame television interview in which he lauded the team and his family but deflected praise for himself. “Coach deserves it,’’ Melson said. “Third-fastest to 500 wins, and people just totally blow that away because he hasn’t been to a Final Four. But they can’t say that no more. He puts everyone before himself, because that’s who he is. But also everyone knows Coach Few is happy on the inside. That’s a big milestone for him.” Someone asked Mathews if the victory validated the Gonzaga program. “Definitely not,’’ he answered firmly. “Gonzaga’s been a big-time program for 20 years now. People look at Gonzaga. They know what it is. They know what Bulldog means. “It’s not validation now that they’ve made a Final Four. Look at the past great teams, great players. … the Final Four doesn’t validate or discredit a season. It’s not an end-all be-all. Gonzaga has been a great program, and we’re just happy to keep carrying the torch.” Sitting near Mathews on the podium, Few nodded his head. “Amen, brother,’’ he said.

Michael Chevy Castranova The Gazette More stories from Michael Mar 25, 2017 at 8:09 pm | Print View There’s this joke I like about this guy who telephones his brother who now lives in another state, and he says, “Hey, Billy, our family cat, the one you grew up with, died last night.” And the brother gets upset and replies, “What’s wrong with you? Don’t just break bad news to me like that. Lead up to it gradually, a bit at a time. You know, sort of like, ‘Hey, Billy, I wanted to tell you, our cat is stuck up on the roof.’ Something like that.’” The first brother says, “Gee, you’re right, I’m sorry. I’ll keep that mind.” A couple weeks later, the guy calls his brother again, and he says, “Hey, Billy, I wanted to tell you, grandma’s stuck up on the roof …. ” Retail in Eastern Iowa and across the country isn’t exactly stuck up on a roof. But in some cases, it looks pretty close. In just the past few weeks alone, I’ve scoured the websites and reached out to corporate communications people to get local updates for business stories for The Gazette on what’s happening with Gordmans, Staples, Gander Mountain and J.C. Penney. All those chains have operations here in the Corridor and all have announced they’ll be shutting down locations. Each time, I’ve asked pretty much the same question: What’s happening with your stores here? Sometimes, the corporate answer was, We’ll let you know when we know. Staples early this month said it would close 70 of its stores in North America. Right now it operate brick-and-mortar locations in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City in our neck of the woods. The Framingham, Mass., chain’s hard times got harder when the feds stymied its plan to merge with Office Depot, citing antitrust reasons — to the surprise of some given the declining foot traffic for buying office supplies. On March 6, Omaha, Neb.-based Gordmans said that part of its chapter 11 bankruptcy, it would close all 106 stores, including its venues in Cedar Rapids, Coralville and Waterloo. And then there’s Gander Mountain of St. Paul, Minn., which on March 10 — after national news wire services reported it was getting ready to file for chapter 11 — announced it would turn out the lights on 32 “underperforming” stores. A spokesman told me none of the venues of the chopping block were in Iowa. And it still plans to move into the under-construction 52,000-square-foot anchor store on Blairs Ferry Road NE. On March 17, Plano, Texas-headquartered J.C. Penney finally put out a list of the 138 stores it will be shutting down over the next several months. Four will be in Iowa, but none in the Corridor. Those marked for darkness are in Decorah, Fort Dodge, Oskaloosa and Ottumwa. For each vacated building, that’s another big chunk of commercial real estate not paying property taxes. A number of industry observers have suggested in recent months that grocery stores can be the answer for luring shoppers to ailing malls — enclosed and strip alike. That’s not an always-winning solution, though — while Lucky’s Market moved into part of Von Maur’s former location in the strip mall once known as Sycamore in Iowa City, the 24,000-square-foot space that housed Fresh Market on Blairs Ferry, on Cedar Rapids’s northeast side, remains silent. All is not lost in the retail world, though. Market Watch columnist Philip Van Doorn listed 10 chains that are doing reasonably OK these days, including Lowe’s, Foot Locker, O’Reilly Automotive, Dollar Tree and, of course, Wal-Mart. And then there’s this: The CIT Retail Outlook survey, put together by the Harris Poll people and released in November 2016, characterized its respondents’ confidence level as “bullish.” While they admitted that “brand strength and popularity of prominent retailers is steadily eroding … many may not exist three years from now.” And yet, many of them at that time believed they’d have a merry Christmas, sales-wise — which they didn’t, as it turned out. Moreover, “They also have plans to continue that growth for the next three years and to increase hiring for next year, especially in the internet/mobile category,” the survey found. That’s the thing about retailers, and why we cannot count them out so easily or early. They are an optimistic bunch. For them, the sun’ll always come out tomorrow. ---------- — Our Iowa Ideas symposia continue to roll out. This coming Tuesday, The Gazette will bring the conversation to the University of Northern Iowa’s Maucker Union. The two topics will be agriculture and higher education. — Two weeks later we’ll be in Sioux City, at the Stoney Creek Hotel and Conference Center.

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this week News Nation/World Pennsylvania News Should this state college be saved? A Solomon's choice between finances, community benefit Financial troubles, enrollment decline threaten Mansfield University Mansfield University's deeply rural location has caused enrollment drops and financial problems, and those two factors put it on short list for possible merger or closure. Mansfield University's deeply rural location has caused enrollment drops and financial problems, and those two factors put it on short list for possible merger or closure. Steve EsackContact ReporterCall Harrisburg Bureau Mansfield University: A Solomon's choice between tight state finances or community benefit Except for the road itself, humanity's mark is hard to see along the main north-south highway that runs through Pennsylvania's Northern Tier. Mountains dominate here. Forest-covered peaks — oak, maple and white pine — stretch to the horizon and rock walls hem in the road that runs around, over and down mountains at ear-pounding elevations. This craggy wilderness, devoid of industrial parks and subdivisions, surrounds U.S. Route 15 for miles and miles. Just when the isolation feels thickest, the mountains give way to civilization when the brick buildings of Mansfield University appear above a tiny crossroads town of the same name in Tioga County. "This is a very sparsely populated area," university President Fran Hendricks said. "We are in a region by ourselves. We are far from an urban center." That location — ideal for the hamlets that sprang up during the 19th century's timber and agricultural booms — now threatens the university's survival in its 160th year. Decades of reduced state funding, rising personnel costs, changing demographics and a student trend toward urban universities have chipped away at Mansfield's financial stability. With the second-lowest enrollment among the 14 universities overseen by the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, the school is more vulnerable than most to a full or partial closure should that recommendation come after a systemwide sustainability study. Why some Pennsylvania public universities are in danger of closing STAFF REPORT The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education could shut down or consolidate some of its 14 universities. The state system was formed in 1983 to bring centralized state control over Kutztown, East Stroudsburg, Cheyney, Bloomsburg, California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana, Lock Haven, Mansfield,... The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education could shut down or consolidate some of its 14 universities. The state system was formed in 1983 to bring centralized state control over Kutztown, East Stroudsburg, Cheyney, Bloomsburg, California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana, Lock Haven, Mansfield,... (STAFF REPORT) Should Mansfield close, the ripple effect across this rural region could be devastating economically and in other ways, interviews and data show. "I'm from Johnstown and I know what happened because of the total shutdown of steel," said Barry Denk, director of the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a nonpartisan legislative agency that serves the House and Senate. "In this instance, when you look at the quality of life, the diversity of employment, with decent-paying jobs, and outreach any university does in terms of arts, cultural events, speaker series, that all affects the quality of life. That is the reality that must be considered in the event Mansfield does, in fact, close its doors." PASSHE consultant: Politics usually trump studies when it comes to state university closings Steve Esack Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education has hired a nonprofit with decades of experience in crisis management to lead a study that could recommend closing or merging campuses.

Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education has hired a nonprofit with decades of experience in crisis management to lead a study that could recommend closing or merging campuses. Just don't call the Colorado-based National Center for Higher Education Management Systems the ax men of PASSHE.... (Steve Esack) Mansfield, historically reliant on local commuting students, has seen its enrollment plunge 38 percent to 2,198 since the fall 2009 semester as the overall population in the Northern Tier counties of Tioga, Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna and Wyoming has decreased and gotten older than the statewide and national medians. Among PASSHE schools, Mansfield's enrollment drop is second only to Cheyney University's nearly 50 percent loss of students in the same time period — and that could put those two schools at the top of the chopping block because all PASSHE schools are more reliant on student tuition and fees than taxpayer subsidies to meet operating expenses. Mansfield is not afraid of the PASSHE study, said Hendricks, a 1979 Mansfield graduate who became university president in 2012 following his retirement as an Air Force brigadier general. "The study is very much needed and, in fact, we welcome the study," he said in an interview in his office. "We are not afraid of merger or closure and, in fact, don't think about that as outcomes for us. We do like to think about recommendations that will be forthcoming regarding partnerships with schools, regionalization or centralization of services." Fortifying state schools The state System of Higher Education was created under a 1982 law to "provide high-quality education at the lowest possible cost to the students." But Harrisburg's commitment to that purpose has waned on a percentage basis while costs have risen and the pool of students has drained. In 1983-84, state tax dollars accounted for 63 percent of PASSHE's $384.1 million operating budget. This year, tax dollars equal 27 percent of PASSHE's $1.67 billion operating budget. The largest state funding drops and corresponding tuition increases occurred after the Great Recession beginning in 2007, resulting in state funding per full-time student falling by $724 to $4,052 this year. That is nearly three quarters lower than the national average — $6,966 per student — for publicly funded universities, PASSHE records show. Gov. Tm Wolf has recommended raising PASSHE's funding by 2 percent to $453 million. PASSHE Chancellor Frank Brogan has asked for a lot more. But money isn't PASSHE's only problem. Children are. PASSHE is ultrareliant on in-state students and there are not enough of them. Between 2007-08 and 2014-15, the number of children attending Pennsylvania's primary and secondary schools has dropped more than 6 percent to less than 2 million. Across PASSHE, that has translated into a 5 percent enrollment drop over the last decade. Mansfield's enrollment decline has been steeper because school districts in Tioga and neighboring counties lost 24 percent of their students between 2007-08 and 2015-16, state Department of Education records show. By comparison, West Chester University, in the expanding Philadelphia suburb of Chester County, is bursting with in-state students. And larger research institutions such as Penn State University and the University of Pittsburgh, which also receive state funding, make up for the drop of in-state student enrollments by registering more foreign students who pay full tuition, which helps stabilize their finances, the colleges' online records show. The downward shift in enrollment is a national trend and the demographic change caught all of higher education flatfooted, Hendricks said. "There are just less students," he said. Fewer students and rising costs are the main reasons Brogan launched the $400,000 sustainability study, which could lead to mergers, closures or curtailments. The goal of the study, to be completed this summer, is to make all universities viable and sustainable, PASSHE spokesman Kenn Marshall said. "But at the end of the day, if the study recommends mergers as the only way to go, we have to consider that," he said. The final recommendation will fall to the Legislature. State Rep. Matt Baker, R-Tioga, said PASSHE needs to make changes and he would prefer not to raise taxes to get them. The Legislature, he said, would better serve taxpayers by no longer shortchanging PASSHE schools by providing money to community colleges, private universities and the large semi-public research institutions of Penn State, Pitt and Temple University. "In difficult times we need to prioritize funding for what we own first and not try to be all things to all people," Baker said. "Politically, that might not be popular but it's the right thing to do." Financially, other lawmakers say, Mansfield's and Cheney's enrollment declines make them more ripe for curtailments. Mansfield is projected to run a $5 million deficit this year, and Cheyney, which is in Delaware County, needed an emergency $8 million infusion to cover expenses. Closing either would have political as well as educational and economic ramifications, given that Mansfield is in a conservative, predominantly white corner of the state and Cheyney is a historically black college outside Philadelphia. To soften the blow, lawmakers could choose to cut programs or majors at those schools. "It gives you a little bit of cover," said Chris Borick, a political science professor and pollster at private Muhlenberg College in Allentown. "If you do one in a part of the state that is predominantly conservative then it opens the Democratic governor up to why he made the choice. If you target the only predominately black school in PASSHE ... you are going to be scrutinized in a very deep way because of the racial implications." While Cheyney students would have options in the many colleges in Philadelphia and its suburbs, Mansfield students would be more limited. The closest four-year school is about 45 minutes away — Lycoming College, where tuition is nearly four times that of Mansfield. The closest PASSHE school, Lock Haven, is more than an hour away from Mansfield. Ultimately, lawmakers could face a Solomon's choice: Is it better to close struggling universities that are losing market share to strengthen PASSHE? Or is it better to keep those schools open to protect local communities that rely on them for education, jobs and other ancillary economic benefits? Those questions, Borick said, would present lawmakers with a decision equivalent to closing a mill or a factory that might employ a whole town. "It's not like when you take a 5 percent budget cut you have to work around," Borick said. "This is life-changing for towns, staff and students." Mansfield's history Some refer to the Northern Tier as God's country, 4,000 square miles of hilly beauty. An outdoor lover's paradise, it draws tourists interested in climbing, hiking and biking, especially in and around its most famous feature: Pine Creek Gorge, better known by its nickname — Pennsylvania's Grand Canyon. However, that rugged beauty also has made economic development tough. "Not much has changed here today, Prosperity never seems to stay," singer Van Wagner wrote in "North of 80," which he wrote in 2001. "One hundred miles off the map." That's where the Mansfield Classical Seminary set up in 1857, on an eastern hill overlooking a village that would be incorporated as Mansfield borough 37 days later. That was the same year the Legislature passed the Normal School Act of Pennsylvania to set up colleges that would train teachers to serve the state's burgeoning population in communities created by mills, farms, factories and coal mines. Mansfield became a state normal school in 1866 and developed a reputation for musical instruction and a strong football program, which recorded the nation's first game played under electric lights in 1892. "Our music education and performance is off the charts," Hendricks said. Its enrollment historically has not been. In the mid-1970s, the threat of closure first hit Mansfield after it failed to meet a recruitment goal of 4,000 students. After living that history, Hendricks, upon taking over his alma mater, commissioned an internal report that used Mansfield as the case study for the viability of the PASSHE system. The 2013 report highlighted Mansfield's ongoing financial and enrollment crunches. In response to its own report, Mansfield cut staff through attrition and expenses by more than $15 million since 2013. It also launched a marketing campaign that touts its frozen tuition levels, small class sizes and its status as the state's only officially designated public liberal arts university. "We are resetting the university to a smaller footprint, but our excellence will not wane at all," Hendricks said. "We are committed to student success and academic excellence. It's what we do." Other PASSHE schools, such as Kutztown University, Edinboro near Erie and Clarion out west, also are retooling. They face the same, albeit lighter, financial and enrollment strains while trying to attract students to campuses in small or rural communities that don't have much going for them beyond the universities themselves. An air of uncertainty floats in the mountain air. "It's unsettling," Peggy Dettwiler, Mansfield's choir director, said after taking a break from teaching her students, who soon will depart for a European tour. "But it makes me put more energy into making the experience better for students." Mansfield is a key player in the economy of Tioga County, which has a per capita income 39 percent lower than the state average of $49,745 and higher unemployment than the state rate of 5.2 percent, according to the state Department of Labor & Industry. With 365 employees, Mansfield University is the county's fifth largest employer, state records show. The county's other main employers are a regional hospital system, a pipe manufacturer, a school district, a trucking outfit and Wal-Mart. The Marcellus Shale gas drilling boom helped the area financially and allowed some to get well-paying jobs right out of high school, but there's a lull in drilling activity, Baker said. That makes the university's financial presence even more important for Tioga County and the surrounding region. "We are fully aware that it would be a drastic economic impact if the university closed," said Dawn Hull, executive director of the Mansfield Chamber of Commerce. Mansfield University generated an estimated $111.8 million for the region's economy through its spending as well as the income and sales taxes generated by employees, students and businesses, according to a 2015 PASSHE study. If accurate, that economic impact would be nearly seven times more than the $16.5 million in taxpayer funds the Legislature allocated to Mansfield this fiscal year. It also would be more than 2.5 times more than Mansfield's operating budget of about $44 million. "I can't imagine the state closing the university and allowing that devastation on this community," said Tom Oswald, who owns a bicycle shop on Main Street. "This place would be a ghost town if the university were to close." "This area is just barely surviving," added Bryan Berguson, director of member services at Tri-County Northern Electric, which has an office on Mansfield's Main Street. "You take away that many more jobs ... ," he said, his voice trailing. Walking from campus to Main Street to get food, Mansfield junior Hunter Brown, a math major and football player, said lawmakers have to strike a balance between taxes and economic development. Citing his own out-of-pocket expenses, he said, most Main Street shops would not exist without students spending money. "There's got to be an equilibrium," the 20-year-old York County native said. The community relies on students for more than money, said Alana Corradi, a 21-year-old senior from New Jersey. Students lead clothing and food drives and care for developmentally disabled people as part of their studies and community outreach, she said. "Without the university the town would get eviscerated," said Corradi, a social work major. But Mansfield's enrollment downturn cannot be ignored. It's too noticeable in the halls of the state Capitol and the few streets of Mansfield. "This is a college bar and I'm able to watch the school kids and it's like there's less and less," said Alison Johnson, manager of Changos Cantina and a 2008 Mansfield marketing graduate. "Honestly, this area does not have a lot to offer kids. It's like rural Pennsylvania." The location has made it hard for Mansfield to hold on to some students, especially those not from the area. Freshman Josh Wilson of Mifflinburg, Union County, said Mansfield's location can be challenging for some students. A handful of Wilson's friends this year transferred out of Mansfield or dropped out of college because they were tired of going back home every weekend to Mifflinburg for activities, said Wilson, a criminal justice major. "There's nothing to do," he said. The solitude can also be a blessing for students like Leron Strothers, 21, of Philadelphia. The junior mass communications major said he chose Mansfield because he had to get away and it was closer than the West Coast options he had. "It was easy for me to adapt," said Strothers, a member of the football and track teams who is active in the campus Black Student Union. "I've grown to like it but everything is uphill." steve.esack@mcall.com Twitter @sesack 717-783-7305 SOURCE: Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Colleges and Universities University of Pittsburgh The Pennsylvania State University Tom Wolf Though schools' future uncertain, PASSHE says students should still apply Breaking Popular Obits Arts & Ent Biz Cycle Sports Video/Photos Classifieds 50°

Yet, it is one of the most maligned, tested, regulated, legislated, and debated food products today.  Milk producers cannot agree on what federal dairy policy should be.  Consumers cannot agree if milk is safe to drink. The government cannot even agree on what should be called milk.  A radical, social activist even claimed that milk was racist and a symbol of white supremacy.  So, with all this baggage, why do so many products want to be called milk? Soy Milk has been around for a while, but, in recent years, a whole new group of products calling themselves milk have appeared, including Coconut Milk, Almond Milk, and others.  Dairy producers have not been happy with this and have petitioned the FDA to prevent these non-dairy products from calling themselves milk. Several lawsuits have also been filed. But, to date, there has been no legal precedent or federal label requirement concerning what can be called milk.  International Dairy Foods Association president and chief executive officer Michael Dykes says the term milk on such a wide variety of products is misleading to consumers, “Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but dairy imitators do not naturally provide the same level of nutrition to the people buying them as milk does.” He added that non-dairy beverages “can mislead people into thinking these products are comparable replacements for milk, when, in fact, most are nutritionally inferior.” Dairy farmers, whether cow, goat, or sheep, can get quite emotional about this issue knowing it takes a lot less work to get milk out of a soybean than out of an animal.  What may rankle even more is that some milk manufacturers are getting into the game.  Some companies are adding milk proteins to water to increase protein content. Does this mean H2O milk will soon be in the dairy case? Last week IDFA did a flipflop and dropped their opposition to a mandatory label definition of milk. “This is an issue that needs to be resolved in the marketplace,” Dykes said. While as a free market advocate I am all for less government regulation, as a consumer I want to clarity and standardization on my food labels.  Milk should be an animal product and not come from a nut or legume.  There is enough manipulation in the marketplace today on food labels. For example, my daughter recently sent me a photo of a package in the Wal-Mart meat case with the label “chicken paws.” The pork industry has even been naming pork cuts after traditional cuts of beef. No wonder consumers don’t know where their food comes from if milk comes from a nut tree, a steak comes from a pig, and chickens have paws. If some common sense is not brought to bear on the label issue, we will soon have no idea what we are eating.

Who is thinking ? On March 27, 20174:09 amIn Viewpoint by OkogbaComments By Ayodele  Adio THE Japanese have a saying that sits right at the very core of their techonogical and economic advancement, “Bad thinking, bad product”. As long as the thinking of the leadership of a country or organisation is faulty, very little can be said of the result of the product. Clearly, we have continually shot ourselves in the foot by either poor thinking or outsourcing our thinking caps for others to do our job for us. Unfortunately for us, push has come to shove and we have allowed the raging bull into our China shop, and except we find the courage to unlearn the past, we are in for a balloon ride. According to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, NBS, 58% of Nigeria labour force aged between 15 and 24 are either unemployed or under employed. Added to this figure  about another  26.06million Nigerians in the labour force that are unemployed or underemployed. Frieghtening as these figures are, we still have a defective thinking in government that rather than create jobs, it is creating more chaos as demonstrated by the figures dished out by the NBS which said over 4,000,000 Nigerians became unemployed in 2016. There is no gainsaying that we are not only faced with a national problem but a regional and continental one, if not global. By 2035, Africa will have more people entering the  work age than the entire world combined. As such, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, has argued that Africa will need to create 18 million decent jobs yearly from now  until 2035 to bridge the gap. More pertinently, by 2050, Nigeria will be the third most populous nation on earth just behind China and India and over 60% of that projection will be in their work age. The question is who is thinking ahead and putting policies in place to deal with the ‘Elephant’ in the room. The Asians, Europeans and even the Americans are rethinking their educational curriculum with a strong emphasis on STEM (science, technology, engenieering and maths) because they  realise that future jobs are dependent on people who hold strong skills in these areas. They understand that to advance their economy, they must create the next great innovative technology and not just consume them. But, back home, we continue to scale our unquenchable apetite for consumption. Nobody is thinking about massively reskilling our people with the capabilities in the construction and repair of basic modern infrastructure. We no longer have skilled plumbers, skilled electricians or carpenters, little wonder the Chinese and Indians profit from our folly. What we see as major public policy is the marrying of widows by the state in a major commercial state like Kano and white elephant projects that benefit no one. We are still struggling to create jobs with pay packets that can hardly get people to their bus stop how much more their homes and have totally failed to unleash the creative and entrepreneurial prowess of our people. Apple has 246 billion dollars in cash. Walmart had a revenue of 482 billion dollars in 2015 alone. Even if we produced and sold 2.2 million barrels of oil per day at the best rate, we could never accumulate such revenues as these giant companies each started by brilliant entrepreneurs whose governments have set up regulatory and policy frameworks that allowed them thrive. Our leaders can either choose to look in the mirror and take full responsibility or look out of the window and continue with the blame game. As I have argued all year long, our problem isn’t just corruption, it is mental. We are led by a group of people who can’t see beyond their nose.   Okogba View all posts by Okogba → Previous Post The President’s handlers and his health Next Post Let there be light, except in Nigeria Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.
