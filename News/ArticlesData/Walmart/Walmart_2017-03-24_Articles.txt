Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.61 -0.25 -0.36% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 845.61 -1.77 -0.21% Macy's Inc M ▼ 28.17 -0.10 -0.35% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ▼ 168.66 -1.23 -0.72% In recent months, Walmart has purchased a number of trendy, online retailers, including hip fashion brand ModCloth, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and shoe store ShoeBuy. These brands' wares are very different from the apparel stereotypically sold by Walmart, which is better known for its low prices than fashion innovation. ModCloth's dresses typically cost from around $60 to $150; Walmart's dresses are usually priced between $10 and $25. "The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a call with analysts in February. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart ModCloth The addition of more "upscale" merchandise demonstrates the changes that the discount retailer has been forced to make as the number of potential middle-class customers plummet. Between 2000 and 2014, middle-class populations decreased in 95% of the 229 metropolitan areas reviewed in a Pew Research Center study. In an economically-divided America, Walmart has begun working to sell not only to shoppers looking for extreme discounts, but also to upper-income shoppers seeking higher-quality items. Walmart has been working to grow sales from more affluent customers for years, especially when it comes to e-commerce. "The nature of e-commerce, the nature of the Neighborhood Markets and other things we’re doing do create an opportunity for us to be even more relevant to customers that are at the higher end of the scale," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at an investor meeting in October 2015, reported Fortune.

However, the retailer has a long way to go until it catches up with rival Amazon — especially as the e-commerce giant expands its own apparel offerings. Amazon is predicted to exceed Macy's as the biggest apparel seller in America this year. Prior to Walmart's recent acquisitions of trendy ecommerce brands, Amazon similarly ventured into more high-end fashion, selling products by designers such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. Walmart's market value is now $298 billion, compared to Amazon's $356 billion. In February, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold off $900 million of its Walmart stock, the last of Buffett's shares in the company, after saying in 2016 that Amazon's competitors had not figured out a way to counter the e-commerce company.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:March 25, 2017 9:29 am PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube. (Source: AP) An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.

If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control.

Published on March 24, 2017. Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Most Popular Another wave of marketers has suspended advertising on YouTube or in some cases other Google properties in what's shaping up as an unprecedented revolt against the world's largest digital media player over ads placed with objectionable content. General Motors, Walmart, Pepsico and FX Networks on Friday joined brand marketers that include Johnson & Johnson, Verizon and AT&T, which earlier in the week said they've halted YouTube advertising over brand-safety issues. The Association of National Advertisers also issued a statement Friday supporting "several ANA members" that "have suspended their advertising on Google websites, including YouTube, after some ads were placed near objectionable content including hate speech and terrorist-oriented websites" "Their concerns for their brands' wellbeing is rational, appropriate and warranted," said the statement, which was attributed to ANA CEO Bob Liodice "All agency and media partners should recognize that -- above all other objectives -- protecting the brand should stand head and shoulders above everything else," the statement continued. The first priority for brands as they choose digital ad platforms, it said, is "to do no harm." In its own, much more terse statement, GM it is "suspending all targeted ads on YouTube until Google can adhere to our brand standards." FX Networks said it's suspending advertising on all Google properties after an ad ran on questionable content. And Walmart put out a strongly worded statement to the same effect. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," the company said. "We have asked Google to rectify this situation immediately. Until resolved, we have initiated the process to remove all ads from Google's non-search platforms." A spokeswoman later softened things by adding: "We have a longstanding relationship with Google, and we are confident they will resolve this issue as quickly as possible." Pepsico said in a statement that it was "deeply concerned and terribly disappointed that some of our brand ads have appeared alongside videos that promote hate and are offensive." "PepsiCo has taken immediate steps to remove all advertising from non-search platforms until Google can absolutely ensure that this will not happen again," it said. Despite the snowballing advertiser defections, equity markets aren't punishing Google much over the issue, which suggests investors don't expect major lasting damage. The stock of parent company Alphabet fell around 4% on the week, but less than 0.4% on Friday amid the lastest wave of suspensions. A Google spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment regarding the latest advertiser pullback, but earlier in the week said the company had begun "an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear."

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos.

It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Advertisement Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. ___ AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story.

After the Journal discovered their ads on videos containing racist and anti-Semitic content, PepsiCo, Walmart and Dish Network told the newspaper they would suspend all Google advertising except targeted search ads. Starbucks and General Motors pledged to pull all ads from YouTube, while FX Networks said it would suspend all Google advertising altogether. Other companies found to have ads on these types of videos said they were monitoring the situation. A Google spokeswoman did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. A Times of London investigation on March 17, which found major British brands advertisements present on videos such as one from a preacher who talked about homosexuals burning, sparked an exodus of several of the country’s major advertisers from the platform. That movement has since traveled across the pond, as Verizon and AT&T suspended their ads Wednesday. Also Read: AT&T, Verizon Suspend YouTube Ads Over Placement Next to Hate-Speech Videos The brands mentioned aren’t directly advertising with these types of messengers, but their ads are placed on their channels through programmatic advertising, which is an auction-type format that purports to enable companies to efficiently place advertisements based on the browsing histories of likely target customers. But the discovery of their content on these videos — and YouTube’s apparent inability to prevent it at this point — is unwelcome news for a company that’s positioned itself to take TV ad dollars as younger viewers increasingly watch online video, and is about to launch its own live TV service with plans to sell ads on that platform as well. In a Tuesday post on YouTube’s blog, Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler apologized for ads that appeared next to videos containing hateful content and outlined next steps. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values,” Schindler wrote in the post. “So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.” Google parent Alphabet’s stock is down nearly 5 percent over the past five days.

Currently store managers allocate hours within the times employees say they are available to work. WIth fixed which workers can lock-in the same weekly hours, and flex shifts, which will allow workers to set their own schedules from a set of available time slots. The retailer aims to have the changes, which it has been piloting at 11 stores, in place at its roughly 4,600 locations by the end of 2016. The changes will not necessarily mean more hours for workers, whose options will still be limited based on when staffing is needed to match customer flow. "Fixed schedules will provide associates a consistent schedule that does not change for up to a year," said Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg. "Flex schedules offer flexibility for associates who want to choose their own schedules from shifts that vary according to customer demand." Initial tests at pilot stores in Arkansas and Kansas showed an 11% drop in absenteeism and a 14% fall in turnover, Lundberg said.

More than 1.2 million Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club associates received a pay increase under the second phase of the company’s two-year, $2.7 billion investment in workers. Walmart is also implementing new short-term disability and simplified paid time off (PTO) programs.  As of the 20th, all associates hired before Jan. 1, 2016 will earn at least $10/hour. Associates already earning more than $10/hour received an annual. New entry-level associates will continue to start at $9/hour and move to at least $10/hour after successfully completing the company’s new retail skills and training program known as Pathways. Associates at or above their pay band maximum received a one-time lump sum payment equal to 2% of their annual pay.  Walmart’s average full-time hourly wage is now $13.38/hour. The average part-time hourly wage is $10.58/hour. Effective March 5, both full- and part-time associates will earn PTO based on tenure and hours worked. The plan includes: -No waiting. PTO is available to use as soon as it’s earned and can be used for almost any reason. -Full-time hourly associates can carry over up to 80 hours (48 hours for part time) of PTO from year to year. -Any unused hours at the end of the year above the 80 hour and 48 hour limits will automatically be paid to hourly associates in the first paycheck every February. -Associates will also keep any existing and accrued sick and personal time. -These balances will be kept separate, to be used for certain circumstances once all available PTO is used.  YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Workforce Management Walmart Tests Associate Scheduling Tool Customer Relationship Management (CRM) The Best Retailers to Work For Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Top 5 Retailers to Work For Human Resources Gap, Target, Sears and Others Investigated for Labor Violations Workforce Management Walmart Boosts Minimum Wage, Improves Customer Experience RELATED TOPICS Workforce Management Footer Social LinkedIn Twitter Youtube Facebook Footer Contact Us Editorial Board Media Kit Privacy Statement Terms & Conditions © 2017 EnsembleIQ, All Rights Reserved

Moosejaw is a online active outdoor retailer with a large web presence as well as 10 physical stores. Founded in 1992 in Michigan, Moosejaw carries more than 400 brands, including Patagonia, The North Face, Marmot, Arc’teryx and more. They have an extensive assortment of apparel and gear for climbing, hiking, camping, snow sports, yoga, swimming and biking. Moosejaw will continue to operate its site and stores as it has in the past, and will be run as a standalone and complementary brand to Walmart's other e-commerce sites. "Moosejaw has built a credible and unique voice in the outdoor marketplace, with a younger, loyal customer base," explained Sarah Engel, SVP of Global Marketing, DynamicAction. "It will be paramount for Moosejaw to protect that brand resonance and keep closely in tune with their customers by utilizing their customer data across channels." Walmart has already said Moosejaw CEO Eoin Comerford, his executive team, and Moosejaw’s 350-plus employees will continue to be based in Michigan. "Authenticity and experience are key drivers for consumer behavior," said Jon Beck, CEO, Columbus Consulting International.  "Acquiring Moosejaw, and then maintaining its corporate culture allows Moosejaw to scale without immediate marketplace rejection/perception that they’ve ’sold out.' It also gives Walmart the opportunity to study the brand and learn how it has attracted and retained its customers. Over time, integration into Walmart's vast supply chain will ultimately lead to greater efficiencies, lower cost and better, more timely deliveries for consumers." Walmart said Moosejaw's expertise will help it further enhance its customer experience, while Moosejaw suppliers that are interested in expanding their consumer reach will now have the opportunity to serve more customers through Jet.com and Walmart's other e-commerce sites. "While the synergies between the two companies may not appear immediately obvious, perhaps Walmart's acquisition is aimed more at showing a larger percent of online revenue for Walmart’s total revenue, given the growth figures for online e-commerce," said Adrien Nussenbaum, U.S. CEO and co-founder, Mirakl. "You have a few market factors that make this acquisition particularly interesting: Warren Buffett dumping millions in Walmart stock this week makes it more vital than ever for Walmart to prove quickly that its acquisition strategy is paying off," said Engel. "Additionally, the outdoor apparel industry is in upheaval, between Bass Pro’s acquisition of Cabela’s and the bankruptcy filings of Eastern Mountain Sports. Leveraging Wal-mart’s technology stack and efficiencies on the back-end to grow Moosejaw has a number of potential pitfalls along the way, but if done well could result in Walmart emerging as a true competitor in a currently disjointed market. A puzzle that not even Amazon has solved."  The acquisition closed February 13. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Fulfillment Is Walmart Poised to Triumph in E-Commerce?

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Mar 24th 2017 2:15PM Walmart is moving away from shoppers who were once its core customers as the middle class shrinks across the US. In recent months, Walmart has purchased a number of trendy, online retailers, including hip fashion brand ModCloth, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and shoe store ShoeBuy. These brands' wares are very different from the apparel stereotypically sold by Walmart, which is better known for its low prices than fashion innovation. ModCloth's dresses typically cost from around $60 to $150; Walmart's dresses are usually priced between $10 and $25. "The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a call with analysts in February. Walmart.com, ModCloth.com The move towards more "upscale" merchandise demonstrates the changes that the discount retailer has been forced to make as the number of potential middle-class customers plummet. Between 2000 and 2014, middle-class populations decreased in 95% of the 229 metropolitan areas reviewed in a Pew Research Center study. In an economically-divided America, Walmart has begun working to sell to two separate groups: shoppers looking for extreme discounts and upper-income shoppers seeking higher-quality items. Walmart has been working to grow sales from more affluent customers for years, especially when it comes to e-commerce.

Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

 Walmart's latest move confirms the death of the American middle class as we know it Kate Taylor Mar. 24, 2017, 3:04 PM 135,133 facebook linkedin twitter email print ModCloth models.Modcloth Facebook Walmart is getting into aspirational retail — and it says a lot about the American economy. In recent months, Walmart has purchased several trendy, online retailers, including the hip fashion brand ModCloth, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and shoe store ShoeBuy. These brands' wares are different from the apparel typically sold by Walmart that's better known for low prices than fashion innovation. ModCloth's dresses can cost between $60 and $150, whereas Walmart's dresses are usually priced between $10 and $25. "The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said during a call with analysts in February. The websites of Walmart, left, and ModCloth.Walmart.com, ModCloth.com The addition of more "upscale" merchandise demonstrates the changes that the discount retailer has been forced to make as the number of potential middle-class customers plummets. Between 2000 and 2014, middle-class populations decreased in 203 of the 229 metropolitan areas reviewed in a Pew Research Center study. In an economically divided America, Walmart has tried to sell not only to shoppers looking for extreme discounts, but also to shoppers with higher incomes seeking higher-quality items. Walmart has been working to increase its sales to more affluent customers for years, especially in e-commerce. "The nature of e-commerce, the nature of the Neighborhood Markets and other things we're doing do create an opportunity for us to be even more relevant to customers that are at the higher end of the scale," McMillon said at an investor meeting in October 2015, Fortune reported. Walmart's e-commerce sales have been spurred on by recent acquisitions, increasing 29% in the most recent quarter compared with the same period last year. However, the retailer has a long way to go until it catches up with rival Amazon — especially as the e-commerce giant expands its apparel offerings. Amazon is expected to surpass Macy's as the biggest seller of apparel in America this year.

March 24, 2017March 24, 2017 by Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Future business success depends on executives decoupling economic growth from resource use and environmental impacts, according to a World Resources Institute report released today. The Elephant in the Boardroom: Why Unchecked Consumption is Not an Option in Tomorrow’s Markets, says current business practices and efficiency improvements are not enough. To thrive in the resource-strapped world of 2050, companies will need to innovate new business models that deliver shareholder value and meet consumers’ needs in different ways, WRI says. Tomorrow’s markets will be shaped by a much larger human population, fewer people in poverty and unprecedented growth of consumer markets, the paper says. For example, the Indian middle class is projected to quadruple in a decade, from 50 million people in 2010 to 200 million by 2020. This demographic shift represents a business opportunity, but without significant changes, is at odds with environmental security, according to WRI. It is in businesses’ self-interest to address long-term social and environmental risks, said Kathleen McLaughlin, chief sustainability officer for Walmart and the President of the Walmart Foundation. “Walmart has committed to bold sustainability goals, including a science-based emissions target, because it’s the right thing to do for our business and our stakeholders,” McLaughlin said in a statement. “We’re working to lead and scale solutions to major issues like climate change and livelihoods, while at the same time improving efficiency and strengthening our company.” The WRI report says while more companies are publishing sustainability reports, most are not yet discussing how to meet the needs of this rapidly expanding consumer base within the limits on water, forests and other resources. It cites a study published in the Journal of Cleaner Production that reviewed 40,000 corporate sustainability reports between 2000 and 2014 and found that only about 5 percent of companies mention some type of ecological limits. Of those, most do not provide detail on current or planned changes to address planetary boundaries. WRI says the answer is to decouple business growth from environmental impacts. Efficiency improvements and recycling are not enough to compensate for market growth. Companies need also to address the challenge of unchecked consumption, and can explore solutions such as sharing economy and a focus on longevity. WRI recommends three steps for companies to take: Do the math by looking openly and honestly at dependency on natural resources and the associated limits on business growth. Take a leadership role and change the conversation with customers, investors, policymakers and peers. Transform your business to one that will thrive in a resource-constrained environment. Align corporate strategy with tomorrow’s markets within the constraints of the planet’s resources. The report comes as a growing number of businesses are employing sharing-economy business models — Uber, Lyft and AirBnB, for example — and other models that reduce resources and encourage circular economy approaches. For example this summer Patagonia will launch an e-commerce Worn Wear platform where the company will sell used Patagonia clothing and gear online, sourced directly from its customers. The retailer launched Worn Wear in 2013 as a way to encourage consumers to take care of their gear, washing and repairing as needed, and eventually recycling once the garment can no longer be used. Other leading businesses like Apple and Dell focus on recovering materials from products and their end of life and reusing them in new products. This not only reduced resources used, it also saves the companies money because they don’t have to buy virgin materials. Apple, for example, is also saving on future mining efforts by reusing recovered gold and other metals in its products. Each iPhone contains about 25 milligrams of gold worth about $1, according to Forbes. “This is a critical moment for businesses wanting to succeed in tomorrow’s markets,” says John Elkington, chairman at Volans, a London-based consultancy. “The key question: Do they embrace breakthrough business models that are fit for a resource-constrained future, or do they duck the need for transformational change and then watch new competitors disrupt their markets?” Categories Feature, ManufacturingTags AirBnB, Apple, Dell, Lyft, Patagonia, Uber, Volans, Walmart, World Resources Institute Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up “This is great for their workers, for their customers, and certainly great for the United States,” Trump told reporters Friday after meeting with Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Charter said it will invest $25 billion on broadband infrastructure and technology in the U.S. over the next four years -- a figure that would be in line with its capital expenditures of $7.1 billion in 2016. Trump has a history of re-announcing hirings and investments that have long been in the works when he meets with corporate executives. Late last year, Trump touted an effort by Sprint Corp. to bring 5,000 jobs to the U.S., hiring that parent company SoftBank Group Corp. had already announced. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and General Motors Co. have also repackaged earlier plans for presidential purposes. By aligning themselves with Trump’s pledges to protect American workers from competition abroad, companies can get the president’s ear to press their own agendas. Charter is “also excited about the opportunity, in the right regulatory environment, the right tax environment, to make major infrastructure investments,” Rutledge told reporters. The plans are “predicated on the right regulatory consistency and efficiency we expect.” Charter hadn’t previously disclosed the $25 billion investment figure. The company has long had a policy of hiring American workers for call centers and technician jobs, and Rutledge has been talking about “in-sourcing” offshore call centers run by Time Warner Cable Inc. since before Charter’s acquisition of that company last year. Trump praised Charter Friday for opening a bilingual call center in McAllen, Texas, a facility that was also announced earlier. With Trump in the White House, cable, phone and media company CEOs have sensed an opportunity to pursue bigger merger deals than they could have before under the Obama administration’s more restrictive antitrust policies. Charter has already been linked in a potential big deal. Verizon Communications Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam talked to Greg Maffei, CEO of top shareholder Liberty Media Corp., about buying the cable operator, Bloomberg reported in January. Comcast Corp.’s and Charter’s introduction of wireless services in the next year or so has sparked speculation that either one could go after a mobile-phone provider next -- Sprint or T-Mobile US Inc.

Melissa Abbott was a resident at the Northern Wisconsin Center, a state-operated facility for persons with disabilities and mental diseases. On April 8, 2016, Abbott was at the Wal-Mart in Lake Hallie, 2786 Commercial Boulevard, when she began swinging a hatchet around other shoppers in the store. The Chippewa County dispatch center received a call at 5:11 p.m. about a “disorderly female who refused to leave the store.” Lake Hallie police officer Adam Meyers arrived at the scene. Meyers shot twice, striking Abbott in the leg and abdomen. Abbott was taken to a nearby hospital, where she died. In May 2016, then-district attorney Steve Gibbs issued a 12-page ruling, saying that Meyers “acted in self-defense and that his belief that he reasonably believed his life was in danger, or that he was likely to suffer great bodily harm, when Ms. Abbott refused to follow orders and charged officer Meyers with a hatchet.” Gibbs concluded his report by stating the evidence clearly showed the shooting was self defense, and there is no reason “to establish a basis to charge officer Meyers with a crime.” The lawsuit, filed by attorney Dean Rohde of the River Falls-based firm Bye, Goff & Rohde, disagrees with Gibbs’ assessment of the incident. Rohde wrote that Meyers’ conduct and actions were “excessive and unreasonable, without lawful justification or reason, and was designed to and did cause specific and serious physical harm, pain and suffering and death.” He added that her death was caused by “the negligence of the village of Lake Hallie and or its agents and employees.” Rohde filed the lawsuit in Chippewa County Court, seeking a 12-person jury to hear the case. Rohde is requesting a jury award punitive damages to any and all defendants, that Lake Hallie, the police department, and the Northern Wisconsin Center “provide necessary training, personnel and resources to adequately protect the constitutional rights of citizens and patients of the Northern Wisconsin Center,” and that the defendants pay all attorney fees and other associated costs. The defendants have 45 days to respond to the lawsuit. The case has been assigned to Judge James Isaacson. Lake Hallie village president Wayne Walkoviak didn’t return calls for comment. The lawsuit is specifically filed against Lake Hallie, ABC Insurance Company, the Lake Hallie Police Department, officer Meyers, DEF Insurance Company, Northern Wisconsin Center and its director Jacqueline Neurohr, GHI Insurance Company and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Abbott was living at the Northern Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled on the east side of Chippewa Falls. The report includes interviews with workers at the facility, who had accompanied Abbott on the trip to Walmart. Several other shoppers and Walmart employees also were interviewed. Gibbs report also included details about Abbott’s background in his report. “She has been diagnosed with depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and a mild intellectual disability,” Gibbs wrote. “She has been hospitalized in the past at Sacred Heart Hospital and Winnebago Mental Health Institute. Due to Melissa’s aggressive behaviors, multiple physical and mechanical restrains have been used to manage her challenging behaviors.” Abbot has threatened to kill the staff at the Excel Treatment Center, and wrote in her journal a desire that “when the cops get called I will grab their gun and there will be a shootout between me and the cops.” Meyers, who has been employed as a Lake Hallie police officer since Oct. 8, 2008, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, which is standard protocol.

Last week Walmart acquired hipster clothing website ModCloth. In February it bought outdoor specialty retailer Moosejaw and the month before, online shoe seller ShoeBuy. The small deals give Walmart access to new groups of shoppers and brands that have shied away from the retail giant, which has struggled with mostly sluggish online sales growth the past two years. Walmart plans to let the retailers run as separate entities, the first time it has attempted to build new e-commerce brands in the U.S. However, some of the deals shed light on the extent of Walmart’s wider image challenges and the balancing act faced by small e-commerce startups looking for a payday. After news of the ModCloth deal surfaced last week, shoppers took to Facebook and Twitter to critique Walmart’s image as out of line with ModCloth’s feminist, socially liberal and plus-size inclusive branding. “Walmart has such a terrible track record. They are so adamantly anti-union,” said Aimee Ledwell, a 41-year-old teacher who lives in Maynard, Mass., and owns about 15 dresses purchased on the site. After news of the deal, she said she erased the ModCloth app from her phone. Related Articles February 15, 2017 Walmart buys outdoor clothes and gear seller Moosejaw January 17, 2017 Walmart to close Neighborhood Market in south Denver December 15, 2016 Walmart shoppers can win prizes for stashing cash “Walmart today is very different than some of the perceptions people still hold,” said a company spokesman. “All the things that made customers love these brands in the first place are not going away, they’ll only get stronger,” he said. The buying spree started after Walmart bought Jet.com Inc. six months ago for $3.3 billion, installing the site’s founder Marc Lore at the head of its U.S. online operations. “Assortment is driving a lot of these acquisitions,” Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon told investors last week. “There are some suppliers that don’t want to sell on Walmart.” Walmart also wants the talent and product expertise the employees provide, executives say. Moosejaw, known for its irreverent marketing and loyal Michigan following, gives Walmart access to outdoor brands like Patagonia, Arc’teryx and North Face, even if they aren’t sold through Walmart directly. Its chief executive, Eoin Comerford, will take charge of the outdoor category on all Walmart websites. ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy are part of a growing group of online retailers confronting the challenge of competing with the fast shipping and large assortment of Amazon or increasingly savvy suppliers selling directly to shoppers. ModCloth’s traffic and revenue has been weak in recent years, said people familiar with the financial statements. It had a large debt payment coming due, said one of these people. Walmart bought the company for less than the roughly $75 million ModCloth raised in venture capital, plus its debt, said this person. Last week the San Francisco-based firm’s co-founders Eric Koger and Susan Gregg Koger sent an email to a small group of people who hold employee stock entitled “The death of ModCloth’s common stock.” Employees and the co-founders won’t make any money from the sale, Koger wrote in the email, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. “It just is what it f—ing is.” The couple didn’t respond to requests for comment. Walmart’s purchase price is “along the same lines” as other recent acquisitions, said a spokesman. Walmart said it paid $51 million for Moosejaw and around $70 million for ShoeBuy. The acquisition strategy is being driven largely by Lore, who wants to take on Amazon directly and grab market share faster. Asked at an industry event Monday if Walmart would be happy as the second-largest U.S. online retailer after Amazon, Lore responded, “winning is winning.” More acquisitions are coming, he said. In the three months ended Jan. 31, 2017, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales grew at a healthy clip, up 29 percent from the year-earlier quarter. Jet.com had explored a deal for Moosejaw, which operates 10 retail stores, before selling to Walmart. The outdoor retailer’s founder and family sold the company to private-equity investors in the mid-2000s. Since then the company continued to raise money and shift investors. Moosejaw’s CEO didn’t respond to a request for comment. Moosejaw shoppers’ reaction has been more muted than after the ModCloth purchase, but the news spurred debate. Owen McDonnell, a 31-year-old in Portsmouth, N.H., said he is wary of how Walmart may change Moosejaw. He likes buying his ski and hiking gear at local shops that support outdoor enthusiasts, he said, and doesn’t shop at Walmart. “I still remember when the first one was built in my area and how it has changed the community and the stores that followed.” “There has been a lot of bad press historically about the values of” Walmart but much of it is unwarranted, Lore said this week. When Jet.com executives told employees that Walmart planned to buy the startup, “upfront people were definitely concerned,” Lore said. But after getting a firsthand look inside, “people have turned the corner.” Tags:  Walmart Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Business Liz Weston: To retire right, plan to do it twice March 26, 2017, 12:29 am There’s the retirement that looks like the commercials: biking, travel, enjoying the family.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Walmart wants to help you watch your old DVDs and Blu-rays online in HD Jonathan Vanian, Fortune@JonathanVanian March 24, 2017 6:05 AM Tags: Fortune, Vudu, Wal-Mart, Walmart Above: A man talks on his mobile phone in front of a Wal-Mart store in Sao Paulo, Brazil, February 16, 2016. Image Credit: REUTERS/Nacho Doce Get out your old DVDs and Blu-rays that are gathering dust at home. Walmart said Thursday that people can now use its Vudu app to convert their existing DVDs and Blu-rays into digital movies that they can watch online. Vudu is Walmart’s video streaming service that it bought in 2010 for a reported $100 million. Unlike other online streaming services — like Netflix or Amazon Prime — Vudu customers pay no monthly subscription fee, but can instead rent or buy individual titles to watch online. In order to convert disks into digital, Vudu users scan the barcodes on the DVD or Blue-ray boxes with the Vudu apps and then choose whether to convert the disks into standard or high-quality streaming files. A high-definition upgrade with improved visuals costs $5, while a lower-quality stream costs $2. Technically, the app isn’t really converting physical discs into digital files. The new service essentially lets people buy movies more cheaply from Vudu as long as they have their old DVD or Blu-ray boxes. For example, a newly released movie on Vudu, like the Academy award-winning film Moonlight, can cost $15 for a high-quality digital file. With the latest marketing gimmick, users can get the same film for a third of the list price. Not every Blu-ray or DVD is eligible for the new service. Walmart said that it only supports around 8,000 movies — from studios like Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com. Copyright 2017 ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Walmart’s Vudu now lets you “convert” your DVDs, discs to digital version By Ida Torres - March 24, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’ve been thinking about decluttering and getting rid of all your DVDs and Blu-Ray discs still hanging around your house, you will now be able to convert them into digital copies (if you haven’t already yet). But of course, like with a lot of things now, there are several catches. You need to have bought them from Walmart, you need to be at your billing address when you convert, and you need to pay for it of course. Vudu is Walmart’s very own premium video-sharing service and in a bid to be more relevant to the market, they are offering “conversion” services for the owners of DVDs and Blu-Ray discs. Using their app, you will be able to scan the UPC bar code that you can see on the case. But to be able to gain access to this online, you will have to pay them, but the rate is still minimal compared to you buying a (legal) digital copy of the film. As part of their anti-fraud and piracy measures, when you do the “disc-to-digital” conversion, you need to be at your home billing address recorded on your Walmart account as they will be using your GPS location to verify your location and match it with your records. You are also limited to 100 titles per year on your account. Almost 8,000 movies are available for conversion, including those from Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, 20th Century Fox, Universal, Warner Bros, etc. Unfortunately, Disney isn’t part of this deal so their whole catalog (including Star Wars, drats) isn’t available. You will have to pay $2 for conversion of DVD to standard definition digital or Bu-Ray to HD digital. If you want to upgrade DVD to HD, you will have to pay $5 per title. This conversion service starts today.

Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter.

Mobile Disc-to-Digital turns DVDs and Blu-rays into digital movies with a simple scan through the Vudu app. These movies can then be viewed on hundreds of Vudu-enabled devices including televisions, Blu-ray disc players, gaming consoles, streaming players and through the Vudu app on phones and tablets. In  recent years, Vudu has seen increased demand for its offerings that bridge physical and digital entertainment, including its in-home Disc-to-Digital service and InstaWatch, which automatically sends customers a digital copy of eligible DVDs or Blu-ray discs purchased at Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. “The average movie collector owns nearly 100 DVDs and Blu-rays. We know these customers have invested a lot into building their physical movie collections,” said Jeremy Verba, general manager, Vudu. “As more and more customers create digital libraries, we are constantly looking for ways to help them unlock additional value from the movies they already own.” Mobile Disc-to-Digital works on iPhones and Android devices and is available for nearly 8,000 movies from Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Additional titles will be added in the coming months. Movie fans can convert a DVD to SD or a Blu-ray disc to HDX for $2 (€1.86). To upgrade DVDs to HDX, it will cost $5 per title. All Vudu users will receive one complimentary first-time mobile conversion. Customers need a free UltraViolet digital content ownership scheme account in order to use Mobile Disc-to-Digital. Mobile Disc-to-Digital conversions must take place at a customer’s home / billing address. Mobile Disc-to-Digital works in three easy steps: Scan – Navigate to Disc-to-Digital in the Vudu app and scan the barcode on the physical disc case. Convert – Choose SD or HDX. Submit one title or scan all of your movies before submitting. Watch – Watch your movies on any Vudu-enabled device. “Like Walmart, at Vudu we’re always striving to save our customers time and money,” added Verba. “Our Mobile Disc-to-Digital service is a key part of Vudu’s broader effort to make digital entertainment access simple and convenient.”   Related posts: VUDU on Walmart.com DreamWorks joins Walmart’s disc-to-digital service Vudu launches free ‘Movies on Us’ Walmart unveils UltraViolet disc-to-digital service CinemaNow launches digital/physical combo packages You must be logged in to post a comment Login LATEST NEWS TV Everywhere Volume 13 Issue 1 Vivendi dispute costs Mediaset €100m Arianespace postpones launch “indefinitely” France: Catch-up TV revenues at €105m in 2016 Twitter ponders paid option Vudu launches mobile physical-to-digital conversion Hispasat revenue up 4.2% BBC names Board appointments Iger extends Disney contract again DEG adds 5 new members Search Archive Select a Month Click to Select March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 0 Select a Category Click to Select Articles Broadband    Cable    Equipment    FTTH    ISP    Satellite    Telco    Test & Monitor Broadcast    Advertising       Ads       Targetted    Digital Radio    DSO    DTH/Satellite    DTT/DSO    FTA    Pay TV    Services    VOD       Catch Up       Premium Business    Funding    IPO    Joint Venture    M&A    People    Regulation       Policy       Spectrum       Standards    Results Content    app    CA/DRM    CDNs    Games    Piracy    Production    Rights    UGC    VR    Work flow Events Guest Blog    Inside Satellite    Off Message    Third Party Headline In Home    Home Network    PVR    STB Magazines    EuroMedia    IPTV Mobile    APPS    Companion devices    MNO    Mobile TV    Portable Media OTT    Connected TV    HbbTV    IPTV    Middleware       IPG       Search/Recommendation    OTT    UGC Photo Press Releases Research    Consumer Behaviour    Equipment    Markets Research Library    Research TV Channel Social Media UHD    Equipment    Production    Ultra-HD/4K Video White Papers Search by Keyword Broadband Broadcast Business Content In Home Mobile OTT Research Social Media UHD White Papers Shop Advertise Events Library Press Releases Newsletter Register About Us Copyright Advanced Television Ltd © 2001–2017 Maintained by Elrond Limited Advanced Television Cookies Policy Our Website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Home Industry Airbnb won’t find a home in China anytime soon: Adam Minter Airbnb won’t find a home in China anytime soon: Adam Minter It's never easy for American businesses to make it in China. Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the U.S. have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. By: Bloomberg | Published: March 24, 2017 5:51 AM It’s never easy for American businesses to make it in China. Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the U.S. have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. (Reuters) It’s never easy for American businesses to make it in China. Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the U.S. have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. Those stumbles aren’t dissuading Airbnb Inc., however. This week the home-sharing pioneer announced that it’s changing its local brand name in China and doubling its investment there. By any measure, the opportunity is immense. In 2015, Chinese travelers spent nearly $500 billion, and the government expects that number to more than double by 2020 as the country’s middle class expands. But capturing a major piece of that market will require Airbnb to navigate a far more tangled thicket of cultural issues than what confronted Uber and other tech companies in China. And judging by its efforts so far, it probably won’t be up to the task. In theory, China should be one of the world’s biggest and best markets for home-sharing. Chinese travelers took 2.2 billion domestic trips in just the first half of 2016, up nearly 10.5 percent year-on-year. Yet China has only 4 hotel rooms for every 1,000 people, compared to 20 in the U.S. And thanks to China’s housing boom, about 50 million empty homes are scattered across the country just waiting (in theory) for paying visitors. But that doesn’t mean Chinese will jump on the opportunity to rent out their properties or stay in someone else’s home. The biggest barrier is establishing trust between owners and renters. In recent years, Chinese consumers have been confronted by scandals ranging from tainted fast food to dodgy pharmaceuticals. They chronically complain of poor-quality goods and misleading marketing or labeling. And they’re highly suspicious of small vendors. So renting a room from a stranger advertising on the internet won’t come naturally. Homeowners, meanwhile, have their own concerns. Many of China’s vacant properties are purchased as investments, and most affluent homeowners — especially those with desirable vacation rentals — will hesitate to open their doors to poorer tourists, who constitute most Chinese travelers these days and who would be the most likely to forgo a hotel. That reluctance is only heightened by the near-constant stream of news reports about misbehavior among Chinese travelers at home and abroad. Bridging this gap in trust will be difficult. But there’s some evidence that local companies — which are more familiar with local customs and concerns — are figuring it out. For example, Tujia.com, China’s biggest home-sharing site, takes the ambitious approach of managing each of the 400,000 properties on its site (or hiring a third party to do so). That includes hotel-like services, such as housekeeping, as well as conducting due diligence to confirm that listings are accurate. That doesn’t just improve the experience for renters; it also expands the number of properties available by giving owners — many of whom live far away from their investments — less upkeep to worry about and more peace of mind. Airbnb, with its paltry 80,000 listings in China, hasn’t made any such effort, focusing instead on self-starting younger travelers. Where Tujia arranges for home cleaners, Airbnb’s new investments are focused on curated “Experiences,” such as tours of local landmarks, that can be purchased alongside a room. That kind of thing won’t be enough to overcome the cultural barriers inhibiting home-sharing in China. And so far, there’s little evidence that Airbnb is savvy enough to come up with a more appealing approach. On Wednesday, shortly after the company announced its new Chinese brand name — Aibiying — social media users were widely mocking it as nonsensical and hard to pronounce. It’s not all bad news for Airbnb. China’s growing tourism market means that even a niche player focused on adventurous young travelers has a big opportunity. Equally important, outbound travel is growing, and Airbnb’s 3 million global listings will remain the best home-sharing option for Chinese who want one, a fact conceded even by its Chinese competitors. When it comes to winning China’s local home-sharing market, however, Airbnb should probably check out early.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart and Dish joined an already impressive list of companies that have pulled their ads from the search giant over concerns the Silicon Valley giant isn’t able to ensure their ads will not pop up on unsavory sites or be attached to scummy videos. Google said it was stepping up its efforts to protect the brands. However, it might not be happening as quickly or be as effective as the advertisers had hoped. The four companies said they were suspending their ads on YouTube and on Google’s ad exchange after the Wall Street Journal reported that some ads were still being placed against anti-Semitic content. Other advertisers, including Starbucks, General Motors and FX Networks, said they were suspending their various activities with Google. Google has been ratcheting up its game — hiring more people and talking with advertisers about its efforts — to prevent ads appearing in objectionable content. The Friday exodus comes after a week of nonstop negative press that was kicked off by a March 17 Times of London report that resulted in an entire ad agency holding company yanking ads for all of its clients. Walmart, in a statement, said, “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values.” Google parent Alphabet has seen its market cap shrink by about $26 billion in a week. Its shares have fallen 4.5 percent since March 17, to $814.43 on Friday. Alphabet was downgraded on Monday by Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research which warned that unless Google could say its systems are foolproof it would continue to suffer from the fallout. Google has said it is retooling its video verification process and introducing new artificial intelligence in response to the problem. In an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, Google added it would create a new hot line manned by humans. The WSJ found ads from Google’s own YouTube Red subscription service running on racist videos containing the “n—–” in the title. The ads are served up typically as part of automated or programmatic ad programs that deliver traffic to advertisers from across the web. Some marketers put filters to screen out blacklisted Web sites.

By Jacob Thorpe jacobt@spokesman.com(509) 710-8070 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Related topics Gonzaga faces red-hot Xavier with Final Four spot on the line John Blanchette: There is no monkey – Gonzaga, Mark Few are legit Gonzaga, Xavier share many traits, including no football teams to share spotlight Xavier’s shifting defenses present a challenge for Gonzaga NCAA Tournament At SAP Center, San Jose, California Saturday, March 25: Gonzaga Bulldogs vs. Xavier Musketeers, 3:09 p.m. TV: TBS Online: March Madness Live SAN JOSE, Calif. – Allen Payne stood in a Cincinnati Wal-Mart, staring at the pink container decorated with green flowers and thought, “This is supposed to hold dead people?” The Xavier graduate assistant had been dispatched on the errand by head coach Chris Mack, who had a notion that his team needed an urn to house the ashes of a February the Musketeers would happily lay to rest. Payne settled on a glass jar that Musketeers call an urn and Mack brought it to a meeting before practice. Xavier was five games into a six-game losing streak that Mack wants to make sure you know was a “brutal strech” in which team had to play No. 1 seed Villanova, three road games against NCAA Tournament teams and then Elite Eight participant Butler at home. Xavier was without leading scorer Trevon Bluiett for three of those games, not to mention second-leading scorer Edmond Sumner, who suffered a season-ending injury on Jan. 29. The Musketeers were still clinging to NCAA Tournament hopes, but something had to change and fast. So Mack brought out a calendar of the month of February (technically the final loss in the streak came on March 1) and asked each player to write a secret thing they would be willing to sacrifice so the team would start winning games again. J.P. Macura wrote that he would turn the ball over less, sacrificing a carefree style of play so his team could maintain possession. Quentin Goodin sacrificed his time, pledging to be in the gym more often working on his game and to spend more hours off the court with his teammates, working on those relationships. And Malcolm Bernard wrote that he would give up whatever his team needed to win, be it sacrificing his body by diving for loose balls or shooting less so that his teammates could score more. Then Mack put the calendar in a trash can and burned it. When it was over, the ashes were scooped up and placed in the almost urn. “The symbolism is not to worry about what’s behind us, but to focus on moving forward, control what we can,” Mack said. “We’ve tried to keep that urn either at the scorer’s table during practice when the players walk in the locker room, on the locker room floor.” It was not an entirely smooth immolation. The calendar burned slow and the fire had to be restarted at one point. The calendar took so long to burn, in fact, that the Musketeers had to leave it smoldering so they could go practice. And there is a mark on the floor that can serve as a reminder to future teams. “It went through the trash can and burned the carpet,” Macura said.

Home Industry More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. By: Associated Press | San Francisco | Published: March 25, 2017 5:13 AM An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. (Reuters) An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks yesterday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. You May Also Like To Watch This: Contacted yesterday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube â€” an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Next to her are plaques for local businesses that have donated to the project. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Click photo to enlarge Bertha Jones was recognized as the All-Around Top Promoter of VFW Auxiliary Programs at the auxiliary's anniversary celebration. « 1 2 3 » Aris Garcia was named the Top Auxiliary Member of the Year for 2016-17 at Sterling VFW Auxiliary's anniversary celebration. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) The Sterling VFW Auxiliary had reason to celebrate Wednesday evening, as they marked their anniversary and showed off the VFW facility's newly renovated restrooms. A dinner kicked off the evening. While it was supposed to be the men making the meal to honor the auxiliary anniversary, in true fashion the auxiliary pitched in as well, to make sure a great meal was served. Following dinner, Lori Davison, auxiliary president, spoke to the group about her goal to remodel both the men's and women's restrooms at the VFW facility. She thanked sponsors who donated items for the remodel, including: Ace Hardware, BVB Contractors in Brighton, Home Depot, Logan County Lumber, Mead Lumber, RL Designs and Wal-Mart. Guests at the Sterling VFW Auxiliary's anniversary celebration were invited to check out the post's newly remodeled women's and men's restrooms. They now have a fresh coat of paint and new fixtures. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Davison also acknowledged volunteers who helped with the remodel. "We've been varnishing the doors, we moved them, we painted the walls in the bathroom, we painted the tile, cleaned up the work on the men's meeting room to do the base boards in there," she said. The work is not finished though. Now that they have more paint they plan to paint in the women's meeting room, paint the stage and they will be repairing the supply room ceiling. Davison said the VFW Auxiliary has put in for some grants from Home Depot and Wal-Mart. "Our work isn't done, but we think we've done good with what we've done already," she told the audience, adding that the goal with the grants is to redo the flower bed. Advertisement Davison was also excited to share they have received $1,000 from the VFW Foundation to help with the project. The anniversary celebration also included recognition of several auxiliary and VFW members. Edna Nichols was recognized as the longest auxiliary member at 65 years. Katie Stroup and Norma Timmerman were also honored as 59-year auxiliary members. John Lester received an award for his many years as the VFW's bingo manager and Dale Hurst was given award for helping out with bingo and all that he has done with the building and VFW activities in the past. Edna Nichols, a 65-year member, was recognized as the longest member of the Sterling VFW Auxiliary at the auxiliary's anniversary celebration. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Freda Moore was recognized for her help with bingo, as well as VFW dinners. Lori Davison was honored for her excellent work for both the VFW and the auxiliary, as well as the upgrades to the post home. Dan Torres was given an award for faithfully promoting the Voice of Democracy and Patriot's Pen programs for local youth for several years, and Lonnie Brungardt was recognized for promoting school and youth participation and aiding the VFW with design, decorating and outside work. Frank Garcia was honored for "jumping in from day one," helping setup for bingo and dinners and re-varnishing the doors and frames. Warren Davison was recognized for his never-ending work making the VFW hall and grounds a better place for all. Paul Jones received an award for plumbing and tile work to improve the VFW. Maxine DeMers was recognized for her dedication to the Poppy Poster Contest, collecting funding for the local veterans and educating the public about the VFW and the auxiliary. Ardis Garcia was named the Top Auxiliary Member of the Year for 2016-17. It was noted that her transfer from Nebraska to Sterling is one of the best things to happen for the Sterling auxiliary, as she "jumped in and made a big splash." Lastly, Bertha Jones was named All-Around Top Promoter of VFW Auxiliary programs, as she has covered more programs than the rest of the members combined. Following the awards presentations, Torres thanked the women of the auxiliary for what they do, pointing out that without an auxiliary the VFW would likely have a meeting once a month and that would be the extent of the post. "They are awesome. They make us look good," he said.

Even as the market has shifted to push consumers to partake in digital downloads, I’ve continued to buy movies on disc because I like the physical representation of my library. Plus, most movies you buy on disc come with a digital copy anyway. However, digital downloads have only risen in popularity since 2010, leaving plenty who had built large physical libraries of movies without an easy or inexpensive way to take their movies with them on mobile devices. But the video download service Vudu has just introduced a new disc-to-digital program allowing consumers to cheaply and easily convert their movie library to digital. Let’s take a look at what the new Vudu disc to digital program has to offer. Vudu’s New Disc to Digital Program Vudu has had a disc to digital program in place with their parent company Walmart since 2012. Consumers could take their discs into participating Walmart locations to verify ownership, and after providing the e-mail associated with their Vudu account, a digital copy of the movie would be in their personal library. This week, Vudu made it significantly easier for consumers to prove their ownership of a movie and pay for a digital copy. Within Vudu’s mobile app, you can now scan the barcode of nearly any movie from your physical library, and you can pay to get a digital copy in your Vudu library. Blu-ray copies can be converted to the high-definition HDX format for just $2 while a DVD can be converted to standard definition digital copy for $2 or upgraded to HDX for $5. If you want to try it for yourself, your first conversion, whether it’s from Blu-ray or DVD, is free. If you’re wondering what’s to keep someone from just scanning a bunch of movies at a local store and getting digital copies on the cheap without actually owning them, the app must detect that you’re at or near the billing address that is linked to your Vudu account. Of course, there’s nothing stopping you from having a friend bring movies to your house, scanning them, and getting cheap movie downloads that way. As someone who has lamented not having some of my physical movies available in digital form for use on mobile devices, whether it’s for business trips or vacations, this sounds like a great new deal. But it still has some shortcomings. The Downside of Vudu’s Disc to Digital Program Even though Vudu has made converting discs to digital that much easier, there’s no guarantee that the video service won’t die off someday. Then what happens to your digital library? This is the problem with digital libraries in general. There’s always a chance that some video service will go belly up, and then all that money that has gone to building your digital library is gone. While something like the iTunes store isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, some other services may not be so lucky. That’s why I’ll always buy physical copies first. Beyond that, Vudu isn’t the best digital download service out there. Their mobile apps are kind of clunky, and they’re a little less user friendly than something like the iTunes store. While there are apps in Apple’s App store for iOS, there is no app for Apple TV. If you happen to have an Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4, you can access Vudu through there (seen above), but again, the application itself isn’t exactly a finely tuned piece of software. Finally, if you happen to have any copies of movies where there are multiple movies in a single package, you might not be able to get digital copies. For example, I have Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II in a single Blu-ray package, and that barcode wouldn’t register as a title that can be downloaded through Vudu. Though this is a rare problem, it’s still something that keeps the service from being a little more convenient. The Way of the Future? Is this something that we could see catch on as a new way for consumers to get digital copies of their movies? It doesn’t seem likely. Studios have already gotten money from consumers for the physical copy of the movie they bought, so their partnership with Vudu on this disc to digital program just gives them extra money for movies that their customers have already purchased. But I wouldn’t expect a similar program to come from a place like iTunes, since they’re not making any money off the physical discs you bought, and they lose money by giving you a digital download at a discount. For the time being, Vudu seems like a great way for people with huge movie libraries to cherry pick which movies they’d like to take with them on the road.

Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the US have frustrated companies ranging from Walmart to Uber. However, those stumbles aren't dissuading Airbnb. This week, the home-sharing pioneer announced that it's changing its local brand name in China and doubling its investment there. By any measure, the opportunity is immense. In 2015, Chinese travellers spent nearly US$500 billion (S$700 billion), and the number is expected to more than double by 2020 as the country's middle class expands. But capturing a major piece of that market will require Airbnb to navigate a far more tangled thicket of cultural issues than what confronted Uber and other tech companies in China. And judging by its efforts so far, it probably won't be up to the task. In theory, China should be one of the world's biggest and best markets for home-sharing. The Chinese took 2.2 billion domestic trips in just the first half of last year, up nearly 10.5 per cent year on year. Yet China has only four hotel rooms for every 1,000 people, compared to 20 in the US. And thanks to a housing boom, about 50 million empty homes are scattered across China just waiting (in theory) for paying visitors. But that doesn't mean the Chinese will jump on the opportunity to rent out their properties or stay in someone else's home. The biggest barrier is establishing trust between owners and renters. In recent years, Chinese consumers have been hit by scandals ranging from tainted food to dodgy medicine. They complain of poor-quality goods and misleading marketing or labelling. And they're highly suspicious of small vendors. So renting a room from a stranger advertising on the Internet won't come naturally. Home owners, meanwhile, have their own concerns. Many vacant properties are purchased as investments, and most affluent home owners - especially those with desirable vacation rentals - will hesitate to open their doors to poorer tourists, who constitute most Chinese travellers these days and who would be the most likely to forgo a hotel. That reluctance is only heightened by the near-constant stream of news reports about misbehaviour among Chinese travellers at home and abroad. Airbnb co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky at the launch of the brand's Chinese name in Shanghai on Wednesday. The company faces many barriers in China, including cultural ones, in growing its home-sharing business. PHOTO: REUTERS Bridging this gap in trust will be difficult. But there's some evidence that local companies - which are more familiar with local customs and concerns - are figuring it out. For example, Tujia.com, China's biggest home-sharing site, takes the ambitious approach of managing each of the 400,000 properties on its site (or hiring a third party to do so). That includes hotel-like services, such as housekeeping, as well as conducting due diligence to confirm that listings are accurate. That doesn't just improve the experience for renters; it also expands the number of properties available by giving owners - many of whom live far away from their investments - less upkeep to worry about and more peace of mind. Airbnb, with its paltry 80,000 listings in China, hasn't made any such effort, focusing instead on self-starting younger travellers. Where Tujia arranges for home cleaners, Airbnb's new investments are focused on curated "experiences", such as tours of local landmarks, that can be purchased alongside a room. That kind of thing won't be enough to overcome the cultural barriers inhibiting home-sharing in China. And so far, there's little evidence that Airbnb is savvy enough to come up with a more appealing approach. On Wednesday, shortly after the firm announced its new Chinese brand name - Aibiying - social media users were widely mocking it as nonsensical and hard to pronounce. It's not all bad news for Airbnb. China's growing tourism market means even a niche player focused on adventurous young travellers has a big opportunity. Equally important, outbound travel is growing, and Airbnb's three million global listings remain the best home-sharing option for Chinese who want one, a fact conceded even by its Chinese competitors. However, when it comes to winning China's local home-sharing market, Airbnb should probably check out early.

Google ad controversy: what the row is all about Read more The companies pulled their ads after the Wall Street Journal found that Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Walmart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Walmart, Pepsi and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2m other third-party websites. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet. Alphabet shares have fallen more than 3% since Monday, closing at $839.65 on Thursday. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5bn last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6bn, or nearly 8%, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blogpost this week. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google’s elaborate ad-serving systems. 'I can’t trust YouTube any more': creators speak out in Google advertising row Read more “We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match,” Schmidt said. “We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google’s public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for the media buying firm Magna Global. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot-button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the US presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

(Photo: AFP/Getty Images) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Toms River needed another giant superstore like it needed another superfund site. That is why we are glad Walmart finally withdrew its proposal for a new store in an environmentally sensitive area with endangered species. Now that this area is protected, it will protect important aquifers, groundwater recharge and open space. And it has so many other benefits to the public. Northern pine snakes are in serious decline in New Jersey due to destruction and fracturing of their habitat as a result of development. The Walmart project should have never moved forward in the first place. Even though it was turned down four times by the three different Department of Environmental Protection commissioners, Gov. Christie forced DEP Commissioner Bob Martin to push this project through. After 13 years of fighting against this project, it has finally stopped. Even though we went to court against the endangered species permit and lost, we kept fighting against the CAFRA permit. This shows that if you keep fighting, there is a greater chance you can win. Market conditions can change and businesses can pull out, which is what happened here. Walmart pulling out is a victory for now, but we will have to remain vigilant against future development plans on this site.

Tech Culture by Ian Sherr March 24, 2017 8:57 PM PDT @iansherr Enlarge Image CNET Wal-Mart, PepsiCo, Starbucks, General Motors, FX Networks and Dish Network have joined the advertising blackout against Google after learning their ads are appearing on YouTube next to videos espousing racist and anti-Semitic views. They told The Wall Street Journal they were pulling either some or all of their ads from the internet giant after being alerted the ads were still appearing on Google-owned YouTube, despite an apology from YouTube and a promise of change in policy. "We are deeply concerned and terribly disappointed that some of our brand ads have appeared alongside videos that promote hate and are offensive," PepsiCo said in a statement, adding that it's removed ads from all of Google's nonsearch services, including YouTube. "PepsiCo has a long history of embracing diversity and inclusion, and content like this violates our core values." Starbucks equally said it was shocked by the development, and stressed these videos don't fit with its vision or culture. The company has pulled its ads, and in the meantime is discussing the best way to prevent this from happening in the future. "Our content should not have appeared before the video referenced or any videos like it," a company spokeswoman said in a statement. "It has since been removed." GM confirmed it had pulled its ads, while Wal-Mart -- which said some of the content was "appalling" -- said it pulled all non-search ads. Other companies mentioned didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The WSJ also found that ads from major brands including Amazon, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft were appearing next to objectionable YouTube videos. Coke confirmed it had pulled its non-search ads while Microsoft said it's working with its media partners to fix these issues. P&G declined to comment specifically about Google but said it continually works with advertising partners and makes changes if they don't comply with ethics guidelines. Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment. This marks the latest bad news for YouTube, the internet's second-most-trafficked site. It's faced increasing scrutiny as waves of anti-Semitic and racist incidents have shocked the country over the past several months. As people have searched for reasons why this appears to be happening, their attention has fallen squarely on extremist news sites, social media and services like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Other companies that have backed away from YouTube include Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, McDonald's, Marks & Spencer, L'Oreal, Audi, the BBC, the Guardian and the UK government.

Wal-Mart Stores appears "best positioned" among the major food retailers to capitalize on the next phase of growth in online grocery and take on Amazon, according to a new report from Citi Research. Kroger also scored high among the pure-play grocers in terms of its online grocery positioning compared with e-commerce giant Amazon, particularly as it related to pricing. But at the bottom of the list was Whole Foods Market. Citi looked at the potential winners and losers in the online grocery space using a five-point analysis that looked at factors such as profitability, brick-and-mortar pricing, online pricing, exposure to Seattle-based Amazon, as well as any early adopter advantage. "Based on our analysis, we determined that Wal-Mart was the winner (low exposure to Amazon Fresh/Prime Now markets and low EPS impact from exposure to those exposed markets)," Citi said in the 43-page report. "Whole Foods Market came in last place overall in our analysis, largely due to their urban store exposure, which overlaps highly with Amazon Fresh and Prime Now, as well as their higher price points." Online grocery shopping could grow five-fold over the next decade, with American consumers spending upwards of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according an forecast released earlier this year by Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. While many of the large grocers are still testing and investing in different formats to see which one works best, there's no denying the changing demographics and rise of millennials weaned on digital technologies supports the case for significant future growth in online grocery spending. Amazon's growing presence in the grocery space with different approaches highlights how much profit potential it sees in capturing spending from food and beverage sales. Amazon's grocery operating margin potential could be about 3 percent, or roughly comparable to North American retail industry margins, according to Citi. The estimate assumes inclusion of revenue from membership fees. Amazon's prices on grocery items tend to be higher than Wal-Mart, which accounts for about 20 percent of grocery sales domestically. Citi's research found the price gap between Wal-Mart's store pick-up prices relative to AmazonFresh was an average of 30 percent. Wal-Mart has been rapidly expanding its online grocery business and concentrating on the so-called click-and-collect model, which allows consumers to pickup orders at stores. A spokesman for the retailer told CNBC the retailer has expanded pickup to more than 100 markets in the U.S. last year and now has more than 600 locations offering the service. Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images InstaCart employees fulfill orders for delivery at the new Whole Foods Market Inc. store in downtown Los Angeles, California. Whole Foods has partnered with Shipt for third-party grocery delivery and uses InstaCart too. Rival organic and natural foods chain Sprouts Farmers Market has an alliance with Amazon Prime Now. According to Citi, Whole Foods has more than 60 percent of their stores overlapped with Amazon's current or future delivery markets while Wal-Mart is just 23 percent exposed. Sprouts also has a high overlap with Amazon delivery markets but given the partnership Citi said that "could therefore be a complementary, rather than adversarial scenario and could mute the threat, or even create an opportunity." Yet Wal-Mart's exposure and threats from Amazon go well beyond groceries and include other merchandise categories, Citi noted. Similarly, Costco and Target also have online grocery activities through mostly third party services and compete with Amazon on several fronts such as consumer electronics, among other things. As for Kroger, the Citi report found that in addition to its competitive pricing compared with Amazon that the Cincinnati-based grocer was poised to benefit from growth in online grocery due to its "early adopter advantage." Even so, Kroger maybe seeing market share erosion in some markets against Wal-Mart, according to analysts. They believe part of the reason is the price-cutting strategy Wal-Mart embarked on to gain advantage against Kroger and Aldi, a rapidly expanding deep discounter. "Kroger looks like they're losing share," said PiperJaffray analyst Sean Naughton. He explained that Kroger's same-store sales trends have been lagging Wal-Mart's in groceries. Meantime, analysts suggest both Wal-Mart and Kroger are likely to continue expanding their "hybrid" online grocer model, which includes focusing on both click-and-collect or in-store pickup as well as utilizing third-party or direct delivery services. "Both models are going to thrive in 2017 and 2018," said Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights for Kantar Retail. "I would actually predict that within 3 to 5 years — maybe sooner — that we would start to see some of these third parties getting acquired by major retailers." Third-party home delivery services such as InstaCart, Shipt and Uber are expanding alliances with large national retail chains. The list of major retailers teaming with these services is growing and now includes not just traditional grocers such as Kroger and Whole Foods but warehouse club operators such as Costco. For example, Shipt this week announced it was offering Costco grocery deliveries in some Florida areas. Sheehan said retailers partnered with the third-party delivery services are relying on them not just to deliver groceries but also be the face of the brand to shoppers. And she said it's doubtful that the "strongest-branded retailers" in the U.S. will allow this to happen for an extended period of time. Still, some experts believe the grocery delivery model will ultimately work best for dense urban areas such as New York, a market where several pure-play grocery delivery companies such as FreshDirect have thrived. "We're still in the test-and-learn phase," said Edward Yruma, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. He said the traditional grocery delivery model will continue to grow although Amazon's plans to open several brick-and-mortar grocery pickup locations maybe a sign that grocery shoppers prefer this approach over home delivery. Yruma sees the grocery delivery model a lot like "waiting for the cable guy. You need to be at home between 5 and 8 o'clock versus just driving by a location and dumping groceries into the car [when you want it]." Wal-Mart doesn't charge extra for online grocery orders picked up at stores, while rival Kroger offers a free trial but then charges after two deliveries. Kroger has been growing its online business with both its ClickList online grocery ordering service as well as providing grocery deliveries through third-party providers, including InstaCart, Shipt as well as conducting tests with Uber. "Kroger is not wedded long term to charging a fee," said Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem. "If they determined that is a competitive disadvantage then they could potentially change that. I don't necessarily think it hurts them to charge a fee right now because of the relatively solid results."

Over the winter the White Sox committed to a full blown rebuild by trading away Chris Sale and Adam Eaton. One of the players they received in the Sale trade, infielder Yoan Moncada, is arguably the best prospect in baseball. Both Baseball America and MLB.com recently ranked him as the No. 2 prospect in baseball behind Andrew Benintendi, his former teammate with the Red Sox. The BoSox signed Moncada out of Cuba in March 2015 to a record $31.5 million bonus. Because they exceeded their international signing bonus pool, the team was also taxed 100 percent on the bonus. Boston’s total investment was $63 million. Clubs don’t spend that kind of money on nobodies. Moncada is an excellent prospect and it was obvious he had star caliber tools at a very young age. Yoan Moncada is arguably baseball’s top prospect, and he loves Twinkies. USATSI Over at ESPN, Eli Saslow wrote about Moncada’s adjustment to life as a 19-year-old millionaire in the United States. Part of that life: binge eating Twinkies, which he never had until leaving Cuba. From Saslow: He is a versatile defender with natural speed and a sculpted upper body, and yet his agent says Moncada has sometimes mowed through 85 Twinkies in a week ... Moncada discovered Twinkies at Wal-Mart and started consuming them by the box, sometimes eating more than 10 in a single sitting even as the Red Sox were trying to counsel him on diet and nutrition. When (agent David Hastings) took Moncada to the dentist in the winter of 2015 -- the first dental visit of Moncada’s life -- he had about 15 cavities, David says. Real talk: Twinkies are gross. But I guess when you’ve ever had them before, you can’t blame someone for binging on them, even a pro athlete and one of the best prospects in baseball. Moncada, by the way, hit .317/.391/.683 with three home runs in 46 plate appearances this spring before being sent to minor league camp. He managed a .294/.407/.511 batting line with 15 home runs and 45 stolen bases in the minors last season. Moncada is Chicago’s third baseman of the future.

Photo: Union City Police Department Suspect in Union City parking lot rampage arrested 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A woman who went on a rampage attempting to hit random people with her car in the parking lot of a Union City Walmart has been identified and arrested, police said. Detectives identified the suspect as 23-year-old Jessica Malicoat of Hayward, Union City Police Department officials said Thursday. Malicoat allegedly became agitated when she tried to return batteries to the Walmart on Sunday, but store employees declined to accept them. She allegedly stormed out of the store, got in her car and nearly hit a family walking in the parking lot as she backed out of the stall, police said. She then continued backing up, intentionally striking two people, and tore out of the parking lot at high speed, narrowly missing a 3-year-old girl and her mother, according to police.

Traylee MT Price, 20, and Alysha M. McCrary, 25, could be charged with armed robbery and unlawful use of a weapon, Springfield police said. Police were sent to the Wal-Mart about 4:30 p.m. and were told a man with a handgun had approached the victim, 29, who was sitting in her car, and took her cell phone and cash. The man then ran away and got into a van. A bystander who saw the robbery followed the van to a mobile home park in the 2500 block of North Grand Avenue East and called police. Officers surrounded the mobile home with several vehicles, including the department's armored vehicle. Price at first refused to come out, but he eventually did without incident, police said. A search warrant was obtained, and the victim's money, cell phone and the gun Price allegedly used in the robbery were found inside the mobile home, police said. Police said they learned through interviews that Price and McCrary conspired to rob the woman in the parking lot. McCrary allegedly arranged the meeting with the woman under the guise of a drug transaction, police said. Anyone with information concerning this crime or any other crime is asked to call the Springfield Police Department at 788-8311 or anonymously Crime Stoppers at 788-8427.

The 69-year-old, who cut his teeth as a local agent in Illinois alongside college roommate Irving Azoff, was tasked with rerouting the group's career following the 1998 exit of frontman Steve Perry. "Irving had just made a deal for the band with Walmart -- for Journey's Greatest Hits -- and we had no lead singer," recalls Baruck. The fixer turned out to be guitarist and Internet sleuth Neal Schon, who found Filipino karaoke singer Arnel Pineda on YouTube. (Pineda joining the group in 2007 would be documented in the 2012 indie film Don't Stop Believin': Everyman's Journey.) Baruck followed Azoff to Los Angeles and to Live Nation, where he helped guide clients like Christina Aguilera. In September 2016, he joined Azoff MSG Entertainment. Says Azoff: "There's something to be said for not growing up in L.A. or New York and experiencing the business in the heartland. You learn in different ways what does and doesn't work." When you took on management of Journey in 1998, was your first order of business finding a replacement for Steve Perry? Irving had just made a deal with Walmart -- for Journey's Greatest Hits -- and we had no lead singer. Neal Schon searched the Internet tirelessly trying to find someone that could sing the songs the way they were created. [Eventually], we found a karaoke singer from the Philippines named Arnel Pineda on YouTube. We gave the green light to a documentary, Don't Stop Believin': Everyman's Journey, which led to millions of people knowing Arnel's story -- and it was an important one to tell. To what do you credit Journey getting past the gatekeepers and into the hall of fame on its first nomination? There is no formula. We worked for a long time with the people that make those decisions: the voting membership and the fans. But it was also, like, how can you not have a band as popular or as successful as Journey in the hall of fame? The band is truly thrilled. I've got two tables of people coming and it's going to be a blast. How important has film and TV usage of original Journey tracks been to its career longevity? Steve Perry is very particular on how we use these songs, but with the movie Monster [in 2003], the Sopranos series finale in 2007 and, in 2009, Glee, it has brought a whole new age group into our fan base. We were no longer an old band playing for old fans. We had three generations at our shows. When did you know Azoff had a future in music? In high school in Danville, Ill. He would sit at one of those folding card tables and break up $100 [among a few bands], then collect $2 at the door. That's how he paid for college.

He would sit at one of those folding card tables and break up $100 [among a few bands], then collect $2 at the door. That's how he paid for college. Is that how it started? We weren’t making a lot of money through the booking agency and then mod clothing came into fashion along with long hair and hippies. The big thing was bell-bottom blue jeans. So we opened up a little store in Champaign, IL called No Hassle. It was about as big as a closet. It had bins all over and I think Lee jeans were our first account. We opened up more stores and then the whole thing went bust. But it was a lot of fun and a real education in commerce. When Irving moved out to California, did he really call and say “We can take this town!  I actually can’t tell you exactly what he said, but he must have because he called me up and said, “Pack your stuff up and come on out.” He had his secretary find a house for me and I packed up my family and my furniture, moved to Los Angeles.  When we opened up Frontline Management and it was just he and I and two assistants and we had Joe Walsh, REO Speedwagon, The Eagles and Dan Fogelberg. That was our roster.   That’s a great roster. You have to realize at that time none of those bands were what we think of those bands now.   What was it like in those early days getting those bands up to the level that they eventually got to? The bands created the music. We didn’t write any songs with them. So they were great. I mean look at that roster. You had songwriters like Danny Fogelberg and Joe Walsh and Don Heney. REO was a great rock band that toured constantly. We learned how to work the record companies, how to promote their records and we had success with all of them. You left Frontline Management in 1977 and Irving went on to run MCA Records. You both had great success, but what brought you back together? Irving and I had not worked together for almost 20 years. I ran into him on the driving range.  We just sat down and started reminiscing.  “How’ve you been for the last few years? What’s going on with you?”  He called me the next day and said, “Listen. I’m managing Journey. I put the band back together again with Steve Perry and they made a record Trial By Fire but something happened. Steve injured his hip and he was laid up. What did the band do? The band decided they couldn't wait any longer and they were going to go on without him. They got a singer a guy named Steve Augeri who was selling pants at The Gap. He had a great voice and there were going to go out and give it a shot. In 1998 we put a tour together. Mainly small venues and we sold everything out. Was the response what you expected? The response was unbelievable. It really didn’t matter whether or not we had the original singer because the songs were what was important. People came to hear those songs. From that point I decided I needed to put the band in front of many as possible. We didn’t have the tools of a record, so we did it through touring. I put together packages. We did nine to ten thousand seats and basically put those songs in front of people and they remembered them. They didn’t care who was singing lead. We kept doing that and we actually never stopped. And now they are going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That must mean the world to Neal! Oh my goodness, hell yeah! He’s so happy. I want to add, I didn’t get Journey into the Hall of Fame. Journey got themselves into the Hall of Fame. What I did was put the music in front of many people as I could. I think their success was undeniable to the Hall of Fame when they were making the decision. It was like, how can you guys not have a band as popular or as successful as Journey in the Hall of Fame, when you have bands that were opening for Journey on their tours in the Hall of Fame already?

(AP) — Police in the San Francisco Bay Area say they've arrested a woman who struck three people in a Wal-Mart parking lot with her car. The East Bay Times reports (http://bayareane.ws/2nvwoxW ) that 23-year-old Jessica Malicoat from Hayward was arrested on Thursday for charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Store officials say Malicoat left a Union City Wal-Mart in rage after she tried to get a refund for batteries they believe she stole. Police say they found Malicoat in her home after receiving numerous tips about her and her vehicle. Malicoat is being held Santa Rita Jail without bail.

Nearly one-fifth of those purchases — 19.4% — are made at a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) location. The second-most popular venue to purchase these products is a traditional food store (16.6%), and Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) stores are third with a 12.1% share. Most of the purchases are made in a brick-and-mortar store; only 3.1% of personal care products are sold online. GenX shoppers make 37% of purchases, followed by millennials who make 24% of all purchases. The data were reported earlier this week by research firm TABS Analytics, based on a February survey of 1,000 consumers on their purchases of seven types of products: hair care, deodorant, personal wash, mouthwash, toothpaste, feminine care and adult incontinence. Cosmetics and skin care products were not included in the study. The researchers noted several key findings from the survey: Amazon, Walmart.com and Target.com represent 82 percent of online personal care transactions in the $1.2 billion dollar e-commerce market. CVS, Walgreens, and Dollar Stores combined have 24.7 percent of all purchases. Target’s share [of] personal care purchases is dominated by millennials and high-income consumers. Personal care consumption peaks among consumers in the $60,000 – $74,000 income range with 26 percent being heavy users. Founder and CEO of TABS Analytics, Dr. Kurt Jetta, said: Walmart, traditional food stores and Target are the clear winners in the personal care market with almost 50 percent of all estimated purchases. Unlike what we see in beauty where online sales is a key driver, online sales in personal care products is relatively unimportant coming in at just 3.1 percent of market share. Online sales of beauty products account for 9% of all sales of cosmetics and skin-care products. One final note: earlier this year Nielsen published a report on demand for premium products. The survey’s respondents said they would consider buying premium hair-care products (27%), body-care products (26%) and oral-care products (26%). More details on the TABS Analytics study are available at the company’s website.

(AP) — Police in the San Francisco Bay Area say they've arrested a woman who struck three people in a Wal-Mart parking lot with her car. The East Bay Times reports (http://bayareane.ws/2nvwoxW ) that 23-year-old Jessica Malicoat from Hayward was arrested on Thursday for charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Store officials say Malicoat left a Union City Wal-Mart in rage after she tried to get a refund for batteries they believe she stole. Police say they found Malicoat in her home after receiving numerous tips about her and her vehicle. Malicoat is being held Santa Rita Jail without bail. She will go before a judge on Monday. ___ Information from: East Bay Times, http://www.eastbaytimes.com Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Union City Police Department Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email UNION CITY, Calif. -- Police have arrested a woman who allegedly intentionally struck several pedestrians in a Northern California Walmart parking lot on Sunday, CBS San Francisco reports. On Thursday, officers arrested 23-year-old Hayward resident Jessica Malicoat at her home on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, according to police. Malicoat was then booked into the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, where she is being held without bail. Investigators were able to identify Malicoat as the suspect thanks to numerous tips from residents after the initial incident. Malicoat entered the Walmart in Union City around 6 p.m. and left the store agitated after employees declined to accept batteries she had tried to return, police said. She then got into a silver two-door Honda Accord, model year 1998 to 2000, backed out of her parking space and almost struck a family walking behind her car. As Malicoat continued to back up, police said she struck “numerous people.” A 3-year-old child and her mother narrowly escaped injury by running out of the way. She then fled the parking lot at a high rate of speed, forcing other pedestrians to get out of the way, police said. Malicoat is set to be arraigned at the Fremont Hall of Justice on Monday. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Dodge H. Teague Jr., 88, 210 Fish Springs Road, Hampton, was struck by a 2008 Kia Sorrento driven by a 46-year-old woman, whose name was not released. Officer Samantha Maney of the Elizabethton Police Department said she responded to the scene and saw Teague lying on the ground, suffering from a leg injury and cuts to his face and arm. Maney spoke with the driver, who told her she was pulling into a parking space on the right side of row 5 when she heard someone yell “stop” and looked to her left. She stopped and was then told to back up. When the driver got out of her car to see what happened, she said she saw a man lying on the ground in front of her vehicle. The store security camera recorded the accident. Sgt. Curtis Bullock viewed the video and reported that it showed Teague loading groceries into his vehicle. He then walked across the row to return the grocery cart to the collection rack. Bullock said Teague then returned to his car and his body was bent forward, as if he was walking into the wind.  Bullock said Teague was walking into the row just as the Kia was pulling into the parking spot. Bullock said Teague never looked up or stopped walking. He also said the brakes were not applied on the Kia. No charges have been placed.

Deputies are looking for a man accused of trying to lure a young girl into his car Sunday outside an Osceola County Wal-Mart. He was driving a red Pontiac, possibly a Grand Prix. Anyone with information can call Crimeline at 800-423-8477. Christal Hayes Contact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy The man accused of trying to lure a 10-year-old girl into his car outside a Wal-Mart says he was only trying to help and thought she was lost, according to an arrest report released Friday. Luis Davila-Quinones, 44, was arrested Thursday night and faces a charge of attempted kidnapping. The girl, who wasn’t identified, went to the parking lot of the Poinciana store off Cypress Parkway and Old Pleasant Hill Road to get her grandmother’s credit card, an arrest report shows. As she was returning to the store shortly after noon Sunday, Davila-Quinones pulled up next to her with his driver’s door open, deputies said. Davila-Quinones called out to the girl in English and Spanish “in a scolding tone,” telling her to get into his red Pontiac, the report said.       Osceola County Sheriff Russ Gibson said the girl told him no and ran inside the store, asking for help. She told her grandmother what happened and said she “was afraid the man was trying to abduct her,” deputies said. Deputies were able to track Davila-Quinones’ car and interview him. The victim also picked his photo out of a lineup and said “her heart sunk” when she saw his picture, the arrest affidavit said. Davila-Quinones told deputies he did talk to the girl “and told her to come on because he thought she was lost,” an arrest report said. Surveillance video showed his car stopping in one of the parking aisles in front of the store as the girl approached. The driver’s door opened and lingered for a few seconds before the girl ran into the store. “This arrest was only possible because of the unbelievable courage of a 10-year-old victim,” Gibson said at a news conference Thursday, adding that Davila-Quinones could face additional charges. chayes@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5493 or Twitter: @journo_christa Caption UCF plagued with spat of vehicle break-ins University of Central Florida police are on the hunt for four suspects who broke into a series of vehicles on and around campus.

Herald Staff Fri Mar 24th, 2017 1:30am News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) officials say they correctly calculated the “baseline” shopper savings that Congress insisted be verified and preserved as commissaries are transformed into more business-like grocery operations. DeCA contends it determined savings by region using price comparison techniques that reflect more accurately than in the past the way commissary patrons actually shop for groceries on base and at local retail outlets. Advocates for patrons are skeptical. They suggest DeCA’s approach isn’t what Congress portrayed last year when it directed that existing discounts be accurately measured and protected. DeCA, critics contend, appears to have taken steps to dampen savings targets so they are easier to meet as it strives to cut operating costs. Paring DeCA’s annual appropriation of $1.3 billion, after all, is indisputably the primary purpose behind transformation of base grocery stores. The most troublesome step to explain is why DeCA used discounted private label products sold by retailers as a significant element in revising savings calculations, at a time when DeCA only sells brand name items. That decision alone, DeCA said, could have lowered baseline savings by up to 2 percentage points. DeCA officials last month gave conflicting reports on whether it weighted the baseline results at all, or at least sufficiently, to neutralize the effect of comparing retail private label prices to brand name products in commissaries. For decades, up until this year, DeCA claimed commissaries saved patrons, on average, more than 30 percent compared with prices at commercial outlets. As defense budgets tightened, the Obama administration, backed by the joint chiefs, urged Congress to allow deep cuts to DeCA’s appropriation so the money saved could be diverted to more pressing readiness needs. Two years ago, a study from Boston Consulting Group, which now has several contracts in support of commissary transformation, estimated that actual shopper savings were closer to 17 percent, which might be preserved even as DeCA’s became more efficient through the adoption of commercial retail practices. Last year Congress authorized DeCA to phase out its tradition of selling only brand name products and of pricing them always at cost plus a surcharge. Instead, DeCA will embrace variable pricing, reduce brand name product selections and introduce its own private label goods, like commercial grocers do, to offer lower prices on the shelves, expand profit margins and cut the annual taxpayer subsidy. Congress stressed, however, that DeCA must first calculate existing patron savings, by region, and then protect the savings during the transformation so that shoppers see no diminution in the value of their benefit. In late January, DeCA unveiled its baseline savings calculations: 23.7 percent globally, 20.2 percent stateside and, for stateside regions, baselines range from 18.1 percent across South Central states to 32.6 percent for Alaska and Hawaii. Given that most of the regional baselines, plus global and stateside averages, came in far below the “more than 30 percent” average savings long touted, agency officials said they got swamped with calls for a more detailed explanation. DeCA said its revised method for calculating savings relied far more heavily than in the past on price comparisons with Walmart Supercenters. It also used in its calculations local price comparisons done manually for a smaller selection of popular products, roughly 1,400, and applied those results to lessen reliance on nationwide price comparisons across all DeCA-stocked products. But the step DeCA took that raised the most eyebrows was calculating regional savings in part by comparing prices on commissary brand name products to outside private label prices. In February, Christopher Burns, DeCA’s executive director of transformation, struggled through half of an hour-long roundtable discussion with trade press reporters to explain why including private label prices at retail outlets didn’t distort commissary baseline savings. He didn’t succeed. Burns noted that Congress wanted a more “granular approach to calculating savings” rather than rely exclusively on Nielsen nationwide price data to compare items sold in commissaries with average retail prices. So DeCA opted to conduct smaller “manual” or clipboard comparisons of more popular commissary items with prices for like products sold by at least two local retailers, often including a Walmart Supercenter and their discounted private label goods. Burns was asked why both those steps shouldn’t be perceived as an effective way to dampen perceived commissary savings. He said DeCA had weighted its savings computations in a way that presumed commissaries also sold private label products, even though the first of commissary labeled goods haven’t been produced or priced yet and won’t be available for sale before May this year. Making private label price comparisons was important, he explained, because patrons buy these products at retail and it’s critical to capture the choices they make at retail to more accurately calculate commissary savings. “It may not be brand” but it’s what they want, Burns said. “So that’s why we moved forward in putting those private labels in. We weren’t trying to artificially lower that baseline savings; it is what it is. And again, on our end, we also factored in a weighting factor … for private label on our side as well.” Later, in a statement, DeCA said “as our shoppers’ behavior evolves, our measurement criteria should as well. Since shoppers buy both branded and store brand, or private label, products at a range of retailers, including superstores, the most accurate way to capture how much our patrons save … is to compare commissary prices for a product to commercial prices for that same product, including both branded and store brand options.” DeCA added that “including store brand products in the savings calculation, in addition to brand named products, provides a more realistic assessment of patron savings in the area where a commissary patron shops.” Brooke Goldberg, director of military family policy for Military Officers Association of America, said savings calculations for commissary shoppers need to be “fixed and transparent” to be credible as store operations are transformed. “The inclusion of private label in the benchmark does not reflect the patron shopping experience at the commissary today, and basing a savings calculation on a projected behavior allows for a larger margin of error,” Brooke said. Eileen Huck, government relations deputy director for National Military Family Association, said the change in commissary shopper savings is hard to understand. “It made sense to me that in the past they excluded private label items from the price comparison since DeCA didn’t carry a private label. It would seem more logical to wait to include generics in the price comparison once DeCA’s own private label is introduced, so you aren’t comparing apples and oranges.” Whatever method DeCA uses to calculate savings and set prices must “be consistent and transparent to families,” Huck said. “I’m not sure the new methodology meets either of those two goals.” To comment, write Military Update, P.O.

The so-called “liquor wall” measure (SB 106), which must still get House approval, was approved in a 21-17 vote. Sponsor Anitere Flores, R-Miami, defend her bill at one point by saying, “this is not going to kill anybody. No one is going to die if this bill passes or not.” The issue has led to repeated legislative battles in recent years, pitting Walmart and Target, which want to stock liquor on shelves near other goods, against Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, which have stand-alone liquor stores as part of their corporate blueprints. Flores called the law requiring stand-alone liquor stores “antiquated.” Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, said the 1934 law doesn’t reflect “contemporary life” in which people can order home delivery of liquor through apps on their phones. Walmart and Target lobbyists say the change is needed to meet customers’ demands and convenience. In asking lawmakers to reject the proposal, Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, said “large corporate citizens want us to do it (approve the bill) for their own economic purposes.” Latvala’s comment caused Sen. Tom Lee, R-Thonotosassa, to fire back — in a speech that ended with him dropping a live microphone on his desk — by saying, “We talk about who is pushing it, but we know who is pushing against it too, Sen. Latvala. We know who’s pushing against it real hard.” Opponents argue the change will impact small liquor stores, eliminate jobs, result in a greater ability for minors to get liquor and lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. Sen. Daphne Campbell, D-Miami, argued that she couldn’t support “a bill that is going to kill my own youngsters.” “How can I do this, to come here and vote for a bill where children or the high school students, going to the store when they have a break to eat lunch, and (they’re) going to buy alcohol,” Campbell said. And “while they’re driving back to school and they die or they get arrested for DUI.” The proposal would stagger the repeal of the law over several years; prohibit new package stores from being licensed within 1,000 feet of schools; and require that small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, be displayed only behind the counter. Also, the measure would require checkout clerks under the age of 18 to be supervised by someone 18 or older when alcohol is being purchased and prohibit the state from issuing liquor licenses to gas stations that are not linked with locations providing more than 10,000 square-feet of retail space. Sen. Frank Artiles, a Miami Republican who called the measure “the Walmart bill,” argued that it would hurt small businesses. The proposal doesn’t “just stack the deck against small businesses; they ensure they don’t get a fair hand,” Artiles said. “If this bill becomes law, it will decimate the family-owned small businesses, and unfortunately a lot of Floridians will lose their jobs.” by Jim Turner, The News Service of Florida Pictured: A separate liquor store next to the Publix in University Town Center on West Nine Mile Road.

The checkout counter is your phone, and there is no checkout line. If legacy retailers want to survive the changing retail landscape, they must — at the very least — offer the same experiences in-store that shoppers can find online, a panel of retail experts on Friday told the annual Commercial Real Estate Summit. The event, now in its 28th year, drew a record crowd of more than 800 to the CenturyLink Center. Retail was top of mind, especially now that Omaha-based Gordmans’ fate is unknown as the department store chain navigates a bankruptcy and potential liquidation. Sears said this week it was on the brink of a second bankruptcy. Retailers nationally are shuttering stores, and some are closing altogether as they face stiff competition from online-only sellers and consumers’ changing shopping habits. “A lot of these retailers will disappear — I don’t think there’s any doubt about it,” Mark Hasebroock told the conference attendees. Hasebroock, founder of e-commerce site Hayneedle and Dundee Venture Capital, spoke on the panel focused on the evolution of retail, and how brokers can adapt. The year is already ramping up to be a bumpy one for retail companies and their landlords. Cushman & Wakefield anticipates as many as 5,000 major chain closures nationally this year, a 25 percent increase over 2016, according to a report by research firm CoStar. Part of the problem? Many retail companies aren’t focused on long-term investment that allows for evolution and, ultimately, survival, said Michael Staenberg, president of St. Louis development firm the Staenberg Group. Instead, they’re owned by private equity firms looking to make a return. “It’s, ‘How can I make money today?’ ” rather than what’s best for the business long-term, he said. Sears’ chief executive and chairman is also its top shareholder. Gordmans’ majority owner is Sun Capital Partners, a private-equity firm based in Florida. The days of a shopping center filling up with purely retail tenants are over, said Brian Kuehl, a retail broker at Investors Realty who also spoke on the panel. “They’re not really retail shopping centers; they’re service centers,” Kuehl said. Tenant mixes might include a medical clinic, a salon of some kind or an iPhone repair shop. Staenberg said his firm anchors many of its new developments with popular grocery stores because they guarantee some foot traffic. “It’s good to lease off that,” Staenberg said. “If you have the right locations and the right retailers it can be successful.” The upheaval is even affecting banks, said Leslie Anderson, president of Bennington Bank, who spoke on another panel. As more people bank and shop online, banks don’t need eight teller stations or nearly as many branches. The panel wasn’t all doom and gloom. The retail industry has always been evolving, said Ben Meier, a retail broker with the Lerner Co. Catalog shopping, QVC, the rise of Walmart and even door-to-door salesmen have all forced change in the retail industry in the past. “Our retail environment is always changing. We need to embrace the experience of shopping,” Meier said. The panel pointed to one retailer that is doing things right: Apple. Their stores are “the holy grail,” Hasebroock said. Meanwhile, another huge retail question mark sits at 72nd and Dodge Streets. Whether or not it will ever be overhauled became a point of debate during the conference, which featured a face-off between Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and her opponent, former State Sen. Heath Mello. The two sparred over several real estate-related projects, including the Crossroads Mall. Mello called the proposed Crossroads redevelopment “stagnant.” Stothert announced that she had just spoken Friday morning with the developer who wants to transform the corner. She said that the city has offered a package of incentives, including tax-increment financing, and that the ball now is in the developer’s court. The two also talked about balancing a desire to preserve Omaha’s history, and landmark buildings, with the needs of future development. In doing so, Stothert announced that the city will not — after all — demolish a century-old streetcar barn in northeast Omaha. Omaha Public Works officials previously wanted to raze the worn building to make way for a parking lot to serve an expanded city vehicle repair facility at 26th and Lake Streets. Restoration Exchange Omaha saw the property as a key to reviving the area’s legendary arts and entertainment scene and had protested. Stothert said she plans to announce soon what is planned as the next chapter for the old barn. To that, Mello said “thanks for taking my lead.” He said he had earlier talked about the need to save the garage structure. In other real estate-related news, Stothert told the group her administration is drafting an ordinance opening the door for a new financing tool that could assist commercial projects. “Pace” funding can be used only for energy-efficiency improvements. Mello pointed out that he was the sponsor of state legislation allowing Nebraska cities to tap the tool. No public funds are involved, but City Council approval is needed because an assessment is repaid as if it were property tax, said Chris Peterson of Pace Sage, the entity that wants to be Omaha’s lender. Meanwhile, both mayoral candidates said they support the proposed streetcar project that would connect downtown with fast-growing midtown retail and residential corridors. Echoing the sentiment were several other speakers at the conference, including Jay Lund of the Blackstone District, Todd Heistand of NuStyle Development and Jay Noddle, whose projects include Aksarben Village. “It’s super-important,” Noddle said of the streetcar. “It’s one of the things that’s got to happen next.” In other news at the conference: » Panelists talking about the “explosive world of multifamily” said they don’t believe the metro area’s apartment scene is overbuilt — yet. Josh Larsen, vice president of Northmarq Capital, said a vacancy rate of below 5 percent is great. With more than 2,500 new apartments expected to become available in the next two years, Scott Mausbach, an appraiser with Mainland Valuation Services, expects the vacancy rate to creep up and development to start slowing. Both Larsen and Mausbach said that Omaha, increasingly, is seeing outsiders shopping in Omaha for apartment projects. Mausbach expects them also to start buying and upgrading older apartment buildings — which could bring to the supply a different look and quality. » Five commercial real estate experts joined the Summit Hall of Fame Friday: Dan Smith of Smith Slusky Law, Ellen Albrecht of First American Title Insurance Co., Dennis Hogan III of Pansing Hogan Ernst & Bachman, and Keith Basham and Tim Holland of Holland Basham Architects. cindy.gonzalez@owh.com, 402-444-1224 paige.yowell@owh.com, 402-444-1414 More information Troubled Gordmans owes hundreds of thousands in rent, documents show Plummeting sales at the Omaha-based operator of 100 stores in 22 states appear to have bitten hard into bill-paying capacity.

Your kids won’t know the difference anyway by Lauren Ro@blauring Mar 24, 2017, 5:17pm EDT tweet share pin The Ami Rocker, $999, from Nursery Works can easily transform into a double-seater. Nursery Works A celebration of sofas, side tables, and everything in between, with intel on where to shop and the best pieces to buy, no matter your budget. Children’s furniture—like children’s clothing—is, by its very nature, meant to be outgrown. This makes it difficult to justify spending a lot of money on items that are essential, but only useful for a specific, finite period of time. Still, dressing up a nursery (if you’re lucky enough to have the extra space), or carving out a nook for your little one is something of a rite of passage. To help you get started, here are our picks for the best online resources that offer adorable, well-designed goods for baby and child. Parents love stalwarts like Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Buy Buy Baby for their affordability and general convenience, but if you’re looking for something a little more inspired—if only for “window shopping” purposes—we’ve got you covered. Carousel Crib, $499 The Land of Nod The Land of Nod Now part of the Crate & Barrel family, The Land of Nod is the one-stop shop for stylish and high-quality furniture that works well with adult-sized pieces already in your home. Putting safety first, the Illinois-based company also champions classic vintage design—but with a contemporary twist. Play Table, $269; Rabbit and Bear Play Chair, $226 (set of 2) Oeuf Oeuf Ouef (French for “egg”) began in Brooklyn, and was founded by real-life couple Michael Ryan and Sophie Demenge when their first child was born. With a focus on sustainably manufactured products, Oeuf offers sleek yet playful pieces that are built to last. Gradient Crib, $7,500 Nursery Works Nursery Works This is not your average children’s furniture company. Just check out that stunning (not to mention expensive) crib. Nursery Works: When they say they are a “purveyor of cutting-edge” pieces made for the “ultra-chic” with an aim to bring “high design” into the nursery, you’d better believe ’em. Emerson Dresser and Topper Set, $699 Pottery Barn Kids Pottery Barn Kids Pottery Barn’s line for the younger generation is just as classic and sturdy as the grown-up version. 1960 Albrecht Lange and Hans Mitzlaff Rocker, $980 Kinder Modern Kinder Modern New York City-based Kinder Modern is, according to its website, the only gallery that specializes in vintage children’s design of the 20th century as well as contemporary pieces from emerging talent. Though the furniture—mostly chairs and a few tables—is more objet than wholly functional, anything you pick up here is certain to be one of a kind. Also a way to start your kids early on collecting art. (That was a joke. Please don’t do this.)

Tanya Keenan-Mack, 37, was arrested by Lycoming County police after she allegedly sold $194 dollars worth of food stamps in exchange for heroin. The investigation began after a tip was received on February 6 that she posted an ad on “Williamsport New, Used, Buy and Sell” page on Facebook, stating that she was selling her food stamps worth $194 for $100. [Image by Shutterstock] It was revealed that Keenan-Mack was sent to jail for a probation violation in an unrelated forgery case. It was not mentioned whether she was in jail when the food stamps were used, but CBS Pittsburgh states that transactions were last recorded last month at a Walmart and Weis Markets. Keenan-Mack did request the assistance of a public defender, and currently has not made any comments on this particular case. As of right now, Pennsylvania does not participate in drug screenings for food stamps; however, according to Extract, there are 13 states that do require drug tests in order to receive government benefits. [Image by Shutterstock] Among the required states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. There are 19 additional states considering this stipulation, and West Virginia is currently in the process of changing their law, thus making it possible for drug testing to be mandated to “suspicious” welfare applicants starting in June, Think Progress reports. According to Think Progress, if an applicant in West Virginia should fail a mandated drug test, they will be able to receive government benefits only if they enroll in a drug treatment program and attend job training programs. A second failed drug test, however, would ban the applicant for a year, followed by a life-ban if a third drug test was failed. Furthermore, should a parent fail a mandated drug test, Child Protective Services will investigate the situation. West Virginia is awaiting federal approval, but should it receive approval, the new law will go into effect in June. According to a 2015 report, seven states that currently drug test for government benefits have found drug testing to be of little assistance. Statistics show that among Utah, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Arizona, very few drug users were found among government assistance applicants. The report revealed that less people were found to use drugs among those who applied for government benefits than the general public. “The national drug use rate is 9.4 percent. In these states, however, the rate of positive drug tests to total welfare applicants ranges from 0.002 percent to 8.3 percent, but all except one have a rate below 1 percent.” The said report certainly caused concern, having questioned whether or not drug screening those who apply for government benefits was truly worth the thousands of dollars spent. Certainly some drug users will be “weeded out” of the system, or perhaps even pushed in the right direction to gain access to the necessary help they may need, but is it worth the extra money? Some argue that drug tests are expensive and will not help with reducing the amount of drug use, but is it really that ineffective? Although there is much skepticism over the drug testing laws for government benefits, more proposals have been regularly popping up. These proposals seek drug test mandates for government benefits, hoping to reduce costs by eliminating drug users who may potentially use their benefits to purchase illegal drugs. Perhaps if Pennsylvania had drug test mandates, Keenan-Mack wouldn’t have had the opportunity to sell her food stamps for heroin because she wouldn’t have received the food stamps in the first place. What do you think about drug testing government assistance applicants?

WALL STREET SHUFFLE - the tyranny of mere wealth, the tyranny of plutocracy (Image by YouTube, Channel: JFWilliam)   Permission   Details   DMCA - Advertisement - By golly, The Donald delivers. Trump and his new blue-ribbon panel of working-class champions have announced a bold new initiative to create millions of American jobs. A spokesman for the panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to "do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans." Wait a minute -- Steve Schwarzman? Isn't he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes -- and holy money bags, there's Jamie Dimon, head of the scandal-ridden bank JPMorgan Chase. - Advertisement - Working-class champions? Hardly. Trump's whole "jobs" panel, it turns out, is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Wal-Mart that are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them "responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class." But now, in a spectacular flip-flop, he's brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. Worse, he's doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But there's not a single labor advocate on his policy council, in his cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called "job-creation plan" announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn't create any jobs, but calls instead for de-regulating Wall Street. These flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that "freeing" banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money to invest in American jobs. - Advertisement - Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump's scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn't require them to invest in jobs -- so they won't. There's a name for this: fraud.   - Advertisement - 2   1   View Ratings | Rate It Jim Hightower is an American populist, spreading his message of democratic hope via national radio commentaries, columns, books, his award-winning monthly newsletter (The Hightower Lowdown) and barnstorming tours all across America.

Union bosses are NOT "workers." Washington, as you know is a very aristocratic, closed society. How many middle class Americans are appointed to anything? Until this changes we will continue the to have a status-quo government which goes nowhere but down.

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.

The Federal Aviation Administration was warned a tragedy like this could happen. But it did nothing. Read the San Antonio Express-News investigation into the hot air balloon crash on our subscriber website, HoustonChronicle.com. Sue Rowan cherishes that last conversation with her son. During a long drive on a Friday night in late July, he called her. He was on his way back to San Antonio, where he was chief of clinical trials in burns and trauma for a ground-breaking research institute at the Brooke Army Medical Center. With the 34-year-old's career falling into place, it was time for other thoughts. "Do you want your next grandchild to be a girl or a boy?" he asked. She laughed. It didn't matter. Just a healthy child.

She definitely wanted a granddaughter. They already had a beautiful boy in their lives – 5-year-old Jett. Matt had married Jett's mother, Sunday Stewart Rowan, five months earlier. On that Friday night, Matt was on his way back from dropping Jett off with his father. Matt and his mother talked for about an hour. He was excited about a sand volleyball tournament and anxious about a $4 million research grant he'd been awarded. And he was pumped about a conference coming up in Hawaii. Sometime after they hung up, Matt and Sunday got an unexpected message. The hot-air balloon trip she had bought Matt for his birthday more than a year earlier was going to happen the next day. They'd had so many cancellations due to weather that Matt had given up. Sunday texted her mom, Janis Stewart, with lots of exclamation points. "Oh, my gosh," Janis texted back. "You have no idea how many times I have thought about this and hated the fact that you guys had lost your money on this." For years, Sunday had worked in children's retail stores, and she was always bestowing outfits on friends, and on the kids at church. Now, she'd give her last gift, finally, to her husband. **** Alfred "Skip" Nichols woke at 3:30 a.m. that Saturday, July 30, after sleeping six and a half hours. He poured some coffee. His roommate and ground crew chief, Alan "Bubba" Lirette, let the dogs out, checked the grass for dew and peered at the sky. It was clear. Nichols, 49, had come to Texas three years earlier after an early release from a Missouri prison. A string of drunken driving and drug convictions had left him unable to drive legally. He'd lied about his alcohol convictions on FAA forms – and the FAA knew that – but the agency let him pilot balloons anyway. Nichols, at 6 feet, 220 pounds, saw doctors in two states to treat a host of conditions, four of which could have disqualified him from flying under FAA rules. He had high blood pressure and cholesterol, diabetes treated with insulin, major depression, attention deficit disorder, insomnia, fibromyalgia and chronic back pain. On that morning, he may have taken eight or more pills – or he may have been coming down off pills taken in the hours or days before. Either way, coursing through his veins were the sedative Valium, the painkiller Oxycontin, two antidepressants, the ADHD stimulant Ritalin, the sedating allergy medicine Benadryl, a muscle relaxant, Tylenol and cough syrup. One FAA doctor later said the cocktail was a "witch's brew" that made it impossible to judge the degrees by which his judgment and coordination were impaired. The only certain thing was that, under FAA rules, the drugs disqualified him from flying. His final morning was pieced together through government documents, witness statements and presentations given to the National Transportation Safety Board at a public hearing. Lirette loaded the van with champagne and orange juice for passengers to celebrate post-flight. He knew Nichols had "a colorful past," but thought he was turning his life around. Voyages through the serene Central Texas skies in the yellow, smiley-face balloon seemed to be the best medicine of all. As they drove from the house, Nichols called the Lockheed Martin Flight Service for a pre-dawn weather briefing. After a few minutes, the person chatting with Nichols concluded: "Those clouds may be a problem for you." "Well, we just fly in between them," Nichols replied. "In between them?" "We find a hole, and we go." Crucially, the temperature and dew point were nearly equal, a sign that fog and mist could form at any time. Safe pilots don't fly in and out of clouds. Some won't fly when the cloud ceiling is as low as 3,000 feet. The clouds at San Marcos regional airport were at 700 feet. Across Central Texas, other commercial tours were canceling. But Nichols was in the Walmart parking lot in San Marcos, meeting the Rowans and 13 other passengers. He released a small weather balloon and chose his launch site, 12 miles southeast at Fentress Airpark. On the way there, he and Lirette noticed a layer of fog over the ground. By the time they were ready to launch, it was clear enough they could see a pole, outside the park's skydiving school, that they used to judge visibility. But clouds were still forming, and another bellwether – a nearby radio tower – was mostly obscured. Balloon pilots are taught never to stop making calculations. Weather changes in an instant. If the pilot sees something he doesn't like, cancellations can happen with passengers in the basket. Customer disappointment, in this business, is routine. One of Nichols' former pilots, Mike McGrath, said his boss wasn't immune to financial pressures. And if Nichols cancelled 10 days in a row and then had iffy weather, McGrath said, he might push it, especially with passengers waiting to fly – and especially at the end of the month, when bills were due. It was the end of the month, nearly 7 a.m. Nichols had 15 passengers who paid as much as $400 each. A mother and daughter. A grandmother. Five couples. No one knows exactly what calculation Nichols made in that moment – or how the brew of substances permeating his brain changed the equation. The sun was coming up. Matt helped hold the balloon, grinning and tugging on the red fabric as the burners filled it nine stories high. Sunday sent that image, and others, to her mother. "You guys look so cute!" Janis texted back. "It's so beautiful," Sunday wrote. "Worth the year and a half wait." Minutes later, they sailed into the clouds. The pictures kept coming on Janis' phone. Standing in the gondola. Going over the trees. A glimpse of fog. The reflection of the balloon in a stock tank. It was typical for Sunday, an effusive stream of photos and texts during a burst of excitement. Then, as was not typical, it all stopped. **** Sue was teeing off on a golf course near home in College Station when she got Sunday's photo of Matt holding the balloon. She played her round, got in the car and turned on news radio. They were reporting a hot-air balloon accident. She called Matt and Sunday and got no answer. She called Janis, who also lives in College Station. Janis told her not to worry, because it didn't sound to her like the right location. But Sue's stomach was churning. Matt and Sunday were on their phones all the time. Why hadn't they texted her? There was a frantic round of calls, within the families and between them. In their respective homes, they surrounded themselves with friends and relatives. Janis called Brent Jones, Jett's father, and told him to come. No official word came that day, but they'd seen a photo of Matt and Sunday from social media flash on the screen during a newscast. Sometime that afternoon in the Stewart household, the grim reckoning began: How – and when – to tell Jett. "Let's let him be 5 today," Janis told Brent. "He has the rest of his life to deal with the loss of his mother." On Sunday, a state trooper called to tell Janis that her daughter was on the flight manifest. She, her husband and Brent took Jett into a bedroom to get away from the crowd of visitors. They told him Mommy and Matt went on a balloon ride. They didn't think he understood, but he did. He'd seen one on Bugs Bunny. They didn't go into details about what happened. Just that there was an accident. They'd died. The balloon ride ended in heaven. Then the three of them held Jett. **** Late Monday afternoon, Sue and Janis stood with families in a field that's a two-hour drive west of College Station, near Lockhart. Thirteen stories above them, 340,000 volts of electricity made the power lines crackle and pop. When the balloon's envelope struck the wires, the hot lines sliced through the metal cables supporting the gondola. It caught fire and fell. All of the occupants died from the impact and fire, according to autopsy reports. All but two had to be identified by dental records. On TV, the burned patch where the gondola landed looked huge. It was strangely comforting to Janis to see that it was no bigger than a dining room table. Sunday was the second to last person identified, because Janis couldn't find her dental records. She started the process of DNA testing, but ultimately identified her by her wedding band. The James Avery ring matched Matt's. An investigator found another ring among the rubble. The Stewarts had given it to Sunday when she was 16, fashioned with a diamond from Janis' own jewelry. Sunday never took it off. Now her father wears it around his neck. Sue wishes she'd spent less time nagging Matt. She was on him about missing family functions for volleyball. But at his funeral, about 200 volleyball players showed up, and she realized they were his family, too. It weighs on her, the hundreds, maybe thousands of people who lost someone in this crash. How easy it could have been to stop. "I don't know what the answer is, but something needs to be done so not just anybody can fire up a balloon and take people up in it," she said. On Dec. 9, Janis went to Washington, to attend the NTSB hearing. She learned about warnings the FAA didn't heed. One thing stuck with her. State troopers, NTSB officials, people from other agencies, they'd all asked how they could help. Not the FAA. "I just think that's offensive," she said. "That doesn't cost them anything to exude some human compassion and kindness." The Stewarts are grieving for themselves and for Jett. Toward year's end, a group of kids from church offered to decorate their Christmas tree. Janis told them to use any ornaments they could find from a mass of decorations in the attic. She'd forgotten that years ago, she acquired a set in gold and crystal, in the shape of hot-air balloons. When Jett saw one on the tree, he brought it to her. Her heart sank. She offered to remove it. Instead, Jett hung it back up. Then he walked around the living room to make sure he could see it from every angle.

Can't Own A Dog? Don't Worry, Now You Can Borrow One A Bunch Of New Companies Just Pulled Their Google Ads Over Racist Videos Libby Watson Mar 25, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  advertising google youtube Share Yet more companies are pulling their ads from Google and YouTube because of fears the ads would appear alongside offensive content, according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal. Image: Getty Per the Journal's testing, ads for companies like Coca-Cola and Microsoft showed up on five racist and antisemitic YouTube videos, despite Google's recent promise to overhaul its advertising system. The Journal story didn't describe any of the objectionable videos in detail, but the reporter, Jack Nicas, tweeted some examples, including a Crest toothpaste ad running before a video titled "A 6000 Year History Of The Jew World Order". According to the Journal, Walmart, PepsiCo and Dish Network will pull all ads from Google, including YouTube, except those present on targeted search results. FX Networks said it would pull all of its Google ads. Starbucks will pull just YouTube ads, and a spokesperson sent Gizmodo the following statement about the debacle: We were shocked to learn about our brand being depicted in an inappropriate way. It does not align with our vision and values as a company. Our content should not have appeared before the video referenced or any videos like it. It has since been removed. We are currently in discussions with Google/YouTube to determine the best way to prevent this moving forward and have pulled our ads until we are confident that measures will be in place to adhere to our brand guidelines. In a statement, a PepsiCo spokesperson echoed those sentiments: We are deeply concerned and terribly disappointed that some of our brand ads have appeared alongside videos that promote hate and are offensive. PepsiCo has taken immediate steps to remove all advertising from non-search platforms until Google can absolutely ensure that this will not happen again. PepsiCo has a long history of embracing diversity and inclusion, and content like this violates our core values. Earlier this week, Google announced sweeping changes intended to ensure the "brand safety" of its advertisers, including allowing advertisers to exclude certain sites or channels across all of their campaigns at once. The day after the changes were announced, however, several companies, including AT&T and Johnson & Johnson, said they were going to pull their ads from the internet giant. The Journal report quoted an unnamed executive at one of the companies who expressed disappointment with Google's response. The company "had assured us over the past few days that our brands were safe from this type of content," but now "it's clear they couldn't give assurance," the executive said. Asked about the Journal report, a Google spokesperson told Gizmodo: We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands. The events of this week leave plenty of difficult questions for Google. As Nicas pointed out, we're now at the point "where a reporter spending few hours on YouTube can spark big brands to pull spending on Google". Google frequently points out that 400 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute, and, as Alphabet chairman and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt admitted this week, the company "can't guarantee" that these ads won't ever run alongside offensive content. While it's unlikely these ads only started appearing on awful videos in the last couple of weeks, the recent media coverage makes the position untenable for brands. They simply can't take that risk if it threatens their profits — because, like Google, these companies are really only concerned about their bottom line — at least not while people are paying attention to the issue. As more and more brands pull out, the pressure will likely build for others to do the same. [Wall Street Journal] Comments brettanthony @brettanthony Mar 26, 2017, 9:48am the company "can't guarantee" that these ads won't ever run alongside offensive content I can understand, from a technical point of view, that would be difficult, but certainly not once the site actually starts trending, and therefore Google must be aware of it. I certainly dont want tested scientifically proven facts, obliterated by fake, agenda based, web sites sprouted as "the truth", sitting at the top of Googles site ranking lists, and it seems money may stop it...but not logic and reason... go figure.

This program provides financial assistance to pre-kindergarten through 12th-grade schools in Illinois that would like to take a field trip to the I&M Canal Boat in LaSalle or a River Thru History in Willow Springs to learn about the history and impact of the Illinois & Michigan Canal. The I&M Canal Boat, The Volunteer, is a replica packet boat, just like one that transported passengers and goods along the I&M Canal more than 150 years ago. The Volunteer, is 76 feet long, holds 70 passengers, is pulled by a mule and operates from May to October. Field trips to the I&M Canal Boat in LaSalle include a 15-minute mule tending class; a 60-minute ride narrated by period-dressed guide and crew; followed by a 30-minute self-guided silhouette walk introducing students to historical Illinois & Michigan Canal figures including Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln, Wild Bill Hickok, Chief Shabonna and 10 other notables. Students learn about the history of the Illinois & Michigan Canal by experiencing actual travel on a mule-pulled canal boat, just as it was back in 1848. The estimated time at the site is two hours. A field trip to the I&M Canal Boat is a fun and engaging way to teach kids about early Illinois history. A River thru History — The Des Plaines Valley Rendezvous, in Willow Springs is a living history re-enactment of an event that would have occurred along the Des Plaines River when Illinois was French territory. Participants dress in period clothing and emulate what early American life was like from the fur trade era to the canal era. Students learn about American history, social customs, and the skills and tools that were necessary to survive on the Illinois frontier. The IMCNHA Field Trip Grant Program has only been possible with support from the community. Sponsors of this year’s Field Trip Grant Program include Illinois Cement Co., Walmart of Spring Valley, Kinder Morgan, Walmart of Ottawa, New Lenox and Peru, as well as James Hardie, Helco Corporation, Christopher Burke Engineering Ltd., and Centrue Bank of Ottawa. CCA has also received support from individual community members. There is no deadline for grant applications. All grants are provided on a first–received, first-funded basis. Assistance is tiered to respond to a schools’ financial need based on their percentage of low-income students. Grant monies are used to offset costs of transportation and boat tickets. The Canal Corridor Association’s mission is to preserve history, protect nature and open space, and create destinations where people can learn and have fun in the I&M Canal National Heritage Area from Chicago to LaSalle-Peru. The I&M Canal National Heritage Area is America’s first Heritage Area, designated by President Reagan in 1984. CCA is designated by Congress as the local coordinating entity for the I&M Canal National Heritage Area which includes 60 communities across five counties. The I&M Canal boat and the Lock 16 Cafe and Gift Shop are owned and managed by Canal Corridor Association. For more information, or to obtain a field trip grant application, visit www.lasallecanalboat.org or call 815-220-1848. Comments Get breaking news and weather sent to your phone.

In his latest filing today, Abbott reports getting $25,000 from Koch industries executive David Koch of New York. Koch executives gave Abbott more than $75,000 last year -- including $25,000 from the head of the company's fertilizer division -- five months after the ammonia nitrate explosion in West that killed 15 people. Koch industries makes a different type of fertilizer than the product that exploded in West. Koch says there was no connection between the contributions and the accident. Abbott has come under fire from Democrat Wendy Davis for ruling that the public can't have access to the state directory of the locations where dangerous chemicals are stored in Texas. Another big-name New York donor in Abbott's latest report is developer Donald Trump, who gave the Republican gubernatorial candidate $10,000. Nearly one-third of Abbott's $11 million total came from just 22 wealthy donors. Abbott received contributions of at least $100,000 from the 22 donors, including $250,000 each from Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton and Dallas investor Robert Rowling. He collected $100,000 donations from Doylene Perry of Houston, widow of major GOP donor Bob Perry; Dallas fracking and energy executive Trevor Rees-Jones; and Hunt Consolidated executive Ray Hunt of Dallas. Abbott’s largest out-of-state contribution was $50,000 from the Chickasaw Nation political committee, which operates casinos in Oklahoma.   ORIGINAL STORY In the fundraising wars of the Texas governor’s race, Republican Greg Abbott goes into the fall campaign with three times more money than Democratic challenger Wendy Davis. Abbott reports $35.5 million on hand in the latest money report. Davis reports $13. 1 million combined from her gubernatorial account, campaign ally Battleground Texas and the joint committee between Davis and Battleground Texas. Battleground Texas is the product of 2012 Obama presidential campaign organizers who have set up shop in the Lone Star State promising to turn the solidly Republican state Democratic. Both Abbott and Davis reported raising the same amount -- $11 million – in the latest campaign report period from the February primaries through June 30. At this clip, the campaign for governor could top $75 million by the time Texas voters go to the polls in November. Abbott, who has been attorney general for more than a decade, is the clear frontrunner in polls and fundraising. He reports raising $16.6 million this year alone. For Davis, the Fort Worth state senator catapulted to national attention by filibuster against abortion regulations, she has $27 million so far in the race. Abbott remains far ahead in fundraising in large because he started with a sizeable campaign war chest built on years in public office. Some estimates are that Abbott could spent $50 million to win the Governor's Mansion. Davis allies say she expects to have $25 million to spend on TV in the fall campaign. Both campaigns have been engaged in active social media campaigning – including digital ads promoted on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. In a new twist, Abbott is taking his campaign to the movies. He is running an ad in two dozen movie theaters across the state, playing on every screen a film is being shown. The ad asks moviegoers to text the word “FREEDOM” to the campaign. The effort is aimed at collecting information the campaign can use to identify and boost turnout in November.

She's only been drinking water and tea, but the liquids don't prevent her stomach from rumbling during class. "The first two days were rough … I'm relatively tired right now," she said. Birri, a freshman majoring in environmental science at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, is one of 19 students who started fasting March 20 in response to the university renewing a lease that allows fast-food chain Wendy's to operate a restaurant inside the Wexner Medical Center on campus. In November, Ohio State extended its lease with Wendy's, which is headquartered in the nearby suburb of Dublin, Ohio. Birri and members of student groups Real Food OSU and Ohio State Student/Farmworker Alliance want their school to cut ties with Wendy's unless the fast-food chain joins the Coalition of Immokalee Workers' Fair Food Program. Continue on your Lenten journey with FREE seasonal formation and liturgical articles from our sister publication, Celebration Publications. Visit the new online resource page here. According to Birri, Ohio State officials had said the school wouldn't renew the lease unless Wendy's joined the Fair Food Program. "Extending the lease was a violation because those requirements were not met," Birri said Since 1993, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers has been lobbying to improve rights for farmworkers. The organization, based in Immokalee, Florida, seeks to eliminate slave labor in farms, gender-based violence, sexual harassment and human trafficking. In 2011, the coalition launched the worker-driven Fair Food Program, a partnership among farmers, farmworkers and food companies that ensures livable wages and humane conditions for produce pickers. The program was designed and implemented by workers, and now protects thousands of farmworkers. Under the Fair Food Program, every farmworker must punch in and out of work to keep track of how many hours per week they're working. They are guaranteed a minimum wage, even if they don't meet their daily quota. The program has also instituted a 24/7 hotline for farmworkers to report any violations. Participating retailers in the program include Taco Bell, McDonald's, Burger King, Walmart and Whole Foods Market. Wendy's, however, has yet to join the Fair Food Program. "We support the goals of any organization that seeks to improve human rights, but we don't believe we should pay another company's employees — just as we do not pay factory workers, truck drivers or maintenance personnel that work for our other suppliers," said a statement on Wendy's blog, The Square Deal, posted Oct. 17, 2016. The blog post says it used to purchase its tomatoes from Florida in the colder months, but now gets them from Mexico. In a rebuttal to The Square Deal's blog post, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers said importing tomatoes from Mexico is unethical, citing Richard Marosi's four-part series of articles on the slavery conditions Mexican farmworkers face that appeared in The Los Angeles Times in 2014. "Wendy's is perpetuating an industry of abuse," Julia de la Cruz, an organizer for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, told NCR March 20 through translator Shelby Mack, an organizer for the Alliance for Fair Food. De la Cruz said the Fair Food Program guarantees full transparency to farmworkers, and farms that don't try to resolve complains face certain consequences. Heidi Schauer, director of corporate communications for Wendy's, told NCR in an email that the company had recently expanded its supplier code of conduct to include additional requirements in regards to human rights and labor practices. The new requirements incorporate third party reviews on human rights and labor practices for produce suppliers. "We require responsible business practices in our supply chain and will continue to work to bring greater transparency to these practices," Schauer said. But according to de la Cruz, third party monitoring provides no kind of actual enforcement. After 11 years as a farmworker, de la Cruz said working conditions are much better now thanks to the Fair Food Program. She said it's now common for farmworkers to work seven to nine hours per day, depending on the weather condition and current demand for tomato production. Farmworkers also no longer have to start working at extremely early hours and can take breaks when needed, something many farms outside of the program do not offer. De la Cruz has been in Columbus for about a month educating consumers about Wendy's' alleged exploitation of farmworkers and the coalition's ongoing 12-city, two-week Return to Human Rights Tour. The tour ends March 26 in Columbus, when Birri, de la Cruz and other Ohio State students and community members will greet the farmworkers before marching at the Parade for Human Rights in Goodale Park. De la Cruz said she will return to Immokalee with her cohorts after the parade concludes. Before the tour bus arrives, students in Real Food OSU and the Ohio State Student/Farmworker Alliance have been supplementing their hunger strike by staying in a tent on campus to share their cause with other students and hanging outside university president Michael Drake's office with the hopes of making direct contact with him. Ohio State is aware that 19 of its students are participating in a hunger strike. Benjamin Johnson, Ohio State's director of media relations, said in an email to NCR that the university doesn't condone "the use of any potentially harmful actions that could jeopardize the health and well-being of our students." Johnson mentioned the university arranged for students to meet with Wendy's directly, but they declined the offer. The university's administration "seemed so eager to get us there," Birri said. "We felt like it was a way to dissuade us from doing the fast and to be patronizing about what we're doing. And for the meeting to be out of eyes of public record it … it didn't feel right. There's no need for discussion right now, only decisions." Students met with Ohio State officials March 24 to discuss the university's contract with Wendy's, but walked out of the meeting after 40 minutes when they were left with ambiguous answers. Drake, the president of the university, was not present. Schauer also said Wendy's is aware of the current protests, and said they are a "business matter" for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. "We find it irresponsible for this group to support their commercial agenda by encouraging young people to forgo nutrition and endanger their health," she said. Birri said she and other Ohio State students drew inspiration from the farm labor organizing of Cesar Chavez, who used fasting as part of his strategy. Chavez co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with Dolores Huerta in 1961. During his lifetime, he led union members and farmworkers in multiple hunger strikes as a nonviolent way to achieve humanitarian treatment, including fair wages and access to clean water, education, housing and medical care.

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio Google has apologised for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavoury videos on YouTube after an ad boycott by big firms. Source: AAP 25 Mar 2017 - 11:14 AM  UPDATED 25 Mar 2017 - 11:14 AM Tweet An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening in a sign that big companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologised for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavoury videos. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.

The closures are part of the 100 closings announced in August 2016.  The announcement came alongside news that Macy's comparable store sales declined by 2.1 percent in the months of November and December 2016 combined. Meanwhile, the retailer's digital business saw double digit gains at both Macys.com and Bloomingdales.com in its third quarter 2016. “Our omnichannel strategies continue to evolve based on the changes in our customers' shopping behaviors, including a focus on buy online, pickup in store and mobile-enabled shopping," said Macy's chairman and CEO Terry J. Lundgren of the closures. While big box retailers, like Walmart for example, pushed their buy online, pickup in store capabilities this holiday season, this move from Macy's seems to be counterproductive. "When you close down a store, what most retailers forget is that you're also losing that option for your customers, and you're also losing that option to buy online and return to store," explained Brendan Witcher, Principal Analyst coving retail strategy at Forrester Research, Inc. He noted closures are not just affecting store sales, but also online stores. So many retailers are asking, "how do I beat Amazon?" and the one thing Amazon doesn't have is physical stores. The question, he said, is "how do you turn those physical locations from liabilities into assets?" Lundgren said the company believes its performance during the holiday season "reflects the broader challenges facing much of the retail industry." While pleased with the performance of digital business, he said "store sales continued to be impacted by changing customer behavior." "This is kind of a reflection of their issues of connecting better with the customer," said Witcher. Macy's appears aware of this, having invested in and enlarged its customer data and analytics team, which, according to Lundgren will help drive its new marketing strategies for 2017. Witcher expects we'll see more closings throughout 2017 from retailer's facing this challenge. The connecting points between retailers already announcing stores closings is they're all "having trouble connecting and staying relevant with today's customer," while other retailers, such as Sepora, are actually expanding their footprint. "They're doing it because they're leaders in customer engagement," he noted.  Lundgren said the plan to close 100 stores over the next few years is an important part of Macy's strategy to "help us right-size our physical footprint as we expand our digital reach." Of the 68 stores, three closed in 2016, 63 will close spring of this year, and two will be closed in mid-2017. Three other locations were sold, or are to be sold, and are being leased back. The company intends to close approximately 30 additional stores over the next few years. "We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetizing locations with highly valued real estate,” Lundgren said. The company estimates that 3,900 associates will be displaced as a result of these closures. Employees displaced "may be offered positions in nearby stores where possible." "The challenge is that Macy's needs to gain more relevancy with their consumers," said Witcher. "They need to differentiate themselves more. They sort of live in the middle of retail right now and they need to find someplace where they can breakout and differentiate themselves." Regardless of its strong online business, e-commerce is still going to be the minority of Macy's business. "Macy's isn't going to turn into that one company that does 80% of their business online," he said. "No one should take this as a reflection that somehow physical retail is dying. The fact of the matter is physical retail is evolving. The business is shifting to players that get it, from players that just simply are having troubles right now."       YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Enterprise Resource Management Macy’s Finds Ray of Hope in Double-Digit Digital Sales Growth Business Intelligence (BI) Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren Outlines Plan to Rebound After Sales Drop 5.2% Customer Service Macy's Continues Tech Investment Despite Slumping Sales Omnichannel Macy’s Picks New CEO, Lundgren to Step Down in 2017 Business Intelligence (BI) Macy's to Close 40 Stores and Layoff Thousands as Sales Continue to Slump RELATED TOPICS E-Commerce Mobile Apps E-Commerce Platform Omnichannel RIS Deep Dive: Unified Commerce Footer Social LinkedIn Twitter Youtube Facebook Footer Contact Us Editorial Board Media Kit Privacy Statement Terms & Conditions © 2017 EnsembleIQ, All Rights Reserved

The Wall Street Journal reports that YouTube videos centered around racist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic views are still scooping up ads from brands like Coca-Cola, Amazon.com, and Microsoft. This is even after reports last week exposed the issue and led to mass advertising boycotts in the UK and now the US, prompting Google to promise companies it would solve the issue and implement better tools and moderation practices. Advertisers continue to pull back from Google Following The Wall Street Journal’s findings, PepsiCo, Walmart, Dish, Starbucks, and GM all pulled their advertising, joining a growing list of dozens of companies in Europe and the US since The Times of London first shined a spotlight on the problem. A majority of these companies are pulling advertising from YouTube and sites that use Google’s ad exchange technology. That means not only is Google’s video arm taking a hit, but its broader network of web advertising is suffering, too, as companies are under the assumption that Google is incapable of policing neither YouTube videos nor third-party websites with its current blend of user flagging, human moderation, and algorithmic detection. That leaves only targeted search advertising intact, which is when a company pays money to bid for placement of an ad on Google’s search results page when a user types in a certain combination of keywords. Even still, some companies like FX Networks have begun pulling all advertising from Google, including search ads, until it resolves the issues at hand, The Wall Street Journal reports. READ MORE: There’s no easy fix for Google’s YouTube problem This has become a rather precarious problem for YouTube and Google’s larger advertising operation, both of which rely on what’s called programmatic advertising that uses algorithms and not humans to dictate placement. For years, YouTube has championed itself as the destination for any and all video on the internet, with loose restrictions around graphic and offensive content and creators espousing views many traditional broadcasters would classify as hate speech. This has allowed YouTube to balloon in popularity. Even when it does veer into hosting illegal content, like copyrighted material or terrorist propaganda, the site is shielded by federal law from being legally held responsible. The end result is that YouTube enjoys 400 hours of video uploaded every minute and 1 billion hours of video consumed every day, with around $11 billion in revenue last year. Yet a growing chunk of that video is the type of content advertisers want nothing to do with. And due to the current political climate, it’s become increasingly popular for content creators to make a living off hateful content that panders to bigots and fringe political groups like the alt-right. YouTube is now in the position of being structurally incapable of policing its platform and perhaps culturally hesitant even to do so with more heavy-handed moderation methods. Google is promising a fix as soon as Sunday Even more pressing is the possibility that YouTube’s business simply cannot operate at its current scale with the human moderation required to ensure no ad is placed on an objectionable video. Google is willing to try, if only to stem the exodus of advertisers. “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” Google said in a statement given to The Verge on Wednesday. “We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” That statement followed a more direct plea to advertisers earlier this week in which Google promised it would be giving brands more direct control over and insight into where ads were placed on YouTube and Google-partnered third-party sites. The company also promised new tools like artificial intelligence-powered filtering that would detect offensive language and other contents within a video and flag it. Bloomberg reports that Google plans on implementing these new tools and changes as soon as this Sunday, according to an internal company memo. Yet it’s unclear just how effective Google’s new tools will be, and what it might take to bring advertisers back.

TBI encourages property owners, especially large land owners or people in rural areas to check their grounds for the two.

It won’t work The federal government is trying to centrally plan innovation. It won’t work The Trudeau government’s 2017 federal budget talks a big game about innovation policy, but it misunderstands how firms actually implement change Mar 24, 2017 Jason Kirby   0 Finance Minister Bill Morneau, left, shakes hands with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Sean Kilpatrick/CP) The very first table you come across when reading the Trudeau government’s 2017 budget isn’t about tax changes, spending measures or the Canadian economy at all. Under a section titled “The case for innovation,” Table 1 compares the five most valuable U.S. companies in the years 2001 and 2016. The biggest companies back then were mostly stuffy giants like General Electric, Exxon, Walmart and Citi—the budget’s authors managed to refrain from labeling them “old economy” companies, but that was clearly the intent. The “new” economy, then, is a digital one, as characterized by the big five in 2016: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. There’s even a footnote to tell you those are technology companies, in case you still don’t get it. Canada’s 2017 federal budget isn’t very innovative about driving innovation The accompanying message: the world is changing fast, but fear not, this government knows “what Canadians need to succeed in an evolving economy.” From that point on, budget 2017 more or less unfolds as a central planner’s instruction manual For Make Benefit Glorious Digital Economy of Canada. Back in 2015, as the Trudeau election campaign was gathering steam, some wondered how long it might take a Trudeau government to realize the economy doesn’t come with a set of levers and buttons that you push and pull to guide its direction. But the budget released Wednesday was a full-on embrace of 1970s-style industrial policy—a verboten term for decades in federal politics—reflecting just how deeply the Trudeau team believes those levers and buttons exist. In the budget there are bold vows—oddly reminiscent of China’s annual edicts for economic growth rates—about boosting exports by 30% in the next eight years (even though exports have climbed just 2.9% from eight year ago). It calls for clean technology to become a bigger share of GDP. The government even set a target for its “innovation and skills plan” of creating 14,000 new, high-growth companies by 2025. And how shall all this come to pass? Specific industries were name-checked as priorities for government attention: advanced manufacturing, agri-food, clean technology, digital industries, health/bio-sciences and clean resources. Hundreds of millions will go towards creating a “venture capital catalyst initiative.” The government’s many varied and overlapping innovation programs will be streamlined to better assist the busy entrepreneur on the go. Canada’s cleantech industry is bigger than you think Meanwhile Ottawa’s economy planners want to guide the creation of “innovation superclusters” across Canada—areas with a high concentration of businesses focused on particular industries (see the list of Chosen Ones above), situated alongside universities and overflowing with talent. Think Silicon Valley, the go-to region that every government the world over, including this one, believes can be replicated at home, if they just put their minds and enough resources to it. It’s easy to draw a line between this strategy and the lads and lasses at McKinsey & Co. The global consulting giant makes its living telling other companies, governments and organizations how to be more innovative, and right now McKinsey is run by a Canadian, Dominic Barton, who also heads Ottawa’s Advisory Council on Economic Growth. Indeed, from the budget’s highly-produced cover—complete with a suitably diverse array of Canadians and overlaid with hand-drawn illustrations—down to the innovation jargon slathered throughout its pages, the budget could easily be mistaken for one of the firm’s high-priced consulting reports. The word “superclusters,” for one, might almost require a trademark symbol beside each mention. In last year’s budget the concept of targeting specific regions to encourage innovation was introduced, but back then they were simply referred to as  “clusters.” But McKinsey consultants have spanned the globe preaching the gospel of superclusters with great urgency. Just this past December McKinsey produced a primer—no doubt required reading at Innovation Canada—on how to spur the region between Toronto and Waterloo to “global technology supercluster status” like, you guessed it, Silicon Valley, but also Berlin and Tel Aviv. (Budget 2017 uses the same cities as examples.) “The opportunity is there,” the McKinsey report notes, “but the window could be closing quickly.” Act fast, this great offer won’t last long. The previous Harper government shares some responsibility for what the Trudeau government is embarking on now. It had already played footsie with industrial policy. It perfected the art of doling out taxpayer money to favoured sectors, and used the language of levers and buttons in its own budgets. The Trudeau government simply picked up the thread and put some serious (borrowed) coin behind it, with its big-innovation, big-infrastructure plan racking up $145 billion in deficits over six years. Want to build a truly innovative economy? Get a good barista There are any number of reasons why Canadians should be wary of the government’s central planning approach to the economy, aside from the obvious question of whether we can afford it. Given that McKinsey’s fingerprints are all over the budget, it’s worth remembering that when it comes to dishing out advice, the firm has a less-than-stellar track record. A few years ago U.S. investor and highly-regarded author Barry Ritholtz summarized the multitude of instances where McKinsey strategists were embroiled in financial messes around the globe—the firm was once described as “the company that built Enron” and its advice has been connected to numerous corporate failures. “Indeed,” Ritholz wrote, “wherever there has been a financial disaster in the world, if you look around, somewhere in the background, McKinsey & Co. is nearby.” Another problem is the challenge governments have always faced when they try to select winning companies and industries while avoiding losers. It’s incredibly difficult and there’s an overwhelming likelihood that you’re going to get it wrong. For instance, there’s a section in the budget about creating a supercluster around artificial intelligence, one of the brightest and shiniest sectors going at the moment. Yet lines from the budget like this, “Activity needs to remain in Canada to harness the benefits from artificial intelligence,” embody the problem with the industrial policy approach. You can deploy the force of government to try to build a domestic industry that develops the raw tools of artificial intelligence, but there’s no certainty of success, and in doing so you risk squeezing out entrepreneurs and companies who might otherwise have imported those tools from abroad and used them in ways you can’t now even imagine. That table about company market caps referred to above is another case in point. You’ll note the government chose 2001, after the giant tech bubble of the late 1990s had imploded, as its starting point, thereby overlooking a period when the biggest companies in the land were all tech firms. Go back just one or two years earlier and Cisco and Intel would have made the cut, too, yet both technology companies are now worth half of what they were back then. It’s a reminder that many of yesterday’s winners are today’s losers, just as many of today’s winners will turn out to be losers tomorrow. But we don’t know—can’t know—which they will be, and trying to stage-manage the economy as if you do is dangerous. Jim Balsillie on how Canada is doing innovation wrong—and how to fix it For all the talk of fostering superclusters and creating new companies, it should be noted that there’s very little in the way of new financial resources to back that up in the budget—despite the big deficits. For instance, the government says it will invest $950 million over five years to support “superclusters,” but the vast bulk of that money is repurposed from last year’s budget, with the remainder scraped from “public transit and green infrastructure” funding allocated in the 2016 fall economic statement. In that way, what mattered more on Wednesday than the dollar figures in the budget, was the government’s unabashed commitment to trying to direct the economy from above—and the absolutism with which it believes these policies will pay off. At least, that’s the plan.

The Issaquah, Wash.-based membership club has long been a poster child for success in the bricks-and-mortar world, but it is still in the early stages of translating those results online. “Costco is generally behind on its online development when compared with Sam’s Club or Walmart, in some ways by design,” said Tim Campbell, an analyst at Kantar Retail. “An overzealous online strategy could cannibalize its in-club sales as members would shop more on Costco.com and less in the club.” In fact, in recent earnings calls Costco has noted that in markets where it has partnered with third-party delivery services such as Google Express and Instacart, the number of trips its loyal members make to its stores has declined. Costco partners with Google Express in five cities and with Instacart in 26 cities. It also recently said it has been in talks with Google Express to launch nationwide delivery. As Instacart has expanded to additional markets, Costco has generally expanded with it, Campbell noted. The partnership with Shipt, which will not require shoppers to have a Costco membership, marks Costco’s first with that rapidly expanding third-party delivery provider. Shipt recently unveiled a partnership with Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Meijer through which it will expand in several Midwestern markets. Other retail partners in the 34 markets where Shipt offers delivery include H-E-B, Whole Foods, Publix, Harris Teeter and others. Birmingham, Ala.-based Shipt charges a $99 annual membership, which allows users to receive unlimited grocery deliveries (free with a $35 minimum order). Orders can be scheduled for same-day delivery and within a one-hour time window. Campbell notes that Costco does not offer a click-and-collect grocery service, which an increasing number of its traditional supermarket competitors do, and in fact its own website lacks a full grocery-ordering capability. “Costco recognizes this is an area where rapid progress must be made lest its shoppers decide to forego the in-club trip for online shopping at a different, more capable, retailer,” he said. “Its members are already shopping online at Amazon at a higher rate than all U.S. shoppers. If Costco does not improve its online offering, other retailers will step into that gap.” Bill Bishop, chief architect with Barrington, Ill.-based Brick Meets Click, said the fact that Costco is working with multiple delivery partners shows that it is still evaluating its options for grocery delivery. “It is becoming increasingly evident that there is a fair amount of demand for people to have groceries delivered to home, and they sell a fair amount of groceries, so I think they don’t want to miss out on that segment,” he said. Shipt’s agreement to expand with Meijer after a year-long test could give Shipt, which has lacked the high-profile investments that have been made in rival Instacart, a shot in the arm, Bishop said. “There must be some pretty good talent on the part of Shipt,” he said. “Meijer seems enthusiastic, and that’s a nice feather in their cap.” Making improvements Costco has been taking several measures to improve its e-commerce offering, including simplifying the user interface and increasing the number of depots from which it delivers product. In its second-quarter earnings call, which covered most of the year-end holiday shopping season, Costco said its online sales were up 12% over a year ago. “While Costco’s online capabilities and especially online assortment may be behind the curve in some areas, Costco.com growth continues in the double-digit growth range,” said Campbell, adding that the online sales gains have “less to do with Costco’s online prowess and more to do with the larger to shift to more online shopping, combined with Costco’s general popularity.” Campbell said in the short term, customers might find value in having both a Costco and and Amazon Prime membership. “Costco continues to offer excellent price per unit value and a true treasure hunt experience, while Amazon offers convenience and a plethora of value-adds such as media and services,” said Campbell. “In the long term, Amazon poses a significant threat to Costco. Platforms like Amazon Pantry and Amazon Business can chip away at parts of Costco’s base as Amazon displays a ceaseless willingness to innovate new ways of increasing its share of the online wholesale pie.” TAGS: Marketing 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Shoppers at the Publix store in Ballantyne pass by a price comparison display in this photo from 2014. David T. Foster, III dtfoster@charlotteobserver.com i By Katherine Peralta kperalta@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story There seems to be no shortage of (very) strong opinions in Charlotte about the city’s uneven grocery store development. I wrote a story earlier this month about how new supermarkets are being built almost on top of one another in more affluent parts of Charlotte, but development tends to steer clear of lower-income areas. Margins are thin in the grocery industry, so companies try to be strategic about placing stores in areas with the most profit potential. The seven grocery stores that have opened in Mecklenburg County since 2015 are located in thriving, predominantly white neighborhoods where the median household income is nearly 50 percent higher than the county’s median of $56,800, we found. But lack of access to a full-service grocery store makes life harder for some folks, many of whom rely on public transportation. I spoke with one woman who lives off West Boulevard and doesn’t have a car. For her, shopping for groceries means taking a bus uptown, then transferring to another bus that takes her to a Wal-Mart Supercenter on Wilkinson Boulevard. After I wrote that story, emails, tweets, phone calls and letters to the editor flowed in – some readers pleaded for better bus routes in Charlotte, others questioned why corporations would ever want to expand into impoverished areas where crime is high. One woman called to personally offer to drive residents who live along West Boulevard to the grocery store. Grocery chains, for their part, say they consider a variety of factors when choosing locations – from traffic patterns to residential growth to demographics and economics. There’s clearly no simple solution to Charlotte’s uneven grocery store growth. Still, there is no denying that some parts of Charlotte are enjoying the city’s development boom much more than others. Here are some of the comments I’ve received from Charlotte readers: ▪ Beth Racine, an associate professor of public health at UNC Charlotte, noted that while “food is a business,” the fact that full-service stores gravitate away from low-income areas is detrimental to the public health of people who live there. According to Racine’s research, only about 78 percent of the people who qualify for SNAP benefits (food stamps) in Mecklenburg County end up redeeming them, for whatever reason. But those who do receive them often use them at grocery stores, she noted. Improving the application rate of the program, and having it available at co-ops like the one described in the story, Racine said, would be beneficial. ▪ A reader named Ed Stone proposed a neighborhood ride-sharing initiative for grocery trips. Stone sees that kind of effort as a way for a neighborhood to fix its own problems, especially with the support of activists and community organizations. “Rather than a complicated ‘Uber-like’ web-based approach, it could simply be offered by handwritten fliers on residents doors,” Stone said. ▪ Many reached out to ask why grocers would expand into “crime-ridden areas.” That would be bad business, they said. After all, the objective of the grocery industry is to make a profit. “My understanding of the retail grocery business is that their goal is to make money, not crusade for social equality,” Mike Wilson of Concord wrote in a letter to the editor. ▪ Several readers decried the issue as a socioeconomic ill that should be addressed by city policymakers. Some asked whether it was possible to use tax incentives to entice major grocery chains to areas bereft of stores – the addition of stores, they said, would provide not only access to fresh food, but also employment opportunities. “Charlotte will not become a great city because of its shiny buildings or sports teams. It will only be great when it puts people in need first,” Kathy Robertson said in an email. ▪ Robert Epes noted on Twitter that “free market has limitations.” “Gov intervention for greater good sometimes (is) A++,” he said. ▪ Many think that the CATS bus system needs to add routes to areas with more retail options. “Once again, public transit is failing those who need it most,” tweeted Cody Stadler. So, what do you think? Let us know in the comments.

Amazon now has a handful of Amazon Prime-eligible Nintendo Switch consoles available for sale. While the price on models varies because they’re from third-party sellers, you can now pre-order Neon Red and Grey Joy-Con with Prime shipping. Most third-party sellers have estimated in stock dates of around March 25 to April 1. Read: Nintendo Switch Sells Estimated 1.5 Million Units Worldwide In First Week Third-party sales of the Switch have remained steady because of several issues. For retailers, Switch inventory is still fairly unpredictable despite its spring launch. Stores like Target and Wal-Mart still don’t have the console in stock and when inventory comes in, it’s often at inconsistent amounts and unpredictable times. But despite the limited inventory, the initial wave of sales for the Switch wasn’t artificially fueled. In a talk with investors Thursday, Gamestop chief operating officer Tony Bartel said the retailer nearly sold a copy of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for every Switch they sold. Coming close to selling a copy of Breath of the Wild with every Switch is notable, since the consoles were sold only with accessories and no games. Read: Every Big Nintendo Switch Launch Title For Release Day & Beyond If you manage to get your hands on a new Switch, though, Nintendo wants to ensure that you’ll have content and functioning hardware to look forward to. Earlier this week, Nintendo confirmed that it’s fixed signal problems with the Joy-Con controller. The console will also have several high-profile games like Splatoon 2 on its release calendar later this year.

Las Cruces Police learned that an 80-year-old woman was shopping at the Walmart store, at 571 Walton Blvd., when she had her purse stolen from a shopping cart. The incident occurred at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, March 21. Investigators reviewed surveillance video from the store and discovered that a couple – a man and woman – could be seen following the 80-year-old woman throughout the store. At some point, the man distracted the 80-year-old shopper while his accomplice grabbed the purse from her shopping cart. The couple fled the store and were seen leaving the parking lot in a dark-color car that’s possibly a station wagon or PT Cruiser with faux-wood trim panels on its sides. Amongst other items, the victim’s purse contained cash and bank cards. Investigators learned that the couple further victimized the 80-year-old woman by using one of her bank cards to withdraw cash at Citizens Bank, at 2511 E. Lohman Ave., later that day. Police have released images of the suspects with the hopes of identifying them. Anyone with information that can help identify the suspects is asked to call Las Cruces Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or send a tip by text message to CRIMES (274637), keyword LCTIPS. The Crime Stoppers number and text messaging services are operational 24 hours a day and you do not have to give your name to collect a reward.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation Amazon To Charge Sales Tax, But Beats IRS On Its Own Taxes Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Amazon To Charge Sales Tax, But Beats IRS On Its Own Taxes Posted at 12:45 pm on March 24, 2017 by Neil Stevens Share on Facebook Share on Twitter For years, failing big box retailers have blamed sales taxes for their inability to compete with Amazon. Now they’re going to have to prove it. Amazon is charging sales tax in every state that has one. 45 states have statewide sales taxes. That is, every state but Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon have them. Which means in every state but those, Amazon will be charging you sales taxes on your purchases. It’s a done deal. Trending An Ultimatum of Doom: Failure is Not an Option on Obamacare Repeal Josh Kimbrell According to all those old, cronyist local businesses who first blamed Walmart for their failures, but now are blaming Amazon, that should fix everything. They’ve been assuring us that the only reason people buy online instead of locally is that people didn’t pay sales taxes on their online purchases. Selection never came into it, allegedly. Nor did lower base prices, convenience of shopping from home, and a desire to avoid rude or apathetic retail employees. According to the industry lobbyists, sales taxes were everything. Well, now the sales tax playing field has been leveled. If the big boxes continue to fail, and Amazon continues to succeed, we’ll know what the truth was all along, won’t we? One interesting part about this is that Amazon certainly isn’t afraid to fight the government on unfair taxes. They just beat the IRS to the tune of $1.5 billion. Billion with a B.

It's not an illusion — chain supermarkets have been lowering their rates to keep up with the competitive times. USA Today reports the pricing scale is offering shoppers great bargains, but it's taking the axe to grocery store's profits. "It's created a price war among everybody," Phil Lempert, a supermarket analyst, tells USA Today. "This is great news for consumers, but bad news for businesses who sell food." The fierce competition is coming from bargain shops like Walmart, online retailers, and wholesale stores. And, according to NPR, shoppers are choosing smaller markets, convenience stores, farmers markets, and even dollar stores over brick-and-mortar grocery stores. To keep up, grocery chains are dropping prices and trying harder than ever to sell more volume to make up costs. According to the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, the cost of supermarket items dropped by 1.3 percent last year — the first decline since 1967. Cost-cutting is being seen across the board. Wegmans slashed prices on bananas, peanut butter, beef, and dairy. Even wholesaler Costco dropped prices for eggs (18 extra-large eggs cost $3.61 last year, but now cost $1.79), pistachios, and liquid detergent. (Image credit: Sergey Ryzhov/Shutterstock) Online grocery shopping is also a looming threat. According to the "The Digitally Engaged Food Shopper" report from the Food Marketing Institute, the market for shopping for food online has the potential to grow five-fold over the next 10 years. American consumers may be spending around $100 billion on online groceries by 2025, reports CNBC. Already a quarter of American households are purchasing some parts of their groceries online, and millennial shoppers surveyed by the Food Marketing Institute reported more willingness to shop online for groceries. But the report doesn't have a bleak forecast for supermarkets. It predicts traditional grocery stores will have to "reconfigure" their strategy. "Only the retailers that first develop an understanding of their digitally engaged shoppers, build a strategy around that understanding, and cost-effectively integrate digital food retail into their banner and channel promise will be market leaders," the report states.

Alexis graduated from Avon Park High School, studied mathematics and philosophy as an undergraduate at Palm Beach Atlantic University, and has a master's degree in education from Grand Canyon University.

In the interest of maintaining a civil forum, Alexis asks that all queries be appropriately respectful and maintain a level of civility. As the saying goes, “iron sharpens iron,” and the best way to sharpen one’s mind is through constructive criticism, good and bad. However, Alexis has no patience with name-calling and ad hominem attack.

View Latest Posts >>> Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu is “anti-Semitic” By Jonas E. Alexis on March 24, 2017 Suppose Wal-Mart closes at midnight and does not allow anyone into the store until the next morning. Would it be anti-Semitic to say that Wal-Mart does not allow Jews into the store after midnight? According to the implications of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has propounded, it is. …by Jonas E. Alexis   Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel couldn’t live in our modern time. Why? Because they would almost certainly realize that reason and the Israeli regime are incompatible. And they would not appreciate it if a group of individuals is deliberately trying to stop them from exercising their rational inquiry. Some scholars have perversely and unconvincingly attempted to demonstrate that Kant and Hegel were part of the German “anti-Semitism” in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,[1] but this frivolous and risible attempt lacks intellectual depth and fails to address historical realities.[2] The fact is that there is something called subversive movements, and history has taught us that the Khazarian Mafia and their marionettes have been using subversive movements to deconstruct the much of the Western infrastructure.[3] Yuri Slezkine himself declares that “The Modern Age is the Jewish Age, and the twentieth century, in particular, is the Jewish Century.” “Modernization,” he adds, “is about everyone becoming Jewish.”[4] The Khazarian Mafia and their marionettes would want us to believe that the “Jewish Age” is good, but we know what happened to people who tried to criticize it. You want to write a book about the Israel Lobby in the United States (John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt)? You are an anti-Semite. You want to criticize Israel’s perpetual wars in the Middle East (Norman Finkelstein)? You are an anti-Semite or self-hating Jew. You want to criticize the situation in Gaza (Sara Roy)? You are an anti-Semite or self-hating Jew. You want to call a spade a spade? You are an anti-Semite or self-hating Jew. You are a Jew and want to say things like Benjamin Netanyahu is a maniac (Norman Finkelstein)? You are a self-hating Jew. No serious reflections. No evidence. And end of discussion. Here is something that will probably make you want to shake your head in disgust. The German newspaper Hamburger Morgenpost has recently published their “The Seven Craziest Leaders in the World.” According to them, the seven craziest leaders are Kim Jung-eun, Vladimir Putin, Rodrigo Duterte, Bashar Assad, Robert Mugabe, Ayatollah Khamenei, and Benjamin Netanyahu.[5] “Frankly, my dear, we invent ‘anti-Semitism.’ It’s been good to us because no one can mess with us anymore.” Guess what? The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs quickly sent a complaint to the newspaper saying that placing Netanyahu on the list is, well, “anti-Semitic”! Putin doesn’t complain; Duterte doesn’t complain; Assad doesn’t complain; Khamenei doesn’t complain; Mugabe doesn’t complain. Yet Netanyahu’s henchmen thought that Netanyahu is unique and is beyond any form of criticism. Let’s put this another way. Suppose Wal-Mart closes at midnight and does not allow anyone into the store until the next morning. Would it be anti-Semitic to say that Wal-Mart does not allow Jews into the store after midnight? According to the implications of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has propounded, it is. The fact that Putin, Assad, Duterte and others are there is not problem. The fact is that the newspaper put Netanyahu on the same list, and that indeed is an unpardonable sin. We see the logical extension of this in other historical areas. For example, we are told that six million Jews died during the Holocaust, and there are dozens of museums built to memorialize those people. But how many Chinese died in the Second World War? Some historians have put the figure in the neighborhood of 10 million.[6]Other historians have estimated it to be between 15 to 20 million.[7] Moreover, there were Christians, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and political dissidents who lost their lives in concentration camps as well. Why then don’t we memorialize all the dead, as opposed to just one particular people? Why don’t we build a museum for the Chinese too? There is a serious logical disconnect here. We see the same logical disconnect elsewhere. For example, flaming Zionist Geert Wilders (he called himself “a Zionist pig”) wanted to ban both Muslim and Jewish ritual slaughter of animals in the Netherlands back in 2012. The Powers That Be instantly called him an anti-Semite.[8] Israel’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi Yona Metzger declared of Wilders’ stand: “This is the classical anti-Semitic way our rites have been targeted and demonized throughout history.” Similarly, Manfred Gerstenfeld, an Israeli author, declared that Wilders was spreading anti-Semitism across Europe.[9] Metzger and Gerstenfeld did not even mention that the ban was also against Muslim rituals. The ritual slaughter of animals by any group would have been prohibited, but because Jews were included in this ban, Metzger and Gerstenfeld saw the proposed law as anti-Semitic. How can we have any meaningful discussion with that kind of attitude? You see, whether the Khazarian Mafia and their puppets like it or not, they are basically saying that the Israeli regime and Benjamin Netanyahu are above the law and rational inquiry. If you were trained in logic, then you would certainly find this wicked ideology repugnant—perhaps even diabolical or Talmudic. The West cannot afford to live by that incoherent weltanschauung. We need a different system that is based on practical reason and the moral order. And Western leaders need to hold the mad man in Tel Aviv responsible for his immoral act.

If the Jews were hoping to make everyone in the World sick and tired of them, they have ALREADY done it. Every time I read an article about them – or by them, I just want to projectile vomit my own asshole. Log in to Reply Amelius  March 24, 2017 at 1:37 pm Human nature is “anti-Semitic”according to them. That being said, is it the rest of the world who needs to adapt to their Talmudic, degenerate ways, or is it they who need to change their degenerate ways to adapt to the rest of the world? They answer is blantantly obvious. Also, the term “anti-Semitic” has no meaning in the context of how it is used today. For instance, Benjamin Netanyahu is not a Semite. He is an Ashkenazi, just like every other leader of Israel who came before him. In anthropological terms, Arabs are considered to be the largest, purely Semitic population on earth. Therefore, who is the real “anti Semite”? Who treats the Semitic Arabs worse than the non Semitic Israelis? Log in to Reply Ariana  March 24, 2017 at 9:17 am I am Anti Semite come and Kiss my Boots !

What happened with education in those yeshivas? Are USA, UK or Turkey the only reasonable and strategic forces of this world? Are they the only ones who are anthropologically worthy of allying with Israelis? Are those countries the only path and role model for greatness? Do they teach geography in yeshivas? Is Israel regarded in yeshivas as a Mediterranean country or as a North Atlantic one? It is very oportunistic for such a small country like Israel to be standing among 200 nations in dark corner with less than a handful of rogue villains calling them their family and offering indebtness.

But let’s face facts: no one likes chicken and metal. Our friends over at The Consumerist report that OK Foods has recalled over 900,000 pounds of breaded chicken for containing metal pieces. Walmart got hit again, according to The Consumerist: 7.5-lb. packages containing “Great Value FULLY COOKED HERB SEASONED BREADED CHICKEN BREAST PATTY WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 201258 and “Best By/Use by” dates 3/2/2018. “The products, which were shipped to retailers and institutions such as schools across the country, bear the establishment number ‘P-7092′ inside the USDA mark of inspection,” said the site. I tried to talk to a few folks at a local Walmart location, but they would neither confirm or deny that any of the Lubbock stores carry this product. It should go without saying that you should not eat this product and return any of it if you have it. Here’s the full list of recalled products: 10-lb. packages containing “Smart Foods4Schools ABC – 123 SHAPED NUGGETS WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 133002 10-lb. packages containing “Smart Foods4Schools BREADED FULLY COOKED CHICKEN PATTIES STAR SHAPED NUGGETS WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 133003 10-lb. packages containing “Smart Foods4Schools BREADED FULLY COOKED CHICKEN PATTIES HEART SHAPED NUGGETS WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 133008 10-lb. packages containing “Smart Foods4Schools BREADED FULLY COOKED CHICKEN PATTIES SHAMROCK SHAPED CHICKEN FINGERS WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 133013 10-lb. packages containing “Smart Foods4Schools BREADED FULLY COOKED CHICKEN PATTIES SHARK SHAPED CHICKEN FINGERS WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 133014 30-lb. packages containing “CHICKENTOPIA FULLY COOKED BREADED TENDER SHAPED CHICKEN BREAST PATTIES With Rib Meat” bearing case code 133015 30-lb. packages containing “Double D Foods FULLY COOKED HERB SEASONED BREADED CHICKEN BREAST PATTY WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 178981 7.5-lb. packages containing “Great Value FULLY COOKED HERB SEASONED BREADED CHICKEN BREAST PATTY WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 201258 and “Best By/Use by” dates 3/2/2018 20-lb. packages containing “TenderBird FULLY COOKED, BREADED CHICKEN BREAST PATTIES WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 235384 21-lb. packages containing “Save A Lot FULLY COOKED, BREADED CHICKEN BREAST NUGGETS” bearing case code 252385 18-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED BREADED CHICKEN FRIES” bearing case code 252386 28-lb packages containing “Save A Lot FULLY COOKED BREADED CHICKEN FRIES” bearing case code 252386 24-lb. packages containing “Lake Liner Logo Brand FULLY COOKED BREADED CHICKEN NUGGETS” bearing case code 256385 and “BEST BY” dates 01/23/18 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED BREADED CHICKEN PATTIES WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 342002 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED BREADED TENDER SHAPED CHICKEN BREAST PATTIES WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 342015 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED Chicken Patties Breaded Chicken Breast Patties with Rib Meat” bearing case code 342384 20-lb. packages containing “TenderBird FULLY COOKED CHICKEN BREAST PATTIES with Rib Meat” bearing case code 342384 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED CHICKEN NUGGETS Breaded Chicken Nuggets with Rib Meat” bearing case code 342385 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED Chicken Fries Breaded Chicken Fries with Rib Meat” bearing case code 342386 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED Spicy Breaded Chicken Breast Filet with Rib Meat” bearing case code 342608 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED Crispy Chicken Breast Fillet Fritters With Rib Meat” bearing case code 342614 20-lb. packages containing “SPRING RIVER FARMS FULLY COOKED HERB SEASONED BREADED CHICKEN BREAST PATTY WITH RIB MEAT” bearing case code 342981 NEXT: Pizza Recall BONUS Lubbock Man Abandons Dog Behind Building       MORE Missing Lubbock Teen Found Safe       Category: Lubbock News Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

But has the Hollywood icon's name been sold out? Tom Cunneff, special to CNBC.com Friday, 24 Mar 2017 | 9:47 AM ET SHARES When the CEO of Newman's Own, Mike McGrath, meets with retailers, he talks about all the great-tasting foods the company that bears Paul Newman's name makes, and there are a lot — the product line has grown from the original oil-and-vinegar salad dressing in 1982 to 324 products today. But lately he's changed his sales pitch to focus a little more on the fact that 100 percent of profits go to charity — the company will surpass more than $500 million in total giving this year. "We put that in front of our retailers every time we meet with them," said McGrath, seated in his office at the Westport, Connecticut, headquarters of Newman's Own. "And they respond favorably, but honestly, a couple of them don't know who Paul Newman was. Some of the younger people are like, 'Was he a singer?'" Just for the record, Paul Newman was an actor, a superstar one at that, who ruled the box office in his heyday in the 1960s and '70s with such iconic hits as "The Hustler," "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "The Sting." But millennials can be forgiven if they don't remember Newman, who passed away in 2008 and whose last onscreen appearance in a feature film was in 2002's "Road to Perdition." Newman would be just fine with the fact that's he's now known more for his philanthropy than his filmography and that his salad dressing has out-grossed his movies. "I think he'd be really happy with the company and the foundation," said Bob Forrester, the president and CEO of the Newman's Own Foundation and the executive chairman of the food company. "He would really like the grant-making that was going on, and he would absolutely love the food." More from iCONIC: The female farmer whose multimillion-dollar success was built on saying no to Wal-Mart 4 ways Silicon Valley may thrive under Trump Business lessons that fueled Reed Hastings' 20-year $60B Netflix run Last year the privately held company, which is celebrating its 35th anniversary, gave away close to $30 million to about 600 organizations after generating more than $600 million in retail brand sales. "Our goal is to make this a billion-dollar brand," McGrath said. "We've had a great bunch of years. The goal is to get that annual giving number up. That's what we work for." To that end, McGrath has redesigned the packaging this year to emphasize the charitable giving — "It's what differentiates us," he says — and is expanding Newman's Own Organics with four new products in existing lines of pasta sauce, salad dressing and salsa, as well as a new line of organic mayonnaise. "That's a big area we're spending a lot of time on to make sure we're coming up with some great-tasting organic products," he said. "We started doing organic products 25 years ago, and when we talk to consumers, they remember that we created all these organic products." A memorable Newman Thanksgiving It was Newman's oldest daughter, Nell, with actress Joanne Woodward, who convinced him that organic food was the fare of the future when she cooked him an all-organic Thanksgiving dinner in 1992. "Pop thought organic was the same thing as health food, which in those days didn't necessarily taste very good," said Nell, a biologist and environmentalist who now runs her own charitable foundation. "So eating a turkey with stuffing, petit pois, a beautiful salad and pumpkin pie and then telling him it's all organic, he learned it's just a growing methodology, not a form of cooking." The first couple of products, Newman's Own Organics Pretzels and Fig Newmans, became the best-selling organic snack food and cookie soon after their introductions a year later. There are now more than 150 organic products, but Nell is no longer involved with the company, which became apparent two years ago when the company replaced the American Gothic-like photo of her and her dad on the labels with just Paul's picture. Source: Newman's Own "My dad would just be honored that people are continuing to trust the products and buy them so we can support wonderful organizations. ... We're at almost half a billion dollars in charitable giving from a lark. It was like a joke in the beginning." -Clea Newman Soderlund, daughter of Paul Newman and member of Newman's Own board "I'm really proud to have been a part of it," Nell says now, noting that the organics division generated $50 million for charity over her 21 years. "I'm just sorry they didn't want to continue to use that iconic, award-winning packaging, because my sister Lissy designed it and made our costumes, and Pop and I had such a great time doing that photo shoot, so it's sad to see that disappear, considering that was about half my life's work." The division, which was based in California where Nell lives, was done under a limited licensing agreement with the expectation that when it expired, the line would be brought back into the fold, which it was in December 2014. Newman's Own was also making its own organic products, and there were license complications that would limit the ability of both companies to grow their product lines. Although the youngest of Newman's five daughters, Clea Newman Soderlund, sits on the board of the foundation, some of Newman's children aren't happy with the lack of a larger Newman presence in the company or at the foundation, as well as skeptically viewing large increases in executive salaries and a new $14 million office building. "I feel like the Newman family has been taken hostage by Bob Forrester," the eldest daughter, Susan Kendall Newman, told Vanity Fair in 2015. Nell has misgivings as well: "I don't think this is what my father would have wanted. He was a man of simple tastes, and he was a loyal to a fault. My dad did tell us we were all going to rotate on and off the board. I haven't been asked to join the board, but it's water under the bridge, unfortunately. I am disappointed. But such is the way of the world in big business. Time to move on." show chapters Billionaire Todd Wagner explains why philanthropy hasn’t been easy    Tuesday, 4 Oct 2016 | 10:00 AM ET | 01:47 Clea remains happy with Forrester's leadership. "My dad would just be honored that people are continuing to trust the products and buy them so we can support wonderful organizations. He came up with a model nobody ever thought of before, and that was so typical of him. We're at almost half a billion dollars in charitable giving from a lark. It was like a joke in the beginning." Forrester's view is that Newman never thought the company or foundation had anything to do with his family. "It was for the public good. He organized his private estate so that ultimately 90 percent of that or more ends up in charity that each daughter will [control]. Susan never came and talked to me about anything. Families are complicated. I can't comment further than that. My job is to protect Paul." Truth be told, Newman wasn't big on planning, which is evident by a sign that used to hang in his office and now hangs in the boardroom: "If we had a plan, we'd be screwed." He had only two guiding principles with regard to the company: Quality trumps profits, and all profits go to charity. Forrester and McGrath are charged with growing the company with the best-tasting products possible so the most money possible can go to charity, like the SeriousFun Children's Network, which was started by Newman and has served more than 730,000 seriously ill children and their families in more than 50 countries since 1988. "Nobody in the food business gives 100 percent profits to charity," said McGrath, who has been in the business since the early '80s. "But the most important thing is what the product tastes like. The reality is, if the product didn't taste good, people wouldn't buy it and we wouldn't be talking about 100 percent profits to charity." — By Tom Cunneff, special to CNBC.com To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

March 2017 | Comments (1) A large All Terrain crane overturned last night in Corpus Christi, Texas, while lifting an Air conditioning unit on to the roof of a Wal-Mart store. According to police reports the crane sank into the asphalt of the car park causing it to tip, with the counterweight coming to rest on the ground, stopping it going over completely. The operator jumped from the cab, sustaining injuries as he did so. The store which was open at the time was evacuated and was to remain closed until the crane is recovered. The overturned crane - damage looks to be minimal Police investigators said they were confused about the incident because the crane tipped in opposite direction of the wind! Clearly the investigators know little about cranes. It looks as though the crane was short rigged and with the retracted boom fully elevated, and swingaway installed the operator slewed over the side and the weight of the large counterweight over the partially extended outriggers caused the jacks to sink and the unit, already very back heavy, went over. It could have been much worse and damage looks minimal. SEE ALL NEWS »     E-MAIL THIS ARTICLE TO A COLLEAGUE » Comments Register today in order to add your own comment, it barely takes a minute.

just-style home News & insights News Top stories this week on just-style... By Beth Wright | 24 March 2017 Font size Email Print Top stories this week on just-style include a look at what the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership might mean for the US and EU textile and apparel industries, updates on the future fashion sourcing landscape from the Prime Source Forum conference in Hong Kong, and Walmart snapping up online fashion and accessory retailer ModCloth. What might TTIP mean for US and EU textiles and apparel? Over the past four years, the United States and the European Union (EU) have been negotiating the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP or T-TIP) free trade agreement, which intends to unlock market access opportunities for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic through the elimination of trade and investment barriers as well as enhanced regulatory coherence. Here Dr Sheng Lu, assistant professor at the Department of Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware, looks at what the pact might mean for the US and EU textile and apparel industries. PSF 2017 – Geo-political uncertainty and how to survive it Global political frictions and economic uncertainty, coupled with a sea-change across the retail sector thanks to the rise of e-commerce, digitally-connected consumers, 'see now, buy now' expectations, fickle millennials, store closures and competition from online specialists, are all creating a perfect storm for apparel sourcing executives to try to navigate. PSF 2017 – Unlocks for the future fashion sourcing landscape Economic uncertainty and upheaval in global trade agreements are immaterial if the apparel and footwear industry can't respond, engineer and produce products that consumers want to buy. Investment in automation and efficiencies, as well as facing up to skills shortages, are among the unlocks for the future fashion sourcing landscape. Walmart snaps up online fashion firm ModCloth US retail giant Walmart is further beefing up its e-commerce strategy with the acquisition of women's online fashion and accessory retailer ModCloth. Kraig Biocraft to begin spider silk production in Vietnam Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, a leading developer of spider silk-based fibres, says it has found locations to begin production in Vietnam, following a site survey trip in Quang Nam province.

(Garett Fisbeck) Quotes and messages of positivity and optimism hang all around the studio as Tammy Conover paints. There’s a large quote by Nelson Mandela, but most of them are Conover’s own words — positive thoughts she hopes manifest in her life in tangible ways. “I am one with God,” one phrase reads. “I am enlightened and awakened. I am one with Tammy.” “I like anything that’s positive,” Conover said in a recent interview with Oklahoma Gazette. “I’m a very positive person. I just love everybody — anybody I meet. I can walk in Wal-Mart and make friends in five seconds.” Conover is an abstract expressionist painter whose brightly colorful works occupy homes, offices and galleries across the country. Her art studio is located at 9106 S. Walker Ave. She also owns Zen Dog Grooming, 8121 S. Western Ave. Painting realistic art, she said, does not excite her. Don’t ask Conover for the world’s most accurate still life or a picture-perfect portrait. She would much rather paint the essence of your soul. Conover offers a popular soul journey painting service — an art process in which she meets and prays with a person and then paints using God and the subject’s spiritual energy as guidance. In addition to her soul painting projects, Conover has works on display at galleries in California and in Aspen, Colorado. She said several local collectors also often buy her pieces. Conover said her work and artistic method is inspired by 20th-century American artist Jackson Pollock, who grew famous for his splattered style. Due to its seeming randomness, Conover said people sometimes assume the style is effortless. “People think, ‘Oh, you’re just throwing paint on a canvas,’” she said. “Well, it’s not as easy as what you think. There’s a technique to it.” Conover owns paintbrushes but rarely uses them. Often, she paints with her hands or paint rollers, even kitchen spatulas. Like Pollock occasionally did, she’ll find a stick from outside and use that. Sometimes she steps up on a ladder and drops paint onto the canvas from eight feet up, using a fan to blow paint and move color across the white plain. The first work Conover ever sold in the Aspen gallery was created while blindfolded. Often during her creative process, she will put on one of her favorite movies, 2000’s Pollock, which stars and was directed by actor Ed Harris, whose parents are from Oklahoma. Conover estimates that she has seen the movie at least 150 times. “I could tell you the movie word for word,” she said. “I mean, I know that movie.” Painting makes Conover happy, and it’s something she has done throughout her life. But two years ago, she started taking it more seriously in an effort to chase her passions and live life more fully. Though her spirit paintings are made to help others and she often donates her work to charities for fundraising purposes, Conover said the truth is that the art is as beneficial to her own happiness as it is to anyone else’s. “I tell people when I paint, it’s like my God time,” she said. “It’s like being in church. When I come down here, I pray and I meditate each time before I start painting. … It’s like the best feeling I can ever feel in my soul when I paint.” Art therapy Conover gets people for her soul paintings the same way she gets any other attention to her art or dog grooming business — fervent word of mouth. The artist said she has probably done 100 spirit paintings just this year. Those getting their spirits painted by Conover come in and briefly speak with the artist. Conover then works to relax the subject, leading them through a series of aura cleanses, meditations and prayers. The subject is asked to do little more than listen carefully. After the prayers, she gets to work depicting the sitter’s spiritual essence. Conover said she rarely knows anything about a subject before a session and they only get to see the completed project. “I just ask God to bring whatever colors vibrate with their soul,” she said. “The people are really just blown away.” The process is intimate and feels like a holistic therapy session. Subjects almost always leave feeling satisfied and grateful. “It’s a very healing experience for people,” Conover said. “Even when people take the painting home, they can feel love and God’s energy. They really feel something from it.” Good karma Conover often uses her art as a tool to help causes she believes in — especially those that help children or animals. Her reputation as an advocate for those in need eventually led her to the source of much of her artistic direction. Norman’s Women’s Resource Center held a fundraising film festival event with actor and longtime supporter Ed Harris in November. Because of Conover’s connection to Pollock’s style and her involvement with charitable efforts in the past, the artist was asked to speak at the event and donate a painting to the cause. That night, Conover got to meet and speak with Harris and presented him with an original painting as a token of thanks for the inspiration he has given her in the past. After countless repeated viewings of Pollock, she was finally face-to-face with the man who — over the course of the film’s production — embodied the famous artist’s essence. “[Harris] told me that he did feel really connected to Jackson Pollock, which is why he wanted to write the story and produce the movie and play the part,” she said. “Really, I felt like I couldn’t have gotten any closer to Jackson Pollock that night by doing it through Ed Harris.” The meeting was a poetic payoff for Conover’s years of dedicated work and kindness, but it is not the praise or cool opportunities that keep the artist going. She is naturally good-natured. “I just love people,” she said. “I really, truly do. I’m all about helping people and helping animals. I’ve always had a positive attitude.” Visit tammyconoverart.com.   Print headline: Soulful canvas, Artist Tammy Conover uses art therapy to bring spiritual healing to herself and others.

South African property developer and investor Atterbury Property is set to open a 18,500 square metre modern mall in Ghana’s city of Kumasi, at a cost of U.S.$95 million. Atterbury said the mall, with potential for a future 10,000 square metre expansion, would give the city of Kumasi its first one-stop environment with shopping and entertainment under one roof when it opens on 20 April. Kumasi City Mall’s anchor tenants are Shoprite and Walmart brand Game Stores, with a retail mix including food, convenience, banking, services, fashion, electronics and a cinema, club and children’s games for entertainment. With access from the Eastern Bypass of the city’s main ring road, Kumasi City Mall is nestled between the dual carriageway Lake Road, Hudson Road, Yaa Asantewa Road, and Kofi Adomako Street. Atterbury is developing Kumasi City Mall for its owners. AttAfrica has been appointed asset manager and would be responsible for its day-to-day running and operations. Cobus van Heerden, retail director at Atterbury Property Development, said this was the first big development the company had undertaken in Kumasi. “We are optimistic about Ghana and Kumasi City Mall, notwithstanding the challenging economic context in West Africa, and competition. There’s a growing positive feeling about Ghana in the market,” van Heerden said in a statement. “With its new president, there is also renewed confidence and positive sentiment about Ghana. Kumasi City Mall is perfectly timed for this upsurge in confidence.” The mall was designed in a joint venture between South African architect practice Boogertman and Partners, and Ghanaian practice MultiCAD. All firms in Kumasi City Mall’s professional team operated with local partners for the delivery of professional services. Atterbury is set to open another two shopping centre developments in sub-Saharan Africa, in Mozambique and Namibia, over the next six months. – African News Agency (ANA) Related Stories Foreign investors now feel more upbeat about SA 24.3.2017 SA businesses optimistic after Ghana leg of trade mission 22.3.2017 BBC confirms Manyi’s resignation as head of policy 21.3.2017 JSE Currencies Commodities today in print menu Contact us About us Code of Conduct Privacy Policy Advertising Rate Card News menu National Africa World Load Shedding Eish!

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 24, 2017 8:44am   Comments Share: Related COST Household Names JPMorgan Initiated Ratings On This Week Perspective Needed: Nervousness Remains, But One Day Doesn't Tell Entire Story New Excel Peter Lynch Chart Template Is Released (GuruFocus) Related AMZN Jim Cramer And Bob Lang's 2013 FANG Call Was A Home Run 4 Of The Most Valuable Modern Tech Patents What's Next For GOP Agenda, Tesla, Oil, Hollywood: Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) The difference between a customer and a consumer could seem arbitrary on the surface. But to Phil Bak, the CEO of America Customer Sentiment (ACSI) Funds, the distinction is vital. "A consumer can have an opinion, but a customer is actually spending their dollars," Bak said. Bak was a guest on Benzinga's PreMarket Prep morning show, where he discussed how tracking customer satisfaction plays a key role in anticipating the positive performance of bullish retail stocks — and how the American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (BATS: ACSI) is able to capitalize on that data for companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) and, of course, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Amazon Is A Beast Any discussion of retail success is bound to include Amazon. Bak recognized this; his ACSI Fund is overweight on the company. He said there's a strong correlation between Amazon's success and the way customers feel about the online retailer, which could be a fundamental driver behind the stock's continued upside. "Amazon is a beast. Amazon is the No. 1 customer satisfaction company and everyone knows,” Bak explained. “You’re not making some big, huge leap to say you’re bullish on Amazon. But right now, Amazon did — I believe — 31 percent of the entire online retail market in the holiday season, and it’s just grown." While Amazon's dominance is no shocker, Bak suggested the experience of shopping online with Amazon is, for better and worse, fundamentally different than the customer experience with other retailers or service sectors. Bak explained how stocks surveyed by ACSI Fund are weighted with those factors in mind and how experience could be a main differentiator for companies going toe-to-toe with Amazon. "Your expectations as a consumer If you’re going in to buy a Maserati versus going to CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS) to buy a box of tissues are very different. When we measure customer satisfaction, we do it relative to expectations," Bak said. "Certainly, the sectors that are more service-focused and that are more relationship-focused are going to be less immune in the short run to some of the automation and some of the conveniences of, say, shopping on Prime." Costco And Walmart: Sentiment Makes The Difference Beyond the behemoth that is Amazon, Bak also pointed to big box and brick-and-mortar companies as prime examples of how customer sentiment can translate to market sentiment and stock performance, both positive and negative. He offered Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc(NYSE: WMT) as perfect illustrations of this. "Costco has very strong customer satisfaction," Bak said, despite taking a recent pricing hit that he ascribes to a $5 increase in membership fees. The ACSI Fund doesn't view the $5 increase as being material to Costco members, but does view at as material to the company's revenue, Bak said. "They have a very loyal following and people love doing business there, much more so than you see at some of their competitors. And that $5 is going to have a very significant impact to their revenue." At Wal-Mart, customer satisfaction cuts a different way, Bak said. "They are not happy shopping there. In many cases that was their only option, but now that people are moving to online, they can go to Amazon, Costco is very strong for the discount shoppers and we’re seeing an emergence of Dollar Tree and Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG)." Customer satisfaction at the discount retailers is "very strong and very steadily increasing," he said. Less Surprising Earnings Surprises The ACSI Fund tracks more than 100,000 customers for their data on 160 large-cap companies for its ACSI ETF, which is up 12 percent since its November 2016 opening. One of the essential theses behind the ACSI Fund is that earnings and revenue are not unpredictable, but rather fundamentally driven by customers. The analysis of this data provides the ACSI Fund with a completely unique alpha compared to those that drive other funds, Bak said. "When all of a sudden you get a big earnings surprise and somebody missed or beat earnings and you wonder what happened — well, what [are] the earnings? It's the customers who are making the transactions. Did those customers tell you ahead of time that they were happy or unhappy with their services? In our case they did. They tell us and we use that data." As a result of this unique, customer-focused market forecast, Bak feels fairly certain about the continued longevity of the bull market. He signaled to the 10-year high statistics from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey, whose March sentiment number was released shortly after the interview and came in 1.3 percent higher than the previous month. From Bak's perspective, valuations are likely to continue to rise. "Even though P/Es are high and the market is expensive in some people’s eyes, we think spending is going to continue."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Ivan Teleguz, 38, was sentenced to death in 2006 for the capital murder-for-hire slaying of his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie Yvonne Sipe, the mother of their 23-month-old son. (Virginia Dept. of Corrections) By Rachel Weiner By Rachel Weiner March 24 Follow @rachelweinerwp Virginia is set to carry out a death sentence for the first time under a new protocol that shields more of the execution from public view. Ivan Teleguz, who was convicted in the murder of his former girlfriend, is scheduled to die April 25. Prosecutors contend that Teleguz paid to have Stephanie Sipe, the mother of his young son, killed in 2001. They said he showed the assailants Sipe’s Harrisonburg apartment, took them to Walmart to buy a fillet knife to use as the murder weapon and drove to Pennsylvania so he would have an alibi. Teleguz has maintained his innocence, and two of the key witnesses against him have recanted. There is evidence to bolster the recantations, his attorneys say, that has never been heard in court. Last October, the Supreme Court declined to take his case after Teleguz argued his trial attorneys were inadequate. Teleguz is appealing again on the grounds that his claims of inadequate counsel have never gotten a full hearing. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit has declined to delay Teleguz’s execution for that appeal. Attorneys for Teleguz would like Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) to issue a pardon or a commutation. “Multiple witnesses have come forward that both his conviction and his death sentence are based on statements that they now admit to be lies,” attorney Elizabeth Peiffer said. “Justice would not be served by his execution.” A British group that assists Europeans facing the death penalty in America has also worked extensively on behalf of Teleguz, who is originally from Ukraine. If the execution goes forward, witnesses — who could include lawyers, family members of the victim and journalists — will not be able to see Teleguz until he is restrained and IV lines have been set. The change comes after the January execution of Ricky Gray, when administering the drugs took an unusually long 33 minutes. [Ricky Gray’s execution took more than 30 minutes. His attorneys want to know why.] The ACLU of Virginia has pushed back against the policy change, expressing concern about transparency and asking McAuliffe to halt Teleguz’s execution. “Such secrecy makes it nearly impossible for the observers or the public to judge whether an execution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment because of the specific method of execution employed or the suffering it causes,” Claire Guthrie Gastañaga, the state ACLU’s executive director, wrote in a letter to the governor. McAuliffe’s office did not respond to a request for comment. But in recent court papers, Virginia’s senior assistant attorney general, Alice T. Armstrong, wrote that Teleguz “has not identified any grave, unforeseen contingencies; only a desire to avoid the trial court’s lawful judgment.” “More than a decade has passed since Teleguz’s jury pronounced its moral judgment,” she wrote. “The bereaved Sipe family is entitled to ‘real finality.’ ” Sipe was found dead in her apartment July 23, 2001, her throat slashed. Her 2-year-old son was sitting in a bathtub in the next room, unharmed. It took three years for investigators to charge Teleguz, who was convicted of hiring two men, Edward Gilkes and Michael Hetrick, to kill the mother of his child. Aleksey Safanov, an associate, testified that Teleguz was tired of paying child support. Hetrick cut his own hand while struggling with Sipe. As he was leaving, he saw Sipe’s young son in the bathtub. He turned off the water and left. Safanov also testified that after the slaying, Teleguz complained that the killer had left his own blood at the scene. Safanov said that Teleguz offered him money to “eliminate” the first hired killer. But after the 2006 conviction, Gilkes and Safanov recanted, writing that they had falsely implicated Teleguz under pressure from prosecutors. Safanov said he was promised a visa to stay in the country. “I don’t have any reason to lie about all of this anymore,” Gilkes wrote in a deposition. “I feel bad about what I did to Teleguz.” But Gilkes refused to testify again after appointed counsel warned him that he was at risk of being tried for perjury or losing his plea agreement. Safanov, who was living in Kazakhstan, never appeared in court during the appeal. Hetrick maintained that he had been paid $2,000 by Teleguz to murder Sipe. Attorneys for Teleguz argued that Hetrick, who had his own criminal background and history of threatening to stab women, was fed information by interrogators. Teleguz’s attorneys also argued that the trial was flawed because their client was implicated in a supposed Ephrata, Pa., killing that never occurred. Gilkes testified that he was with Teleguz in Ephrata one day when two men, apparently Russian, came up and said that if they weren’t paid, another man would soon be killed. He said a man was killed in the town a few days later, and prosecutors referred to that case in arguing for the death penalty. But no such murder actually happened. An appeals court deemed the recantations “unreliable” and upheld Teleguz’s conviction. “While Gilkes retracted his trial testimony implicating Teleguz, he failed to provide any explanation why he and Hetrick traveled to Harrisonburg to murder Sipe, who drove them there or how they ultimately located Sipe,” U.S. District Judge James P. Jones wrote. Teleguz’s attorneys say that Sipe could have been killed because of drug dealing in her family and that both Gilkes and Hetrick were involved in drugs. Teleguz is one of six men on death row in Virginia, all of whom committed their crimes over a decade ago. Like other states, Virginia has struggled with a shortage of drugs for executions. Gray was killed with a previously unused cocktail of drugs that included midazolam, a sedative experts say is not strong enough to eliminate the pain of the other two drugs used. local public-safety Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO – The U.S. furniture industry, particularly the upholstered furniture segment that’s anchored in Northeast Mississippi, is only now getting started in its recovery from the Great Recession. So said Jerry Epperson, a veteran industry observer and analyst with more than 30 years of experience. “While the overall economic recovery is seven years old, the furniture industry is only in its third year of recovery,” said Epperson, the keynote speaker at the State of Economic Development meeting at the BancorpSouth Conference Center. Epperson said the growth of imports has changed the industry at every level. “Logistics are a huge issue today,” he said. “If you’re a Wal-Mart or major furniture store, you’ve got the ability to buy in huge quantities, but more importantly, you can bring the product in directly, even through your own ships, and that can be a 10-percent, 12-percent or higher cost advantage versus other retailers. They’ve exploited that. “It’s also changed the distribution model. And at the same time, we’ve seen this adaptation of where products come from.” Imports now make up about 60 percent of furniture in the U.S. Epperson said more than 90 percent of metal furniture is imported, while about 85 percent of wood furniture is exported. Upholstered furniture has been able to fend off the wave of imports, which make up about 45 percent of the segment. In mattresses, only about 7 percent is imported. “So you have other sectors that have changed and adapted,” Epperson said. “Domestic upholstery is growing at the same rate as imports are, and I doubt that will change much. In wood, it’s going to be tough, but in upholstery, you can bring a lot of production back to the U.S.” Epperson said more than half of the 20 major manufacturers who polled recently either were expanding or building new facilities. The upholstered furniture industry also has made great strides in improving itself, with better fabrics and the addition of power and other special features to motion furniture that appeals to more consumers. “Some of these features are pretty frivolous, but people love them and it sells,” he said. Epperson doesn’t necessarily see a huge wave of manufacturing returning to the U.S. because there still are economic advantages of doing business in Asia. “The competitive advantage in Asia right now is that’s where all the mills are,” he said. “In 2002-2004, they installed as many looms as there were in the U.S.” In the late 1990s, the leather industry in China, which had its business concentrated in shoes, purses, wallets and apparel, began to expand into the furniture industry. “Now they’re the dominant player in leather upholstery. We can do leather here, and we can buy pre-sewn kits to put on the frames here, but overall leather’s going to be tough to bring back.” Epperson said with the technology available and the increased use of automation in manufacturing today, the domestic upholstered furniture is in good shape. “I just don’t see it losing more market share,” he said.

The state’s largest regulated utility wants to add a monthly minimum charge for homeowners who have solar panels, wind turbines and storage batteries. That covers about 10,000 customers in the Oncor service area, which includes North Texas. Oncor did not propose a separate fee for big companies with rooftop solar systems, such as Wal-Mart, Ikea and Costco. They’re already paying their fair share, Oncor said. The new minimum, projected to be about $40 a month, must be approved by the state Public Utility Commission, and that won’t be easy. Last year, El Paso Electric proposed a similar fee that didn’t get through. Nationwide, regulators have rejected comparable requests from many utilities. In Texas, a typical home solar system costs about $13,000 after federal tax credits. It usually takes about 10 years to recoup the investment through energy savings, and the new Oncor fee would extend that timetable. It doesn't affect potential savings on energy generation, which is the competitive side of the Texas electric market. But regulated rates for transmission, distribution, smart meters and the like can account for almost half the monthly electric bill in Texas.   The fee would discourage investment, solar advocates said, and enable Oncor to establish a separate channel for future revenue. Residential solar accounts for a tiny fraction of power generation in the state. But the number of home installations in Texas almost doubled last year, and the industry is growing rapidly nationwide. “Residential solar is getting much more affordable and popular, and utilities see that,” said Kaiba White, who specializes in energy policy for Public Citizen in Austin. “They’re trying to stomp it out before it becomes an existential threat.” At the moment, it’s a tiny target, less than one-third of 1 percent of Oncor’s 3.4 million metered customers. The total is expected to grow by 400 to 500 households a month, Oncor said. While the vast majority choose rooftop solar, the minimum fee also applies to wind turbines and storage batteries -- a class of power generation known as distributed energy. According to Oncor, those customers cost the utility about $1.6 million last year. Transmission charges are based on the volume of electricity delivered, and their consumption typically declines by 30 percent after adding rooftop solar. But Oncor still has to provide access to the power grid, especially during the hottest and coldest months. The company said home solar doesn’t reduce peak demand. “This isn’t about raising revenue. This is about who pays for the grid,” said Don Clevenger, Oncor’s vice president of strategic planning. “This is a more equitable way to spread the costs to everyone.” Fifteen investor-owned utilities sought tariffs for on-site generation in the last two years, according to the NC Clean Energy Technology Center. Like Oncor, they argued against "cross-subsidies " -- others subsidizing access to the grid. But costs are shifted regularly in electricity. Those with newer homes and appliances pay less, for example. “We might all pay the same rate for electricity whether we’re living on a ranch or in an apartment,” said Sean Gallagher, who oversees state legislative policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association. “But you don’t single out customers by putting them in a separate rate class. That’s a bad idea, and it’s a setup for further mischief.” Oncor seeks electricity rate increase for Texas that would start in late 2017 Rather than drive up utility costs, he said, residential solar can reduce the impact in other parts of the system, from maintenance to emissions. By Oncor’s estimate, the costs of residential solar amounted to less than 50 cents per customer last year. In 2016, Oncor revenue topped $3.9 billion with $431 million in net income. The company is considered a crown jewel, in part because it earns high regulated returns in a growing state. The new minimum charge was part of a larger rate increase that Oncor requested last week. Oncor is in a transition. After its parent company filed for bankruptcy, it was put up for auction. NextEra Energy of Juno Beach, Fla., agreed to pay $18.7 billion, including debt. The PUC in Austin is determining whether that deal is in the public interest. NextEra, the nation’s largest utility, is a leader in wind power but has been aggressive on rooftop solar. It was the largest campaign contributor to a Florida ballot initiative that could have stifled growth in the segment. Is Florida's NextEra worthy to buy Texas utility Oncor? Critics call it 'arrogant' and 'dishonest' The November amendment was sold as a way to protect consumers from subsidizing the costs of residential solar. But Elon Musk, best known for Tesla and SolarCity, called the measure a “calculated attempt to deceive” Florida voters. It was defeated despite $20 million from utilities, including $8 million from NextEra’s Florida Power & Light unit. Last year, NextEra also was rejected in its bid for Hawaiian Electric Co. One reason was that regulators doubted the company’s commitment to the state’s clean energy goals. Oncor talked with NextEra about its plan to add the minimum fee, Clevenger said, but the decision was its own. “This has nothing to do with NextEra,” Clevenger said. The solar industry might not oppose a small flat charge, comparable to the universal fee added to phone lines, said John Berger, CEO of Sunnova Energy Corp. in Houston. But Oncor's proposal calls for a formula based on the customer’s peak demand, and that could be a meaningful number. “They want to get paid for a service we’re not using,” Berger said. “They’re doing less for us so why should we pay more?” View Comments Tags Business Commentary Dallas Oncor Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

clock menu more-arrow Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Circuit Breaker Moto G5 Plus review: a new value champion Cheap phones can't afford to suck anymore by Chris Welch Mar 24, 2017, 7:00am EDT share tweet Linkedin The lesson of Lenovo’s new Moto G5 Plus is simple: cheap smartphones have no business feeling cheap anymore. The "below this price, you get a lackluster device" line that once existed has officially evaporated when you can buy a phone for as little as $229 with a metal build, phenomenal display, great performance, and satisfactory battery life. And best of all, it’s a phone that you can take to any major carrier, and it’ll just work. Very few other bargain phones can offer the same convenience. The Moto G series has always been a good value, combining great Android software with decent-enough hardware. But this is the first iteration of the series to feel truly premium. If other companies like OnePlus, ZTE, and Huawei weren’t battling out this war to produce impressive, inexpensive phones, I’m not convinced Lenovo would’ve felt compelled to make the G5 what it is. It’s nowhere near perfect, with curious hardware omissions and a camera that doesn’t live up to its spec sheet. But I can’t think of an easier recommendation for someone who wants to spend between $200 and $300 on a phone that just works. And that’s a pretty nice position for Lenovo to be in. In the US, the G5 Plus comes in two configurations (the standard G5 is not being sold here): one is the $299 model I tested with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. The other cuts both of those numbers in half and sells for a cheaper $229. You’ll be able to get them from Moto’s website, Walmart, Best Buy, Target, Costco, and other retailers. But here’s the real hook: if you’re an Amazon Prime user, you get a steep discount on either version — as long as you’re willing to put up with lockscreen ads. The better 64GB / 4GB model drops to $239.99, and the lesser 32GB / 2GB G5 Plus falls all the way to $184.99. That’s cheap. A smartphone that feels above its cost Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge When I say that the Moto G5 Plus is a "metal" phone, that’s only partially true. The backplate taking up much of the phone’s rear is aluminum, but the G5’s core frame is actually plastic. It’s plenty sturdy, with tactile buttons, a creak-free frame, and an internal nanocoating that can save the phone from accidental spills. My issues with the design are twofold: for one, Lenovo made some aesthetic choices that make the phone look a little cheap, like the Moto logo plastered on the front and the shiny chrome edges that surround the display. Two, it’s just a little bland. Your opinion may differ, and my unfavorable take might rest partly with the gold color I reviewed. And while the G5 Plus is comfortable to hold thanks to its 5.2-inch 1080p screen — not a size considered "Plus" by today’s standards — it can feel a little slippery thanks to that metal backplate. It’s not what I’d call compact though, since the large top and bottom bezels negate the reasonably-sized display. On the left side is the volume toggle and a textured power button, and up top is the SIM tray, which also holds microSD cards to supplement the 32GB or 64GB of built-in storage. The display is definitely one of the best things about the G5 Plus. It’s a 1080p IPS LCD panel with flawless viewing angles. No matter how or from where you look at the screen, it’s excellent. Just be aware that colors are somewhat muted compared to the vivid OLED displays on the Moto Z line — even in the "vibrant" display mode. Below the screen is a wide, oblong fingerprint reader. You can use it in one of two ways: by default, it’s just like Moto’s other fingerprint scanners that will unlock your phone or lock it again when you hold your finger down a bit longer. But there’s also a neat trick that turns off Android’s on-screen buttons (back, home, and recents) and lets you replicate them with swiping gestures. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge You swipe left to trigger Android’s back function, or swipe right to enter multitasking view. You can even swipe right twice quickly to do Android Nougat’s quick-switching action between apps. In this configuration, the fingerprint reader acts as a home button and can trigger Google Assistant. This do-everything fingerprint reader approach gives you just that extra little bit of space on the screen for emails, Facebook, and other content. The swiping gestures worked as expected most of the time, but as a longtime user of Android’s on-screen buttons, I could never fully adjust to this style of using the phone day to day. I’m probably just too hard-wired to the virtual buttons; people new to Android might prefer it. Great software, but updates aren't guaranteed Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge But the biggest feature that Lenovo is emphasizing with the G5 Plus is the camera inside. It’s a 12-megapixel f/1.7 sensor with larger individual pixels to pull in more light. On paper, that sounds fairly similar to the camera setup in Samsung’s Galaxy S7. I wish I could say you were getting that phenomenal camera for half the price, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. In daylight, the G5 Plus captures impressive dynamic range (particularly in HDR mode) and keeps pace with cameras far above its price range. Come nighttime, the phone’s lack of optical stabilization can have a noticeable, bad impact on your shots. Everything tends to look soft. Phone cameras don’t need OIS to take fantastic low-light images (see: Google Pixel), but Moto’s camera app and algorithms don’t have the smarts to get the image you want on the first try. There’s a pro mode that lets you adjust white balance, shutter speed, and ISO, but most people buying this phone are likely to tap and shoot. Compared to other phones in this price range, the G5’s camera is ahead. It’s just nowhere close to today’s flagships, which is probably an unrealistic expectation to have. Just about everywhere else, the Moto G5 Plus excels at smartphone stuff. It’s got Snapdragon’s 625 processor inside, and as we saw previously on the Moto Z Play, 95 percent of the time it runs just as smooth and reliably as any $800 phone. And it’ll outlast several of them between charges. The G5 Plus has a 3,000mAh battery, which has been enough to make the phone last for between 4 and 6 hours of screen-on time in my experience, and fast charging that can refuel the battery quickly. Two caveats: I’ve had the phone for under a week, and have noticed an outlier or two where the battery drained faster than expected. It’s not the all-time battery champion that the Z Play is, but it’ll comfortably get you through a day of heavy use. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Hopefully you’ve still got some Micro USB cables around, because neither version of the G5 has USB Type C for charging. But a Micro USB port isn’t the most glaring example of cost-cutting with this phone. That would be the total lack of NFC, which gives you a phone that can’t do tap-to-pay with Android Pay or anything else you’d use NFC for. That’s inexplicably only true of the US version; international models will have NFC support. Lenovo’s backwards justification for this is that US consumers have been slow to embrace mobile payments. You know what might help with that? Putting the technology in every phone regardless of price. For many people, this phone can do everything they need For software, out of the box you’re getting Android 7.0 Nougat and Google Assistant. My review unit currently remains on a January security patch, which isn’t the most encouraging thing to see. Motorola’s got a rather patchy history with timely software releases — both on the software and security end of things. Nougat-specific features, such as splitscreen multitasking, worked very well on the 64GB / 4GB model I tested, though I can’t speak to whether it struggles on the cheaper $229 G5 Plus with 2GB of RAM. If you can afford it, I’d absolutely go for the better hardware. That’ll more comfortably last you another year or two. With the G5 Plus you’re getting most of Moto’s excellent software customizations like Moto Display lockscreen notifications and Moto Actions, letting you twist the phone to launch the camera or chop the phone twice to turn on the flashlight, among other gestures. The only one missing is Moto Voice. But that’s not much of an issue since you can still set up "OK Google" to control the phone with your voice and get answers from Assistant. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The Moto G5 Plus is simply an outstanding phone for the money. It’s cheap, comes without monthly installments or commitments, and you can take it anywhere. Sure, spending $100 or $200 more will get you a better overall package in the OnePlus 3T, or the hard-to-believe battery longevity of the Moto Z Play. But not everyone can do that. And though the Moto G5 Plus is by no means the best smartphone available today, it’s hard to find a better one at this price — especially if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber.

It had already reclaimed its superpower lead before Donald Trump swept into office vowing to make America great again. With hindsight we can see ever more clearly that the Lehman crisis was a false alarm. Loss of dominance has long been a staple of US discourse. John Kennedy decried the ballistic "missile gap" with the Soviet Union before the 1960 election, when Russia had just four missiles and the US had thousands with explosive power equal to 1.3 million Hiroshima-sized bombs. Ever since I began covering the US as a journalist in the early Reagan years, there have been bouts of soul-searching.  Paul Kennedy's theory of imperial over-stretch in Rise and Fall of the Great Powers was all the rage in the late 1980s, when the Washington clerisy thought Japan destined for economic leadership. Edward Luttwack upped the ante in 1994 with Endangered American Dream, warning that the US was turning into a third world nation. This was just as the US was about establish its undisputed hegemony over the digital age. US decline was a myth then, and remains a myth today. Putative rivals have all run into trouble or face structural limits that will be obvious within a decade. India's time has not yet come. And: A decade ago the US was preparing to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a large scale. The terminals have since switched into export hUBS. American shale gas is being shipped to Europe. The effect is to force down the market price of gas in EU, depriving Russia's Gazprom of its lockhold on prices. Lithuania's "Independence" terminal can now import LNG, eliminating dependence on the Kremlin. Poland is following suit. That strategic implications are profound. As Goldman Sachs said this week, US shale oil can go from zero to peak output within six to nine months. It can do so on a big enough scale to hold down global crude prices, and for long enough to bleed OPEC and the Kremlin almost white. The Permian Basin in West Texas alone could match Saudi Arabia's Ghawar field within five years, topping 5m barrels a day. Fracking technology has cut break-even costs so fast that old "super-basins" are poised for stunning revivals. It is no longer a question of whether the US will become a net oil exporter, but how soon. While the US "manufacturing renaissance" has been patchy, cheap gas has restored the fortunes of the plastics, chemical, and glass industries. The American Chemistry Council is tracking $130bn of new investment along the Gulf Coast, expected to create 460,000 jobs by 2022. The US unemployment rate is 4.7pc, near a  half-century low This is the recovery that Donald Trump managed to turn into a landscape of “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones” in his dystopian inaugural address. It is of course standard fare for opposition candidates to decry the decline of America during campaigns. What is different about President Trump is that he continues to push this line after taking office, presumably because he believes his own wild claims. We all have to reach our own conclusions about Donald Trump. My view is that he matters less than we now think. His presidency may prove no more than a four-year embarrassment, leaving few traces. His plans to slash science and technology funding by 20pc would indeed risk the sort of decline he rails against. But his budget is dead on arrival in Congress. His contempt for allies and the multilateral bodies that vastly lever America's strategic power is folly but the US Senate is likely to take charge and run foreign policy on traditional lines. Grown-ups at the helm of the State, Defence, and Treasury departments will navigate the reefs. America's institutions and courts will contain Mr Trump.     David Fuller's view Donald Trump won the US Presidential election for two very different reasons. 1) He recognised that vast stretches of America between the East and West Coasts contained plenty of angry voters, who Hillary Clinton once described unwisely as “the deplorables”. Job losses due to accelerating technological innovation were a big problem, especially for less skilled workers.  For instance, people were working at Walmart for $9 an hour, while a little over a generation earlier their ancestors earned $30 an hour in steel mills.  That was before globalisation and competition from developing Asian economies led to many of the US’s rust belts.   2) Most of the financial community and a considerable number of Republican business people were fed up with onerous financial regulations, high taxation and limited economic growth. The Lehman crisis was no “false alarm”, as stated above, because it could have triggered a depression without a massive monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve and also central banks in other countries.  Unfortunately, Barack Obama was far more interested in regulation than economic stimulus.     Europe Has Forgotten What It Means for a Nation to Govern Itself. Article 50 Will Remind Them Here is this short comment by Janet Daley for The Telegraph: So it begins. This is either going to be the most tedious two years of argy-bargy, mind-numbing detail, procrastination, futile grandstanding, and empty threats ending with something that looks remarkably like the present arrangements... or it isn’t. What could and should happen is that the UK creates not just a stunning precedent in the modern European era of a country leaving what was supposed to be an everlasting relationship, but an entirely new model of the nation state fit for the 21st century. Europe has almost forgotten – sometimes with good historical reasons – what pride in nationality might mean, and how democratically responsive governments in touch with their populations might have something valuable to offer the world. Ironically, the idea of the self-governing state directly answerable to its own people was lost in the terrible shame of the twentieth century’s nationalist crimes. But the EU now finds itself harbouring a return to just the kind of populist nativism which it was designed to prevent. Will this generation of British politicians have the vision and the strength of character to re-invent nationhood? Who knows? Until this moment, I suspect that at least some of the EU establishment doubted that Theresa May would go through with it. Presumably this is why Donald Tusk has to be given forty-eight hours to make a formal response to the announcement of the actual date: he and his colleagues must be allowed to come to terms with the reality that some political leaders mean what they say. Yes, this is really happening. March 29th will be the first day of the rest of our lives.   David Fuller's view I’ve said it many times – don’t play the expensive and frustrating EU delaying game.  Leave the EU politely but quickly and without an agreement, if necessary, which can come later. The alternative, described by Janet Daley in her opening sentences above, would be like spending two years on a tiny desert island with Jean-Claude Junker.     Energy Stat: Are Electric and Autonomous Vehicles Heading Down the Road to Peak Oil Demand? Thanks to a subscriber for this fascinating report by Pavel Mulchanov for Raymond James which may be of interest. Here is a section: There is no law of nature that dictates that global oil demand must eventually reach a peak and then begin an irreversible decline. The well-known “law” of Hubbert’s Peak applies to supply, not demand, and the advent of modern technology (fracking, horizontal drilling, enhanced recovery, etc.) has led to a fundamental rethink of whether oil supply will peak after all. In this context, we see comments such as the one from Shell, suggesting that peak demand will come first, rendering peak supply a moot point. There is no direct historical precedent for worldwide demand for a major energy commodity to peak on a sustained basis. (Sorry, whale oil doesn’t count.) Despite all of the regulatory and other headwinds, for example, global consumption of coal is still growing. But it is true that there is precedent for national and even regional demand to peak. Coal demand in Europe peaked in the 1960s, and has since fallen to substantially lower levels. Oil demand in Japan peaked in the 1990s. Oil demand in Europe peaked more recently, in 2006, one year after the U.S. By definition, a peak is something that can only be known in retrospect, but with a decade having passed, it seems abundantly clear that European oil demand will never get back to its pre-2006 levels. With regard to the U.S., the situation is less clear-cut because of the demand recovery in recent years, but 2005 may well be the all-time peak. The theory of peak global oil demand holds that when enough parts of the world reach a peak, a global peak will result, because the few places still growing will not be enough to offset the decliners. In this sense, the theory is conceptually valid. Thus, we would not argue with the notion that peak oil demand is a matter of time. The real question is: how much time?   Eoin Treacy's view A link to the full report is posted in the Subscriber's Area. I had not previously seen the statistics about peak demand for Europe and Japan so I found this report enlightening and commend it to subscribers. Peak demand is an important theme and explains why Saudi Arabia guards its Asian markets so jealously; offering discounts again as recently as two weeks ago. Asia and Africa represent the two big growth markets for international oil products just as they represent the major growth areas for coal consumption.   Dow's Merck Swipes Immuno-Oncology Share From Heavyweight Rivals This article from investors.com may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Four immuno-oncology drugs from Merck, Bristol-Myers and Roche brought in $464 million in February, declining 4% from $483 million in January, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said, citing data from tracker Symphony Health. But February was a shorter month, which could be partly responsible for the decrease, Fernandez said in a research report. Despite the slowdown, Merck's Keytruda sales grew 2% in February vs. the prior month. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers' drugs Opdivo and Yervoy held on to a collective 69% market share, falling 1% vs. January. Merck's Keytruda now has 24% of the market, up from 23% the prior month. Roche's Tecentriq was flat at 7% share. Immuno-oncology drugs fight cancer by teaching the body's immune system to identify cancer cells hiding behind specific proteins. Those proteins are called checkpoints.   Eoin Treacy's view CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is quickly revolutionising the genetics sector by reducing the cost and increasing the speed of innovation. That is particularly good news for cancer treatments because there are so many different mutations and each needs a tailored approach. In fact the end point of research and another area receiving a great deal of interest is the synthetic biology sector where custom viruses can be written to attack a patient’s personal cancer.   Not So Fast on India Stock Rally as UBS Sees Profit Bar Too High This article by Nupur Acharya and Ameya Karve for Bloomberg reiterates an argument more than a few institutional investors have made about India. Here is a section: “The markets are trading at all-time-high multiples and are pricing in a lot, or expecting reforms to continue and growth to come back fairly quickly,”  Chhaochharia said. “The risk-reward is definitely not attractive.” Skeptics like Chhaochharia are becoming harder to find as foreign and local investors pile into equities and analysts predict further gains. The S&P BSE Sensex will climb to 32,000 by year-end, up 10 percent from current levels, according to a survey of traders and investors by Bloomberg News on March 14, three days after Modi won the state polls. Citibank, which previously forecast the Sensex to reach 30,000 by September, now sees the gauge at 31,500 in December. Overseas investors have plowed a net $3 billion into Indian equities in March, the biggest monthly inflow in a year, while mutual funds have been buyers for seven months through February. The liquidity-aided euphoria saw a department store chain double in its trading debut on Tuesday, and an exchange-traded fund of state companies on Friday got bids for about four times the target.     Eoin Treacy's view 10-year local currency Indian government bonds yield 6.82%. That’s well below the 9% which was on offer in 2014 but the question of the currency is much less pressing today than it was then. More than any other factors, the combined trends of the currency and the bond market offer a window into how large foreign investors view the prospects for India.     Fuller Treacy Money Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version The information provided on this website (www.FTMoney.com) is for the purposes of information only.  This website and its content is not and should not be considered or deemed to be an offer of or invitation to engage in any investment activity.  Nothing FT Money does and nothing on this website is intended to operate or be construed as the giving of advice or the making of a recommendation by FT Money to any investor or prospective investor.

We hear about conflict palm oil and conflict minerals often, but what about conflict cotton? The world’s most popular textile fiber has been linked to slavery in Uzbekistan and thousands of farmers committing suicide in India. Indeed, programs such as the Better Cotton Initiative and Cotton Connect are doing remarkable work to alleviate cotton’s impact on human rights and the environment. And to their credit, more apparel companies — from Adidas to C&A — are incorporating more sustainable sources of cotton into their clothing lines. One company, however, wants to go even further in guaranteeing that its cotton comes from a reliable and responsible source. PimaCott, owned by a large Indian supplier, says it has a solution. The company partnered with Applied DNA Sciences, an American biotechnology firm, to treat its cotton so that it can be easily scanned and identified. Molecules with DNA tags are added to cotton during the ginning process, so someone on a company’s supply chain team is able to track the authenticity of the cotton from the field to the store. Applied DNA Sciences says its technology also allows for “fiber typing.” This allows supply chain stakeholders to authenticate a bolt of textiles or a garment as a genuine varietal of cotton – which, in PimaCott’s case, is pima: the high-end cotton grown in California’s San Joaquin Valley. (Hence the company’s name.) From a business perspective, this is critical for the Central Valley’s pima cotton farmers, who are subjected to far stricter environmental and labor standards in the Golden State than other countries, or even other U.S. states. The problem is that consumers who seek textiles made from coveted Californian or Egyptian cotton can be misled by wayward suppliers. Last fall, Walmart and Target were nailed by lawsuits alleging the retailers mislead consumers about a line of “100 percent” Egyptian cotton sheets, made in India. Walmart in turn offered customer refunds, but the episode raised questions about the authenticity of high-quality products in other stores. And of course, conscious consumers were left wondering if that ethical set of sheets or shirt had fibers that traveled from cotton suppliers with dubious labor or environmental practices. Other controversies, such as the tensions between Monsanto and India that eventually prodded the biotech firm to pull its latest GMO cotton seeds out of the Indian market last summer, raised further questions about the veracity of any company’s claims about their products. This technology shows promise, and could eventually help other organizations that are trying to scale fair trade or responsibly-sourced cotton. But it will take a while for DNA tagging to score widespread acceptance. As Fast Company reported, these tagged molecules need to be added to cotton at its point of origin. From the point of view of farmers, many of whom face thin margins and other risks such as bad weather or global slumps in commodity prices, DNA tagging could come across as yet another expense. But PimaCott says it is helping cotton growers with the upfront costs. And if farmers see the value in having their crops verified and prevented from becoming blended with lower-grade cotton, we could see an industry transformed — and down the road, witness improved traceability in other agricultural supply chains as well.

Staff Photo by Matt West Credit: Matt West NOT ON BOARD: Stop & Shop customer Liseth Tabares, above, bristled at the company’s decision to eliminate baggers at some Stop & Shop checkouts, saying she’d rather see jobs saved . Staff Photo by Matt West prev next         comments Stop & Shop’s move to ax baggers from some checkout lanes has advocates and shoppers worried the grocery giant could be chasing dollars and cents at the expense of disabled workers who depend on those jobs. Two Stop & Shop stores in Revere have recently converted more than half of their checkout lanes from a traditional system with a bagger to a Walmart-style carousel system that has the cashier bagging groceries. It’s a hint of what’s to come as the Quincy-based company says it’ll soon convert some registers at all of its 419 stores to run without a second set of hands. Stop & Shop said in a statement that it has begun adding the carousel bagging systems to “provide customers with an even faster checkout experience.” The company said the move is not cost-related, and emphasized that no one would lose their job because of the change. “It will be all stores,” said Phil Tracey, a Stop & Shop spokesman. The company said it is adding more of the systems at “select store registers over the next year,” although it will keep some traditional registers with baggers as well as electronic self-checkout lanes. The baggers are represented by the United Food & Commercial Workers Local 1445, which says the grocery stores are required to give a minimum number of hours to the baggers at other positions in the company. Advocates who help handicapped people find jobs say they are worried that the wave of checkout changes soon to sweep across New England could spread across the industry as a whole. Debbie Muldoon, director of career and employment services at Triangle Inc., a Malden disability employment organization, told the Herald two of her clients already have lost their positions as baggers at the Squire Road Stop & Shop in Revere and are undergoing retraining for other jobs at the store. “It doesn’t send the message of having an inclusive work environment when you eliminate jobs that are the only work these people can do,” Muldoon said. “This is probably going to be the trend.” Muldoon sees the move as a cost-cutting measure, and she said the loss of bagger positions could have a “huge impact” on her organization’s ability to find jobs for disabled people, because 20 percent of the placements are grocery-bagging jobs. “We have people bagging groceries at Market Basket, at Stop & Shop,” Muldoon said, “As stores eliminate these types of jobs, it’s a huge impact on us.” Shoppers loading bags of groceries into their cars in Revere yesterday bristled at the company’s move to cut baggers out of their shopping experience. “It’s a good job. It’s job security,” said Andrea Vitale of Malden. She added that she’d rather “stand in line for an hour” than use one of the electronic self-checkouts also competing for space in many grocery stores. “You see it everywhere.” Liseth Tabares of Revere said having someone bag her groceries is a big help, and she likes to see people with limited job skills employed. “It’s easier and it’s faster,” she said. “They need to work, and they feel special when they do it.” Related Articles Proposed regulations irk lobstermen Costco will soon be delivering in 50 different cities State trooper collapses, dies in Framingham More On: Stop & Shop Market Basket Share this Article Join the Conversation Herald Columnists Bill Speros / Obnoxious Boston Fan Speros: White House visit stirring up Patriot haters Joe Battenfeld Battenfeld: Deal’s off for health care, but artful turn for Donald Trump Lindsay Kalter Kalter: Democrats smile now, but rising costs still dog program Joe Battenfeld Battenfeld: DCR parks truck fleet citing abuse Jessica Heslam Heslam: Terrorist mows down a Utah ‘gem’ Bob McGovern McGovern: SJC to rule on youth animal abusers Trending Now The Latest: Trump blames Democrats for health bill's failure Man gets 7-year sentence in Bridgewater State child sexual abuse case Boston Herald photographer wins award for image Elizabeth Warren to Donald Trump: You’re trying to make Obamacare fail Tweets by @bostonherald ✖ Boston Herald News Local Coverage Local Politics Columnists National US Politics International Offbeat News Obituaries Opinion Op Ed Letters to the Editor Editorials Send a Letter Sports Red Sox Patriots Celtics Bruins Columnist College Soccer Golf High School Other Entertainment Inside Track Celebrity News Arts & Culture Movies Music Television LifeStyle Food & Beverage Style & Fashion Travel Health & Fitness Business Automotive Real Estate Technology Markets More… Classifieds Radio Horoscope Lottery Crossword Contests Weather RSS Feeds Archives Log In Legal Notices Advertise Purchase Back Copies Send a News Tip Contact Us Home Delivery e-Edition Mobile Apps Herald Newsletters Send a Letter to the Editor Boston Herald In Education Mass Literacy ©Copyright by the Boston Herald and Herald Media No portion of BostonHerald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.

According to Zacks, “Share price of Wal-Mart has been rising since the past one year, higher than the Zacks categorized industry. Wal-Mart also reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, driven by higher comparable store sales, despite deflationary pressure hurting the profits. However, both earnings and revenues declined from the year-ago quarter, due to unfavorable currency and higher investments in wages and e-commerce activities. Further, the decline in the International business was more than offset by growth in sales at Wal-Mart U.S and Sam’s Club divisions. Nevertheless, we are encouraged that the company is focusing on ways to drive traffic. The three acquisitions in 2017 are in line with the company’s efforts to grow its online activities. The end of Shipping Pass and announcement of free two-day shipping service will also make the company competitive against Amazon.” Several other equities analysts have also issued reports on WMT.

Rather, it is that one is run by lawyers and the other by engineers. Nowhere is this truer than in the astonishing “catch-up” occurring on the mainland in the explosion of digital technologies and their application to the daily lives of hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese consumers. As long as China is governed by engineers, I reckon this breakneck transformation will shock, intimidate and challenge us for decades to come Ask people in the US or Europe about Chinese technology and most will still cast a dismissive smile and say China remains home of the cheap and cheerful copycat stuff that fills Walmart shelves. The dangerous naivity of this view was brought home forcefully at our APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) meetings last year – the first in San Francisco and the second in Shenzhen. The first thing we noticed was that our internet worked noticeably faster in Shenzhen than around San Francisco. The second was that our Chinese colleagues were paying for everything via AliPay on their smartphones. In awe of the smart technologies on display at PayPal, Google and Dolby sound studios, we were blown away by Huawei, where 40 per cent of its 170,000 staff are working on pure research, and the foundations being are being laid for roll-out of 5G across the whole of China by 2020. Hardly a week goes by without fresh reminders of extraordinary technological developments occurring on the mainland – many unique to China. Take the bike-sharing boom that has gripped Shanghai and other mainland cities over the past year. Many cities worldwide have bike-sharing operations, but none like those offered by Mobike and Ofo in Shanghai: find your brightly-coloured bike (there are an estimated 450,000 of them parked around Shanghai), open the Mobike app on your phone, scan the QR code on the bike, and you are away. AliPay charges you a security deposit, and user charges of RMB1-2 an hour. The bikes are GPS-tracked. This e-payment revolution has left the rest of the world in the dust. China’s digital payments market is today 50 times larger than that in the US. China’s digital payments market is today 50 times larger than that in the US More seriously, look at the 500-metre-wide radio telescope in Guizhou province that has joined the global search for extraterritorial life. Or the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer which is by far the fastest in the world. Or lithium battery development. Or 3D-printed blood vessels made from stem cells…the list goes on. I even noticed this recently when a tech publication compared the specs of the pride of America’s drone market – the GoPro Karma – with the Mavic Pro drone made by DJI in the Pearl River Delta. By every measure the Mavic was superior – it flew faster, flew twice as high, weighed 25 per cent less, could fly 30 per cent longer time, and cost US$749 compared with the GoPro’s US$799. Where do the GoPro team go to slit their wrists? This extraordinary transition from cheap and cheerful to world-matching high tech is not an accident, and in many governments around the world it is triggering alarm and protest. Back in the early 2000s, China’s engineers – whoops, party cadres – realised that as “manufacturer to the world” its companies were playing a mug’s game. They had captured the low-cost assembly parts of the global supply chains of companies worldwide, but this kept their millions of migrant workers in virtual poverty, while they were importing high-value-adding components from manufacturers in the US, Japan, Germany and Korea. Domestic patent applications inside China have soared from nothing at the start of the century to 928,000 in 2014 – 40 per cent more than the US’s 579,000 and almost three times Japan’s 326,000 These engineers quickly worked out that if they were ever going to build a middle-class consumer economy, China’s workers would need to earn much higher wages – which meant higher productivity, and the technological capacity to make the high-value-adding sophisticated components inside China. From this, the Made in China 2025 scheme was conceived, attracting billions of dollars into research at home, and the acquisition of foreign companies, and foreign talent, wherever possible. Within two years high-tech experts, particularly in the US, were pressing panic buttons. Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told the US Congress in January that China had plunged into “an aggressive by-hook-or-by-crook strategy that involves serially manipulating the marketplace and wantonly stealing and coercing transfer of American know-how”. In truth, China’s government was not doing anything unique or even novel. The Made in China 2025 initiative was based on Germany’s Industrie 4.0 blueprint for technology development. What is awesome is the speed and effectiveness with which they have built this technology self-reliance initiative from scratch. A total of 19 data labs have been established in universities across the country. STEM education (science, technology, engineering and maths) is being prioritised countrywide. A “Qianren Jihua” (Thousand Talents) scheme is trawling the world to attract brilliant scientists. And for a US official who has for decades had first-hand experience of how US government-funded defence industry research has been carefully used to fuel the US’s technology leadership worldwide, complaints about Chinese government support for high-tech research sounds a tad hypocritical. But Mr Atkinson is right to be unnerved, and wary of the massive global implications of what is now occurring across the mainland. From a horse-and-cart economy just three decades ago, China is not only being transformed: its lack of legacy technology infrastructure, and a ruthlessly hypercompetitive private sector, are leapfrogging in ways most of the rest of the world can barely imagine. China’s Huawei in 2015 became the world’s biggest issuer of new international patents. According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation, domestic patent applications inside China have soared from nothing at the start of the century to 928,000 in 2014 – 40 per cent more than the US’s 579,000 and almost three times Japan’s 326,000. China’s engineers – whoops, party officials – have not simply been driven by the quest for technology leadership, or fear of reliance on technology from overseas. They hate its gigantic deficit in royalty and licence fees to foreign technology-holders. From zero payments for intellectual property in 2000, China today pays royalty and licence fees of almost US$20bn. Since its companies currently earn a meagre US$1 billion a year in such payments from foreign companies, that means an intellectual property deficit of over US$18bn. As long as China is governed by engineers, I reckon this breakneck transformation will shock, intimidate and challenge us for decades to come. And I suspect Americans will respond the way they know best – as lawyers.

Trump won, get over it Ukraine’s genocidal famine remembered These businesses REALLY recycle If you are sitting down to do your family budget in order to deal with such necessities as paying for hydro, or perhaps wondering if your children will ever be able to afford a home somewhere even near the GTA, consider this. According to Forbes magazine, for the first time ever there are in excess of 2,000 billionaires in the world. Now go pour yourself a shot. Each year Forbes publishes its billionaires catalogue, which I for some sadistic reason find extremely entertaining to read. It’s not like I’ll ever see my name on that list. I’d have to win three U.S Powerball lotteries, just to make it to the bottom rung — barely. I suppose it’s like fantasizing about playing for the Blue Jays, and I’m nearly 64 with a back that occasionally deserts me. What does a billion dollars look like? Well, put a $100 bill in your hand and imagine 10 million more on top of it. You could spend $1,000 a day and it would take 2,739 years before it was all gone. Or give it to the Liberal Party of Ontario and wait a week. So who are the kings of currency? Once again, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates leads the way with an estimated worth of $86 billion. Warren Buffet, head of Berkshire Hathaway, made $14.8 billion last year, moving him back to second spot with $75.6 billion. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos raked in $27.6 billion and he’s now sitting at number three with $72.8 billion. Amancio Ortega, who along with his wife founded the fashion line, Zara, and owns a vast real estate empire, plus the Spanish soccer club Deportivo La Coruna, is worth $71.3 billion. That makes him the fourth wealthiest man in the world and the richest man in Europe. Rounding out the top five is Mark Zuckerberg, the man behind Facebook, worth $56 billion. And he’s only 32 years old. I’ll have to remember to “like” that on his Facebook page. There are also four billionaires in their twenties. (Lazy millennials.) The three wealthiest women are, at number 14, Lillian Bettencourt, with $39.5 billion. She owns one third of L’Oreal. Next is Alice Walton, daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, with $33.8 billion. Jacqueline Mars is worth $27 billion. She owns one-third of Mars Inc., as in Mars bars, which happens to be the world’s largest candy maker. Here at home — not my home, but Canada — David Thomson, the media giant, is the leader at $27 billion, good for twenty-fourth place. However, that’s according to Forbes. Canadian Business Magazine says he’s worth $39.13 billion. He bests Galen Weston’s $13.22 billion and the cheese dynasty Saputo family, with $10.61 billion. How about the leader of the free world, U.S. President Donald Trump, who, during his election campaign, claimed he was worth $8-billion plus? Well, according to Forbes, it’s now less than half that, apparently due to a changing New York real estate market. In the past year, Forbes says, he’s dropped from 324th to 544th place, with a current estimated worth of $3.5 billion. Mind you, that’s still a lot of rubles. Nyet?

Each year Forbes publishes its billionaires catalogue, which I for some sadistic reason find extremely entertaining to read. It’s not like I’ll ever see my name on that list. I’d have to win three U.S Powerball lotteries, just to make it to the bottom rung — barely. I suppose it’s like fantasizing about playing for the Blue Jays, and I’m nearly 64 with a back that occasionally deserts me. What does a billion dollars look like? Well, put a $100 bill in your hand and imagine 10 million more on top of it. You could spend $1,000 a day and it would take 2,739 years before it was all gone.

Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh has ditched his Dockers for another 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 5:47 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens

butter and jelly. Milk and cookies. Batman and Robin. Maize and blue. Jim Harbaugh and khakis. All are iconic combinations, but it appears the latter is undergoing a few changes right now. The Michigan head coach’s affinity for a pair of khakis has been so strong over the years that it’s become almost comical how much he likes the style of pant. Heck, he even got a commercial out of it a few years ago when he specifically started getting outfitted with Dockers brand khakis. Despite being a paid endorser though, it appears that Harbaugh has dropped the famous Levi’s brand version of khakis to attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind in another pair of pants. Just had a nice chat w/ Jim Harbaugh about his khaki game. He upgraded to @lululemon pants and says, "I'll never wear anything else." Smart. pic.twitter.com/uDny4Ceqc8 — Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) March 24, 2017 Not only is the switch from Dockers to Lululemon result in a lot more comfort for the Wolverines coach, it’s probably a bit more of a hit to the ol’ wallet than dropping by Walmart for a pair of khakis off the shelf. It probably doesn’t make a huge difference for Harbaugh though given that he’s the highest paid coach in the country but it might result in a few more trips to the mall. Either way, what it does mean is that now we demand a new commercial featuring Harbaugh and khakis. After all, if you’re upping the clothing game, you’ve got to up the ad game as well. View 10 Comments Scroll Down For: Florida State planning new facility to catch up with Clemson Getty Images 9 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 2:54 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Florida State completed a major facility overhaul not even three years ago. But the thing about arms races is that when someone pulls ahead of you it means you are behind. And Clemson officially pulled ahead earlier this year with the opening of its glistening, slide-equipped new home. As such, Jimbo Fisher told reporters Friday that Florida State now has plans to construct its own standalone facility, going as far as meeting with an architect. “We need room. We need meeting space, player development areas. You’ve got to have those areas and also to show off your history. That’s what Florida State is known for, being a great football program,” Fisher told ESPN. “You can never stand still. If you’re not evolving and moving, people are going to bypass you. You’ve got to keep going. The great programs never settle. We’re always looking for that edge. It’s going to help recruiting. It’s going to help player development. We get a lot of guys that are three-and-out, so we’ve got to have space for them to get them developed as quickly as we can so we can get production out of them.” While saying that it’s a “competitive” race and not an arms race, Fisher also tried to sell that the plans for the ‘Noles’ new home were unrelated to Clemson’s new facility. “I don’t care what they’ve got,” Fisher said. “I’m worried about what we’ve got. If I don’t think it’s going to make a difference in our program for these kids to develop as people, students and players, I won’t ask. I didn’t grow up with a lot. I was taught if you need it, do what you’ve got to do to be successful but don’t waste. I’m not going to do that. But there’s things you’ve got to have to be successful and that’s the next step, in my opinion.” View 9 Comments Former Michigan TE Jake Butt says college players should be able to cash in on likenesses Getty Images 10 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 12:34 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) For the record, Jake Butt shouldn’t “be paid” in the strictest sense of the term — to receive a paycheck for services rendered. Rather, the former Michigan tight end believes players should be able to profit from their statuses as college athletes when the NCAA, its conferences and member schools are already doing the same. (Having an extremely marketable last name probably contributed to the forming of this opinion.) “Something needs to change,” Butt told ESPN.com at Michigan’s pro day. “I don’t want a check from the NCAA. I don’t know if that’s something that’s likely. But the big thing is they say you can’t use your name to benefit. I can’t go into my favorite breakfast spot, Benny’s, I can’t go in there and get a free breakfast because I’m only getting that because of my name. “That’s not to say I can’t make friends with the owner because of the person I am. I’m a good guy, a really good guy — sociable guy, made a lot of friends. I can’t accept anything free for that. They said I can’t go down the street, the example one of them gave us is you can’t go to [get] tires and negotiate your price from $600 to $500 because that’s only because of your name. But Joe Schmo can go down the street and he can negotiate his price. It’s kind of ridiculous to me.” Butt was a victim of the cruelest twist in circumstances possible for a college athlete — a season-ending injury at the end of his final season. A senior, Butt was one of the top tight ends on the draft board before suffering a torn ACL in the Wolverines’ Orange Bowl loss to Florida State. The Mackey Award winner as the nation’s top tight end will be drafted next month, but the damage to his bank account resulting from the injuries is significant. Being able to profit from his own name and image would have served as insurance against the loss of value he suffered due to the injury. “I should be the example of why college athletes should be getting paid in college or why I can’t use my name to benefit off my likeness in college,” Butt said. “Why can I see ‘I Like Jake Butt and I Cannot Lie,’ I see those shirts and I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck in college. Who knows? Heaven forbid something happens in the NFL, can I really benefit off of it when it was at the most? No, I can’t.” View 10 Comments Baylor strength coach apparently no longer with the program Getty Images 1 Comment By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 6:49 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) It seems every bit of news related to Baylor football nowadays has to do with the school’s on-going sexual assault scandal but it appears there is one bit of information coming out of the program that doesn’t have something to do with that. A school spokesperson told ESPN on Friday that football strength coach Kaz Kazadi has been “reassigned to a role outside the athletic performance staff.” A report from the local ESPN Radio affiliate in Waco indicates that the move will eventually have the coach leaving the school altogether. Kazadi spent nearly a decade with the Bears and played a big role in the team’s on-field turnaround under the former coaching staff. Several former players took to Twitter on Friday to express their shock over the loss of one of the cornerstones of the team in recent years. After the hire of Matt Rhule this offseason, it isn’t too surprising to see some turnover among those staff members connected to the previous regime. Baylor’s new head coach brought most of his strength staff with him from Temple so it was probably only a matter of time before Kazadi moved on, though the timing of the quasi-announcement (the Bears started spring football last weekend) is somewhat interesting. Either way, it appears Baylor will have a new direction in the weight room going forward. View 1 Comment Former Penn State president found guilty of role in Sandusky scandal Getty Images 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 4:44 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Former Penn State president Graham Spanier’s day in court has come and has resulted in a guilty verdict. The Centre Daily Times is among the outlets reporting that a jury has found Spanier guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of children in a trial related to his role in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. In addition, Spanier was found not guilty on two other counts, one a similar child endangerment charge and the other a count of criminal conspiracy. The verdict comes after lengthy deliberations by the jury in the case, which took a turn last week when former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz plead guilty to child endangerment charges as part of the same trial. All three figure to be sentenced in the next few months. Prior to the scandal, Spanier was widely considered to be one of the most respected college presidents in the country and heavily involved in NCAA matters. However he was one of several key figures fired by the school as a result of covering up the actions of Sandusky, the Nittany Lions’ former defensive coordinator who was found guilty on 45 charges of sexually abusing minors. While the verdict is likely to be appealed, Spanier is nevertheless facing the prospect of joining Sandusky behind bars as a result of his own involvement in the scandal.

The cost for the console is $299.99, not including any games. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” “1-2-Switch,” “Snipperclips – Cut it out, Together!” and “Just Dance 2017” are now among the few games available for the Switch. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, available April 28, is one of the games planned for future release. Many Nintendo fans are disappointed by the short the list of available games. The Nintendo Switch consists of a tablet-like console, which includes a screen and a kickstand for tabletop mode, a dock, which holds the console for charging and TV mode, and two controllers, called joy-cons. The joy-cons’ side controllers slide off the main console to become individual joysticks and can also be combined with each other to create a single traditional-style controller, allowing for single or multiplayer gaming. The joy-cons come with removable wrist straps which also feature larger L and R buttons. The right joy-con also has an IR scanner that can detect hand signals, such as rock, paper and scissors, a feature which does not have many, if any, in-game uses yet. The Nintendo Switch also has a motion sensor, a feature used in some of the games, such as “Breath of the Wild.” In this game, the player can tilt and turn the controller to change the orientation of items held by Link’s magnesis power. The Nintendo Switch is currently available in two color schemes: standard gray and the more rare “Red-Blue” version, as users call it, which features one neon red and one neon blue joy-con. The Nintendo Switch also allows for online gaming, which is free until the paid service launches in the fall.  Many users have experienced the occasional glitch or lag while playing certain games, particularly “Breath of the Wild,” as well as issues connecting to the internet. Things like these are to be expected with the release of a new console, especially one as complex and versatile as the Nintendo Switch. However, these issues do not take away from the overall enjoyment of the Nintendo Switch. Other than those issues, which will hopefully be fixed as time goes on with software updates and new games, the Nintendo Switch meets a lot of the expectations fans had for it. “My favorite thing about the Switch is the versatility, the capability to use it as a home console you can take anywhere you want,” said James Kessler, an Oswego State freshman. Kessler was among other gaming fans at Wal-Mart on the night of March 2 for the official midnight release of the Nintendo Switch. The Oswego GameStop ran out of pre-orders earlier that night, but Wal-Mart had yet to put theirs out. Oddly enough, there is a trend of licking the game cartridges, comparable to the cinnamon challenge or the salt and ice challenge, though not as hazardous to one’s health. A tweet from Jeff Gerstmann, co-founder of the game blog Giant Bomb, revealed the cartridges taste absolutely awful. A Nintendo spokesperson told the website Polygon that the cartridges are coated with the “most bitter chemical compound known to humanity” to discourage people, specifically small children, from swallowing them. Though some may view this as a smart idea, others feel that it is a bit ridiculous and unnecessary, considering that such things should be kept out of reach of small children. Though the Nintendo Switch is far from perfect and still has a ways to go, it has already made its mark as an innovation in gaming. Its ability to act as both a home console and a handheld game system makes it great for those who cannot bear to put their game down to go eat or to get to class or work on time or to go hang out with friends.

Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh has ditched his Dockers for another 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 5:47 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens

butter and jelly. Milk and cookies. Batman and Robin. Maize and blue. Jim Harbaugh and khakis. All are iconic combinations, but it appears the latter is undergoing a few changes right now. The Michigan head coach’s affinity for a pair of khakis has been so strong over the years that it’s become almost comical how much he likes the style of pant. Heck, he even got a commercial out of it a few years ago when he specifically started getting outfitted with Dockers brand khakis. Despite being a paid endorser though, it appears that Harbaugh has dropped the famous Levi’s brand version of khakis to attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind in another pair of pants. Just had a nice chat w/ Jim Harbaugh about his khaki game. He upgraded to @lululemon pants and says, "I'll never wear anything else." Smart. pic.twitter.com/uDny4Ceqc8 — Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) March 24, 2017 Not only is the switch from Dockers to Lululemon result in a lot more comfort for the Wolverines coach, it’s probably a bit more of a hit to the ol’ wallet than dropping by Walmart for a pair of khakis off the shelf. It probably doesn’t make a huge difference for Harbaugh though given that he’s the highest paid coach in the country but it might result in a few more trips to the mall. Either way, what it does mean is that now we demand a new commercial featuring Harbaugh and khakis. After all, if you’re upping the clothing game, you’ve got to up the ad game as well. View 10 Comments Scroll Down For: Florida State planning new facility to catch up with Clemson Getty Images 9 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 2:54 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Florida State completed a major facility overhaul not even three years ago. But the thing about arms races is that when someone pulls ahead of you it means you are behind. And Clemson officially pulled ahead earlier this year with the opening of its glistening, slide-equipped new home. As such, Jimbo Fisher told reporters Friday that Florida State now has plans to construct its own standalone facility, going as far as meeting with an architect. “We need room. We need meeting space, player development areas. You’ve got to have those areas and also to show off your history. That’s what Florida State is known for, being a great football program,” Fisher told ESPN. “You can never stand still. If you’re not evolving and moving, people are going to bypass you. You’ve got to keep going. The great programs never settle. We’re always looking for that edge. It’s going to help recruiting. It’s going to help player development. We get a lot of guys that are three-and-out, so we’ve got to have space for them to get them developed as quickly as we can so we can get production out of them.” While saying that it’s a “competitive” race and not an arms race, Fisher also tried to sell that the plans for the ‘Noles’ new home were unrelated to Clemson’s new facility. “I don’t care what they’ve got,” Fisher said. “I’m worried about what we’ve got. If I don’t think it’s going to make a difference in our program for these kids to develop as people, students and players, I won’t ask. I didn’t grow up with a lot. I was taught if you need it, do what you’ve got to do to be successful but don’t waste. I’m not going to do that. But there’s things you’ve got to have to be successful and that’s the next step, in my opinion.” View 9 Comments Former Michigan TE Jake Butt says college players should be able to cash in on likenesses Getty Images 10 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 12:34 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) For the record, Jake Butt shouldn’t “be paid” in the strictest sense of the term — to receive a paycheck for services rendered. Rather, the former Michigan tight end believes players should be able to profit from their statuses as college athletes when the NCAA, its conferences and member schools are already doing the same. (Having an extremely marketable last name probably contributed to the forming of this opinion.) “Something needs to change,” Butt told ESPN.com at Michigan’s pro day. “I don’t want a check from the NCAA. I don’t know if that’s something that’s likely. But the big thing is they say you can’t use your name to benefit. I can’t go into my favorite breakfast spot, Benny’s, I can’t go in there and get a free breakfast because I’m only getting that because of my name. “That’s not to say I can’t make friends with the owner because of the person I am. I’m a good guy, a really good guy — sociable guy, made a lot of friends. I can’t accept anything free for that. They said I can’t go down the street, the example one of them gave us is you can’t go to [get] tires and negotiate your price from $600 to $500 because that’s only because of your name. But Joe Schmo can go down the street and he can negotiate his price. It’s kind of ridiculous to me.” Butt was a victim of the cruelest twist in circumstances possible for a college athlete — a season-ending injury at the end of his final season. A senior, Butt was one of the top tight ends on the draft board before suffering a torn ACL in the Wolverines’ Orange Bowl loss to Florida State. The Mackey Award winner as the nation’s top tight end will be drafted next month, but the damage to his bank account resulting from the injuries is significant. Being able to profit from his own name and image would have served as insurance against the loss of value he suffered due to the injury. “I should be the example of why college athletes should be getting paid in college or why I can’t use my name to benefit off my likeness in college,” Butt said. “Why can I see ‘I Like Jake Butt and I Cannot Lie,’ I see those shirts and I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck in college. Who knows? Heaven forbid something happens in the NFL, can I really benefit off of it when it was at the most? No, I can’t.” View 10 Comments Baylor strength coach apparently no longer with the program Getty Images 1 Comment By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 6:49 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) It seems every bit of news related to Baylor football nowadays has to do with the school’s on-going sexual assault scandal but it appears there is one bit of information coming out of the program that doesn’t have something to do with that. A school spokesperson told ESPN on Friday that football strength coach Kaz Kazadi has been “reassigned to a role outside the athletic performance staff.” A report from the local ESPN Radio affiliate in Waco indicates that the move will eventually have the coach leaving the school altogether. Kazadi spent nearly a decade with the Bears and played a big role in the team’s on-field turnaround under the former coaching staff. Several former players took to Twitter on Friday to express their shock over the loss of one of the cornerstones of the team in recent years. After the hire of Matt Rhule this offseason, it isn’t too surprising to see some turnover among those staff members connected to the previous regime. Baylor’s new head coach brought most of his strength staff with him from Temple so it was probably only a matter of time before Kazadi moved on, though the timing of the quasi-announcement (the Bears started spring football last weekend) is somewhat interesting. Either way, it appears Baylor will have a new direction in the weight room going forward. View 1 Comment Former Penn State president found guilty of role in Sandusky scandal Getty Images 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 4:44 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Former Penn State president Graham Spanier’s day in court has come and has resulted in a guilty verdict. The Centre Daily Times is among the outlets reporting that a jury has found Spanier guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of children in a trial related to his role in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. In addition, Spanier was found not guilty on two other counts, one a similar child endangerment charge and the other a count of criminal conspiracy. The verdict comes after lengthy deliberations by the jury in the case, which took a turn last week when former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz plead guilty to child endangerment charges as part of the same trial. All three figure to be sentenced in the next few months. Prior to the scandal, Spanier was widely considered to be one of the most respected college presidents in the country and heavily involved in NCAA matters. However he was one of several key figures fired by the school as a result of covering up the actions of Sandusky, the Nittany Lions’ former defensive coordinator who was found guilty on 45 charges of sexually abusing minors. While the verdict is likely to be appealed, Spanier is nevertheless facing the prospect of joining Sandusky behind bars as a result of his own involvement in the scandal.

Brady Says GOP Will Head Straight Into Tax Reform President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan say they’re ready to put a tax overhaul at the top of their agendas. After the lack of sufficient support among House Republicans forced them to cancel a scheduled vote on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, both men highlighted the need to focus now on rewriting the U.S. tax code. “So now we’re going to go for tax reform, which I’ve always liked,” Trump said Friday following the decision to cancel the vote. Health care represented the first big test of Trump’s ability to steer ambitious proposals through Congress -- yet some experts say he’s seemed more interested in tax issues throughout his comparatively brief political career. “Tax reform has always been a bigger priority for the administration than health-care reform -- when they were in campaign mode, tax reform was their big thing,” said economist Kyle Pomerleau, the director of federal tax projects at the conservative Tax Foundation. During a rally earlier this week, Trump repeated a theme from recent speeches, calling for “massive tax reform” -- though details of the plan he’ll offer remain unclear. ‘Ambitious Plans’ During a press conference Friday, Ryan acknowledged that failing to repeal and replace Obamacare would make a tax overhaul more difficult, but not impossible, because his members have more consensus on taxes. He said he met with the president, as well as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on Friday to discuss a tax overhaul. “Now we’re going to move on with the rest of our agenda because we have big, ambitious plans to improve people’s lives in this country,” Ryan said. Trump’s tax proposals changed throughout his presidential campaign -- by Election Day, his plan had moved closer to the tax blueprint that Ryan and other House leaders prefer. Both plans would consolidate the number of individual income-tax rates to three from the existing seven; the top rate would drop to 33 percent from 39.6 percent currently. On corporate taxes, Trump and Ryan have yet to forge an agreement -- particularly on the controversial issue of “border adjustments.” Ryan favors replacing the existing 35 percent corporate income tax with a 20 percent tax rate on companies’ domestic sales and imports. Exports would be excluded. Border Adjustment That border-adjusted approach -- which opponents say would increase consumer prices -- has divided Trump’s White House advisers, and the president hasn’t yet announced a position on it. Supporters say higher prices on imported goods would be offset over time by a strengthening dollar. “One of our concerns about it is that if the currency moves, then the Wal-Mart shopper shouldn’t be impacted," Mnuchin said during a Friday morning appearance at an event sponsored by the media company Axios. "But if the currency moves, that has an impact for our exporters. It’s a very complicated issue worth looking at carefully.” Mnuchin said the White House is committed to a tax overhaul that includes corporate and individual tax cuts. He added that the administration had been working on a tax plan for the past two months and it’s something “we are designing from scratch and running through a lot of scenarios.” Mnuchin has previously said tax legislation would be completed by Congress’s August recess. On Friday, he said he’s still optimistic about the August target but signaled a tax overhaul by the fall might be more likely. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also said Friday the White House will be taking the lead on pushing the tax overhaul -- and that the president is working on that plan now. “When you see tax reform the first time, it will be the president’s plan and we’ll drive the debate on that,” Mulvaney said during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said he remains committed to getting a tax overhaul completed before Congress’s recess in August and that he still wants to use the House GOP plan to achieve a meaningful corporate rate reduction. “We’re going to head straight into the next game, which is the biggest tax reform in modern history,” Brady said.

The scouts are going door-to-door, collecting non-perishable foods for those in need. Last year, they collected almost 30,000 pounds of food and more than $400 to provide 27,000 meals, making their efforts a new record. Ozarks Food Harvest will provide the donations to its network of 270 pantries and programs in 28 different counties in Southwest Missouri. “The Boy Scouts of the Ozark Trails Council in southwest Missouri participate in the Scouting for Food drive because it is rooted in the very foundation of the Scouting movement and its dedication to implement good character development and morals for the future leaders of our communities, country and world,” commented Kurtis Grothoff, District Executive for the Boy Scouts of America in Springfield. “Scouts learn how to take care of others and their community and they do so by giving their own time and energy to help someone in need.” Saturday, March 25th, will end the month long drive with a one-day, community-wide food drive at four Walmart locations in Springfield. Members of the community can either donate food in grocery sacks left by their doors, or they can give at Walmart stores on Independence and Campbell from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., as well as Walmart Neighborhood Markets on East Republic and South Glenstone from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. You can also drop off donations at the Ozark Trail Headquarters at 1616 S. Eastgate or at Ozarks Food Harvest. Through this project, local Boy Scouts have provided nearly 160,000 meals over the last 11 years.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Consumers are finding more and more goodies to tempt them at the supermarket, but many of them aren’t even edible. This week, Aldi reached into Ikea’s bag of tricks and offered an upholstered chair in a box for $70, an ottoman for $40 and leaning bookshelf for $40. Cub Foods is currently selling ­freezers for $199. Hy-Vee’s newest Twin Cities stores entice shoppers with departments devoted to cosmetics, clothing and wellness supplements. With so many nonfood items crowding the shelves, consumers can find nearly everything under the sun at the supermarket. They are gravitating toward the edge of store where meat, dairy, produce and delis are placed, but also nonfood categories, according to Alexia Howard at AllianceBernstein global investment firm. Meanwhile, the center store area with cans and boxed goods has shrunk. Why? It’s about opportunistic buying, said Paco Underhill, environmental psychologist and the author of “Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping.” “The internet has taught us opportunity — that we can buy anything from almost anywhere,” he said. “People used to think they would only buy milk at the grocery store or convenience store and now they’ll buy it at a drugstore or a hardware store.” Glen Stubbe - Star Tribune The Aldi Finds aisle includes a rotating selection of home goods, from their exclusive brands Huntington Home and Sohl Furniture, seasonal items and unique finds. That’s causing supermarkets to look for new ways to attract shoppers. Retailers such as Aldi have learned if they can get an aggressively good price on a desirable item, consumers will buy it, even if it’s an oddball thrown into the regular mix. Kirby and Barb Hunt of Burnsville look specifically for the nonfood items in Aldi’s weekly flier, and they are regulars in the discount chain’s home aisle. On opening day Thursday at the new Aldi across from Burnsville Center, the couple had a $20 waffle iron in their cart. “This aisle has good finds,” Kirby Hunt said. “We’d buy that chair if we needed it.” The element of surprise keeps shoppers coming back, said Dave Brennan, a retailing professor at the University of St. Thomas. “The idea is to get people in the store more frequently and then keep them there longer,” he said. Just as Target and Wal-Mart added groceries to get people to shop more often, supermarkets are now adding general merchandise for the same reason. Aldi runs two pages of nongrocery items called “Aldi Finds” in its weekly ad, and the selection keeps expanding. “In years past we would not have carried furniture,” said Matt Lilla, vice president of the store’s Faribault division. “We’re finding that we can sell just about anything.” Aldi’s new, larger-scale Burnsville store — which at 12,000 square feet is a fraction of a 90,000-square-foot Hy-Vee — devotes an entire aisle to such home goods rugs, pillows, shelving, mattress pads, office chairs, writing desks, bookshelves and small ­appliances. It’s a little bit like throwing things against the wall to see what sticks, said David Livingston, supermarket analyst in Milwaukee. “They’re experimenting, trial and error, to see what works,” he said. “Aldi introduced Lacura cosmetics and that didn’t work so well, so they brought in a baby ­section.” Groceries have always had a relatively low profit margin, especially in stores’ center aisles filled with cans and cartons of food. “Items that can spend five years on the shelf have the lowest gross margin,” Livingston said. “That’s why supermarkets want to steer them to higher-profit items.” For the past two years, Cub Foods has run a promotion offering a freezer for $199. Customers also get a $50 gift card with the purchase. “The freezer promotion is something Cub customers have enjoyed so we will continue to look for these out-of-the-box opportunities as they become available in the future,” said Mike Wilken, spokesman for Supervalu, Cub’s owner. While buying a low-priced freezer at the supermarket might not seem as knee-jerk as snatching a bag of Dove chocolates off the shelf, they are both considered impulse buys at the supermarket. “Consumers spending more per trip offsets lower traffic at the retailer,” said Brennan, the St. Thomas professor.   jewoldt@startribune.com 612-673-7633 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Norman Police say 21-year-old Oklahoma University student Vincent Valentin crashed his pickup through the back fence of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house.  Investigators reportedly say he then got out of the truck and started shooting into the house. “I heard a loud crash,” said OU student Nate Fain, who lives next to the fraternity house. Fain rushed outside, thinking he had heard an accident and the driver might need help. “The guy opened the door and cocked the gun. He started firing the gun into the air,” said Fain. Two bullets reportedly struck the Phi Gamma Delta house. Investigators told the station that fraternity members confronted Valentin, who raised his gun at them and pulled the trigger again. “There was some sort of malfunction that prevented the gun from firing, thankfully,” said Norman Police Public Information Officer Sarah Jensen. Officers say Valentin also threw a hatchet at fraternity members before running off. No fraternity members were hurt. Valentin was reportedly found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the front yard of a home less than 100 yards away. Before crashing his pickup at the fraternity house, police say an employee at a local Walmart saw Valentin using the hatchet to hack at trees and shrubs outside the store. “The individual pointed a gun at the employee,” said Jensen, who says Valentin quickly left. Valentin’s Twitter account reportedly shows a picture of him holding a pistol. The station reports that he also made references to being bullied and murdering people. Police are now looking into any connection between him and Walmart, including the belief he may have been a former employee. Investigators are reportedly still trying to understand the connection to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. “We know there was a prior relationship with them, as a group, and there were some issues that had come up and they believe this could have somehow contributed to this incident,” said Jensen. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Home Opinion Hat Tips Hat Tips March 24, 2017 · · 0 Hello, I grew up in the fifties and sixties. Kind of. Shirley says I never did really grow up. But, believe it or not, I was cool. At the sock hops I was cool. I could twist. I could shout. BY DEAN MEYER Elvis was the King. Or Bob Wills. But to many of us, Chuck Berry was the real king. He passed away this weekend. “Maybelline.” “ Go Johnny Go.” “Brown Eyed Handsome Man.” I twisted and shouted for an hour on Saturday. Until Mrs. Meyer lay the law down. She can be cruel. I’m not sure if I ever mentioned this. For months Shirley asked what I wanted for Christmas. I only had one wish. I wanted a pressure canner! Really! I’ve always wanted a pressure canner. I got to thinking about when I was a kid and we would go to Grandma’s house in Nebraska. She would always open a can of canned meat for lunch. Home canned meat. It was always wonderful. Shirley reminded me that the reason she canned is because there was no refrigeration when I was a kid. And there wasn’t a Super Value down the street with shelves full of canned meat. And people aren’t dying from pressure cookers blowing up and getting sick from improperly canned foods. She is really a spoilsport. I left notes around the house. I posted pictures of the best cookers from Wal-Mart and Cabelas. I left recipes for canned pork and canned chicken and canned beef. She explained how she had to help her grandmother can when she was growing up a sickly child and couldn’t go outside with the other kids. I think it made her mean too. Well, I will cut to the chase. She didn’t get me a pressure cooker canner for Christmas. Deep down I knew she would. I tore open my gifts like a child on Christmas morning. A jacket. Gloves. Socks. Underwear. Bridle reins. A new cinch for my saddle. No cooker. None. I was devastated. How could she be so cruel? But being a resilient man, I figured out a way around it. Valentines Day! That was coming up. And I hadn’t gotten her a gift for Valentines Day for forty years. But this year I would. I went to Ace Hardware and bought her the nicest pressure cooker they had. I’m that kind of guy. You should have seen the look on her face when she ripped that beautiful red wrapping paper off that box. It was priceless. I have my own room now. And I have a lot more time for canning. If the Russians or Koreans shut off our electricity and you need canned meat, call me. I’m not letting my wife have any.

(AP) - A Pennsylvania woman is facing charges that she sold food stamps for heroin, after she tried to sell the food stamps online for cash. Lycoming County authorities filed charges this week against 37-year-old Tanya Keenan-Mack. Court records show Keenan-Mack is in jail stemming from an unrelated probation violation in a forgery case. The state inspector general's office says Keenan-Mack exchanged $194 in food stamps on an electronic benefits card for heroin, and that the card was used at a Weis Markets and a Walmart last month. The office says it began investigating after receiving a tip Feb. 6 that Keenan-Mack had posted an ad on Facebook's "Williamsport New and Used, Buy and Sell" page, offering $194 in food stamps for $100. A public defender for Keenan-Mack didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Want uninterrupted access to TheMercury.com on your computer, smartphone and tablet? We have many subscription options to fit your needs. See my options The future of Pottawatomie County’s one-cent sales tax could be decided this November — even though the tax isn’t scheduled to “sunset” for another three years. City officials from around the county Wednesday night endorsed a proposal to put the sales tax question before voters as soon as possible for two reasons: first, the outcome of the election would allow municipalities to better plan for outlying budgets; second, if a sales tax extension is voted down, it would give elected officials time for a second election before the tax officially sunsets in 2020. The meeting was hosted by the Pott County Commission and the Pott County Economic Development Corporation at IronClad in downtown Wamego. Jack Allston, PCEDC director, called the meeting “historic,” as it may have been the first time elected officials from around the county have come together to discuss a single issue. In addition to county officials and PCEDC board members, cities represented were Wamego, Olsburg, Westmoreland, Onaga, Havensville and Wheaton. Chamber of Commerce representatives from St. Marys and Wamego were also present. The countywide one-cent sales tax, approved by voters, went into effect in 2005, with a 15-year sunset clause requiring a countywide vote to extend it. Since its inception, revenues from the tax have trended steadily upward and have become a significant portion of municipal budgets, especially in smaller communities in the county. “This is just a Godsend to the city of Wheaton,” Councilman Terry Force said of the sales tax revenue. He said the revenue has allowed the community to fund projects annually rather than setting aside property tax dollars over a number of years. Wheaton’s 2016 sales tax allocation was $12,274, according to figures compiled by Robert Reece, county administrator. Westmoreland Councilman Jeff Rosell echoed Force’s sentiment. “I don’t think any of the small cities realized the financial impact this would have,” Rosell said. “This is just huge for us.” Loss of the sales tax revenue, he said, “would just tear apart these small cities.” Rosell noted that one mill of property tax generates about $10,000 for the city of Westmoreland. In 2016, the city’s sales tax allocation was $111,814. The countywide sales tax generated a total of more than $5 million in 2016. The revenue is allocated to the county and the cities using a formula based on population and property tax dollars levied, according to Reece. The allocations are recalculated annually, he said. Of the $5,116,281 generated in 2016, the following allocations were made, according to Reece’s figures: Pott County, $3,298,272; Belvue, $26,925; Emmett, $24,533; Havensville, $17,800; Louisville, $23,099; Manhattan, $297,913; Olsburg, $27,777; Onaga, $103,830; St. George, $98,518; St. Marys, $355,203; Wamego, $718,316; Westmoreland, $111,814; and Wheaton, $12,274. The sales tax revenue, according to Reece, equates to about six mills of property tax revenue for the county, 18 mills for the city of Wamego, and 48 mills for the city of Louisville. A mill is $1 in tax for every $1,000 in assessed taxable property value. “It’s a significant amount of their annual budgets for projects they do within their cities,” Reece said. Officials noted that the growth in sales tax revenue has mirrored the rapid growth of retail businesses in the county, especially in the southwest portion of the county (Blue Township) where large “box stores” such as Wal-Mart, Menard’s and (soon-to-be) Academy Sports are located. The rapid retail growth has also given Pott County one of the most favorable County Trade Pull Factors (CTPF) in the state. The CTPF is a gauge of a county’s retail strength and its so-called “balance of trade,” according to the Kansas Department of Revenue. A CTPF of 1.00 represents an even balance of trade; that is, the purchases of county residents who shop elsewhere are offset equally by the purchases of out-of-county residents. “A CTPF greater than 1.00 indicates local businesses are pulling in trade from beyond their county borders. Thus, the balance of trade is favorable,” according to the Department of Revenue. Pott County has a CTPF of 1.7, according to a market analysis commissioned by the PCEDC in 2016. That’s among the top five in Kansas and a clear indication that out-ofcounty residents are making a significant contribution to the county’s sales tax revenue, officials noted Wednesday. “If we lose this stream of revenue, it’s going to hurt a little bit and we’ll probably see a decline in services from this county and the cities,” said Pat Weixelman, county commission chairman. “I think it’s very imperative to try to sell this thing this year.” A vote on the countywide sales tax must be initiated by the county commission, which will also determine the specific purpose for the funds, as well as duration of the tax, if any. The stated purpose of the current sales tax was for “public safety and emergency services,” said Bob Awerkamp, Belvue, who noted the county used sales tax revenues in part “to build that Taj Mahal in Westmoreland (the Pott County Justice Center).” In order to get the sales tax question on the November ballot, a resolution must be approved and submitted to the county clerk within about 60 days, according to Reece. Allston closed the meeting with an appropriate plea: “Just make sure we all shop in Pott County. That’s all.” Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | The Manhattan Mercury, 318 North 5th Street, Manhattan, Kansas, 66502 | Copyright 2017

By Ben Ames Comment Supply chain software startup SensorThink has released a specialized warehouse execution system (WES) product designed to serve automated distribution centers (DCs) such as those being launched by parent company Tompkins International. Tompkins, a Raleigh, N.C.-based consultancy, co-founded SensorThink 18 months ago and holds an ownership stake in the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company. Tompkins recently unveiled a plan to create a fourth-party logistics provider (4PL) division called the MonarchFx Alliance, build a network of six highly automated DCs, and manage a team of logistics partners featuring prominent third-party logistics (3PL) providers, software vendors, and a delivery company. MonarchFx plans to start shipping orders by August, and all its fulfillment centers will utilize SensorThink, Tompkins Chairman and CEO Jim Tompkins said. SensorThink defines its software as a WES product combined with an Internet of Things (IoT) platform and a data analytics engine. Working together, those components tie the various elements of warehouse production, performance, and execution into a single platform, the company said. "Nothing new has happened in warehousing for a long time; the warehouse management system (WMS) has been the core technology there for 15 years," SensorThink CEO Eric Peters said in an interview. "But we saw the connected car, the connected city, the connected home, and that led us to the conclusion that we're soon going to have the connected warehouse. Cameras, drones, robots, connected thermostats...they're all coming to the warehouse, and the industry is not prepared." The SensorThink platform enables users to manage that broad collection of smart devices from a single computer screen, analyzing the performance of the entire building from a dashboard view, Peters said. The system gathers data from nearly anywhere in the building, including IoT-enabled devices that share information through networked sensors, as well as non-IoT connected machines and other software solutions. Data sources in a warehouse could include security devices, building automation, fleet management software, or the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that control manufacturing hardware, Peters said. SensorThink will not compete against established platforms like WMS, labor management system (LMS) or transportation management system (TMS) software, but rather will make it easy for warehouse managers to collect information and analyze it in ways they couldn't do before, he said. "Customer demands are stressing the warehousing sector because of the pace of change in retail," Peters said. "Amazon and e-commerce are changing the industry by offering next-day delivery, free shipping costs, and allowing customers to search the Internet for the lowest price. If you're not the leader, you're just going to fall farther behind Wal-Mart and Amazon." #Logistics #Software & Systems About the Author Ben Ames Senior Editor Ben Ames has spent 20 years as a journalist since starting out as a daily newspaper reporter in Pennsylvania in 1995.

Mnuchin says after the battle over health care, the administration will turn quickly to tax reform with the goal of getting a program approved by Congress by August 2017.

Some Republican lawmakers have warned that if the health bill fails, their goals of tax cuts could be imperiled. In February, Trump had promised a “phenomenal” tax plan within two or three weeks. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Friday said the White House will be taking the lead on pushing the tax overhaul — and that the president is working on that plan now. “When you see tax reform the first time, it will be the president’s plan and we’ll drive the debate on that,” Mulvaney said during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” After difficult negotiations on the health bill, Mnuchin said he thought the tax overhaul might go more smoothly. “Health care and tax reform are two different issues,” he said. “Health care is complicated, tax reform is a lot simpler in some ways.” Mnuchin has previously said tax legislation would be completed by Congress’s August recess. On Friday, he said he’s still optimistic about the August target, but signaled a tax overhaul by the fall may be more likely. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said the GOP is committed to an August deadline. Mnuchin expressed concern about a controversial provision that’s a centerpiece of Ryan’s tax plan — border adjustments, which would tax U.S. companies’ imports while exempting their exports. The issue — which opponents say would increase consumer prices — has divided Trump’s White House advisers, and the president hasn’t yet announced a position on it. Supporters say higher prices on imported goods would be offset over time by a strengthening dollar.

But if the currency moves that has an impact for our exporters,” Mnuchin said. “It’s a very complicated issue worth looking at carefully.” The House GOP plan calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Trump campaigned on a tax plan to reduce the rate to 15 percent. On Friday, Mnuchin said it was premature to speculate on what the exact corporate rate would be in Trump’s tax proposal. On the individual side, Mnuchin reiterated that Trump’s primary focus is a tax cut for middle-income Americans. The House health bill, which Trump endorsed, contains individual tax cuts of its own — but they’re focused on high earners. The bill would eliminate a 3.8 percent net investment income tax that was imposed by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, along with a 0.9 percent Medicare tax. Those levies apply only to single people with incomes above $200,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.

As I wrote about here, here and here, there was a clear recognition among attendees that they were suddenly operating in an environment that is very different than it was even a year ago, and to quote one presenter “the struggle to stay relevant” in this new world was a top concern. Following are 10 or fewer observations: Curbside Crush Meijer Inc., the Michigan institution headquartered at the conference’s home city in Grand Rapids, had a strong presence at the show. Meijer was in the news just last week for having expanded grocery home delivery through Shipt, an evolution from the curbside pickup option it launched in some stores in 2015. According to Peter Whitsett, EVP of merchandising and marketing at Meijer, that change has put a spotlight on the huge demand for convenience, and the challenge for the big retailer to wrestle it economically. “As retailers we’ve done a reasonably good job of managing price for products, but what we’re learning to do is managing price for service,” Whitsett said. When Meijer launched curbside, he said, “there were assumptions about incrementality. We thought this would be a fill-in trip. We were 180 degrees wrong. Customers said ‘do all my shopping for me.’ “Now you’ve got to run around a store that’s 200,000 square feet and our costs went up. So we raised the price and what happens? Customers said, ‘OK, I’ll order more.’ Our cost structure just continued to go up. So our ability to manage variable expense in the model has been a really interesting learn.” The Shipt partnership, it should be noted, limits selection to 55,000 grocery SKUs and provides a personal touch of workers who bring orders not to the door but the kitchen counter. “This is stretching our ability to say we’re not only a retailer of goods, but we’re a retailer of services,” Whitsett said. “I think this whole notion of relationship, and personalization, and our ability to learn how to price for service, and not just goods, is going to lead to success.” What you want to be when you grow up The presence of current students, and WMU food management graduates like Sam’s Club consumables VP Trent Weller — class of 1995, and recipient of the conference’s annual distinguished alumni award — further imbued a sense that change was afoot. A speaker urged industry attendees to ask students what apps they were using, and that led to my downloading Flipp, an aggregator of food retail circulars which if nothing else, ought to boost my investigative productivity. My completely unscientific poll of the students I met indicated an even split between those who aspired to work for retailers vs. those who hoped to be hired by a CPG company, which would indicate — observationally anyway — retail’s profile has gained a little since I last wrote about this topic several years ago. Things change. One student said she didn’t particularly care whether it was a retailer or a supplier she went to work for, as long as she could do analytics, which seemed to me like a pretty good career decision already. Surveying the new landscape Part of the change people kept talking about was impact on the physical landscape now that e-commerce and mobile technology are stitched into how people shop. When sales go virtual, does store location matter? Maybe not as much as we once thought, according to a report by the Coca-Cola Research Council, presented at the event. Judy Spires, CEO of Kings and Balducci’s, said that insight highlighted the importance of meeting other consumer needs. “You really have to have a compelling value proposition – give people what they need, when the want it, the way they want it,” Spires said. “That’s different from, ‘C’mon down, Mom, and see our A-1 location.’” Larry Levin, EVP of business development at IRI, noted that the omnichannel world would shift sales of supermarket goods — edibles and non-edibles — to the online channel at different speeds, with edibles generally slower to move, but moving all the same. According to IRI’s figures, the multi-outlet retailers controlling 98.6% of the market for such goods in 2015 will see their share dip to 95% in 2020 and to 89.9% by 2022. By then, 3.5% of edible share — and 6.5% of non-edibles — will belong to e-commerce. Who would that effect? Gigantic stores like Meijer for one. In general, superstores like Walmart, Meijer and Target will grow even more slowly than traditional supermarkets going forward, Kantar Retail’s Bryan Gildenberg noted. Although both those formats, along with drugstores, will lag growth among club stores, discount stores and convenience stores. Microcosm Microbrew Away from the show I visited the home of a retail phenomenon: Founders Brewery. The Grand Rapids-based brewer made a local reputation on flavorful, high-alcohol brews that sparked the craft craze, but found nationwide success behind an innovative twist: A lighter, lower-alcohol interpretation of India Pale Ale pioneering a category today known as “session IPAs.” Your store probably sells a lot of Founders’ All Day IPA today, which cleverly bridged a gap between that big group of domestic beer drinkers turned off by aggressive craft styles, and craft enthusiasts who want easy-drinking authenticity — all at the relative value of the “brewer’s dozen” 15-pack in which its sold, also a Founders innovation. Hip but accessible, unique packaging, value: It’s a trend in liquid form.

(Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News) 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Brad Galli thought it was a clever idea. Jim Harbaugh likes his khakis, and Galli likes his, too — yet somehow, Galli, a sports reporter at the local ABC affiliate (Channel 7, WXYZ), wore more-pricey pants than Harbaugh, who makes more than $9 million a year. So last September, during his weekly sitdown with Harbaugh, Galli gifted Michigan’s football coach a different brand of khakis to try out. And wouldn’t you know, they’ve stuck. “I’ll never wear anything else,” Harbaugh told ESPN on Friday, at Michigan’s Pro Day in Ann Arbor. (Mobile users, watch the Galli-Harbaugh interaction HERE.) The new pants are Lululemon brand, which retail for more than $100. They’re considered much more fashionable, and they fit better than Harbaugh’s old go-tos, $8 khakis from Walmart. Galli got the idea for the gift from late Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell, who used to present his guests Florsheim shoes. “I wear them every day,” said Galli, whose wife, Claire, a volleyball coach at Oakland, recently got him several pairs of different-colored options as a gift. “The pants really are great.” tpaul@detroitnews.com twitter.com/tonypaul1984 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS UM's Maurice Hurst on making a mess 0:11 UM DC Don Brown on trying different personnel options 0:33 Clarkston's Dan Fife on winning the state title 2:26 Clarkston's Foster Loyer after state title win over GR Christian 1:51 Xavier Tillman on state title loss to Clarkston 1:30 Blashill disappointed by Wings first period 0:15 Abdelkader on the Red Wings' slow start 0:31 Wilton Speight on Pep Hamilton 0:20 Yzerman recalls fond memories of Joe Louis Arena 5:49 Chris Wormley on what he wanted to prove 0:24

By Emily Bary March 24, 2017 1:02 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Nearly a quarter of U.S. adults have an Amazon credit card, a new report says. Photo: iStockphoto Credit card issuers are dialing up the perks to gain new customers and get them to spend more. You’d think that might be good news for retailers across the board, but, go figure, Amazon.com is reaping the rewards. (The e-commerce giant upped the cash-back bonus for Prime members on its co-branded Chase card earlier this year.) More from Barron’s Next Et tu, Costco? Is There Any Hope for Bricks-and-Mortar Retail? 2-Hour Deliveries? Amazon Can Spend Big Bucks to Make It Happen The Case for Spending $550 on AmEx’s Platinum Card A new Morgan Stanley report shows that Amazon already has an impressive share of store-branded credit cards, with more gains in store. This “is likely to drive more consumer dollars toward Amazon and away from other retailers,” Morgan Stanley’s analyst team wrote in its report. According to a Morgan Stanley AlphaWise survey, 23% of U.S. adults have Amazon cards – tied with Wal-Mart. Plus, 13% of those who don’t have Amazon cards indicated that they were “very likely” to sign up for one. “We see this as an additional risk for the retail industry that we believe is not particularly well known by investors,” the report says. “For Amazon, we see the company wielding its latest card to deepen the moat around Prime, capture greater wallet share and give its Prime members more reasons to spend on Amazon.” That’s probably the last thing Amazon’s competitors want to hear. Big Picture: More U.S. adults have Amazon credit cards than they do cards for any other single retailer, and that’s further trouble for bricks-and-mortar stores, a new report says.

(Mike Mulholland | MLive.com) Print Email Matt Durr | mattdurr@mlive.com By Matt Durr | mattdurr@mlive.com MLive.com Follow on Twitter on March 24, 2017 at 12:50 PM, updated March 24, 2017 at 12:57 PM comments ANN ARBOR, MI -- No other coach in any sport around the world garners more interest about his pants than Jim Harbaugh. Fans have flocked to retailers both in store and online to buy tan colored khakis as they attempt to recreate his signature game day look. Capturing that authentic Jim Harbaugh look may have just got a bit more expensive however as the coach told a reporter Friday that he recently switched to a Lululemon pant. Just had a nice chat w/ Jim Harbaugh about his khaki game. He upgraded to @lululemon pants and says, "I'll never wear anything else." Smart. pic.twitter.com/uDny4Ceqc8 -- Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) March 24, 2017 Harbaugh made the statement while meeting with reporters at the University of Michigan's pro day and its first day of spring practice.  Along with the khaki pants, a baseball hat fitted with the iconic "Block M" on the front and a sweater featuring the logo have become synonymous with Harbaugh. The look has become a Halloween favorite of some fans, while retailers like The M Den market the authentic look in their stores. But for true authenticity, the Lululemon pants might be harder for some people to purchase as they retail online for $128 a pair. "These lightweight, tailored pants are perfect when there's a dress code and you're in a jeans and tee state of mind," reads a description of the pants on the company website. That's quite the difference when compared to the reported $8 khakis Harbaugh bought at a Walmart in 2014. Lululemon was founded in Vancouver in 1998, according to the company website. "Our vision for our store was to create more than a place where people could get gear to sweat in, we wanted to create a community hub where people could learn and discuss the physical aspects of healthy living, mindfulness and living a life of possibility," reads a portion of the company website.

just-style home News & insights News US Q4 in brief – The Finish Line, Oxford Industries, Shoe Carnival By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 24 March 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent fourth-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Destination XL moved to a profit but booked lower sales, while Caleres moved to a loss in the quarter. VF Corporation, meanwhile, revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the quarter, while Stein Mart moved to a loss as a result of "aggressive" promotions.  The Finish Line Athletic footwear and apparel retailer The Finish Line said its fourth-quarter earnings performance represented a disappointing finish to a financially challenging year for the company, with net sales falling 0.4% year-on-year to US$557.5m. Same-store sales decreased 4.5%. In the 13 weeks to 25 February, the company made a loss of $9.5m, compared to net income of $4m in the year-ago period. Despite this, CEO Sam Sato said the company is confident that the numerous operational improvements it has made throughout the past year have created a "more efficient company with a stronger foundation to support enhanced profitability and increased shareholder value over the long-term." Oxford Industries Oxford Industries booked a mixed fourth-quarter as it saw earnings tumble on charges and sales edge up. In the three months ended 28 January, earnings dropped to US$10m from $17.5m a year earlier. The company incurred $7.1m of charges associated with inventory markdowns, severance and closing three outlet locations related to actions to improve the operating performance of its Tommy Bahama brand. Gross margin was 42 basis points higher at 56.2%, while consolidated net sales increased to $261m compared to $259.6m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Shoe Carnival Show carnival has moved to a net loss of US$920,000 in its fourth-quarter from earnings of $4.2m a year earlier as a result of non-cash impairment charges. Gross profit margin narrowed to 27.5% from 29.2%, while net sales edged up $0.5m, or 0.2%, to $234.2m. Comparable store sales were down 1.2%. CEO Cliff Sifford, said: "We believe the strong athletic footwear cycle we experienced during the year will continue into 2017 and we are pleased with the early results from our casual sandal footwear." PVH Corp Apparel giant PVH Corp said it was "very pleased" with its fourth quarter results, which exceeded both sales and earnings guidance, despite seeing a 25.1% drop in net income to US$100.5m from $134.2m in the year ago period. For the quarter ended 29 January, revenue of US$2.1bn was flat compared to the prior year period. PVH's Tommy Hilfiger business recorded the highest growth at 3% to $932m, while Calvin Klein revenues fell 1% to $795m. Meanwhile,Heritage Brands' sales decreased 5% to $381m. CEO Emanuel Chirico said: "We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which exceeded both our sales and earnings guidance despite the volatile macroeconomic environment and the highly promotional retail market in the US. We continued to demonstrate strong momentum in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it saw "solid progress" on its strategic plan in the fourth quarter, which led to sales growth in its core global brands, expansion in gross margin and earnings in line with guidance. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$9m, compared to a loss of $17.7m in the year-ago period.   Gross margin expanded 150 basis points to 38.7% from 37.2%, while total sales dropped 4.7% to $204.2m from $214.4m last year.

CEO John Walbrecht, said: "While we still faced foreign exchange headwinds and margin constraints due to our manufacturing repatriation, demand for climbing and mountain products remained strong. We also continued to experience growing momentum in our direct-to-consumer and independent global distributor businesses, as both channels continue to grow in the strong double-digits."

In Europe, net revenues were up 13%, while in both the Americas and Asia net revenues declined 1%.

Record net sales, record gross margins, record operating income, expanded operating margin, and record net income reflect our powerful brand portfolio, robust operational platforms and disciplined prioritisation of investments."

However total comparable sales were flat, but were up 2% at the Urban Outfitters brand and 1.2% at Free People. Comparable sales decreased 2.9% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by lower retail store comparable net sales.

The Moto G5 Plus is official for March 31 in the US. We already talked about the screaming deals on it you can get at Amazon if you are cool with some Amazon ads, but the phone is available at numerous other retailers. You’ll be able to buy this new mid-tier value beast at places like Best Buy, Fry’s, NewEgg, Target, and even Walmart. Just like at Amazon, the Moto G5 Plus starts at $229 with 2GB RAM and 32GB storage, but you can double that goodness to 4GB RAM and 64GB storage for $299. We’ll review the Moto G5 Plus eventually, but on paper it sure looks like a heck of a value. For more, including specs, hit up this post. If you’d like to pre-order right away, there are plenty of links below.  Moto G5 Links: Motorola Best Buy Newegg B&H Photo Post navigation Previous StoryHere’s the Movado Connect, Available This Fall Next StoryGoogle Releases More Details on the Death of SMS in Hangouts M3D1T8R Just waiting to find out if wifi hotspot works out of the box on Verizon (grandfathered Unlimited data) like it does with my current G4. If so, I might upgrade for the battery life improvement and smaller size. Just wish it had USB-C. NFC isn’t a deal breaker but couldn’t hurt. Meanwhile…just preordered a Zenfone 3 Zoom for the very nice price of $329. Should be the new battery life king. 5Ah. Also it has OLED, USB-C, good camera. Still no NFC but everything else a plus vs my current ZTE Blade V8 Pro, should make it worth the extra $100. As long as the UI isn’t awful, it should beat out the similarly priced Moto Z Play by a good margin. Same goes for the G5 Plus but it works on Verizon. RustyDroidFan How do you think this would be compared to the older Moto X Pure? M3D1T8R Should be a really good upgrade. Performance at least as good. Battery life at least double. Destiny’s Paw Register at Lenovo dot com for a e-coupon. YW… DanSan so moto z play vs moto g5 plus? Jeff Stevens not a bad phone i am considering it but seems to me the price should be $279.99 or lower due to no nfc or the ability to create your own like on the g4 plus santy83 Wish the display was at least 5.5″ but then it would eat into sales of Z Play. Daniel J. Peters While I wish it had NFC, the reality is that I never use the NFC chip in my MXPE anyway.

Nengmy Vang, 45, is the man police believe committed the shootings, according to multiple people with knowledge of Vang’s involvement. Police at a Thursday afternoon press briefing declined to name Vang or say exactly what motivated the killings, except to say it was a “domestic incident” involving a husband and wife. The husband had targeted the wife in the shootings, but she escaped unharmed, said Jason Smith, deputy administrator of the state Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation. Vang is seeking to divorce his 41-year-old wife of more than two decades. He called the marriage “irretrievably broken” in a court filing obtained by USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin. The couple has at least six kids. (Weston, WI)  —  The 45-year-old suspect in the Marathon County shooting rampage which left four people dead this week is being treated for non-fatal wounds and remains in a hospital.  The name of the Weston man has not been officially released.  The four shooting victims have been identified as Everest Metro Police Detective Jason Weiland, Marathon Savings Bank employees Dianne Look and Karen Barclay, and attorney Sara Quirt Sann.  Investigators say the shooter was motivated by a domestic incident and wasn’t trying to rob the bank.  The domestic violence victim was not injured.   Thursday morning at about 8:30, a female subject requested a Rusk County deputy to stop at the Express Mart on Main Street, Bruce to take a complaint of a fake $20 bill. According to the police log, they took it a couple weeks ago and the bank notified them that it was fake. An Officer from the Eau Claire Police Department called the Express Mart and advised they think they have the subject in custody that was using the fake 20 dollar bills. No other information was available. The Rusk County Sheriff’s Office late Thursday afternoon received a theft complaint. According to the report, a female subject reported the theft of 2 pieces of culvert at a location on Broken Arrow Road. One was 10 feet and one was 20 feet long. The culverts were reportedly stolen from the ditch sometime Wednesday night. Shortly after 6 PM Thursday, a male subject advised the Rusk County Sheriff’s Office that a second male subject stole a bunch of tools from him after that subject fired him from the job. The complainant advised that some of the crew stated that the suspect admitted to taking the tools and was wanting to sell them. The theft reportedly happened at a job site in Rusk County. The case is under investigation. Thursday Ladysmith Police were called to the Ladysmith High School for a theft complaint. After an investigation, Zachary D. Wiles, 18 was cited by a City Officer for theft of money from another student. Ladysmith Police Thursday afternoon were notified that Kristen N. Popp, 21, was a Walmart and had an active Warrant. A City Officer and Rusk County deputies arrived at Walmart and located Popp. She was escorted to the squad car where she was arrested and transported to the Rusk County jail. At 1:15 AM this (Friday) morning, a City Officer was called in to go to RCMH to sit with Dalton James Krueger, 24 until he was medically cleared. According to the report, Krueger was brought into RCMH via ambulance for medical problem. After finding Krueger was smoking Methamphetamine, Probation placed a hold on him. After Krueger was medically cleared, he was arrested and transported to the Rusk County jail. (Madison, WI)  —  The Legislative Fiscal Bureau projects a larger structural deficit for Governor Scott Walker’s proposed budget than previously thought.  The figure released Thursday was nearly one-point-one billion dollars.  The previous estimate from Walker’s office was about 740-million.  Wisconsin lawmakers would have to erase that deficit when they put the 2019-to-2021 budget together.  Leaders of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee have questioned the spending approach in the past.  The final budget will have to be balanced because that is required under the state Constitution.

GameStop reported Thursday that hardware sales declined 29.1 percent, and new software sales fell by 19.3 percent for the quarter — two categories that were once key in boosting revenue for the retailer. The Texas-based company said fiscal fourth-quarter global sales decreased 13.6 percent to $3.05 billion, while consolidated comparable sales — a metric monitored closely for retail companies by Wall Street — declined 16.3 percent, falling in line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. In 2017, GameStop said it expects to close between 2 to 3 percent of its global store footprint, a sign that traffic at its brick-and-mortar locations has slowed. The company also said Thursday that its video game category has become "weak." "The fourth quarter [ended Jan. 28] was significantly impacted by ... aggressive console promotions by other retailers on Thanksgiving [Day] and Black Friday," the company wrote in its earnings release. GameStop is facing more competition from big-box retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart, and e-commerce giant Amazon. Moving forward, GameStop will no longer provide quarterly earnings nor same-store-sales guidance, Chief Financial Officer Rob Llyod said in a statement. "We believe that providing only annual guidance will reduce investor distraction as we continue to diversify the company and seek to maximize long-term shareholder value," Lloyd said. On Thursday, GameStop reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.38 per share, topping a Thomson Reuters estimate of $2.28, but coming in 2 cents lower than the same period one year ago. With Friday's steep declines, shares of GameStop are down more than 30 percent over the past 12 months and are down more than 18 percent year-to-date. Shares closed the down around $20 per share, far below an all-time intraday high of $63.77 reached in 2007 but nowhere near an all-time intraday low of $3.75 per share, which occurred in 2003.

Pierre Obendrauf / Montreal Gazette Share Adjust Comment Print Related Bill Zacharkiw's Wines of the Week: March 24, 2017 Talk of privatizing the Société des alcools du Québec is nothing new, but it has heated up recently. Finance Minister Carlos Leitao has said the government is studying all possibilities regarding Quebec liquor sales. This followed the publication of two studies: one by a commission chaired by former politician Lucienne Robillard, and the other by auditor general Guylaine Leclerc.  Both reports criticized the SAQ for its lack of efficiency, which hurts its profitability and ability to pass on savings to consumers. The Robillard commission suggested “eliminating the monopoly of the SAQ and opening the door to competition would directly benefit consumers.” Another recent study, by the HEC’s Centre for Productivity and Prosperity, found that, “since the late 1980s, the SAQ has considerably increased the dividends it remits annually to the government, but its productivity has not improved. … Hence the government has not maximized its return on the SAQ’s operations.” I doubt anyone will be surprised to learn that a government monopoly was found to be inefficient. In fairness, the SAQ has taken some steps to address the problem. Since last April, 280 administrative jobs have been eliminated. The head office and distribution centre are being centralized. And there’s a push on online sales.  Result? Consumers have seen prices reduced three times in the the past year. What remains to be seen is whether the SAQ can maintain or maybe even increase its dividend to the government, which last year amounted to more than $1 billion. The bigger question, however, is this: What are the pros and cons of changing the way alcohol is sold in Quebec? Few critics of the monopoly demand outright privatization, but rather “liberalization” by opening the market to other retailers — similar to what Alberta did in the early 1990s. Under this model, the government retains control of the wholesale sector and allows competition at the retail level. A tax or charge is levied on all sales to help fill government coffers. This would allow the Quebec government to alter the way wine is sold in the province without the risk of having its monopoly challenged by the World Trade Organization. It’s a touchy subject: British Columbia’s recent decision to allow B.C. wineries to sell through grocery stores is being challenged by the European Union, United States, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia. According to lawyer Mark Hicken, who runs winelaw.ca, “if a province decided to retain control of the wholesale level, it could do so as long as it treated imported and domestic products the same.” But would allowing other retailers mean better prices for consumers? Probably not. Quebecers already pay some of the cheapest prices in Canada, even when compared to “free market” Alberta, which I have found to be more expensive. Would selection be better? Well, consider this: Between what’s available at the SAQ and via private import, Quebecers have access to more than 25,000 different alcohol products each year. The hitch, though, is that private import wines have been available only by the case. The SAQ says it plans to have all these wines available by the bottle on SAQ.com in two to three years. So do we really need even more selection? The answer, for the majority of Quebecers, is probably no. What would and must change, however, is access. As it stands, dépanneurs and grocery stores can sell only wines that are bottled in Quebec. Allowing them to stock their shelves with quality wines would be a definite benefit to consumers. Would service be better? Most Quebecers, I think, are pretty satisfied now. The causal drinker is well served at the SAQ, which continues to maintain a presence outside major city centres. The vast majority of wine sold in Quebec is under $20. While I can’t say for sure, with its “taste tags” and basic employee training, the SAQ would continue to do a better job serving clients than, say, a Costco or Walmart. However, the big difference would be for informed consumers. It is unreasonable for even the most passionate SAQ wine advisor to have more than cursory knowledge of even 1,000 wines, let alone thousands. If, for example, a wine agency set up its own store, it would offer much more detailed information about each wine. There could even be specialty stores for organic wines and other niche products.  I admit I dream of having access to this type of store. I don’t need a choice of 10,000 or 20,000 wines. But I would love to find a small store that fits my tastes, and can respond to my questions. For now, though, this is all just a discussion. Pro-liberalization critic Marc-André Gagnon of VinQuebec.com, who has created a number of discussion points on the subject, told me the government has carried out in-depth studies of various scenarios, but has not made them public. I have no idea if we are moving toward a new liquor retailing landscape in Quebec. But I bet that until the government figures out how it can make more money by changing things, it will remain a dream, at least for some Quebecers. *** Your turn to taste … with yours truly. I will be leading a tasting called “démystifier le vin blanc” at Dock 619 in Longueuil on April 5. Seven white wines will be served, along with perfectly matched food, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., at 619 rue le Breton. Price: $85 plus tax (service is included). Lots of free parking.

 The biggest underdog left in the NCAA Tournament burned the calendar during a slump — and they say it sparked their run Scott Davis Mar. 24, 2017, 10:32 AM 1,279 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ben Margot/AP Xavier has become this year's Cinderella team in the NCAA Tournament. The 11th-seeded team has beaten Maryland, third-seeded Florida State, and on Thursday, second-seeded Arizona to advance to the Elite Eight. An 11th-seed making the Elite Eight is rare enough, but for this Xavier team, the run has been particularly unlikely because of a slump they were going through just one month ago. According to ESPN's Jeff Borzello, in February, Xavier had lost five in a row at the end of February, going 3-5 in the month, and starting point guard Edmond Summer was lost for the season with a torn ACL. The team knew they needed to do something to break out of the slump. "We sat in one of those infamous staff meetings and tried to figure out how to turn the page," head coach Chris Mack told Borzello. The team came up with burning the calendar to put February in the past. They decided to take it a step further. "'Let's not just burn it. Let's keep the ashes, buy an urn,' Mack told his staff." "The coaches went onto Walmart's website looking for urns, something none of them had ever done. They sent graduate assistant Allen Payne out to the store to pick one up, but the one they wanted wasn't available anymore. So they settled on a jar that wasn't technically an urn, but it was glass, and you can see inside of it. It would suffice." Furthermore, the team then created a February calendar for each player, with the scores of their losses that month. The players privately wrote down something they would do to help the team on the back of the calendar, then they burned them in an aluminum trash can. They were putting February behind them. The "urn" still remains today, holding the ashes of February. Here's a picture, via Borzello. A jar of ashes in the locker room helped save Xavier's season #Sweet16 #MarchMadness https://t.co/dqKq0sbKj7 pic.twitter.com/aoCDMXR75W — Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) March 24, 2017 Though the team lost the next game, they're 5-1 since that loss, not including their tournament run. "We just wanted our guys to constantly have a reminder, no matter where we went," Mack said. "During practice, managers put it out on the scorers table. We wanted our urn to go with us. So our players were forward-thinking and not worried about what happened." The jar will surely be with them when they take on No. 1 seed Gonzaga in the Elite Eight on Saturday.

just-style home News & insights News US Q4 in brief – The Finish Line, Oxford Industries, Shoe Carnival By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 24 March 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent fourth-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Destination XL moved to a profit but booked lower sales, while Caleres moved to a loss in the quarter. VF Corporation, meanwhile, revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the quarter, while Stein Mart moved to a loss as a result of "aggressive" promotions.  The Finish Line Athletic footwear and apparel retailer The Finish Line said its fourth-quarter earnings performance represented a disappointing finish to a financially challenging year for the company, with net sales falling 0.4% year-on-year to US$557.5m. Same-store sales decreased 4.5%. In the 13 weeks to 25 February, the company made a loss of $9.5m, compared to net income of $4m in the year-ago period. Despite this, CEO Sam Sato said the company is confident that the numerous operational improvements it has made throughout the past year have created a "more efficient company with a stronger foundation to support enhanced profitability and increased shareholder value over the long-term." Oxford Industries Oxford Industries booked a mixed fourth-quarter as it saw earnings tumble on charges and sales edge up. In the three months ended 28 January, earnings dropped to US$10m from $17.5m a year earlier. The company incurred $7.1m of charges associated with inventory markdowns, severance and closing three outlet locations related to actions to improve the operating performance of its Tommy Bahama brand. Gross margin was 42 basis points higher at 56.2%, while consolidated net sales increased to $261m compared to $259.6m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.

CEO John Walbrecht, said: "While we still faced foreign exchange headwinds and margin constraints due to our manufacturing repatriation, demand for climbing and mountain products remained strong. We also continued to experience growing momentum in our direct-to-consumer and independent global distributor businesses, as both channels continue to grow in the strong double-digits."

VF Corporation US apparel giant VF Corporation revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016. Net income fell 15% to US$264.3m in the three months to December, from $312.2m the year before. As a result of the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $98m in 2016, which also includes the operating results of the businesses, net of tax. Gross margin improved 90 basis points to a record 49.1% on a reported basis, while total revenues were relatively flat at $3.32 from $3.33. Brand revenue at Vans was up 14% and by 4% at Timberland, but fell 8% at The North Face. For fiscal 2017, VF Corp is forecasting revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate. Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade says it is exploring and evaluating "strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value" as it revealed higher fourth-quarter earnings and sales. Net earnings reached US$87m in the three months to the end of December from $62m a year earlier. Gross margin, however, narrowed to 59.2% from 60.2%, while net sales were up 9.8% to $471m. Direct-to-consumer comparable sales growth reached 9.3%. For the full year, earnings jumped to $153.6m from $17.1m, while net sales climbed 11.2% to $1.38bn. Rocky Brands Rocky Brands has moved to a loss in both its fourth-quarter and full-year, after incurring non-cash impairment charges. Despite this, CEO Mike Brooks said he is "confident" the changes to the company's operating strategies and leadership team has made it a stronger organisation that will return greater value to its shareholders over the long-term. For the three months ended 31 December, Rocky Brands reported a net loss of US$0.6m from earnings of $1.4m in the year ago period. Excluding charges, the company recorded earnings of $1.3m. Sales, meanwhile, increased 2.6% to $67m. Wholesale sales declined 8.9% to $42.4m, while retail sales edged up to $13.7m from $13.5m. Gross margin dropped 140 basis points to 32.5%. For the full year, net losses amounted to $2.1m from earnings of $6.6m in 2015. Excluding charges, the company made earnings of $0.6m. Sales decreased 3.4% to $260.3m. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase slightly in the fourth quarter, up 1% to US$1.29bn from $1.28bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 27 November, net income slipped to $96m, down 5% from $101m last year. The decline reflected investments associated with the expansion of company-operated stores network and e-commerce, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 50.7% from 51.2%. In Europe, net revenues were up 13%, while in both the Americas and Asia net revenues declined 1%. "We are pleased to report our fourth consecutive year of profitable constant currency revenue growth behind the strength of the Levi's brand and our global direct-to-consumer business," said Chip Bergh, president CEO. "Looking ahead, although it remains a very challenging environment, given our diversified portfolio we remain optimistic about our long term prospects for growth." Columbia Sportswear Columbia Sportswear has revealed record four-quarter net sales of US$717.4m, a 3% increase compared with net sales of $699.4m last year. Net income also reached record levels, up 34% to $84.7m from $63.4m in the year ago period. For the full year, Columbia also booked record sales and earnings, with net sales up 2% to $2.38bn and net income reaching $191.9m, a 10% increase on fiscal 2015. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 4%, and net income of between $192m and $200m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "We are very proud of our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance against a challenging backdrop in many of our largest markets. Record net sales, record gross margins, record operating income, expanded operating margin, and record net income reflect our powerful brand portfolio, robust operational platforms and disciplined prioritisation of investments." Skechers  Despite achieving new fourth-quarter and full-year net sales records, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip by more than three quarters in the three months ended 31 December. Sales in the quarter were up 5.8% to US$764.3m on last year, but the company reported an earnings decline of 77.4% to $6.7m. For the full year, net sales increased 13.2% to $3.56bn on last year, while earnings reached $243.5m, compared to $231.9m at the end of 2015. For the first quarter of 2017, the company expects net sales in the range of $1.05bn to $1.08bn. Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters has delivered "record" fourth-quarter sales, growing 2% to US$1.03bn. However total comparable sales were flat, but were up 2% at the Urban Outfitters brand and 1.2% at Free People. Comparable sales decreased 2.9% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by lower retail store comparable net sales. Net income meanwhile, slipped 12.2% to $64m from $72.9m in the year-ago period. For the full year, total company net sales increased to $3.5bn or 3% over the prior year. Comparable sales increased 1%. Net income fell 2.9% to $218m, versus $224.5bn last year. Tweet Citi Trends appoints CFO Smith as acting CEO PREVIOUS Top stories this week on just-style...

My girlfriend (now my wife), a writer friend and I were following the Natchez Trace, an ancient route that had been turned into a national park, a strip of unbroken green stretching 400 miles south. As I drove, the modern world of gas stations and strip malls fell away, and it seemed to me that I was travelling back into a yellow-hued past. It was beautiful, but at the same time faintly threatening, like several moments on that trip: the Disney castle that loomed up over a dark forest and revealed itself as a chemical plant; the electrical storm on the horizon as we pulled into a motel. In the rural south, the three of us stuck out like a sore thumb. We were the set-up for a bad joke: an Asian woman, a white woman and a non-specific brown man walk into a bar… More than once we brought a place of business to a halt. I remember a gas station with a diner counter where a row of men in hunting camo stopped spooning eggs into their mouths just to watch me pay for a soda. There was a diner in Clarksdale run by a Lebanese family (flag on the wall, tabouleh and hummus on the menu after the usual “American” items) where the waitress leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, “New York?”, as if making contact on behalf of the super-secret immigrant-welcoming committee. Soon we left Mississippi behind, but the place was firmly lodged in my imagination: the signs of the Baptist churches raining hellfire on passing motorists, the empty bottles of Four Roses bourbon at the William Faulkner House, the Spanish moss hanging from the trees. Even before that journey I’d been caught up in the music. Modern Mississippi (the part that isn’t buying Faith Hill records) bumps along to trap and bass, nodding its head to Gucci Mane or the Jackson rapper Big KRIT, but I had got mixed up in a style that seems to have been consigned to heritage tourism: the country blues. The blues has become a hollowed-out shorthand in advertising: man on porch with harmonica, droplet running down bottle If I say it’s almost impossible to hear the blues now, that’s not because it’s unavailable, quite the opposite. In every city in America (and most others around the world) there is a half-empty bar where a middle-aged man with a ponytail is yodelling about how he woke up this morning and got down on his knees. Young baby boomers fell in love with the blues, and made their taste global. In England, skinny young rock musicians like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones studied the old songs, then sold them back to America with extra heaviness. John Bonham’s massive booming drums on When The Levee Breaks weren’t recorded anywhere near a levee, but in the hall of a Hampshire country house. Though the height of its popularity was 50 years ago, in the popular imagination the blues still stands for authenticity. But since authenticity is catnip to capital, the blues has become a visual shorthand in advertising: a tastefully blown-out shot of a sharecropper sitting on a porch playing a harmonica, cut with a water droplet running down the flank of a beer bottle. It’s hard to think of another kind of music that has been so thoroughly hollowed out. But it is extraordinary music, if you can really hear it. I’ve been making playlists of songs originally recorded on 78rpm shellac discs in the years before the second world war, songs that sounded like the work of ghosts. The voices of the old singers were distant in time, muffled by crackle and hiss, and yet somehow immediate. I started scribbling lists of names in my notebook, fingerpicking guitarists, men from the Mississippi hills who played fife and drums. Inevitably, I started writing a novel, if only as a pretext for my obsession. A couple of years after my first short trip, I went back, following a meandering path dictated by fragments of old lyrics and the life stories of musicians. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hari Kunzru at Dockery Farm, a Mississippi blues mecca. Photograph: Hari Kunzru One morning I drove through heavy rain towards the river, near a place called Rosedale. “Lord, I’m going to Rosedale, going to take my rider by my side,” sings Robert Johnson, who’s making his way through towns and women in Traveling Riverside Blues. The “rider” is from Friars Point, a little farther upriver, near the Stovall plantation where Muddy Waters was still an unknown tractor driver. She has gold teeth and “a mortgage on my body, now, and a lien on my soul”. Rosedale today is a scatter of one-storey houses and cabins. On Main Street there’s a bank, a courthouse and an old cafe selling hot tamales. Johnson must have stopped in places like that, because another of his girls (“she long and tall, she sleeps in the kitchen with her feets in the hall”) sells them “two for a nickel… four for a dime”. The tamale is a Mississippi delta curiosity. Shucks of corn, filled with ground meat and cornmeal, wrapped up with twine into skinny little parcels of steaming fragrant paste. I order them by the half-dozen, by the dozen; smother them in cheese and slather them in hot sauce. Most people argue that they were brought by Mexican migrants who worked the cotton fields in the early 20th century. A few say that tamales are far older, a trace of the maize-based agriculture of the mound-building Native Americans who once lived on the river. Stories abound of drunken fights and bluesmen playing to patrons who would tread on your corpse to get to the bar The mounds, and the memory of the people who built them almost 1,000 years ago, are one of the many ghostly traces on the Mississippi landscape. Downriver from Rosedale, at Winterville, I walked around the base of one of these mysterious constructions, part of a culture that had disappeared by 1500. “Big” Bill Broonzy used to tell a tall story about his birth, claiming it took place during the great Mississippi flood of 1893. His parents (and their 15 other children) had fled to the top of a “Choctaw mound”, possibly even this one. There his mother went into labour, after his father had gone off in a rowing boat to get help. You can be very close to the Mississippi river and still not see it. The reason is the levee, a huge mound of earth raised to prevent flooding. Not until you walk up on top do you witness the great sluggish beast making its way down to the Gulf. Since European colonisation, engineers have been battling to stop the Mississippi spreading itself out across the delta in times of heavy rain. As I stood on the levee near the river port of Greenville, the rain was falling hard and the Mississippi was rushing on in a great brown muddy torrent. I retreated to my car and spent the night in a motel on a strip of fast-food restaurants on the highway, listening to the sound of eight inches of rain falling on the state. I woke to discover that rivers and creeks had overtopped their banks, washing away roads and killing at least one person, a little girl swept into a storm drain. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Johnson singing Me And The Devil The National Weather Service classified this as “minor to moderate” flooding. The great flood of 1927 was one of the most destructive in the history of the US: 27,000 square miles were inundated, leaving some parts of the delta 30ft underwater. You can hear its impact in the blues. Charley Patton found “high water everywhere”, which drove him from one place to another, frantically looking for shelter. “The water in Greenville and Leland, Lord, it done rose everywhere,/ I would go down to Rosedale but they tell me there’s water there.” Two hundred thousand people were displaced in Mississippi, most of them farm workers and their families. “It’s raining, it has been for nights and days./ Thousand people stands on the hill, looking down where they used to stay,” sings Barbecue Bob, who is “sitting here looking at all of this mud,/ And my gal got washed away in that Mississippi flood”. The flood had a wider impact on the lives of the black people of the delta. The federal response was to institute a massive programme of levee reconstruction, some of it using forced labour. The Mississippi levee camps were some of the roughest places in the south. Gangs worked from sun-up to sundown (traditionally “from can see to can’t” or just “from can to can’t”), wheeling barrows of earth and driving mule teams. Some men were free, others convicts, working off fines. Conditions were primitive. Bosses were armed and drove the workers hard. Cholera was rife. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bluesmen Robert Johnson (on left) and Johnny Shines, circa 1935. Photograph: Robert Johnson Estate/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Near the camps, women set up their own tents, washing clothes and selling sex. “Men on the levee hollering whoa and gee,/ Women in the levee camp hollering who wants me,” sang the Texan Gene Campbell. Stories abound of drunken fights in camp jukes and barrelhouses, where bluesmen would play to patrons so inured to violence, it was said they’d tread on your corpse to get to the bar. Many blues lyrics are based on levee camp hollers, work chants that could contain everything from gossip (“That woman ain’t nothing but a downtown money waster”) to advice on when it’s safest to ask for wages from a psychopathic boss (“Oh, boys, if you want to go down to Mr Charlie and don’t get hurt,/ go down Monday morning when the boys are at work,/ you’ll be alright”) and the broken-down condition of the draft animals (“Lord, I walked around the whole corral,/ couldn’t find a mule with his shoulder well”), which at times made it impossible for them to pull a load. Inland from Rosedale is the monotonous landscape of the delta, flat agricultural land that in the 20s and 30s was devoted to highly profitable large-scale cotton farming. I drove through it under a lowering sky. The fields were full of standing water. At first it was a place where the majority of landowners were black; but by 1890 black people had been disenfranchised and a systematic pattern of lynchings had driven out most of the former owners and put their land firmly in the hands of white people. In the interwar period, it was known as a racy, modern place, where people went to work on large farms like Dockery’s, the plantation where Charley Patton used to play to the pickers on payday. No one else wanted to look at the old plantation in the rain, so I walked around the outbuildings on my own. At its height, the place had supported 2,000 black workers, who were paid in farm currency or scrip, tying them to the place. No wonder it was so glamorous to be a rambler, a rounder, able to move around freely. In Me And The Devil, Robert Johnson (often to be found around Dockery’s) cheerfully greets Satan, who’s come to take him to hell, and leaves instructions that “you may bury my body”, not in sanctified ground, but “by the highway side,/ So my old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride”. Some, like Johnson, travelled all across the country playing music. Son House travelled, but he saw the upside of home: “Clarksdale’s in the South, and lays heavy on my mind,/ I can have a good time there, if I ain’t got but one lousy dime.” When cotton was king, Clarksdale was a thriving town, with streets of smart shopfronts in the newly fashionable deco style. Now it’s a fragile place, the downtown economy vampirised by Walmart and the other big box stores that lurk at the periphery of most southern towns. These days, Mississippi has the lowest average household income in the US, at just under $37,000 (£30,000) a year. Once there were more than 100 railway lines serving the delta. Almost all have gone, except in the lyrics of the blues I walked around Clarksdale, thinking about Son House, who saw the town’s 20s and 30s boom time from the gutter. “Every day in the week,” he sings, “I goes to Midtown Drugs,/ and get me a bottle of snuff, and a bottle of Alcorub.” During prohibition, the poorest southern alcoholics, who couldn’t even afford the price of a jug of country liquor, would try to stave off the comedown by sniffing rubbing alcohol or drinking camping fuel, known as canned heat. “Crying, canned heat, mama,” sings Tommy Johnson, “sure, Lord killing me.” I stumbled around in a muddy graveyard as rain hammered down, looking for one of the three reputed graves of Robert Johnson. I stood outside the ruins of Bryant’s grocery, where in 1955 14-year-old Emmett Till was accused of “reckless eyeballing” and whistling at the owner’s wife. I climbed in and out of ruined shops on Jackson’s Farish Street, once known as the “black Mecca”. I looked for railway junctions. At one time there were more than 100 lines serving the delta. Almost all have gone, except in the lyrics of the blues. The composer and bandleader WC Handy was asleep on a train in 1903, when in the depot at Tutwiler, just south of Clarksdale, he heard a ragged musician sing about “going where the Southern cross the Dog”. I found that spot, at Moorhead, the junction of the Southern Railroad and the Yazoo and Delta line, known because of its initials as the Yellow Dog. There are still rails, but no trains will ever run on them again. Rounders such as Johnson would hop freights if they had no money for a regular ticket. “I got to keep moving,” he sings, “blues falling down like hail./ And the days keeps on worrying me, there’s a hellhound on my trail.” The most famous train in the blues is the Midnight Special, implored by hundreds of singers over the years to “shine her ever-loving light on me”. It’s a Texas train, the Southern Pacific Golden Gate Limited, which passed Sugar Land prison outside Houston, bringing dreams of freedom and redemption. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lead Belly singing Midnight Special But in the delta there was another known by the same name. Every fifth Saturday, at midnight, the Midnight Special left Jackson on the Yellow Dog line, arriving at dawn at Parchman Farm, the notorious state prison. “Judge give me life this morning, down on Parchman Farm./ I wouldn’t hate it so bad, but I left my wife and home,” sings “Bukka” White. The Parchman Midnight Special shone a light on the men incarcerated there, because it brought wives and lovers on conjugal visits, as well as prostitutes who would be smuggled in for guards or trustees. And it always held out the tantalising possibility of freedom, the arrival of the “woman with the umbrella and the pardon in her hand”, who appears in various versions of Midnight Special saying, “Warden, give me my man”. There are recordings from inside the prison, made by John and Alan Lomax. In 1948, a group of prisoners led by a caller known as “22” sang one of the many prison works songs dedicated to “Rosie”: “Ain’t but one thing I done wrong,” they sang, “stay in Mississippi a day too long.” That line ran round my head as I sat in my rental car outside the main gate. Flat farmland stretched away in all directions. Cars came and went, entering what is now the Mississippi State Penitentiary. If I’d learned one thing about the blues by driving around Mississippi in the rain, it was that you have to listen to messages like that. I turned the key in the ignition and headed down the road, in the direction of Louisiana. • Hari Kunzru’s new novel, White Tears, is published on 6 April by Hamish Hamilton at £14.99.

Share Adjust Comment Print A popular trading-card game rooted in a fantasy storyline is becoming a target of thieves at Edmonton comic-book stores.  The recent thefts of Magic: The Gathering cards has gaming and collectible store owners trying to co-operate to stop further losses.  “Magic is a very easy currency to move. The cards themselves hold a lot of value,” said Jeremy Brandy, general manager of the Wizard’s Comics and Collectibles location in Old Strathcona. “You can buy a $100 box and get cards in it that are worth $100 to $200 a piece.” A typical bundle containing about 230 cards sells for $54 at one Edmonton store and $40 online. In some recent thefts, stores are falling victim to credit-card fraud.  Staff at the Wizard’s store learned earlier this year that a shopper was using stolen credit cards to purchase packs of cards. That meant the small business had to cover the cost of about $2,000, Brandy said. Police investigating That same man is believed to have stolen cards at Red Claw Gaming on the north side. When his card was declined, he grabbed boxes of the cards and ran. Wizard’s snapped a few photos of the man and the Edmonton Police Service is investigating, said spokeswoman Noreen Remtulla. Kim Lewis of Warp One Comics arranges Magic: The Gathering cards at the store in Edmonton on Thursday, March 23, 2017.  Kucerak, Ian / Postmedia Store owners suspect the cards — which are collected, traded and used in competitive play — are being resold online where it is difficult to trace their origins.   “It’s almost like an unregulated currency,” Brandy said. Rare commodities Some of the rarest cards can sell for tens of thousands of dollars online, although those are from older editions of the game, which launched in 1993. Black Lotus, one of the rarest and oldest cards, carries a suggested “fair trade price” of $16,900, according to mtgprice.com, a website dedicated to pricing Magic: The Gathering cards. Dave Bryenton, one of the owners of Warp One Comics and its sister stores, said sometimes people will come into the store and attempt to resell boxes of magic cards they say they purchased from Walmart, but store staff suspect are stolen. Magic cards aren’t the only goods in the collectibles realm regularly targeted by thieves. Popular comic book series such as the Walking Dead are often stolen, said Jay Bardyla, owner of Happy Harbor Comics. In 2015, someone stole a copy of Superman #3 from Bardyla’s shop in downtown Edmonton. “Certainly, as the economy gets worse, that gets higher. People will think that they’re more entitled to your product,” Bardyla said, adding he had hoped people would respect small, independent businesses. After the initial cases of credit-card fraud at Wizard’s, the store’s management posted photos of the man to a few Facebook pages where other Alberta comic book shops are members. When a product is stolen, these businesses will post information that tells other businesses to beware and to avoid buying anything they think might be stolen. “We do try to curb it wherever we can,” Bryenton said. djohnson@postmedia.com Woman admits to running over man with his own van before...

Twitter Facebook Moto G5 Plus: Economy class that gets you there (with video) Moto's new Android phone may not set any speed records, but it's a solid, useful device with no bloat and a low price. Dan Rosenbaum (Computerworld (US)) 24 March, 2017 22:00 - - - - print email Comments When I book a plane ticket, I fly economy, but I always cast an eye over the prices in the business class column. For three to four times the cost, I could get better food, more room, a more comfortable seat and more personal attention. What I wouldn't get is a faster trip. So although I'll pay a few extra bucks for a little extra legroom in coach, I forego business class, because the luxuries aren't worth all the added money. To an increasing extent, smartphone buyers are being asked to make similar calculations. As high-end phones reach the $800 mark (rumors have it that the next iPhone will have a shocking $1,000 price), name-brand vendors are carving out economy-class price niches at about a quarter of that. And in the same way that the less expensive airplane ride will still get you to Fargo or Paris, the cheaper phone will give you what you want just as safely and almost as quickly. The latest economy-class phone is the Moto G5 Plus. It's built with the same style language of the Moto Z: aluminum body, slightly rounded back and a distinctive .87-in. circular, .08-in.-high bump on the phone's back for the camera. It's immediately recognizable as a Lenovo-owned Moto phone (as opposed to the design of the Google version of Moto, or that of the original independent company). Unlike the Moto Z, there are no contacts on the back for expansion modules; the G5 Plus rides alone. The phone feels sturdy and is pleasant to hold. Speeds and feeds At 5.9 x 2.9 x 0.3 in., the G5 Plus is among the smaller contemporary phones, roughly the same size as the Huawei Honor 6X, with which it competes. Moto's engineers did not strain themselves to shoehorn a particularly big display into that space -- its 5.2-in. LCD screen with a 1080 x 1920 resolution is smaller than the Honor's 5.5-in. screen, although both phones have the same pixel count. Power and volume buttons are along the right edge, the drawer for dual SIMs and a microSD card are along the top, and the headphone and micro-USB ports are on the bottom. The single-port speaker fires through the same aperture used for listening to phone calls. It's nothing to write home about. [ Further reading: 30 tasty tips for Android Nougat ] There's a fingerprint sensor on the phone's chin, below the phone's Back/Home/Recent soft buttons. There is no provision for left-handedness. The phone runs a stock version of Android 7.0 (Nougat). The Moto uses an eight-core Snapdragon 625 chipset, and comes with either 2GB memory and 32GB storage or 4GB/64GB. (I reviewed the latter.) Performance was on the low end of so-so, scoring around 64328 on the Antutu benchmarking suite. That's below the top 50 currently available phones, but a bit ahead of the Honor 6X's score of 57055. I noticed that, particularly in the 3D graphics part of the test, the G5 Plus' display looked choppy. This is not a phone made for heavy-duty gaming. On the other hand, the 3,000mAh battery is quite substantial. I wasn't able to complete a full-drain battery test -- the G5 Plus' system software seemed to short-circuit it -- but the partial tests that I was able to complete indicated that the battery would last a full day and then some under a steady load. That makes sense: It's a big battery running a small-ish screen and a mid-spec chipset. A little less legroom Other corners also get cut. Wi-Fi is 802.11n, but not ac. The phone uses micro USB, not USB-C. GPS does not include support for the latest Galileo European network. In the United States, there is no NFC chip. The camera is a little better than okay. The main back-facing camera shoots up to 12MP at f/1.7 (wider than most) in 4:3 format and 9.1MP in 16:9. Videos can scale up to 4K at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps. Lenovo says the camera uses more than the usual number of pixels to focus, letting it focus more quickly than competitors. The front-facing camera has 5MP at f/2.2. There's no autoshooting, smile detection or similar features, although the camera does have slow-mo and panorama modes. A "professional" mode allows somewhat more manual control than pure automatic mode. If you're looking for a serious smartphone camera, there are better. But lest you get the idea that the G5 Plus is all narrow seats and no legroom, there are a bunch of very nice touches in this phone to make the ride more comfortable. The fingerprint sensor hides some neat tricks. If you enable one-button navigation, swiping left on the sensor is the same as tapping the Back button, and swiping right is the same as tapping the Recent button. Tapping the sensor brings you home, and holding it launches Google Assistant. If you don't like that, you can swipe up on the fingerprint sensor to shrink the screen, making one-handed operation all the easier. (You need to choose between this function and one-button nav; you can't have both.) In all cases, touching the fingerprint sensor both unlocks the phone and puts it to sleep. It's easy to get the hang of the kind of tap that brings you Home and the kind that sleeps the phone. Other gestures with the phone itself can turn on the flashlight (a double chopping motion) or launch the camera (a repeated wrist twist). Sometimes they work, although I wouldn't want to bet my rent money on their working reliably. Who needs baggage? And there are a lot of subtle geek things that start to add up. Most phones that have dual SIM support will either support two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card. The G5 Plus lets you do both. That makes the SIM drawer a little complicated, but travelers will appreciate it. There is no -- zero -- bloatware, other than a couple of Moto apps that let you control special features of the phone. Otherwise, this is as close to a native Android experience as you're going to get. The only applications that this phone comes with are those in the native Google app stack: Google, Mail, Maps, YouTube, Drive, Play Music, Play Movies, Calendar, Play Store, Duo, Contacts, Chrome, Messages. And there's FM radio, which has been part of smartphone silicon forever but which vendors are only now activating. Oh -- there's a genuinely helpful Device Help app, too. Another truly remarkable but non-obvious thing about the G5 Plus: Wherever you buy it, it is unlocked and will work on any of the four U.S. networks. It has radios for GSM and CDMA, so will work on AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon or Sprint. And it will work overseas, too. Being unlocked, unbloated and carrier-agnostic, it is perhaps unsurprising that the G5 Plus will be available on March 31st pretty much everywhere except from a carrier. (Pre-orders start today.) Moto says you'll be able to buy it at Amazon, Best Buy, B&H, Newegg, Republic Wireless, Target, Costco, Ting and Walmart. The biggest feature of all Which brings us, perhaps, to the biggest feature of all: the price. The 2GB/32GB version will sell for $229; the 4GB/64GB version will cost $299. The lower-end phone roughly competes with the Huawei Honor 6X, which sells for $250. But if you're an Amazon Prime member, you can get the Moto 5G Plus for $185 for the 2GB/32GB version or $240 for the 4GB/64GB. I'm pretty sure this is the first name-brand smartphone to break the $200 barrier. So here's your choice: An iPhone 7 Plus costs $769 and a Samsung Galaxy S7 costs $570 (although the S8 is due any day now). For that money, you could get two or three Moto G5 Pluses. They all take phone calls, they all run apps, they all take photos. The iPhones and Galaxys are undoubtedly plusher and faster (though you could make a good argument that the lack of bloat on the Moto G5 makes it a better deal than the Galaxy S7). But, just as on an airplane, the economy seat gets you there at pretty much the same time as the business-class seat. From an industry standpoint, the G5 Plus is significant because it's a smart reaction to an alarming trend in the phone business: rising used phone sales. At the end of 2015, Deloitte predicted that about 120 million used smartphones would change hands at an average of $140 per device. If you made smartphones, wouldn't you rather capture that money with a yesterday's-spec phone rather than let your old phones cannibalize your sales? A new sub-$200 phone might compete powerfully with a two-year-old model for $140 -- and the Moto G5 Plus is a prime candidate to do just exactly that. If you're on a tight budget, or if you just plain like the idea of getting two or three phones for the price of one, check out the Moto G5 Plus.

East side or west side? For years, the west side of 10th Street in Great Bend seemed sparser to consumers with business options. The makeover that the former Village Mall has received is starting to breathe more life into west 10th Street. Advanced Therapy & Sports Medicine in Great Bend decided to move their business to the Village Mall and officially opened their new location at 4801 10th Street earlier this month. Kevyn Soupiset with Advanced Therapy & Sports Medicine and Progressive Therapy & Sports Medicine in Larned says it was time to get more space. Kevyn Soupiset Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/soupiset-1.mp3 Soupiset says Advanced Therapy has nearly tripled their size from their old location in the strip mall next to Walmart. Advanced Therapy is not the only organization to take advantage of the once bare Village Mall. Ace Hardware had the early start, bringing their business to the location in 2014. Recently Smallcakes and Heartland Community Church moved into the facility and Up N Rollin Skate Center and Dr. David Hart’s dentist office will open soon. Kevyn Soupiset Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/soupiset-2.mp3 Soupiset says Advanced Therapy plans to eventually use 2,500 square feet of the building to the east for their sports performance program, senior wellness programs, and other exercise opportunities for the community.

I’m not sure if that was the City Limits but it was Gravel from their West to Larned. When you got to Tenth and Patton on the NE Corner was the Great Bend Drive In but maybe a few years later.. The intersection was a high and slanted curve that went south on Patton. Those on the west side of the intersection had a stop sign. I don’t remember if Patton went North at the intersection at that time. Those were the days. No fast food restaurants, convenience stores not yet available, A few lucky people had Party Line Phones with 5 families on the same phone line.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News Food Retail Industry to Grow at 6.1% CAGR by 2020 : PMR Under regional segment, the Asia Pacific food retail market (the largest market in 2013) increased by 7.2 % CAGR during 2010-2013 to reach USD 1,909.2 million in 2013. According to a new market report published by Persistence Market Research “Global Market Study on Food Retail: Supermarkets/hypermarkets Segment To Witness Highest Growth by 2020,” the global Food Retail market was valued at USD 5,643.6 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.1 % from 2014 to 2020, to reach an estimated value of USD 8,541.9 billion in 2020. Rise in the global population, changing customer preferences, and emerging economies are making the way for the food retail industry. It is a dynamically progressing industry and contributes to the development of several industries such as food packaging. Rising middle-class population is creating growth opportunities for food retail market and is expected to drive the market further. According to a U.S.-based research firm, about 1.5 billion households globally would be in the middle-class category by 2020, up from 1.2 billion households in 2012. China and India are among the countries witnessing a fast growth in their middle-class population. In 2012, there were 227 million and 149 million middle-class households in China and India, respectively. In addition, due to busy life schedules many working peoples have less time to shop for food items. Therefore, increasing online retail shopping through online retail formats such as in-store pickup and pure-play online grocers is expected to drive the food retail market in the years to come. The restraining impact of lack of supply chain effectiveness in less developed countries is expected to be medium in the short and medium terms, and low in the long term. Government investment in infrastructure and the entry of global food processing companies in developing countries are expected to minimize the impact of supply chain-related restraints. The threat from unorganized players is expected to be high in the short term, medium in the medium term and low in the long term. The number of organized players is increasing in developing countries due to increasing urbanization and per capita income. In India, discussions regarding foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail are currently under way, and if it is approved by the Indian government it may add benefits to the food retail industry. Asia-Pacific is the largest market for food retail. Increasing per capita income, growing level of education, smaller families and increasing urbanization and westernization are the key factors driving the growth of food retail industry in this region. Europe is the second largest market for food retail due to the presence of the large number of branded stores and discounters such as Aldi, Carrefour, Auchan and Tesco which offer fresh and branded products. They are then followed by North America. Health and nutritional concern among consumers are the major factors fuelling the growth of the food retail market in this region. RoW region has experienced the fastest growth in the past few years and is likely to hold its position in the years to come. Request to view table of content @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/food-re… Food Retail is categorized under distribution channel into four different segments: supermarkets or hypermarkets, independent and specialist retailers, convenience stores and others.

However, after 10 days with my T-Mobile SIM in the new Moto G5 Plus, it will be very difficult to justify spending more than $300 on a smartphone again. The Moto G4 Plus, check out my review from last year, was a solid choice and earned an 8/10 rating from me. There were a few tradeoffs, but at $300 that is expected. With the G5 Plus, I was only able to come up with one con and even that con can be overcome by using Android Pay on your Android Wear smartwatch. cloud tv How ethics migrate to the cloud Cloud migration: Dipping in a toe before diving all in Secure your clouds across AWS, Azure, and more Cloud computing will be key for autonomous driving At just $300 for the model I tested, businesses can purchase the Moto G5 Plus and provide a complete smartphone experience to employees. You get a stock experience with Moto enhancements that increase your productivity. Motorola has also shown an excellent track record of monthly Android security updates over the past year and I have no hesitation in recommending the Moto G5 Plus. Specifications Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 2.0 GHz octa-core Display: 5.2 inch 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution LCD screen, 424 ppi Operating system: Android 7.0 Nougat RAM: 2GB and 4GB (I tested the 4GB model) Storage: 32/64GB internal with microSD expansion card slot Cameras: 12 megapixel rear f/1.7 dual autofocus with 5 megapixel wide-angle f/2.2 front-facing camera Water resistance: Splash resistant nano coating, not to be submersed Connectivity: 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS Battery: 3000 mAh non-removable with Turbo Charge Dimensions: 150.2 x 74 x 9.7 mm and 155 grams One powerful feature of the Moto G5 Plus that we don't see in flagship carrier variations is the support for virtually all mobile networks, both GSM and CDMA. You can pop in a SIM from Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, and their prepaid partners and be off and running with the Moto G5 Plus. In addition, you don't get any of the massive carrier bloatware that so many carriers love to add. The one specification that is lacking here is NFC, which means you won't be able to use Android Pay. You could always pair up a new Android Wear watch or Samsung Gear S3 to use Android Pay though. I have also moved to USB Type-C for most of my cables, but the Moto G5 Plus still uses a microUSB port for charging. Thankfully, there is also still a 3.5mm headset jack. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 While many not appreciate it, the Moto G5 Plus does come with a FM radio. As a sports fan, I enjoy having the ability to listen to my local sports radio when out and about on my phone. Hardware The Moto G5 Plus presents a different shell than we have seen in the past. Moto used aluminum for the back panel and frame. It's very well done with matte finish on the back, polished metal around the edges, and a slightly raised edge around the glass front display. It looks classy and works well in a business environment. While the LG G6 pushes the smartphone world forward with its 18:9 display and fantastic camera, it is also priced twice as much as the Moto G5 Plus. You won't find anything special about the 1080p display on the Moto G5 Plus, but fonts are crisp and colors look just fine. Even at just $300, Lenovo brought some innovation to the Moto G5 Plus that we have yet to see on other Android phones. I am not a fan of the front-facing fingerprint scanner on the Moto Z line that does not act as a home button. With the G5 Plus, you will find the home button does perform as a fast fingerprint scanner and home button. Even better, there is an available Moto Actions setting where you can use the fingerprint sensor for navigation. Simply enable it and then swipe left to go back and swipe right to view recent apps. My productivity has improved significantly with this one button navigation feature and I would love to see this on other devices. Moto devices have had good speaker performance in the past, but with the Moto G5 Plus we see a single speaker that plays out of the headset. This front-facing speaker isn't a bad idea, but the speaker isn't anything you will want to use for regular listening of music or video content. Moto G5 Plus review: in pictures SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 23 NEXT PREV There is a microUSB port, microphone, and 3.5mm headset jack on the bottom. The SIM card and microSD card tray is found up top. There is nothing on the left side while the power and volume buttons are on the upper right side. The camera and flash are positioned at the center of the upper back with a rather large protrusion that extends out the back. A Moto logo is centered below the camera while the second mic is also placed near the top of the back. It stuns me that devices like the HTC U Ultra, priced at $749, do not come with any level of water resistance in 2017. The $300 Moto G5 Plus continues to use the nano coating that Moto has used for years so you have a device that can take a splash or light rain without failing. This is just what I need and should be the minimum standard for all phones at this time. Software The Moto G5 Plus launches with Android 7.0 Nougat and the evaluation device I have in hand has the January 2017 Android security update. The UI is stock with a few Moto widgets and the Moto app. The Moto utility gives you access to toggles for the various actions and display settings available on the G5 Plus. Actions include: One button nav to swipe for back and recent apps Karate chop twice to turn on the flashlight (don't drop the phone) Flip the phone face down to silence notifications and calls Pick up the phone when it rings to switch to vibrate Twist your wrist twice to launch the camera Swipe to shrink the screen Display options let you toggle on notifications that appear while the display is off. You can choose to block apps from the display, set how much detail is shown, dictate when the display should remain dark, and toggle on touch vibration. The standby notification screen on Moto devices is better than on any other smartphone. You can see notifications from many of your apps and then hold the notification to see more details without ever unlocking or turning on your display. Over the course of a day, you can save yourself a considerable amount of time and also save on some battery life. The camera app is easy to use and supports auto photos, video, panorama, slow motion, and professional modes. Tap the camera icon in the upper right to switch between the various modes. Swipe in from the left to access settings and in from the right to quickly view photos in the gallery. I love that the phone app integrates visual voicemail and hate using Android devices like the HTC U Ultra and LG G6 that require a separate app just to add visual voicemail functionality. Google provides this in Android and even though it is a minor detail, all manufacturers should enable this by default. The rest of the software is typical Android Nougat, including the ability to customize your Quick Actions buttons and see important information at a glance in settings. Price and competition The Moto G5 Plus will be available in the US starting on 31 March at Amazon, Best Buy, B&H, Costco, Flash Wireless, Frys, Motorola.com, NewEgg, Republic Wireless, Target, Ting, and Walmart. Pre-orders begin March 24 at select retailers. It will be available for $229 with 2GB RAM/32GB storage and $299 with 4GB RAM/64GB storage. The Moto G5 Plus will also be available as a Prime Exclusive Phone on Amazon.com, at a discounted price for Amazon Prime members (2GB RAM/32GB of storage will be $184.99 for Prime members, and 4GB RAM/64GB of storage will be $239.99 for Prime members). Other options in the sub-$300 range include the Honor 6X for $250, the ZTE Axon 7 Mini for $200, and the ZTE Blade V8 Pro. Looking at the specs, Moto actions, and track record of timely security updates, the Moto G5 Plus is the best sub-$300 smartphone available today. Daily usage experiences and conclusion There are always some compromises you have to make when you are paying half to a third of the cost of a high end flagship phone so I wasn't expecting the Moto G5 Plus to be much different. The Honor 6X started to change my opinion and after getting an even better stock Android experience with Moto Actions providing serious productivity enhancements I could easily use the Moto G5 Plus as my daily driver. With phones like the Moto G5 Plus, it is possible the masses may start looking to more affordable options and realize they don't have to give up much to save a ton of money. As ZDNet's Jason Perlow wrote back in October, the app experience is about the same across most smartphones today. It gets to be challenging trying to explain to your boss while the company needs to pay twice as much for a phone that does the same thing and in many cases may even be better. Phone calls sounded fine and callers told me I sounded great on their end. I was able to obtain a solid connection at all times and even tested out Sprint and Verizon SIMs without any issues. The battery lasted me a couple of days, even with fairly heavy usage. Cameras on these low cost phones are generally fine for social networks, but it is not often they are very impressive. Huawei did well with the Honor 6X, but the Moto G5 Plus does even better. It has a 12 megapixel camera with large pixels to capture more light and I have been very impressed with the output. Check out my Flickr photo album with full resolution images from the Moto G5 Plus and other flagship smartphones to see and judge for yourself. BTW, you also get full image resolution upload to Google Photos for free for at least two years with the Moto G5 Plus. The Moto G5 Plus sold me on affordable phones and after all of these new phones are tried and tested, I may just be back to using it as my daily driver.

In January, the company revealed two new subscription services—iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access—powered by Napster. eMarketer predicts there will be over 121 million US mobile phone music listeners in 2017. Amazon Postpones Southeast Asia Entrance Amazon has delayed its launch in Southeast Asia, which was expected to take place in Q1 2017, TechCrunch reports. The company has pushed that date to “later this year,” according to the news outlet. Amazon is starting to lag behind its main global competitor, Alibaba, in Southeast Asian markets. Alibaba purchased regional ecommerce platform Lazada in 2016 and has been forging partnerships with local ecommerce players since. SoundCloud Raises $70 Million in Debt Funding SoundCloud, which has been looking to raise more than $100 million since last summer, has raised $70 million in debt funding, according to Bloomberg. The online music service secured the line of credit from Ares Capital Corporation, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology. Alibaba Unveils Malaysia Distribution Hub Alibaba continues to foster closer ties with Southeast Asian markets, this week announcing it would create a regional distribution hub in Malaysia. The new hub would be the first such logistics center outside of Alibaba’s home country of China. In addition, Alibaba signed other agreements with Malaysia’s government designed to foster cross-border ecommerce and help small to medium-sized businesses in the country get online. eMarketer estimates that retail ecommerce sales in Malaysia—excluding travel—will total $2.4 billion this year, but will make up just 1.7% of all retail sales in the country. Who Even Watches DVDs Anymore? Walmart created a solution for people who don’t watch their DVDs anymore, but still have them lying around. Vudu, the retail giant’s subscription-free video streaming service, is now able to adapt DVDs and Blu-rays into digital files from customer’s mobile phones. India’s App Usage Shoots Up 43% Mobile analytics firm Flurry reported that usage of apps in India grew 43% year over year in 2016, with usage of entertainment-focused apps increasing by 188%. Business and financial apps also saw strong gains, with use growing 176%, while shopping app usage increased 12%. Will Reliance Jio Surive the End of Its Promotions? It Looks Good. A recent survey of Reliance Jio’s users found that 96% planned to stay on with the India-based mobile service provider after its free voice and data promotions conclude at the end of March. Reliance Jio launched in late 2016 and grew a user base of more than 100 million people in less than six months through its free offerings, but observers questioned whether consumers would stick with the company once its generous promotions ended. —Rahul Chadha, Rebecca Chadwick, Rimma Kats New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week US Ad Spending: The eMarketer Forecast for 2017 US paid media ad spending will grow steadily in 2017, on the heels of a strong 2016 boosted by the Rio Olympics and the presidential election.

By Dan Rosenbaum Contributing Writer, Computerworld | Mar 24, 2017 4:00 AM PT Credit: Motorola More like this Review: Huawei plays 'The Price Is Right' with Mate 9, Honor 6X (with video) Deep-dive review: The new LG G5 restores the replaceable battery Review: Google's new Pixel XL is a fine phone -- but is it really special? Video Mingis on Tech: A closer look at the new Moto G5 Plus When I book a plane ticket, I fly economy, but I always cast an eye over the prices in the business class column. For three to four times the cost, I could get better food, more room, a more comfortable seat and more personal attention. What I wouldn't get is a faster trip. So although I'll pay a few extra bucks for a little extra legroom in coach, I forego business class, because the luxuries aren't worth all the added money. To an increasing extent, smartphone buyers are being asked to make similar calculations. As high-end phones reach the $800 mark (rumors have it that the next iPhone will have a shocking $1,000 price), name-brand vendors are carving out economy-class price niches at about a quarter of that. And in the same way that the less expensive airplane ride will still get you to Fargo or Paris, the cheaper phone will give you what you want just as safely and almost as quickly. The latest economy-class phone is the Moto G5 Plus. It's built with the same style language of the Moto Z: aluminum body, slightly rounded back and a distinctive .87-in. circular, .08-in.-high bump on the phone's back for the camera. It's immediately recognizable as a Lenovo-owned Moto phone (as opposed to the design of the Google version of Moto, or that of the original independent company). Unlike the Moto Z, there are no contacts on the back for expansion modules; the G5 Plus rides alone. The phone feels sturdy and is pleasant to hold. Speeds and feeds At 5.9 x 2.9 x 0.3 in., the G5 Plus is among the smaller contemporary phones, roughly the same size as the Huawei Honor 6X, with which it competes. Moto's engineers did not strain themselves to shoehorn a particularly big display into that space -- its 5.2-in. LCD screen with a 1080 x 1920 resolution is smaller than the Honor's 5.5-in. screen, although both phones have the same pixel count. Power and volume buttons are along the right edge, the drawer for dual SIMs and a microSD card are along the top, and the headphone and micro-USB ports are on the bottom. The single-port speaker fires through the same aperture used for listening to phone calls. It's nothing to write home about. [ Further reading: 30 tasty tips for Android Nougat ] There's a fingerprint sensor on the phone's chin, below the phone's Back/Home/Recent soft buttons. There is no provision for left-handedness. The phone runs a stock version of Android 7.0 (Nougat). The Moto uses an eight-core Snapdragon 625 chipset, and comes with either 2GB memory and 32GB storage or 4GB/64GB. (I reviewed the latter.) Performance was on the low end of so-so, scoring around 64328 on the Antutu benchmarking suite. That's below the top 50 currently available phones, but a bit ahead of the Honor 6X's score of 57055. I noticed that, particularly in the 3D graphics part of the test, the G5 Plus' display looked choppy. This is not a phone made for heavy-duty gaming. On the other hand, the 3,000mAh battery is quite substantial. I wasn't able to complete a full-drain battery test -- the G5 Plus' system software seemed to short-circuit it -- but the partial tests that I was able to complete indicated that the battery would last a full day and then some under a steady load. That makes sense: It's a big battery running a small-ish screen and a mid-spec chipset. A little less legroom Other corners also get cut. Wi-Fi is 802.11n, but not ac. The phone uses micro USB, not USB-C. GPS does not include support for the latest Galileo European network. In the United States, there is no NFC chip. The camera is a little better than okay. The main back-facing camera shoots up to 12MP at f/1.7 (wider than most) in 4:3 format and 9.1MP in 16:9. Videos can scale up to 4K at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps. Lenovo says the camera uses more than the usual number of pixels to focus, letting it focus more quickly than competitors. The front-facing camera has 5MP at f/2.2. There's no autoshooting, smile detection or similar features, although the camera does have slow-mo and panorama modes. A "professional" mode allows somewhat more manual control than pure automatic mode. If you're looking for a serious smartphone camera, there are better. But lest you get the idea that the G5 Plus is all narrow seats and no legroom, there are a bunch of very nice touches in this phone to make the ride more comfortable. The fingerprint sensor hides some neat tricks. If you enable one-button navigation, swiping left on the sensor is the same as tapping the Back button, and swiping right is the same as tapping the Recent button. Tapping the sensor brings you home, and holding it launches Google Assistant. If you don't like that, you can swipe up on the fingerprint sensor to shrink the screen, making one-handed operation all the easier. (You need to choose between this function and one-button nav; you can't have both.) In all cases, touching the fingerprint sensor both unlocks the phone and puts it to sleep. It's easy to get the hang of the kind of tap that brings you Home and the kind that sleeps the phone. Other gestures with the phone itself can turn on the flashlight (a double chopping motion) or launch the camera (a repeated wrist twist). Sometimes they work, although I wouldn't want to bet my rent money on their working reliably. Who needs baggage? And there are a lot of subtle geek things that start to add up. Most phones that have dual SIM support will either support two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card. The G5 Plus lets you do both. That makes the SIM drawer a little complicated, but travelers will appreciate it. There is no -- zero -- bloatware, other than a couple of Moto apps that let you control special features of the phone. Otherwise, this is as close to a native Android experience as you're going to get. The only applications that this phone comes with are those in the native Google app stack: Google, Mail, Maps, YouTube, Drive, Play Music, Play Movies, Calendar, Play Store, Duo, Contacts, Chrome, Messages. And there's FM radio, which has been part of smartphone silicon forever but which vendors are only now activating. Oh -- there's a genuinely helpful Device Help app, too. Another truly remarkable but non-obvious thing about the G5 Plus: Wherever you buy it, it is unlocked and will work on any of the four U.S. networks. It has radios for GSM and CDMA, so will work on AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon or Sprint. And it will work overseas, too. Being unlocked, unbloated and carrier-agnostic, it is perhaps unsurprising that the G5 Plus will be available on March 31st pretty much everywhere except from a carrier. (Pre-orders start today.) Moto says you'll be able to buy it at Amazon, Best Buy, B&H, Newegg, Republic Wireless, Target, Costco, Ting and Walmart. The biggest feature of all Which brings us, perhaps, to the biggest feature of all: the price. The 2GB/32GB version will sell for $229; the 4GB/64GB version will cost $299. The lower-end phone roughly competes with the Huawei Honor 6X, which sells for $250. But if you're an Amazon Prime member, you can get the Moto 5G Plus for $185 for the 2GB/32GB version or $240 for the 4GB/64GB under its Prime Exclusive program (as long as you don’t mind lockscreen ads). I'm pretty sure that Moto is the first name-brand vendor to break the $200 barrier. So here's your choice: An iPhone 7 Plus costs $769 and a Samsung Galaxy S7 costs $570 (although the S8 is due any day now). For that money, you could get two or three Moto G5 Pluses. They all take phone calls, they all run apps, they all take photos. The iPhones and Galaxys are undoubtedly plusher and faster (though you could make a good argument that the lack of bloat on the Moto G5 makes it a better deal than the Galaxy S7). But, just as on an airplane, the economy seat gets you there at pretty much the same time as the business-class seat. From an industry standpoint, the G5 Plus is significant because it's a smart reaction to an alarming trend in the phone business: rising used phone sales. At the end of 2015, Deloitte predicted that about 120 million used smartphones would change hands at an average of $140 per device. If you made smartphones, wouldn't you rather capture that money with a yesterday's-spec phone rather than let your old phones cannibalize your sales? A new sub-$200 phone might compete powerfully with a two-year-old model for $140 -- and the Moto G5 Plus is a prime candidate to do just exactly that. If you're on a tight budget, or if you just plain like the idea of getting two or three phones for the price of one, check out the Moto G5 Plus.
