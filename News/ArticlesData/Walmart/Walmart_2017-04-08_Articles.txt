The store is in the 12700 block of Moreno Beach Drive in Moreno Valley. The fire, which reportedly began in the clothing section of the store, sent some shoppers scrambling out of the business. While store employees called 911 to report the fire and began evacuating the store, one Wal-Mart employee took charge of the situation and battled the small, but growing blaze with one of the store’s fire extinguishers. After the fire was reported, emergency first responders from multiple agencies rushed to the Wal-Mart just after 10 a.m. Twenty-five firefighters from six engine companies and one truck company from Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire and City of Moreno Valley Fire Departments responded to the reported blaze, according to Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire spokeswoman Jody Hagemann. They were later assisted by Riverside County Environmental Health officials. Authorities began arriving at the store within minutes of the initially dispatched call. “The first arriving company officer reported clothing on fire inside the store that was extinguished via fire extinguisher by an employee,” Hagemann explained. “All employees and patrons safely evacuated the structure prior to fire department arrival.” The employee who helped put out the fire, who was not identified, was transported to an area hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation and asthma-related symptoms. Thanks at least in large part to the fast actions of the employee who extinguished the fire, there were no other injuries reported from citizens or emergency personnel. Fire resources remained at the scene for about one hour and the store was temporarily closed after the incident to allow employees time to remove the charred debris, clean the store and quickly re-stock the shelves. The store reopened several hours later, about 3 p.m. Although many shoppers fled the store immediately after the first sign of fire, one frustrated Wal-Mart employee – who declined to be identified – later described how after the fire broke out some guests ignored the obvious fire danger and continued shopping as if nothing was happening. According to the employee, some other guests used the opportunity as a chance to shoplift from the store, while employees were distracted by dealing with the fire and trying to evacuate shoppers; some of whom had to be convinced or even told to leave the store. After the fire started, “many customers continued shopping and their daily business as if nothing was wrong,” the employee said. “Neglecting their own safety, they saw the fire and mandatory evacuation as an inconvenience. Only at the insistence of store employees and management did the shoppers leave their selections behind.” The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to Hagemann, who estimated the loss to be about $10,000 in product and property damage.

When the evacuation of the store began, customers continued shopping and their daily business as if nothing was wrong. Neglecting their own safety, they saw the fire and mandatory evacuation as an inconvenience and prime opportunity to try to shoplift. Only at the insistence of store employees and management did the shoppers leave their selections behind. The store re-opened at approximately 3:00 PM after employees rapidly cleaned and re-stocked the shelves. Reply Trevor Montgomery   April 8, 2017 at 7:14 pm Thank you for providing a first-hand accounting of this incident. I am glad you are OK and that nobody was injured. -TM Reply Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Levy My Other Blogs You are here: Home » General » Simplistic Solutions to Organized Labor’s Problems Simplistic Solutions to Organized Labor’s Problems [ 7 ] April 8, 2017 | Erik Loomis If you want to get published, a real good way is to write yet another version of “labor unions are doing it wrong. They should ORGANIZE and listen to REAL WORKERS instead of PLAYING POLITICS and DOING THE SAME OLD THINGS.” These articles come out all the time. Virtually all have some level of truth in them. Unions often do a lot of things wrong. But they inevitably make broad statements that erase all the complexity from the problems the labor movement faces while asserting a potential for working-class power that probably isn’t there in the way these writers want. There’s a new piece along these lines from Dan Schlademan, the co-director of a group called Organization United for Respect, a group made up of grocery store employees organizing in that industry. So you have to respect the work and I do not mean to say anything negative about that. But this is a good time to critique some of the arguments routinely made on the labor left, because a lot of them are really problematic. Working people in this country can not and should not underestimate their power. History, as well as emerging movements and organizations, show that working people are not facing a question of life or death. Rather, they are facing the opportunity for renewal. The US labor movement has reinvented itself repeatedly in the past. These rebirths have been crucial to the evolution of the movement’s power. We are now at another historical moment of rebirth. But it’s important to understand how we arrived here, so to best take advantage of the opportunity ahead. Given the Trump OSHA and EPA though, workers are literally facing a question of life or death. The Trump administration is not an opportunity for renewal. There’s no silver lining here. Yes, the labor movement writ large is not going away. Workers will always fight to improve their lives, or at least some workers will. But I really struggle calling the likelihood of Friedrichs II and right to work laws sweeping any state Republicans take over an “opportunity.” Today, too many people—inside the labor movement and out—wax nostalgic about mid-1950s movements that are still dominant in 2017. It’s understandable: union membership was over 30% of the workforce, GM workers were able to buy the cars they built, and the modern American Dream—where working hard meant getting ahead—emerged. In this period, unions played a huge role building the middle class and making America strong. But changes to global trade policies, technology, and the rise of other forces, like automation, mean that the organizations that thrived in 1955 are not necessarily equipped to build power for working people today. This is true. Emerging worker movements are winning hard fought victories with the painful recognition that the same methods for organizing don’t work inside America’s broken system of laws and traditions. New, emergent forms of organizing are gaining power despite the fact that corporations have unprecedented control over workplaces, politics, laws, and the economy. From OUR Walmart to the Fight for $15, National Domestic Workers Alliance, Restaurant Opportunities Center, the Better Banks Campaign, New York Taxi Workers Alliance, and the Freelancers Union, new forms of worker organizations are winning better pay and scheduling practices at major corporations. They’re providing access to benefits and services by using economies of scale. And they’re securing stronger public policy, winning paid sick days and higher minimum wages for entire communities. I would call all of this exceptions to the horrible things happening to American workers rather than a new model that is gaining power. Are these workers gaining power? Are they really winning? These movements have put the minimum wage back on the table and shown that raising it is a popular move, even in conservative states. All of these groups do really good and important work, but there’s little evidence that this is a model of the future per se. These models show that organizers must not be afraid of being catalysts that help workers build independent organizations and experiment. The decision about forming an organization can’t be left up to the government or employers. The presence of workers ready to initiate organization building should be the only prerequisite necessary for an organization to exist. Workers and organizers must also remember that who gets elected, and what they do in once in office, is a reflection of their power; until they build independent power, they will continue to lose. Some of the resources currently focused on politics needs to be focused instead on building organizations that give working people a voice, community, and vision for change, first. So this is a really common refrain on the labor left. Unions should stop with the politics and organize. The problem with this is that it’s totally disconnected from the reality of when and why unions succeed in this country. No, the decision on forming an organization can’t be left up to employers or the government, but giving up on the National Labor Relations Act is hardly a strategy, as limited as the NLRA is today. And it certainly may be that we need worker organizations that are not really unions so that they can operate outside the NLRA. But ultimately, those organizations are hard to run, they face enormous challenges that range from a lack of resources to the need for constant leadership building given the reliance on local people to do all the work. In reality, these are big tasks. Moreover, to give workers a voice, they need to have political power. The most important factor in the success or failure of the American labor movement is something that the labor left hates to hear. It’s not about organizing. It’s not about militancy. It’s not about worker activism. It’s not about radical union leadership. Through the whole history of American labor, the key deciding factor has been the position government takes in a strike or to labor’s demands. There has simply been very few strikes or other victories in American history where labor has succeeded in the face of the complete opposition of government. The Gilded Age provides the most prominent examples of this, not so much because of Pullman and Homestead and the Great Railroad Strike, but because the two big victories of the period–the Anthracite Strike and Cripple Creek–happened precisely because the government made exceptions to their usual anti-labor politics, with Theodore Roosevelt mediating the former and a Populist governor openly taking the side of the miners in the latter. Yes, the Memphis sanitation strike won in 1968 with the Memphis government in total opposition, but that required the death of Martin Luther King and AFSCME couldn’t even build on that in Atlanta less than a decade later when Maynard Jackson decided to side with the city’s business elites over the workers. Moreover, unions’ success not only required unprecedented interventions from the federal government (which would not have happened had workers not struck across the nation in the early 1930s) but their decline coincides with a newly hostile federal government that is most associated with Reagan destroying the air traffic controllers, but really began during the Carter administration. Unions do need to do more than just play the political game. But the political game is absolutely vital to any union victories. There is no way around this. We have well more than a century’s worth of evidence on this point. United for Respect @ Walmart (OUR Walmart) has been working on these issues since 2010. Worker-leaders choose not to wait for the government or Walmart to decide if it had the right to exist. The organization exists because Walmart workers decided to build it into a network of more than 100,000, who, in coalition with communities and allies, created pressure on Walmart sufficient to raise minimum pay, change national policies, and win thousands of store-level victories. By necessity, the organization has focused on developing new forms of building power. While the results may look unfamiliar to traditional labor unions, to date OUR Walmart is both resilient and on the route to building long-term sustainability. OUR Walmart was largely put together and funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers, even though that union has mostly pulled out of it. The Fight for $15 is a project of SEIU. Its not an either/or here. The problem though, as evinced by the UFCW turn away from it, is that these projects are incredibly expensive and there is very little chance of a pay off in terms of union dues. SEIU is facing this now with the fast food workers. When will this pay off? You might say that organizing should happen without worrying about this. But these organizations not only owe their current members proper representation, but if you have a declining membership, you need to focus on keeping your organization alive. Moreover, this supposedly alternative model required traditional unions already doing things that were nontraditional to get off the ground. Without UFCW support, Our Walmart has basically done nothing. Maybe it is resilient in the sense that a few people are still trying. And that’s great! But neither is Our Walmart some sort of alternative to unions that demonstrates that if unions QUIT PLAYING POLITICS AND ORGANIZE!!! that a new labor movement will flower. The essay concludes with an odd point: We live in an era where the opportunity to bring people together is in transformation, thanks to continued technological developments that allow for the democratization of connection, information, and media. We also live in a time when poverty and inequality are destroying the fabric of America and the world. We know that the labor movement won’t survive in its current state—a state that allowed for the election of Donald Trump. The question for those of us invested in the future of labor is this: Are we bold enough to build something different, and better, than what has come before? Social media is a great thing. But social media is not going to organize the working class. Period. If capitalist technologies that are easily monitored by the bosses and where infiltrators and provocateurs can easily screw up these campaigns is the great alternative to stodgy unions, we have a long ways to go to recreate the labor movement. The people struggling to fight for the rights of themselves and their fellow workers are heroes. The people keeping Our Walmart going are doing necessary and incredibly difficult work. But that doesn’t mean we can allow for simplistic narratives about the future of the labor movement or the problems of the contemporary labor movement to dominate our thoughts about working class movements. I know we all like a clear narrative that diagnoses problems and suggests solutions without muddying the waters too much. This is how you get published and these are the books that sell. But not facing the problems with our own narratives doesn’t help us overcome the huge obstacles anyone fighting for working class power faces.

Log in to Reply Murc says: April 8, 2017 at 9:02 pm So this is a really common refrain on the labor left. Unions should stop with the politics and organize. The problem with this is that it’s totally disconnected from the reality of when and why unions succeed in this country. Mmm… maybe there’s more to it than that? I mean, you clearly know a hell of a lot more about this sort of thing than I, Erik, but while a large part of this is clearly “if only we get all the politics out of politics” wishing for a unicorn, I have to wonder if there’s more at work there. And to be specific… politics is deeply polarizing, by which I mean deeply tribal. If unions want to wield political power, that means engaging with one of the two current political coalitions currently existing in this country, and realistically that means engaging with only one of them: the Democrats. And there are a shit-ton of people who wouldn’t politically engage with the Democrats if they were literally on fire and the Democrats were standing there with a bucket of water. My mom did union work for the teacher’s union here in New York for awhile before she became an administrator. Most of the membership recognized that it had damn well better be involved with the Democratic Party… but, well, a lot of these teachers skewed older, white, and suburban, which means there were a non-trivial number of conservatives and Republicans in it. And they were a constant, unending problem; it offended them, on a deep and incandescent level, that were “forced” to be part of an organization they viewed as an appendage of the tribe they hated. They liked the things the union could give them, they just loathed the Democrats. Basically they wanted the union, they just didn’t want the politics the union necessitated, and because of they were a millstone. I have to wonder if some of the “lets stop with the politics” rhetoric comes from people eager to avoid that problem, or from alt-left types who don’t understand why all this culture war nonsense is infecting the glorious class struggle. Log in to Reply pdxtyler says: April 8, 2017 at 9:07 pm I feel like the article is making an important point that shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand though. One of the weakest parts of American labor law is the nlrb election process, and unions have largely accepted that recognition is a prerequisite for membership. There’s nothing stopping unions from experimenting with other types of membership, most just aren’t familiar with anything except NLRB elections or their public sector equivalents. In other countries workers are able to join up individually. My understanding is that this is how most organizing is done in the UK, unions build work place committees to address workplace issues and then they attempt to sign their co-workers up as members. Once they have a sufficient membership percentage they will likely attempt for recognition, but if they don’t reach that point the organization doesn’t go away. That’s very different from the norm in the US which is that after a lost election most unions just give up and any organization structure built at that point is lost. One thing that UK unions can offer individuals is protection from unfair dismissal due to at will employment not being the norm. I’d love to see a U.S. union offer an associate membership that offers employment protections, training and other benefits in the state of Montana. It’s the only state in the country thats not at-will, and attempting to establish workplace committees that immediately took on workplace issues as a step toward full recognition would be a really interesting pilot program. If you kept the dues nominal I think you could get sufficient interest to get off the ground, there’s got to be some folks working in service sector jobs in Butte whose families have union backgrounds. Log in to Reply Erik Loomis says: April 8, 2017 at 9:10 pm There’s no question that the NLRA is no longer effective. Unions are trying to figure out what to do about that. That includes the UFCW’s attempts to support Walmart organizing that the author fails to mention. I think the real point of this article is angrily subtweeting UFCW’s pullout from that campaign. But in any case, it’s not that there aren’t good points in the article. It’s that he doesn’t offer any actual solutions and in fact, I think a lot of what he does offer is not really valuable. Log in to Reply Brett says: April 8, 2017 at 9:46 pm I’ve become more sympathetic to UCFW curtailing the campaign. Unions have to nourish their membership and spend their dues where it can enhance the union meaningfully. They can’t afford to be the financier for all the many, many cash-strapped progressive efforts out there. Right for $15 might be next. Remember that SEIU announcement about a 30% cutback one spending? Log in to Reply Jake Nelson says: April 8, 2017 at 11:25 pm So, I’m sure I’ve posted something like this before in an LGM thread or three, so apologies to those who’ve read it, but… I am extremely skeptical that the “shop model” of unionization can survive even in its current paltry state for much longer. Even aside from things like how the DeVos family is again circulating their years-old proposal to outright ban collective bargaining itself… When I was doing local party activism, it was so frustrating that union officers’ idea of how to join a union was: 1) get an existing union job or 2) unionize your workplace. When the only way to join your club is to bring either a unicorn horn or a pegasus feather, you’re not going to have a growing membership. Plus, even union-sympathetic, willing to join, workers are put off by the lack of direct benefit to them the times it’s an option. I did overnight stock at my local Target for 7 years. Dozens of my coworkers also worked, or had worked, at Cub Foods, a large regional discount chain grocery store. Cub is UFCW. But everyone who worked both would tell you Cub had worse pay, benefits (and this even after Target’s benefits went to hell), work hours, schedule flexibility, working conditions, jerkass supervisors, etc, etc, etc. Now there’s a lot of valid points to make about that’s hardly UFCW’s fault, but it’s hardly helpful to recruiting to be abstractly in favor of/advocating unsuccessfully for things people can get next door. The system seems to be permanently screwed in a way that breaks the existing idea of how a private-sector union works. I don’t know what to do about that, other than a solution will have to let people join on their own, not already be employees of a union shop. (Public-sector unions, while obviously facing their own challenges, are a very different beast, and I’m even less sure how to help them. My utterly horrible school years made siding with teacher’s unions all the time extremely unpleasant- I did it anyway, of course, because there isn’t a choice.) Anyway, to try to make a statement other than anecdote, my main takeaway from years of dealing with it is that union leadership have no understanding of the current realities of the world outside a union, and 90+% of workers have no understanding of unions. Both tend to have vague ideas based mostly on a surface understanding of how things were 20-40 years ago. Unless something drastic changes, I only see that getting worse.

What I haven’t seen reported anywhere is the price Walmart paid to acquired Shoes.com. This afternoon, George Kirikos helped me uncover what appears to be the sale price that Walmart paid to acquire the Shoes.com domain name, associated domain names, and related intellectual property. According to a pdf of a court filing I found on the Alvarez & Marsal website, Walmart bid $9 million for the “Shoes.com Technologies domain names and intellectual property.” George Kirikos compiled several associated filings on his website. As George wrote, “After reading the above, one can see Walmart paid USD $9 million for the shoes.com domain name, plus minor related assets (social media accounts, lower quality domain names, and some trademark registrations.” Walmart paid USD $9 million for the https://t.co/P9VmeW1Omt domain name, as independently discovered by @DInvesting — George Kirikos (@GeorgeKirikos) April 8, 2017 This deal includes more than just the Shoes.com domain name. The other assets included in the sale are likely much less valuable, but I don’t think it can be recorded as a pure domain name sale. It is great to see a company like Walmart operating a descriptive keyword domain name like Shoes.com. It will be interesting to see how Walmart grows this brand and how much marketing Walmart puts behind the brand. Thanks to George for his help in uncovering what appears to be the price Walmart paid for Shoes.com and associated IP. 10 Comments - Join Discussion Email This Article Topics: Domain Sales Tweet About The Author: Elliot Silver is an Internet entrepreneur and publisher of DomainInvesting.com.

Reach out to Elliot: Twitter | Google + | Facebook | Email Comments (10) George Kirikos Based on the very low value of the other domain names, TMs, and social media accounts, I’d consider this a $9 million domain name deal. The rest of the assets were inconsequential, but Wal-Mart was forced to buy them to get the domain name. Reply April 8th, 2017 at 2:28 pm George Kirikos Just for some additional details, before I even got to the BC Court Services online, I went to PACER, and then to the US bankruptcy receiver’s website at; http://inverness.us/receivership-shoes-com-onlineshoes-com (there’s a separate US bankruptcy) That eventually inspired me to look to the Canadian bankruptcy records ($12, but worth it), to find the details. By the way, there was a note about a licensing deal for the Shoes.com domain name between the US company and the Canadian owner. The receiver records and the PACER documents confirm that that licensing deal was terminated, when the US bankruptcy assets were sold. So, Walmart gains the domain “cleanly” now, without any other side agreements, etc. Reply April 8th, 2017 at 2:39 pm Acro Wal-Mart is going on an all out war against Amazon for the online retail space. Amazon owns Zappos.com. The $9 million price tag is peanuts for WM and I hope they promote this brand aggressively. Reply April 8th, 2017 at 2:46 pm George Kirikos Marc Lore of Jet.com/Walmart (and Quidsi before that) certainly knows the value of domain names, given Quidsi owned Diapers.com, Soap.com and other domain names before being bought by Amazon years ago. Now he’s using the same playbook at Walmart. Strangely, Amazon just killed Quidsi! Reply April 8th, 2017 at 2:50 pm MM Not strange they killed Quidsi. They bought it for that one reason – to kill it, to take the competition out. Job well done. Now Lore is trying again with a system that worked for him and a new partner in crime. Reply April 8th, 2017 at 4:39 pm Anunt Why didn’t Amazon buy shoes.com??? Reply April 8th, 2017 at 5:12 pm R P In order to beat Amazon, amongst other things, you need to double/triple/quadruple serve different recognizable brands in search. Exact match .coms are instant, separate brands. That’s how I beat Amazon in selling licensed sports product online. Reply April 8th, 2017 at 5:34 pm Rob Great strategy in the part of Wal-Mart to compete against Amazon’s Zappos and the other big players in the U.S. Market. They, now, also have the opportunity to secure the Mexican Market … We’re Looking for a Domain Broker to offer Zapatos.mx and Zapatos.com.mx to http://Walmart.com.mx (Zapatos is Shoes in Spanish and .mx and .com.mx are the ccTLDs of Mexico). Reply April 8th, 2017 at 7:02 pm M. Menius The Walmart vs. Amazon competition has turned into an epic battle. At first brick-n-mortar vs. online, but now they are both morphing into something new with the online component taking the greater share. I hate to see local stores disappear, but the economics have clearly dictated this new direction. Reply April 8th, 2017 at 7:58 pm R P Perhaps, but this is a capitalist country and small business needs to adapt. Got to be more savvy. These goliaths can be slayed by wise, long term, niche marketing in certain categories. Amazon most often delivers the best price but doesn’t necessarily deliver the best overall value/info/new product info over the long term for a real enthusiast. It takes passion in any business to win. Amazon has low prices, great delivery time, but very little passion. Unfortunately I believe this new generation believes everything should be handed to them and don’t know the old school generations of hustle and hard work. Reply In reply to M.

Arthur Adams, 19, was shoplifting diapers at the Walmart in Pine Hills, Florida, on February 4 when he was shot and killed, according to reports on Thursday. Deputies say his assailant was a Walmart shopper, Lonnie Leonard, 51, of Apopka. Leonard also was arrested on two weapons charges. Adams’ two accomplices fled and were never caught. “What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened — one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm,” Orange County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Angelo Nieves said at the time of the shooting, according to Fox 35 Orlando. Deputies now say Adams was shot in the back. They said he and the accomplices were unarmed. The Orlando Sentinel reported that Leonard was armed with a 9 mm Winchester Luger and fired nine shots. Adams was struck twice. Adams was a gang member who was planning to sell the stolen diapers, the paper reported. Leonard thought he was catching a bad guy, his brother, Gary, told Fox 35. “He thought people was robbing Walmart,” Leonard said. “It’s a little nerveracking because he thought he was doing the right thing, and it turned out to be the wrong thing that he done, so he says from now on he’s going to mind his own business.” Leonard was ordered held in the Orange County jail on Thursday after failing to post bail.

Asa Hutchinson and top executives from major Arkansas companies will attend the 2017 Women in Information Technology conference on Wednesday at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. Hutchinson will speak, along with keynote speakers Rita Carney, a retired Wal-Mart executive, and Lisa Tuttle, chief information security officer for SPX Corp., according to a release. The conference also features two panel discussions including executives from Dillard's Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc. The event at the Donald W. Reynolds Center for Enterprise Development will be held Tuesday and Wednesday. It is sponsored by the Information Technology Research Institute at the Sam M. Walton College of Business. Tickets are $225 for the general public, $180 for UA staff or faculty, and $20 for students, who must provide ID. More information is available on the Information Technology Research Institute's website, itri.uark.edu. -- John Magsam KFC says no to antibiotic-raised chicken NEW YORK -- KFC said it plans to stop serving chicken raised with antibiotics important to human health. The fried-chicken chain said the change will be completed by the end of next year at its more than 4,000 U.S. restaurants. Other fast-food companies have made similar pledges, including McDonald's Corp. Meat producers give animals antibiotics to make them grow faster and prevent illness, a practice that has become a public health issue. Officials have said it can lead to germs becoming resistant to drugs, making antibiotics no longer effective in treating some illnesses in humans. KFC said it is working with more than 2,000 poultry farms around the country to make the change. The chain, owned by Louisville, Ky.-based Yum Brands Inc., said it is also in the process of removing artificial colors and flavors from certain menu items by the end of 2018. -- The Associated Press Adviser backs splitting bank operations WASHINGTON -- White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said Friday that separating Wall Street's investment and retail banking operations would increase lending by eliminating the need for burdensome regulations. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, said he supports President Donald Trump's call for a new version of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated lending banks from investment banking. "If we come up with a 21st-century, modern Glass-Steagall, we may be able to tailor regulation for different aspects of the financial markets and different aspects of the financial institutions and that would allow banks to get lending more aggressively to small- and medium-sized companies," Cohn said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. Cohn didn't provide specifics of what an updated version of Glass-Steagall would look like. He said it's consistent with the administration's efforts to decrease banking regulation and spur economic growth. Cohn's comments came after he told lawmakers in a private meeting Wednesday that he backed the separation of banks' business lines. A group of senators Thursday proposed legislation that would separate consumer and investment banking. Similar bills haven't gained traction in previous years. -- Bloomberg News Mexicans traveling to Canada, not U.S. WASHINGTON -- Airports in Miami, Orlando, San Antonio and Denver clocked fewer travelers coming from Mexico City and Guadalajara, Mexico, in the first two months of 2017, while Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver saw a surge in traffic from Mexico's capital. Mexicans may be choosing to alter their travel plans because of Twitter jabs from U.S. President Donald Trump, his plans for a wall to divide the two nations and uncertainty over travel restrictions. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on the other hand, announced plans last June to lift a visa requirement for Mexicans that allows them to enter the country with only a passport. "It's the uncertainty more than anything," said Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. "A lot of people have canceled their trips to the U.S. because they don't understand the new rules." -- Bloomberg News Ditch 12 Wells Fargo execs, firm urges CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A proxy advisory firm on Friday urged shareholders to vote against 12 of Wells Fargo's 15 directors over the bank's sales scandal. In a report, Institutional Shareholder Services said the 12 members of the board's audit, risk and human resources committees "failed over a number of years to provide a timely and sufficient risk oversight process that should have mitigated the harmful impact of the unsound retail banking sales practices that occurred from 2011-2016." The firm recommended yes votes for the three other board members -- new Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan and newcomers Karen Peetz and Ronald Sargent -- at the bank's annual shareholder meeting April 25 in Florida. Proxy advisory firms such as Institutional Shareholder Services play an important role in shaping the voting of big institutional investors such as pension funds. In September, regulators fined San Francisco-based Wells Fargo $185 million to settle allegations that its employees opened as many as 2 million fake accounts to meet high-pressure sales goals. The scandal has tarnished the bank's reputation, cost former CEO John Stumpf his job and spurred congressional hearings and new investigations. In a statement, the Wells Fargo board responded sharply to the report, highlighting its efforts to overhaul the bank's operations. "The extreme and unprecedented [Institutional Shareholder Services] voting recommendation on directors fails to recognize the active engagement of the Board and the substantial actions it has already taken to strengthen oversight and increase accountability at all levels of Wells Fargo, including important improvements to corporate governance," the statement said. -- Charlotte Observer Fitch cuts South Africa's credit rating LONDON -- South African debt got dealt a second blow in a week Friday as Fitch Ratings Ltd. joined S&P Global Ratings and cut the nation's credit assessment to junk following President Jacob Zuma's move to fire a well-respected finance minister. Fitch reduced the foreign-currency rating to BB+, the highest non-investment grade, the company said in a statement, four days after S&P reduced its assessment. The local-currency rating was also lowered one level to junk. The outlook is stable. Zuma fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who pushed for budget restraint, in a cabinet reshuffle on March 31, igniting South Africa's worst political crisis in almost a decade and sparking calls from top officials for Zuma to resign. Investors regard the firing as a blow to an economy growing at the slowest pace since a 2009 recession and grappling with 27 percent unemployment, and the nation's currency and bonds plunged. The downgrade "reflects Fitch's view that recent political events, including a major cabinet reshuffle, will weaken standards of governance and public finances," the company said. "The reshuffle is likely to undermine, if not reverse, progress in state-owned enterprises' governance, raising the risk that [the enterprises'] debt could migrate onto the government's balance sheet." Former President Kgalema Motlanthe said in an April 3 interview that Zuma doesn't understand how his actions can influence decisions by rating companies. Motlanthe argued that Zuma's actions showed a "recklessness" that ruined South Africa's credibility. -- Bloomberg News Business on 04/08/2017 Print Headline: KFC to phase out chickens' antibiotics Adviser calls to split banks' businesses Mexicans traveling to Canada, not U.S. Dairies protest Canadian import halts Fitch cuts South Africa's credit rating...

Screen Rant You Are Reading: Wonder Woman: Funko Movie Exclusives Line Revealed Share On Facebook Comments (1) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + QUIZZES TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next 97 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment Wonder Woman: Funko Movie Exclusives Line Revealed By Rose Moore 04.07.2017 1 Comment 97 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment Funko rolls out their line of Wonder Woman exclusives, including Dorbz, PopVinyls, and Rock Candy figures. The movie itself is less than two months away, and while fans wait to see the first lady of DC comics in her own solo movie, they are being treated to some sneak peeks at the tie-in merchandise for the film. So far, a Wonder Woman LEGO set has been revealed, which included a large LEGO Ares, sparking further speculation that the God of War is going to play a part in the film. In addition, Mattel showed off a sneak peek at some of their figures that will be arriving exclusively at Walmart this month. As with any major blockbuster, especially a superhero one, toys, collectibles and merchandise are big business, and there are sure to be plenty more on offer once the movie hits theaters. For many collectible fans, however, it’s Funko that is the big name in affordable figures – and the toy giant has now revealed their full line of Wonder Woman exclusive figures. Funko posted images of seven of their upcoming Wonder Woman exclusives on their blog today, including some available now and others that will be available next month. The exclusives include a Dorbz of Wonder Woman in her classic costume (Walmart exclusive), a Rock Candy figure of her in her classic costume with sword and shield (Hot Topic exclusive), a PopVinyl showing her on one knee with her shield in front of her (Walmart exclusive), a PopVinyl  of her in her Themyscira costume with her shield (Hot Topic exclusive), a PopVinyl of her in a blue evening gown with her sword (GameStop exclusive), a PopVinyl of her as Diana Prince with her shield (Entertainment Earth exclusive) and finally, a PopVinyl set of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor (FYE exclusive). These exclusives are in addition to the previously announced Funko figures for the film (which include Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor and Hippolyta PopVinyls, another Rock Candy figure, and a Pocket Pop keychain). The Diana Prince PopVinyl has also been seen already, when Funko revealed it last month. These new Funko figures are bound to sell well, as the film is one of the most anticipated of the year, and fans love the Funko brand. PopVinyls have become one of the most popular collector items, with figures available from a massive number of franchises. It’s likely that there will even be more Wonder Woman PopVinyl figures announced in the future if the movie does well, as especially popular films often have multiple PopVinyl collections released. Of course, not every fan of DC is going to be a fan of these figures, but for Funko collectors, these will make an adorable addition to the display cabinet.

(Source: Pixabay) (RNN) - Fresh Express is recalling some possibly contaminated prepackaged salad mix sold only at Walmart stores in the southeastern United States. The recall of a limited number of cases of Organic Marketside Spring Mix was announced Saturday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The company said "extraneous animal matter" was allegedly "found in a single container of the salad."  Federal officials recommended that two people who ate salad from a package of salad that reportedly contained a dead bat begin post-exposure rabies treatment. Lab testing could not rule out the possibility of the bat having rabies. The salad was purchased at a store in Florida. The recall concerns 5 oz. Organic Marketside Spring Mix sold in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.  The product was sold in a clear container with the production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017, on the front label and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 on the bottom of the container. Consumers should not eat the product and should discard it, the announcement said.   For full refunds, consumers should return to the place of purchase or call Fresh Express toll-free at 800 242-5472.  "People who have eaten the recalled salad product and did not find animal material are not at risk and do not need to contact their health department," the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said in a news release. "CDC recommends that anyone who ate the recalled salad product and found animal material in it contact their health department for evaluation." Copyright 2017 Raycom News Network.

EDT April 08, 2017 Green Salad (Photo: GSshot, Thinkstock) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Fresh Express is recalling some of its prepackaged salad mix after a bat was found in a bag sold at a Walmart, according to Florida health officials. According to a news release from Fresh Express, it is recalling the 5-ounce Organic Spring Mix with production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 located on the front label, and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 located on the bottom of the container. The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States. The news release referred to "extraneous animal matter," but The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the matter as a bat. The CDC said the bat was found by two people who had already ate some of the salad. They are being tested for rabies as a precaution. The bat was too deteriorated to be tested, officials said. The CDC said the two people report being in good health and the risk of rabies transmission is very low, but because the chance isn't zero, it is recommending the two begin rabies treatment. Consumers who  purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it, the CDC says. A full refund is available where purchased or by calling the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center toll-free at (800) 242-5472 between 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. EDT. © 2017 WTSP-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS WFAA Breaking News Violence erupts at Hemming Park 4 children taken to area hospitals Orlando area brush fire Lightning sparks fire at home in Mandarin Protesters rally after six arrested in Hemming Park Tweet is going viral for haunting look at domestic abuse FCL Friday April 7th Peterbrooke Chocolatier The Chat Friday April 7: Before We Go Brian Fogarty sentenced for reign of terror in Jax More Stories Protesters rally after six arrested in Hemming Park… Apr. 8, 2017, 10:54 a.m. Missing Neptune Beach man with early stages of… Apr. 8, 2017, 10:10 p.m. Why we love to live on the First Coast Jan 27, 2016, 5:58 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home National Politics Weather 7 Day Forecast Closings & Delays Radars Hurricane Central Conditions Beach Cam More...

Hot Topics: Latest police blotters Fall Harvest Car Show top 50 Addressing FM biz rumors Alzheimer's Walk Chat with Coroner Obits Print   Email   Font Resize Local News City 'leaking' $245M in retail sales Council hears results of retail analytics study By Jenni Grubbs Times Staff Writer Posted:   04/05/2017 06:44:07 PM MDT Fort Morgan's retail trade area is shown in yellow on this map created by TheRetailCoach for the city of Fort Morgan. The 2016 estimate for total consumers within this retail trade area was 38,227 with an average household income of $64,907, according to Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. (TheRetailCoach / Courtesy map) Fort Morgan businesses draw from a "retail trade area" with a population of more than 38,000, according to the results of a retail analytics study commissioned by the city. The identified retail trade area is the geographical area where this community's businesses get about 85 percent of their business, explained Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. But of the $624 million in potential retail sales that trade area and its 38,000-plus customers could generate, the city is benefiting from an estimated $379 million in actual retail sales, according to Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. He called the difference between the potential and actual retail sales the trade area's "leakage" or "gap." There was no surprise as to the source of that leakage, with people reporting that they were heading out of town to visit national chain restaurants and clothing stores that were not available in Fort Morgan, Farmer told the Fort Morgan City Council Tuesday night while delivering his company's retail study findings. "We know that quite a bit of retail dollars are leaving the community and heading west," he said. "You just don't have all of the retail, all of the restaurants that people leave town for." Advertisement The findings Farmer presented were based on gathering and sorting through many different kinds of data, all with a goal to "really get a feel for the market and really understand where are consumers coming from that are shopping and eating here, that are coming from outside of Fort Morgan," he told the council. "We know you've got that city limits population, that town limits population, that is eating, shopping here on a regular basis. But we also know you are getting people from outside the community. We call that the retail trade area." How that was determined may sound "a little scary" or " a little Big Brother-ish," Farmer said, "but I think you'll understand the use of this." TheRetailCoach did a "cell phone analysis," he said. "If you're shopping at Walmart or you're shopping downtown, you get a phone call, an email or a text. We're actually able to track your home address based off of that," Farmer said. "We're not selling the information or doing anything like that. We're just using it to understand where your consumers are coming from." He showed the council a "heat map" that indicated the number of people coming from various areas in and outside of Morgan County and who had shopped at Walmart in Fort Morgan at least one time over the last year. "We can look at specific times of the year or just lunch time," Farmer explained, and the contractor had created many other maps and reports about where and when people were shopping or visiting the city's retail stores or restaurants. "38,227 people are shopping in Fort Morgan on a regular basis," he said. "We realize you're getting people from outside of this area." Of those people, average household incomes were nearly $65,000 and average ages were 37 to 38, and that is only a couple of the types of data in Farmer's report. "What we've done is we've literally put together hundreds of pages of reports," he told the council. "Hundreds of pages of demographic information that a retail developer or site selector would be interested in." Farmer also had some advice for the city. "When it comes to recruiting retail, when it comes to even working with your existing businesses, forget about the city limits population," he said. "Retailers want to know where are those consumers coming from. Going forward, focus on that trade area population, which is almost 39,000." Further, there could be opportunities for the city with recruiting large, chain restaurants or clothing stores, he said. "There's about $23.5 million in clothing dollars that are leaving on a yearly basis," Farmer said. "Probably why we already have a clothing store interested in looking at the market is they see that." Similarly, the city was leaking almost $21 million spent at sit-down chain restaurants. "That number of almost $21 million in leakage is going to interest some of those casual sit-down restaurants," he said. But now begins the work of actually recruiting new businesses and meeting with the existing ones to look for opportunities for expansion or change, according to both Farmer and Fort Morgan Community Services/Economic Development Director Josh Miller. "We've been working with TheRetailCoach now since November," Miller said. "It's been helpful, as we look to the future and where we need to focus our attention in retail attraction specifically and what that might look like. Aaron's work thus far has generated a variety of reports for us that have proven helpful to better understand our market area, what our retail market looks like, what our opportunities are." "Having these specific dollar amounts to take to these retailers I think is going to help," Farmer told the council. TheRetailCoach will continue to work with the Fort Morgan Economic Development Department on recruitment, retention and more, according to both Farmer and Miller. "Really there's a couple ways this gap analysis, this leakage analysis can be used," Farmer explained. "Number one, it's to recruit businesses in, to recruit retailers that are not here into the market. We want to work with existing businesses. That's the other way it can be used. We're going to be having a meeting with existing businesses, downtown merchants and some others in the next few months. If there's an opportunity for an existing store here to expand their business or expand and carry different items or brands that people are buying, that's another way. The third is obviously entrepreneur-ism, somebody coming into the market and opening up a business." City Manager Jeff Wells pointed out that the goal was not to bring in businesses to compete with the existing ones already here, but to capture the leakage to businesses in other trade areas. The city's contract with TheRetailCoach is for at least two years from last October, with an option for a third year. The contractor's services are being funded both by Fort Morgan capital improvement dollars and a grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

Co-ordinated police investigation Lisa Rutledge, Times Staff Supt. Pat Dietrich, investigative commander of the region’s police force, speaks during a press conference at the Kitchener RCMP detachment Friday (April 7). next play/pause pre Cambridge Times By Lisa Rutledge WATERLOO REGION – In a dramatic drug bust in Cambridge’s Walmart parking lot Thursday (April 6), police say they seized 38.5 kilograms of cocaine and triggered 12 arrests as part of a multi-jurisdictional investigation into a sophisticated drug network. The investigation -- dubbed Project Owing -- set in motion a chain of events that included the execution of 14 search warrants in Waterloo Region, Toronto and Windsor. Twelve people, ranging in age from 30 to 62, were charged with drug possession and drug importing offences. Nine of those charged are residents of Waterloo Region, including eight from Kitchener and one from Cambridge. Police say they seized 38.5 kilograms  of powdered cocaine bricks worth an estimated wholesale value of $1.75 million, but even more when mixed with other drug substances and sold by individual dealers. A kilo of cocaine could fetch as much as $45,000 in the region, according to police sources. The cross-jurisdiction international drug investigation, which involved the RCMP’s Kitchener detachment, Waterloo Regional Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration, also resulted in the seizure of five luxury vehicles and about $15,000 Cdn. Thursday’s operation by the RCMP’s emergency response team was caught on video by a local resident who described it as something straight out of a movie. At a news conference Friday morning at Kitchener’s RCMP detachment, police outlined the operation,  which began taking shape in September 2016. RCMP Supt. Jamie Jagoe said the tactical unit was ready and waiting in the local parking lot. “We believed the individuals behind this conspiracy were ready to pick up a load of cocaine, and as a result of that, we decided that would be the most opportune time to arrest those individuals,” he said. Project Owing, say police, was a success thanks to a shared commitment to combining intelligence and resources that uncovered an organized drug ring funnelling cocaine from Los Angeles to Waterloo Region. The co-ordinated search warrants and  arrests were described as strategic and calculated. Investigators say they found evidence that drugs were being trucked into Canada hidden in secret floor compartments in commercial trucks carrying legitimate cargo. Additional charges may be levied against companies operating the vehicles. Those charged locally, many of whom were known to police, were alleged to have been involved in a plan to facilitate travel to California to pick up a shipment of cocaine and bring it back to Canada. “This is a very well-organized crime group that was responsible, we believe, for importing large amounts of cocaine into our community,” said Jagoe. “They were well-versed in how to move contraband across international borders.” Supt. Pat Dietrich, investigative commander of the region’s police force, described Waterloo Region as a key pivot point for drug importers and dealers. “Based on the organization and the fact they were all local, this is somewhat of a distribution hub.” At a time when local police forces and health-oriented agencies are struggling to address a crisis of drug overdoses, it’s hoped the sheer size of the operation could put a dent in local cocaine distribution. “The impact of illicit drugs in our community is on the rise,” said Dietrich, “and this investigation will significantly impact the distribution of cocaine locally, a drug that is increasingly being combined with other illicit drugs like fentanyl, resulting in overdoses and fatal consequences.”   Lisa Rutledge is a Reporter/Photographer for the Cambridge Times.

The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States.

Out of an abundance of caution, all salads manufactured in the same production run are being recalled. No other Marketside salads are included in the recall. Fresh Express salads are not subject to a recall. Walmart acted quickly to remove the product from store shelves. Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it. A full refund is available where purchased or by calling the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center toll-free at (800) 242-5472 during the hours of 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time. Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation and initiate product removal and recall procedures. Fresh Express takes matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulations including the proscribed Good Agricultural Practices. In addition, a range of stringent controls are in place during growing and harvesting to mitigate against field material from entering the raw product system. In manufacturing, additional controls including thorough washing and filtration systems as well as visual inspections that are designed to eliminate unwanted debris.

The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States.

Apr 7, 2017 Finding Self-Reliance in May Sarton’s ‘Dead Center’ Apr 7, 2017 Notes Home Most Popular On The Atlantic Carlos Barria / Reuters Seven Lessons From Trump's Syria Strike David Frum The attack raises a series of questions about the president’s approach to America’s political processes and institutions. When the Electoral College elevated Donald Trump to the presidency, it conferred on him the awesome life-and-death powers that attend the office. It was inevitable that President Trump would use those powers sooner or later. Now he has. For the effects on the region, I refer you to the powerful piece by The Atlantic’s Andrew Exum. I’m concerned here with the effects on the U.S. political system. Seven seem most immediately relevant. Trump’s Words Mean Nothing If there was any one foreign policy position that Donald Trump stressed above all others, it was opposition to the use of force in Syria. Time has helpfully compiled Trump’s tweets on the subject dating back to 2013. For example: We should stay the hell out of Syria, the "rebels" are just as bad as the current regime. WHAT WILL WE GET FOR OUR LIVES AND $ BILLIONS?ZERO — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2013 Continue Reading Kendall and Kylie / YouTube How on Earth Does an Ad Like Pepsi's Get Approved? Joe Pinsker The backlash-provoking spot likely came out of a months-long, multimillion-dollar process that offered producers plenty of opportunities to spike it. This week, after a new, activism-themed ad from Pepsi fizzled when it was met with backlash on social media, the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel told his audience, "The fact that this somehow made it through—I can't imagine how many meetings, and edits, and pitches, and then got the thumbs-up from who-knows-how-many people is absolutely mind-boggling.” With one marketing firm estimating that at one point this week, roughly three-quarters of social-media engagement around the phrase “tone-deaf” mentioned Pepsi or the ad’s star, the 21-year-old model Kendall Jenner, Kimmel was articulating a widespread bafflement: How does a company—a major global brand worth more than $150 billion—make a multimillion-dollar advertisement that it later has to pull, conceding that it had “clearly missed the mark”? How could a bunch of well-paid, supposedly zeitgeist-fluent copywriters, art directors, and marketing executives have agreed that, indeed, the message the company should put out into the world is that the soda they were promoting is what can bring the country together at a fractious time? Continue Reading The Filthy Moralist James Parker How the comedian Louis C.K. became America’s unlikely conscience Try this, Hollywood. A middle-class American man, a husband, a father—you know, that guy—is addicted to Internet pornography. Night after night, while the house sleeps, he’s out there, browsing the cyber-fleshpots, trolling the tides of electronic lust. His vice deepens; his kinks get connoisseurial. Until one night he has an Experience. An Epiphany. He sees it all so clearly: the loss, the deadness, the degradation, the entire tragic panorama of porn. He must give it up—and more than that, he must seek absolution. He must quit his job (insurance? sales?), travel like a post-porn pilgrim to the San Fernando Valley, find the women in whose debasement he has most assiduously, if remotely, participated, get down on his knees, and beg for their forgiveness. And then, from there … I dunno. Could be a sort of weirdo rom-com, as our hero falls for a scornful porn queen. Or maybe one of the girls is caught up in a gangster subplot and he rescues her, Liam Neeson–style. I leave this to the writers. The leading man, however, is nonnegotiable: he has to be Louis C.K. Continue Reading Craig Ruttle / AP When Gut Bacteria Change Brain Function David Kohn Some researchers believe that the microbiome may play a role in regulating how people think and feel. By now, the idea that gut bacteria affect a person’s health is not revolutionary. Many people know that these microbes influence digestion, allergies, and metabolism. The trend has become almost commonplace: New books appear regularly detailing precisely which diet will lead to optimum bacterial health. But these microbes’ reach may extend much further, into the human brains. A growing group of researchers around the world are investigating how the microbiome, as this bacterial ecosystem is known, regulates how people think and feel. Scientists have found evidence that this assemblage—about a thousand different species of bacteria, trillions of cells that together weigh between one and three pounds—could play a crucial role in autism, anxiety, depression, and other disorders. Continue Reading Peter Ryan Donald Trump’s Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president during his time in office President Donald Trump still has not taken the necessary steps to distance himself from his businesses while in office. In accordance with a plan that he and one of his lawyers, Sheri Dillon, laid out at a press conference on January 11, Trump has filed paperwork to remove himself from the day-to-day operation of his eponymous organization. However, numerous ethics experts have voiced strenuous objections to the plan, which they say does very little to resolve the issue: As long as Trump continues to profit from his business empire—which he does whether or not he is nominally in charge—they say, the possibility that outside actors will attempt to affect his policies by plumping up his pocketbook will remain very much in play. Continue Reading Patrick Fallon / Reuters Trump’s Disillusioned Supporters Rosie Gray The president’s military action in Syria is a bitter disappointment for some of his biggest fans. Updated at 4:25 p.m. President Trump’s decision to launch airstrikes against the Syrian regime in response to a chemical weapons attack has made him abnormally popular with the elites who inhabit the swamp he campaigned against. MSNBC’s Brian Williams hailed video of the strikes as “beautiful,” and CNN’s Fareed Zakaria identified this as the moment when Trump became president. But it has been a bitterly disappointing turn of events for some of his most ardent supporters in the white nationalist alt-right movement and in adjacent political circles, who have supported Trump from the beginning of his campaign and who were enthralled by his promises to not get involved in Middle East conflicts. The strikes, and the about-face they represent in terms of Trump’s posture towards the Middle East, reveal a White House showing less-than-full devotion to the movement that formed the ideological backbone for Trump’s election. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, for example, the former Breitbart chairman who represents ideological Trumpism within the White House, is locked in a battle for influence with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a more pragmatic operator who appears to be nudging Trump in a more mainstream direction—a battle which Kushner, as a family member, is better-positioned to win. Continue Reading UN Sources Say Syrian Rebels — Not Assad — Used Sarin Gas Adam Clark Estes A member of the United Nations commission of inquiry announced on a Swiss-Italian television show that they believe the Syrian rebels have used chemical weapons on Assad's troops. This article is from the archive of our partner . A member of the United Nations commission of inquiry announced on a Swiss-Italian television show that they believe the Syrian rebels have used chemical weapons on Assad's troops. "Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report of last week which I have seen, there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas, from the way the victims were treated," said Carla Del Ponte, a member of the commission. "This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities." Well, this complicates matters. It was just ten days ago that the United States shook its fist and officially declared that chemical weapons were being used by the Assad regime against its own people. This indicated that the Syrian government had crossed the "red line" that Obama determined last year and opened the possibility of greater U.S. involvement. But if it was the other way around — if the good guys sprayed sarin gas on the bad guys? That makes assisting the rebels a much more complicated transaction. Chemical weapons are horrible, no doubt about that. And sarin gas is absolutely off limits, according to the Geneva Protocol, and with three reported uses in Syria, it's not like it was an accident.

Perhaps then it’s no surprise that people addicted to opioids have considered the converse. If a drug that gets you high causes constipation, could a drug that causes constipation get you high? Yes, and that drug is another opioid called loperamide, better known by its brand name Imodium as an over-the-counter treatment for diarrhea. At extremely high doses—dozens or even hundreds of pills a day—it can produce a high or ease withdrawal symptoms. And in the middle of a national opioid epidemic, overdoses of loperamide are rising, too. “It’s a cheap, legal, and easily accessible opioid alternative,” said William Eggleston, a clinical toxicologist at SUNY Upstate Medical University.  Eggleston authored a case report last year about two men who died of loperamide overdoses. Such case reports have been piling up—in Texas, Arizona, and most recently Rhode Island. Nationally, the number of calls to poison centers for intentional loperamide exposure more than doubled between 2010 and 2015. And the FDA has issued an alert for doctors to look out for loperamide misuse. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters The Obama Doctrine, R.I.P. Jeffrey Goldberg Under pressure to respond to Assad’s use of chemical weapons, Trump reached for the same playbook that his predecessor resisted opening. President Obama’s foreign policy doctrine, like many foreign policy doctrines, was contradictory at times, and it sometimes lacked coherence. Obama himself resisted the desire of others (including yours truly) to corral his various foreign policy and national security impulses into a comprehensive, globe-spanning, capital-D doctrine. But Obama possessed a number of well-developed foreign policy predispositions, and he exhibited, over time and under pressure, extraordinary fidelity to some of these views. One such view held that the U.S. has traditionally paid too much attention to the Middle East, and that, in any case, even concentrated American attention could not make the region a better place—and actually, in some instances, made it worse. Another of Obama’s salient foreign policy views held that the U.S., particularly in the Middle East, had traditionally been too quick to pursue military solutions to problems that neither represented core U.S. national security interests, nor were susceptible to amelioration by missile strike.

Those records and intercepts would become the core of the Obama administration’s evidentiary case linking the Syrian government to what one official called an ‘indiscriminate, inconceivable horror’—the use of outlawed toxins to kill nearly 1,500 civilians, including at least 426 children.” Continue Reading More Popular Stories On This Page: What Do You Know ...

S. Merwin Q of the Week: Where Should Trump Donate His Salary? Finding Self-Reliance in May Sarton’s ‘Dead Center’ More Most Popular On The Atlantic Carlos Barria / Reuters Seven Lessons From Trump's Syria Strike David Frum The attack raises a series of questions about the president’s approach to America’s political processes and institutions. When the Electoral College elevated Donald Trump to the presidency, it conferred on him the awesome life-and-death powers that attend the office. It was inevitable that President Trump would use those powers sooner or later. Now he has. For the effects on the region, I refer you to the powerful piece by The Atlantic’s Andrew Exum. I’m concerned here with the effects on the U.S. political system. Seven seem most immediately relevant. Trump’s Words Mean Nothing If there was any one foreign policy position that Donald Trump stressed above all others, it was opposition to the use of force in Syria. Time has helpfully compiled Trump’s tweets on the subject dating back to 2013. For example: We should stay the hell out of Syria, the "rebels" are just as bad as the current regime.

Joe Pinsker The backlash-provoking spot likely came out of a months-long, multimillion-dollar process that offered producers plenty of opportunities to spike it. This week, after a new, activism-themed ad from Pepsi fizzled when it was met with backlash on social media, the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel told his audience, "The fact that this somehow made it through—I can't imagine how many meetings, and edits, and pitches, and then got the thumbs-up from who-knows-how-many people is absolutely mind-boggling.” With one marketing firm estimating that at one point this week, roughly three-quarters of social-media engagement around the phrase “tone-deaf” mentioned Pepsi or the ad’s star, the 21-year-old model Kendall Jenner, Kimmel was articulating a widespread bafflement: How does a company—a major global brand worth more than $150 billion—make a multimillion-dollar advertisement that it later has to pull, conceding that it had “clearly missed the mark”? How could a bunch of well-paid, supposedly zeitgeist-fluent copywriters, art directors, and marketing executives have agreed that, indeed, the message the company should put out into the world is that the soda they were promoting is what can bring the country together at a fractious time? Continue Reading The Filthy Moralist James Parker How the comedian Louis C.K. became America’s unlikely conscience Try this, Hollywood. A middle-class American man, a husband, a father—you know, that guy—is addicted to Internet pornography. Night after night, while the house sleeps, he’s out there, browsing the cyber-fleshpots, trolling the tides of electronic lust. His vice deepens; his kinks get connoisseurial. Until one night he has an Experience. An Epiphany. He sees it all so clearly: the loss, the deadness, the degradation, the entire tragic panorama of porn. He must give it up—and more than that, he must seek absolution. He must quit his job (insurance? sales?), travel like a post-porn pilgrim to the San Fernando Valley, find the women in whose debasement he has most assiduously, if remotely, participated, get down on his knees, and beg for their forgiveness. And then, from there … I dunno. Could be a sort of weirdo rom-com, as our hero falls for a scornful porn queen. Or maybe one of the girls is caught up in a gangster subplot and he rescues her, Liam Neeson–style. I leave this to the writers. The leading man, however, is nonnegotiable: he has to be Louis C.K. Continue Reading Craig Ruttle / AP When Gut Bacteria Change Brain Function David Kohn Some researchers believe that the microbiome may play a role in regulating how people think and feel. By now, the idea that gut bacteria affect a person’s health is not revolutionary. Many people know that these microbes influence digestion, allergies, and metabolism. The trend has become almost commonplace: New books appear regularly detailing precisely which diet will lead to optimum bacterial health. But these microbes’ reach may extend much further, into the human brains. A growing group of researchers around the world are investigating how the microbiome, as this bacterial ecosystem is known, regulates how people think and feel. Scientists have found evidence that this assemblage—about a thousand different species of bacteria, trillions of cells that together weigh between one and three pounds—could play a crucial role in autism, anxiety, depression, and other disorders. Continue Reading Peter Ryan Donald Trump’s Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president during his time in office President Donald Trump still has not taken the necessary steps to distance himself from his businesses while in office. In accordance with a plan that he and one of his lawyers, Sheri Dillon, laid out at a press conference on January 11, Trump has filed paperwork to remove himself from the day-to-day operation of his eponymous organization. However, numerous ethics experts have voiced strenuous objections to the plan, which they say does very little to resolve the issue: As long as Trump continues to profit from his business empire—which he does whether or not he is nominally in charge—they say, the possibility that outside actors will attempt to affect his policies by plumping up his pocketbook will remain very much in play. Continue Reading Patrick Fallon / Reuters Trump’s Disillusioned Supporters Rosie Gray The president’s military action in Syria is a bitter disappointment for some of his biggest fans. Updated at 4:25 p.m. President Trump’s decision to launch airstrikes against the Syrian regime in response to a chemical weapons attack has made him abnormally popular with the elites who inhabit the swamp he campaigned against. MSNBC’s Brian Williams hailed video of the strikes as “beautiful,” and CNN’s Fareed Zakaria identified this as the moment when Trump became president. But it has been a bitterly disappointing turn of events for some of his most ardent supporters in the white nationalist alt-right movement and in adjacent political circles, who have supported Trump from the beginning of his campaign and who were enthralled by his promises to not get involved in Middle East conflicts. The strikes, and the about-face they represent in terms of Trump’s posture towards the Middle East, reveal a White House showing less-than-full devotion to the movement that formed the ideological backbone for Trump’s election. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, for example, the former Breitbart chairman who represents ideological Trumpism within the White House, is locked in a battle for influence with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a more pragmatic operator who appears to be nudging Trump in a more mainstream direction—a battle which Kushner, as a family member, is better-positioned to win. Continue Reading UN Sources Say Syrian Rebels — Not Assad — Used Sarin Gas Adam Clark Estes A member of the United Nations commission of inquiry announced on a Swiss-Italian television show that they believe the Syrian rebels have used chemical weapons on Assad's troops. This article is from the archive of our partner . A member of the United Nations commission of inquiry announced on a Swiss-Italian television show that they believe the Syrian rebels have used chemical weapons on Assad's troops. "Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report of last week which I have seen, there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas, from the way the victims were treated," said Carla Del Ponte, a member of the commission. "This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities." Well, this complicates matters. It was just ten days ago that the United States shook its fist and officially declared that chemical weapons were being used by the Assad regime against its own people. This indicated that the Syrian government had crossed the "red line" that Obama determined last year and opened the possibility of greater U.S. involvement. But if it was the other way around — if the good guys sprayed sarin gas on the bad guys? That makes assisting the rebels a much more complicated transaction. Chemical weapons are horrible, no doubt about that. And sarin gas is absolutely off limits, according to the Geneva Protocol, and with three reported uses in Syria, it's not like it was an accident. Also, chemical weapons are horrible.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Apr 8th 2017 10:09AM Retailers are closing thousands of stores in one of the biggest waves of closures in years. But there's one company bucking that trend: Dollar General. Instead of shutting down stores, Dollar General is opening hundreds more locations. The discount chain says it plans to open 1,000 stores this year, bringing its total store count to more than 14,300. The chain announced its plans after reporting that sales grew nearly 14% in the most recent quarter, to $6.01 billion. Check out the retailers that are closing stores in 2017: 14 PHOTOS Retailers closing stores in 2017 See Gallery Retailers closing stores in 2017 Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This HIDE CAPTION SHOW CAPTION of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE We went to a Dollar General store in Richmond, Virginia, to find out what makes it so successful. At the entrance of the store, shoppers are greeted with a "last chance" table of discounted goods. The store feels tiny. Most Dollar General Stores range between 7,000 and 10,000 feet which is about half the size of a CVS store. It's lit with bright, fluorescent lights and features narrow aisles with basic metal shelving. To the left of the entrance, there's a large selection of snacks, drinks, and candy similar to what you might find at a gas station or convenience store. Wine and beer is easily accessible. There is only one refrigerated section in the store. It features dairy products like cheese, milk, and eggs, as well as frozen meals and pizzas. This section of the store also features dry packages foods like cereal and soup. One aisle features items that all cost $1. These products aren't necessarily discounted, they just come in smaller package sizes than what shoppers would find at Walmart or Kroger. For example, this box contains just five trash bags, compared to the boxes of 24 or more bags that Walmart carries. I compared Dollar General's prices on these trash bags and six other items to Walmart's prices for the same products, and I found minimal differences. Dollar General was nearly 3% more expensive overall on a basket that cost $35.75. I was surprised to find clothing, lingerie, and shoes in the store. There's also toys, gardening equipment, kitchen tools and small appliances, home decorations, and craft supplies. No shelf space goes unused. It seems that Dollar General has managed to squeeze everything you would find at a Walmart store into one tenth of the space. This helps keeps costs low by ensuring that the stores are cheap to build and require very little labor. Dollar General typically staffs only two to four employees at a time to work the registers and keep the shelves stocked. But the close quarters mean the aisles are a mess when employees are restocking shelves. Some of the merchandise is also in disarray. One aisle devoted to vitamins and over-the-counter medications was completely blocked by an empty box. Some boxes are deliberately placed in the aisles to bring attention to special deals. There are also branded displays around the store like this station of Starbucks drinks. Shoppers don't seem to mind the cramped space. The smaller store size means they can get in and out of the store quickly with whatever they need. The register was empty when I tried to check out. I waited five minutes and eventually left to find an employee who could help me. Dollar General's strategy to keep prices low by driving down labor and infrastructure costs is readily apparent in the stores. But the breadth of products in such a conveniently sized store is unparalleled, making it clear why Dollar General is growing when most other retailers are shrinking.

There were no injuries.   | (6) Comment By | APRIL 08, 2017 04:32 PM Actions have consequences.. how do you expect her to learn from the mistake if you jus let it slide. She should not be tried as an adult simply because she's not. If she doesn't realize what she has done and how she has effected an entire community she'll will continue on this path. 12   3 Report as Offensive By Jericho | APRIL 08, 2017 03:42 PM We all feel the strain. Especially those who have lost business over mega cooperations, our kids go to school to learn how to be robots. Part of a disgusting age of mass production. Obviously those who are out of work will be compensated right? NO! But Walmart will have an insurance calm to cash in. If Walmart is a beacon of hope to Alliston, it will pay its lost time to employees. As for the girl, mental illness isn't a reason for incarceration. Not a single person was harmed. Let's help those in need, I am sick of this bull hate I see, it's the same with the anti abortion rally the church holds in the Center of town. Be ashamed. This girl needs help, not a witch hunt. 7   25 Report as Offensive By Cassandra | APRIL 08, 2017 02:21 PM The strain I was speaking of was to the hospital and walk in clinic, to the people who have to pay rent, put food on the table, pay tuition, etc., the strain on the community at large for having to add extra time and expense to seeking medical attention, the people who need their prescriptions from the pharmacy. There is a strain - to our community - it was directly caused by this girl. This girl gives you "hope"??? What the heck are you hoping for?? To have your life put in turmoil because of the INTENTIONAL actions of this girl?? The only thing I am hoping for is that she is made to answer for her PREMEDITATED actions. She had time to change her mind and chose to continue with her PLAN. How does this possibly give you "Hope"? 31   8 Report as Offensive By | APRIL 08, 2017 02:07 PM There are hundreds of people who are out of work because of this girls stupidity. Yes there were people who witnessed what she did. There was a full night crew working their shifts and could've lost their lives because this girl decided it was a good idea to deliberately start a fire. Our young offenders act needs to change and she needs to feel the wrath of her actions. Everybody makes choices in life and we must all take responsibility for our actions and how they will affect not only ourselves, but other people as well. So no I don't feel sorry for this girl who should now be tried as an adult. 38   13 Report as Offensive By | APRIL 08, 2017 01:22 PM I don't care about the so called "strain" or who ever you claim to be affected. Walmart is not your friend, not your mom and pop Alliston run business. They are a mega CORPORATION. The employees will be fine as no one was made to witness the event except for that poor scared girl. Do not try her. Come on people rally around your community. The youth in new techumseth and around our messed up world need you. We need each other. Grow up and show some love. Imagine if that was your friend, daughter, sister, mother, niece, cousin or daughter. These comments make me sick and that girl gives me hope. 10   90 Report as Offensive ( Page 1 of 2 ) Next >> Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Latest Local News WhatsOn Volunteers ready for Barrie's annual Day of Giving Snapshot ArtsEntertainment Innisfil's Emily Roberts competing in Miss Northern Ontario pageant Snapshot Music Midland Cultural Centre welcoming back bluesman Steve Strongman Snapshot Education Orillia's Orchard Park school scores high marks for green achievement Snapshot PHOTOS AND VIDEOS View All Photos View All Videos Photo Gallery Totten-hug News Georgian College kicks off 50th anniversary celebration in Barrie Ontario Friends of the Utopia Gristmill awarded Ontario150 grant Photo Gallery Midland's King Street redesign plans revealed The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Alliston Walmart closed following suspected arson Barrie, Innisfil men charged with first-degree murder Barrie ‘guest’ arrested after man found in neighbour’s bedroom Truck involved in fatal Innisfil crash “grossly unsafe,” officer testifies Portion of Barrie's Collier Centre up for sale, developer confirms In Your Neighbourhood Today Don’t forget about these 2 winter tasks!

Shannon Morrison stands in front of the Fresno County Public Library's Digibus as it visits Kerman, Calif., on March 23. The revamped Winnebago offers free computer skills classes for residents. By Carmen George, The Fresno Bee Published: April 8, 2017, 6:04 AM A   A FRESNO, Calif. — Librarian Shannon Morrison recently drove a large bus into a Wal-Mart parking lot while wearing a long blue skirt covered with prints of Hawaiian hibiscus flowers. “She’s one to try anything,” says fellow Fresno County community librarian Michelle Gordon. “She’s very adventurous.” Hearing this across the parking lot, the normally soft-spoken Morrison raises her library voice to project excitement: “I think that’s part of why I find it so much fun — it’s like an adventure!” Morrison is no ordinary librarian, and she drives no ordinary bus. She’s the guardian of the Digibus — a new mobile computer classroom manned by librarians that hit the road at the end of January bound for Fresno County communities with the aim of bringing computer literacy and job-search skills to all. “I never thought in a million years that I’d be driving a Winnebago that’s almost 40 feet around the community,” Morrison says, “but it really fits my personality. … A lot of people don’t realize how much I’m outgoing, and how much I like to come to them and be really with them and care for them and be a part of who they are — not so much waiting for them to come to me.” Morrison and her Digibus came to the aid of people in Kerman last week. Maria Batres was among those who boarded the bus parked in the Wal-Mart parking lot. The 43-year-old mother of five and grandmother of three is working to better understand how to use a computer so she can access online resources to help her learn English and study to become a U.S. citizen. Batres used a computer for the first time two years ago. She says many of her friends and family members don’t have a computer at home and are also still learning how to use them. Batres has seasonal work driving a truck. She says she likes truck driving, but hopes more education can help her get a better job working at a restaurant. During her Digibus visit, Batres was assisted by Maria Conchas, a bilingual instructor and interpreter. Three other women, one with a baby in a stroller, boarded the bus after Batres on Thursday morning to use some of the 12 computer tablets with keyboards. The bus was donated by Reading and Beyond and was transformed into a mobile computer classroom last year thanks to a $90,000 state library grant, with matched funds from the county. The transformation includes a futuristic blue paint job featuring computer coding. The Digibus has stops scheduled through June, but Morrison expects its travels to continue long into the future. It now visits two communities a month for one week each. Digibus services, all provided at no cost, currently include teaching basic computer skills, such as how to use email and browse the internet, along with job preparedness, including r?sum? writing and searching and applying for jobs online. Morrison says a future bus tour could include more advanced training, like how to create videos and apps, but before that happens, a number of young people surveyed asked librarians to first focus on helping their parents with “digital literacy.” One recent Digibus visitor didn’t know how to use a computer mouse. The Digibus is part of Fresno County Library’s WoW! program, which stands for a library “without walls.” Among the WoW! projects is a mobile library that travels to senior living facilities and schools. One of Morrison’s most rewarding experiences on the Digibus was helping a farmworker finish her r?sum? to apply for new work. The woman was able print her resume on the bus and leave with it in hand. Morrison hopes to help many more on her Digibus adventures. “Drop all hinderances, approach the bus,” Morrison says to all. “Come in, we’re friendly, we’re nice, we want to serve you — even if it’s just to get a library card … or even if you just want to sit somewhere that’s cool or warm. Come in. Come in, spend some time on there. It’s here for you.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Date: 2017-04-08 04:39 More videos «Bounty paper towels research articles» Research Paper - Wipe It Up - Google Sites History | Bounty News Bounty - Official Site To test absorbency per a given amount of area, I cut each towel to the same size and weighed them dry with the American Weigh Signature Pocket Scale , which resolves gram. 6 I then dropped, removed, and held up the paper towels for a set number of seconds at each stage before weighing them again. I tested five sheets each of Bounty and Viva, and of two eco-friendly alternatives. Research Paper - Wipe It Up - Google Sites The most apparent solution for this problem is to tell you what to write in paper towel research paper, so have a look on the following given facts about paper towels that can be effectively utilized in paper towel research paper. History | Bounty News * Most read reviews this week: The Best Dishwasher , The Best Flashlight , and The Best Wine Glasses. [ See all 65 most popular reviews this week.] Bounty - Official Site A near-exclusive Walmart brand, White Cloud, has a recycled Green Earth variety that consistently rates a bit higher than Marcal. Having used it for a few weeks alongside the Marcal towels, however, I would recommend it over Marcal only if Walmart is a regular shopping stop. You don’t want to drive extra miles to get better recycled goods, after all. As mentioned above, in our tests we prioritized scrubbing ability and wet strength over softness or absorption. But if getting the most absorption is your number one priority in a paper towel, Viva Choose-A-Sheet is your best pick. If you’re indifferent between absorbency and scrubbing ability, just go with whichever brand is cheaper. But don’t expect too much in savings between the brands: Looking closely at the pricing, we’ve seen that Bounty and Viva costs per square feet can fluctuate but stay competitively close. We help support the hundreds of hours that go into our evaluations through affiliate commissions on purchases made through our links. We’re committed to publishing unbiased guides that clearly detail our decision-making criteria to our readers, but we just want you to know. Bounty Select-A-Size is just Bounty, but with more tear-off points that many people find convenient for reducing unnecessary use. And Bounty is quite good at what it does, as we and other testers see it. P& G recognized the growing demand for paper towels and began a decade of research, experimentation, and ultimately, innovation. We actively moderate the comments section to make it relevant and helpful for our readers, and to stay up to date with our latest picks. You can read our moderation policy FAQ here.

Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease. The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies. Transmission of rabies by eating a rabid animal is extremely uncommon, and the virus does not survive very long outside of the infected animal. CDC is supporting Florida local and state health officials in evaluating the people who found the bat in the salad. In this circumstance, the risk of rabies transmission is considered to be very low, but because it isn’t zero, the two people who ate salad from the package that contained the bat were recommended to begin post-exposure rabies treatment. Both people report being in good health and neither has any signs of rabies. CDC is not aware of any other reports of bat material found in packaged salads. On April 8, 2017, Fresh Express issued a recall of a limited number of cases of Organic Marketside Spring Mix. The salads were sold in a clear container with production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 located on the front label. The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States (AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, VA). All remaining packages of salad from the same lot have been removed from all store locations where the salad was sold. Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it.

Using the metric of county statistics, the answer is Colorado's Aspen (pictured here) and Wyoming's Jackson (Pitkin and Teton counties respectively). JACKSON, WYO. — Which ski towns have the biggest bucks? (And no, this isn't a joke about masculinity). Using the metric of county statistics, the answer is Colorado's Aspen and Wyoming's Jackson (Pitkin and Teton counties respectively). But there's another metric, called a micropolitan. Using that measure and arbitrarily picking several metrics relative to wealth, Bloomberg concludes that Utah's Summit Park, i.e. Park City, to be the No. 1 micropolitan in the U.S. for wealth. Following it is Colorado's Edwards micropolitan, home to Vail and Beaver Creek, and Wyoming's Jackson. Aspen lags down the list at eighth, behind Colorado's Summit County and Steamboat Springs at fifth and sixth. Of the top 10 most affluent micropolitan areas, six are in ski areas of the West. Following them are Heber, Utah, which is near Park City, and Durango, Colo., and a bit down the list are Truckee and Grass Valley in California, and Hailey-Ketchum-Sun Valley in Idaho. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced micropolitans after the 2000 census as a way of distinguishing smaller areas, of 10,000 to 50,000 population, that better describe an economic, geographic unit. They're almost always big enough to have a Wal-Mart Supercenter. They're not strictly defined by incorporated areas or county boundaries. The Bloomberg index is based on four equally weighted metrics: median household income, the percentage of households with at least US$200,000 in income, median home value and the percentage of homes worth $1,000,000 or more. An 8,000-metre peak in winter — without oxygen! ASPEN, Colo. — By day, Mike Marolt is an accountant and, at age 52, at least on the cusp of what most people consider middle age. But don't mistake him for anybody remotely ordinary. Together with his identical twin, Steve Marolt and fellow adventurer Jim Gile, he plans to travel in January 2018 to Tibet. There, on the world's sixth tallest mountain, Cho Oyu, they hope to do something unique in the human experience. The trio hopes to ski from above 8,000 metres or, failing that, at least 7,000 metres — and without supplemental oxygen. They also plan to do this without assistance of Sherpa guides, part of what he calls the modern climbing "infrastructure." Mike called this "pure climbing," bringing to mind the words of the famous Italian climber Reinhold Messner, who was the first to climb Everest without oxygen, what he called "fair means." Mike recently spoke to a business group in Aspen, where he lives and where he grew up, at a gathering covered by the Aspen Daily News. The trio began skiing from the world's highest peaks in 1997. By then, alpine touring equipment had become advanced enough that skis could be used not just to get to a peak, but also to have fun while descending, he said. In Pakistan, they skied from 8,000 metres on Broad Peak, the world's 12th highest mountain. That was in summer. "Immediately, we knew we wanted to take it to the next level," he said, and by that he meant Everest, the very highest. But by then, Everest was becoming a problem for even good climbers, as was evident the year before. Eight people died one day in May 1996, and the deaths were at least partly attributable to the bottlenecks on the mountain route. There were just too many people. Climbing without supplemental oxygen elevates risks. It requires moving rapidly. Stopping even briefly — particularly in the alpine touring boots, as opposed to warmer, climbing boots — is too risky. "The thing about climbing without supplemental oxygen and without infrastructure is that you can't stop moving; you have to continue moving because your circulation is so impaired from the lack of oxygen," Mike said. He and his companions have tried climbing Everest without oxygen, first in 2003 and again in 2007, skiing from high elevations, but not the summit. "We nearly lost our feet," he said. Even turning around short of the summit, his feet were numb for six months afterward. Crowds will be absent on Cho Oyu, but the conditions he described to his Aspen audience sound nearly impossible. The jet stream sinks to 7,000 to 8,000 metres, or the tops of the peak, producing harsh winds, and temperatures can drop below minus 37 C. For winter training, they've tested themselves in Peru on a 6,400-metre peak, going from a base camp in one day at 1,500 metres. They did a 2,700-metres day on a 6,400-metre peak in Bolivia. Obviously, these are guys without pudgy, middle-age bellies. Trump vows to bring back coal, but tide is against him CRAIG, Colo. — With coal miners at his side, U.S. President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order that seeks to undo the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. In coal towns, there was rejoicing. The plan requires a gradual bending of power sources to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions 32 per cent by 2030. Unless carbon capture and storage technology advances rapidly, this puts coal at a great disadvantage. Coal plants were already closing in droves. They've been losing out to cheaper natural gas, which has fewer greenhouse-gas emissions and can be dispatched in a matter of minutes, unlike coal plants, which take about a day to crank up. This makes natural gas a better fit with renewables, whose prices have tumbled dramatically in the last five years. But coal plants in the Rocky Mountains have also been closing because of their dirty environmental footprint, not even considering greenhouse-gas emissions. The sulfur dioxide and other emissions contribute heavily to regional haze. For example, PacifiCorp announced it would close one of the generating units at its power plant at Kemmerer, Wyo., located south of Jackson Hole. The plant provides power for Park City. The reason: the electricity wasn't needed, because of improved energy efficiency, and to upgrade the plants to reduce pollutants was too expensive. In northwest Colorado, Tri-State Generation and Transmission and other electrical providers have agreed to shut down a 427-megawatt power plant at Craig by 2025. This is 68 kilometres west of Steamboat Springs. Again, the problem is regional haze and other environmental pollutants. In New Mexico, it's the same story. There, two units of the San Juan Generating Station are to be shut down by the end of this year, notes the Durango Herald (Colorado). The Herald reported that the Public Service Co. of New Mexico is deciding whether the remaining units at the San Juan complex will operate beyond 2022. At the Colorado Solar Energy Industries Association conference, former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter pointed to action at state and local levels, along with that of private companies, all aiming to clean up energy sources. Among those pushing are a variety of Republican governors in an organization called the Conservative Energy Network. "What this makes me believe is that no matter what happens at the federal level for the time being, there are opportunities," said Ritter. Wyoming didn't join that coalition, even if Gov. Matt Mead continues to prod his state into making changes. Jonathan Schechter, writing in the Jackson Hole News&Guide, while pondering his own mortality, wants Wyoming to similarly quit denying that the day for the end of coal is drawing nigh. Wyoming has been living high with its go-to source for low-sulfur coal since the 1980s. You can still see mile-long coal trains grinding their way through Denver's booming LoDo section on their way to plants as distant as Texas, Mississippi, and even, for a time, Florida. But nearly 40 per cent of the nation's coal-fired power plants closed between 2006 and 2016, and most remaining plants are on the verge of functional obsolescence. In 20 years, Schechter observes, nearly 90 per cent of the plants will be 40 years old or older. As these plants close down — likely to be replaced by natural gas and renewables — "so too will the market for Wyoming's coal, and with it the economic benefits coal has bestowed upon our state." Wyoming has no income tax. That simple fact, as much as the amazing sight of the Teton Range, may explain why Jackson Hole rivals Aspen for billionaires per capita. "When the day comes that income is taxed, Jackson Hole will start to become home to a much different demographic," Schechter concluded. Wow, what a lot of snow in Jackson Hole JACKSON, Wyo. — The Teton County fairgrounds in Jackson are looking pretty ugly right now after being the dumping ground for streets plowed through the winter in Jackson. The snow is piled 17 metres high, the tallest seen in at least 20 years. And it's dense snow, too, packed down to make room, reported the Jackson Hole News&Guide.

Case in point: President Donald Trump warned House Republicans Tuesday if they can’t pass health care legislation after seven years of promises it could be a “bloodbath” in the 2018 midterm election, according to one member present in the meeting. But is this actually true? Will Republicans face dramatically reduced turnout from their base if they fail to repeal it? I’m not so sure. It’s important to remember that base conservative anger at the ACA is an entirely manufactured phenomenon, without even an objective correlative or specific dogwhistle in play. Most conservative betes noires work on the base because they relate to some very specific anger or prejudiced fear: their kids will be rejected from college because affirmative action gave their spot to a minority; they have to pay their cell phone bill but some poor minority will get a free “Obamaphone”; some Syrian person with a dangerous-sounding Muslim name will come in as a refugee and blow up their local WalMart; etc. These are the ugliest, least informed motivations in politics. They are deplorable. But they at least have grounding in fear of an actual consequence that will affect their lives. The Affordable Care Act is different. Yes, there is the generalized fear that their insurance premiums will rise so that “others” can get less expensive healthcare. But the conservative base inclined to believe this either 1) is already on Medicaid or ACA plans, or 2) has enough life experience with healthcare to be aware of how much premiums were rising before the ACA passed. True, in 2010 conservatives swept to office by lying to Medicare recipients that they would be subject to death panels and that they their Medicare money would be given to “unworthy” poor people. But it’s 2017 now, and those lies have subsided through experience. Meanwhile, the promised “death spiral” of Obamacare is also a myth: the exchanges seem to be in fairly decent shape overall, and the insurance market isn’t going to implode on its own. So will conservatives really stay home in November if the ACA stays in place? Or will a polarized electorate mostly forget about the whole thing if Republican politicians give them some other shiny object to fret about? I’m inclined to suggest the latter. The only real electoral danger to Republicans from a failure to repeal the ACA will come from opportunistic conservative primary challengers who will promise to repeal the ACA where their own legislators failed. But even that is a largely illusory threat, because most Republicans in the House did vote to repeal the ACA, and the Freedom Caucus members who refused are essentially immune to challenges from their right. At this point the best move for Republicans is to do nothing. The polarization of the electorate, combined with the lack of clear cultural consequences for conservative white nationalists from a failure to repeal the ACA, suggests that the GOP won’t really pay a price for failing to deliver on their campaign promises.

The luxury retailer's VP of ... customer-facing technologies, Rajeev Rai, explains how. Expand Traditional retail is stuck in the eye of a hurricane as shoppers continue to flee the in-store experience in favor of shop-from-the-couch e-commerce platforms. But, despite a potential sale, luxury chain Neiman Marcus says it is positioned to weather the storm, thanks to large collections of data on its niche customer and out-of-the-box thinking on tech.  Continue Reading Below Revenue growth on the S&P 500 department store index has been stuck in a downturn for seven-straight quarters as brands like Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl’s (KSS), Macy’s (M) and more grapple with rapidly-changing consumer shopping habits. Neiman is no outlier: It has seen six-straight quarters of revenue and same-store sales declines as customers become increasingly less loyal. The uncertain environment even led the luxury brand in March to begin exploring strategic alternatives. Expand / Contract Expand / Contract “It’s entirely driven by consumer adoption of technology, and retailers are running out of time before the next generation of buyers – which includes Millennials – get used to surviving without retailers,” said Brian Kilcourse, managing partner and co-founder of Retail Systems Research, adding, though, that Neiman Marcus is working itself into a position to not just sell goods, but an experience. Kilcourse describes it like this: Imagine a graph that, on one axis includes basic human needs at one end, and esteem at the other. On the opposite axis is price and convenience. So, the lower left would include base-line goods at low prices – characteristics aligning mostly with retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).  On the upper right, where esteem and experience matter most are brands like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. The focus for them, Kilcourse said, has to be on providing not just a shopping hub, but a shopping experience. “There’s not a thing in any Neiman Marcus store anywhere that any human needs. It’s all items they want to buy. So, the experience has to be entertaining…the more it has to be about the individual shopper and not the average shopper. Exclusivity becomes the key,” he said. That’s a trend Rajeev Rai, vice president of customer facing technologies and information services at Neiman Marcus, knows all too well. To try and provide that unique and compelling shopping experience, he and his team have rolled out a range of gadgets shoppers can deploy not just in store, but from home and on the go. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Expand / Contract The company’s mobile app features tools like Snap, Find, Shop, which customers can use to take a picture of a co-worker’s boots, for example, and find out whether Neiman Marcus sells same or similar pairs. In store, customers can take advantage of mobile-phone charging stations and Memory Mirrors that record 360-degree views of various apparel items customers try on, or the steps in a new makeup routine at the cosmetics counter. While fun for customers to use, Rai said the technology has also given the company valuable insight into their consumer base. In exchange for being able to use those pieces of technology, the customer gives an email address, phone number, and in some cases, answers a survey question about their experience.  “There’s a fundamental tectonic shift happening in retail on how customers engage with brands, what they value. Loyalty is very fickle now. People are looking for ‘what’s in it for me,’ ‘what’s the brand doing and how are they engaging with me,’” Rai, who spoke last week at the WWD Retail 20/20 Forum about the new store experience, told FOX Business. “The amount of digital exhaust that has been generated and the amount retailers have to learn…is tremendous to get to understand the customer.” Watch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com Indeed, a 2017 study from Gartner found retailers expect the customer experience to be impacted most by digital technology.  All of that comes down to aggregating and understanding customer analytics, which luxury and high-end retailers have had initial success doing, said Robert Hetu, research director for retail at Gartner. “When it comes to the mid-tier like Macy’s on down to JCPenney, you find these retailers are struggling a lot more to figure out what this digital experience looks like in store…you find that these retailers know less about their customers,” he explained. To that end, Fitch Ratings said Neiman Marcus is sitting in a somewhat protected position, despite what seems like an imminent collapse of retail as consumers know it. Fitch cited Neiman’s ability to distribute sought-after designer brands through just 46 stores worldwide, and its loyal customer base that generates 36% of the company’s overall revenue through its InCircle rewards program. It also pointed to its “established” sales model that includes multiple channels and platforms and a direct business -- including online and catalog sales – that accounts for 30% of total sales, the highest online penetration of all major department stores. To continue making headway, Kilcourse said Neiman needs to move more toward curated customer offerings, and that’s where Rai said he sees the most opportunity. “The day’s not far away where conversational commerce will become a reality. You don’t have to type at your keyboard and think about the right words to choose to put in a search engine. You’ll be able to ask the question ‘What should I wear to this event, what complements this dress, what shoes or accessories,’” he said. “We’re getting ready to experiment with those technologies that allow the seamless experience to happen.”   Related Content Ralph Lauren to Cut Jobs, Shutter 5th Avenue Polo Store in NYC Payless Files for Bankruptcy Protection, will Close Nearly 400 Stores Consumers Still Economic Bright Spot as 1Q Growth Outlook Remains Uncertain JCPenney Is Closing These 138 Stores: Texas, Minnesota Hit Hardest The Cloud Could be a Salve for Old Retail's Growth Problem What do you think?

Simply  substitute Jared Kushner’s name for that of Ilham Aliyev, Kim Jung-Un, Bashar al-Assad, or some other princeling—and we’re in business. Honestly, the whole thing is such a dumpster fire that it’s hard to know where to begin. By virtue of their close relationship with the president, Jared and Ivanka are able to speak truth to power without fear of suspect motives. This is a major advantage of family enterprises. The great merchant banking families were able to cover the globe, operating in distant seaports, with primitive communication and painfully slow transportation by dispatching family members as their emissaries in these far off lands. With shared values, deeper bonds of trust, greater respect for risk taking, and longer time frames, family dynastic wealth has been a huge force in the success of global enterprises. Today, companies like Ford, Wal-Mart, Mars Inc., and Campbell Soup still benefit from large family stakes and faith in the mission of the enterprise. If I were setting out to defend the transformation of governance—in the world’s oldest extant democratic republic, nonetheless—into a family business, I would probably not start out by genuflecting toward the Medici or invoking the same features of kinship-based trust networks that work well for organized criminal enterprises. But, then again, I’m not the Senior Associate Dean for Leadership Studies & Lester Crown Professor in the Practice of Management at the Yale School of Business. What follows—after some noncommittal material about possible conflicts of interest and the fact that observant Jews don’t work on the Sabbath—is a long list of inexperienced people that held powerful positions in the White House. Sonnenfeld sprinkles in examples of insular and inbred administrations. The fact that many of these arrangements—the Nixon administration, the early Clinton years—proved deeply dysfunctional seems besides the point. For Sonnenfeld Kushner is just like Kissinger—except for the record of scholarship and policy profile—or Harry Hopkins—except for a twenty-some year history in government and non-government service to the public welfare. Also, experienced hands in the Bush Administration brought us Iraq, Thus, nepotistic self-dealing at the highest levels of American government is totally fine. Because reasons. It’s particularly rich to read all of this forty-eight hours after we learned that Kushner met with Russian officials—and failed to disclose those meetings on the application for his security clearance. That’s enough, by the way, to get people stripped of their clearances and fired. But, not to worry, because Sonnenfeld assures us, based—as best I can tell—on no evidence other than his conversations with Donald Trump, that Kushner is the bee’s knees. Perhaps, too, it is time to stop the needless bomb-hurling at Kushner, a trustworthy, objective, smart, fresh voice working in the national interest, who unlike some of his colleagues in the White House, appears to work effectively and quietly with real facts and analysis rather than with public pronouncements, tweets, “alternative facts,” or threats. As Daniel Drezner puts it: .@dandrezner on Trump’s ‘secretary of everything’: “This is insane… his one qualification is that he married well” https://t.co/P5oTQFCSQb — CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) April 4, 2017 I suppose that this might be amusing as a clickbait-y exercise in counter-intuitive punditry. Except that it’s actually rather frightening. No matter how smart, or capable,  Jared Kushner is…. well, it doesn’t actually matter. Indeed, I agree with Sonnenfeld that I’d rather have Kushner making policy than Bannon or Miller. So what? There are plenty of smart, capable, and even qualified people who could fill Kushner’s roles without eroding the foundations of our system of government. Essays like Sonnenfald’s normalize the destruction of norms that keep the United States from sliding into an outright kleptocracy, oligarchy, or banana republic.

The truth is that to a very large degree they are the President. Donald Trump is a fat unhealthy old man who’s never studied and never worked a day in his life (to anyone else’s expectations). He is rumored to be near illiterate and is just staggeringly ignorant, and disinterested in ceasing to be so. He’s not inclined, perhaps not able, to perform most of the public functions of the President, and we have no idea how much if any of the private functions he is willing or able to address. When we see Jared in Iraq, or Ivanka visiting a school, or see one or the other of them sitting in on the President’s meetings with foreign leaders (I believe every such meeting has featured one of them, and am uncertain if any has featured both), they’re not intruding or meddling – they’re literally usurping. Most of the things they do, including Jared looking a bit silly and massively out of his depth in body armor on an Iraqi airfield, would be quite unremarkable if they were the President, and the President’s not going to do them. It all makes much more sense if you consider them to be the President, or perhaps to be part of a triune Presidency. PS not related to the above, I think I may physically assault the next person who proclaims, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever and in the teeth of quite some considerable proof to the contrary, that Ivanka or Jared, or Ivred, is a liberal.

Remember when Gary Johnson was asked about Aleppo and responding by asking what a leppo was? I’d bet a lot of words would stump Trump, though he might handle it better.

If Jared and Ivanka were actually Uday and Qusay, there wouldn’t be so much White House infighting. They may attain that status but they’re not there just yet.

And he wasn’t that experienced in 1961, having only served as an aide to Adlai Stevenson for a few years before that and an on-again-off-again staff attorney for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (the committee that elevated and then laid-low Joe McCarthy). His biggest claim to fame, besides being a Kennedy, was that he got into a very public spat with Jimmy Hoffa and wrote a bestseller about organized crime in the Teamsters. Few expected him to be a capable Attorney General, but he had a real knack for hiring and delegating authority to the right people (i.e. Katzenbach).

His influence over his brother’s administration went a good deal further than his official duties as AG. In retrospect, this was mostly for good, and gave us the man who spoke in Indianapolis that fatal night in 1968, but there are good reasons why such appointments are bad in principle. On the other hand, there’s George Washington to John Adams: “The sentiments do honor to the head & heart of the writer; and if my wishes would be of any avail, they shd go to you in a strong hope, that you will not withhold merited promotion from Mr Jno.

Log in to Reply DamnYankees says: April 8, 2017 at 2:15 pm Let me make a somewhat counter argument here – not that this is good, but that’s it’s not as insane as people make it sound. I think the example that people have used is, and that I frankly don’t think is crazy, is Hillary Clinton. Hillary was given a ton of power in the first few years of the Clinton administration. And she wasn’t elected to anything. She was the President’s wife, which is not an elected position. And my understanding is that a lot of the justification of this (I was too young to remember this happening, but let me know if I’m wrong) was that this was sold as a package deal. Bill Clinton ran basically saying that his wife is awesome and qualified and would be involved and that by electing him you’re getting 2 for 1. Didn’t Trump kind of do the same? There was tons of talk pre-election about how awesome his kids were, and everyone knew they’d be involved (as unethical as it is, it wasn’t a secret). Same for Kushner. People knew that they were his closest advisors. Can’t the same argument be made? Now, to be 100%, absolutely stone cold fucking clear – Hillary Clinton is a million times better and more competent and smart and moral than Ivanka and Jared. Not even close. I don’t say this – at all – to begrudge Hillary or say she shouldn’t have done that work. My only point here is that the practice of putting your family in charge of stuff does not begin with Trump. The problem with Trump is not that he’s putting his daughter and son in law in positions of power. The problem is that they are staggeringly incompetent, and that their installation to positions of power appears to be only justified on the basis of their nepotism. Which is really bad. But I think the attack here isn’t that “he’s his son-in-law so should do anything”. The attack is that he’s incompetent.

Log in to Reply Joe_JP says: April 8, 2017 at 2:22 pm ETA: The incompetence is key but part of the problem here other than the broad amount of stuff put on their plate is that they have much more power than let’s say Hillary Clinton even over health care proposal because there Bill Clinton surely practiced significant oversight and input.

The break in that tradition isn’t Hillary, it’s Melanja of NYC. *Yes, Buchanan was single. Look how that turned out. Log in to Reply TopsyJane says: April 9, 2017 at 12:59 am There is no “tradition” for the role of the president’s wife. She doesn’t have to do a damn thing if she doesn’t want to. The notion that she has to sponsor an uncontroversial cause or two is a relatively recent one and there has never been any expectation that she will be a key adviser, or even hostess – Bess Truman mostly stayed home. (The only points of comparison Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Rodham Clinton have are each other.) I assume things like the annual Easter egg hunt can be staffed out. If Melania wants to stay in NY with her son she’s within her rights.

Not sure how much power she had over vetting, let’s say, as compared to someone (along with others) having a role there.

Incidentally, I don’t care much for the use of the word “observant” to mean something like “Orthodox.” I suppose it’s difficult to see what word could replace it. But it implies that there’s only one valid form of Jewish religious practice, and that any given practice is better in proportion to how stringent it happens to be.

Log in to Reply LosGatosCA says: April 8, 2017 at 6:45 pm Top to bottom every strata of the American electorate has seen the median IQ shift lower due to the influence of the Republican Party or because the median IQ of the American electorate has shifted lower the Republican Party has become more unhinged, more evil, more stupid generally. I’d like to think the Republicans and Fox-lead alt-media drove it that way but my head tells me it’s really the more unhinged, more evil, and more stupid electorate that drove the Party. It’s sad to think that 45% of the country has values inimical to a healthy society. But when they started making excuses for an Alzheimer’s victim trading arms for hostages, getting about 300 Marines and embassy personnel blown up in Beirut, and rationalizing the quadrupling the national debt for 1% tax cuts as some magical formula (Laugher Curve) to increase tax revenue I guess it just naturally extends in a straight line thru all the stupidity they’ve provided since: Quayle, impeachment, 2000 election stolen/Bush II, 9/11, Iraq/Feith/Wolfowitz/Cheney, Palin, Scalia/Garland, now Trump. At some point there’s a pattern that puts the blame on the evil stupidity of your fellow citizens who have kept electing these evil, stupid people to represent them. Because it’s much worse collectively at the state level.

Sonnenfeld’s academic specialty is not just “leadership” but in particular the study of CEO behavior. The only way to do that effectively is via direct contact and observation. CEO egos tend to be not small, so the CEO scholar must become extremely adept at tongue baths. Being a bootlicker is not an occupational hazard, it’s a job requirement.

Politicians of all parties agree on all of this. Reform is coming, and soon, we're promised.  That's been the steady drumbeat since the peak of the recession nearly a decade ago. So what's the holdup? ADVERTISEMENT Any attempt to lower rates substantially creates a revenue hole. How to deal with that hole is a perennial sticky wicket. Congress has put forward one idea—a border-adjusted tax (BAT) that would eliminate the benefits of moving companies overseas and bring back billions of dollars stranded in offshore accounts. Articulated in last year's "A Better Way" report from the House GOP's Task Force on Tax Reform, the BAT reorients the code toward a destination-based cash flow tax, removing what sometimes are characterized as self-imposed penalties for exports and subsidies for imports. A few supporters have marketed the BAT as "a tax on the trade deficit."   Opposition to BAT, however, has been fierce. Retailers, apparel-makers, automakers, and other import-heavy companies—think Wal-Mart, Nike, Autotrader and J.C. Penny—have raised serious concerns that the BAT will make it too expensive for Americans to purchase common goods and services. Conservative interest groups like Americans for Prosperity are waging an all-out campaign against the proposal. There's substantive concern that the tax-reform debate may go the way of health care, with a divided GOP unable to reach agreement and legislate a solution. Here's where it gets interesting: earlier this week, reports emerged that the administration's tax team is considering ideas like a value added tax (VAT) and a carbon tax as alternative ways to finance tax reform. That's not to say these instruments are a foregone conclusion. For starters, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declared "neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration." If the White House actually were considering such contentious revenue options as a VAT or carbon tax, there would be clear motivation to signal otherwise. Ronald Reagan detested the VAT for being a hidden tax, easily increased without alerting taxpayers. The U.S. House last year passed a resolution against carbon pricing. Even so, if the administration is serious about getting tax reform over the finish line, these would be two pretty good bets to raise revenue. In 2010, inspired by a heated battle over the debt ceiling, deficit reduction was the cause du jour. While the debate ultimately resulted in budget sequestration, as articulated in the Budget Control Act of 2011, a number of commissions, task forces and members of Congress assembled proposals to improve fiscal discipline and reform the tax code. Of the seven most prevalent proposals, four included revenue from either a gas tax or carbon price; two introduced a VAT; and one considered a carbon tax, though ultimately did not include it. When serious people consider serious measures to reform the tax code and address the deficit, carbon pricing and a VAT are the two go-to instruments. A carbon price, though, fits well into the administration's other plans. As part of the campaign, President Trump promised again and again a new way forward on regulation and energy. In an executive order last week, Trump ordered the substantial rollback of a number of regulatory policies to address carbon emissions, on top of a requested 31 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency's budget. More regulatory rollbacks can and should be done, as they serve as the least efficient way to solve the carbon-pollution problem. But all these rollbacks are only half the battle. If this year's health-care debate proved anything, it's that efforts to roll back Obama-era policies are highly susceptible to political backlash. The environmental movement has demonstrated its ability to turn opposition into highly visible protests through campaigns over the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Pairing permanent removal of the EPA's authority to regulate carbon emissions with a transparent carbon price might take the fire out of potential protests, give the GOP the upper hand in a major environmental-policy fight and bring moderate Democrats into the fold on tax reform.  Moreover, carbon pricing can raise serious revenue. A 2013 estimate from the Congressional Budget Office suggested that a carbon tax could raise $1.2 trillion over 10 years – beating the proposed BAT in revenue estimates and financing even deeper cuts to the corporate income tax. R Street research suggests that even a relatively modest carbon price actually could replace corporate taxes entirely, turning the United States into the most competitive investment climate in the world. Tax reform is long overdue, but bipartisan agreement on the need for reform hasn't yielded a workable proposal. White House leadership on carbon pricing may prove to be the missing link.

Make Save Borrow Grow Live More Deals How to Get Paid to Get in Shape Dan Schointuch April 8, 2017 Photo by Dean Drobot / Shutterstock.com How to Get Paid to Get in Shape 0 Like Pin Tweet Email Print The last time I had a fitness program I stuck with, it was given to me by a drill sergeant and wasn’t exactly optional. In other words, you could say I’m not a fan of working out. But as an MTN’er, I am a fan of making money. So when I found out there were ways I could make money by getting in shape, I had to write about it. Work out with Swagbucks If you’ve never heard of Swagbucks, it’s an online rewards program that will pay you for watching videos, taking surveys, using its search engine and playing games, as well as give you cash back for online purchases at thousands of retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Click here to see everything it offers. All of those things are great, and it’s why we recommend Swagbucks if you’d like a way to make a little extra spending money in your free time from home, but what’s new to me is the company’s collection of fitness videos. For example, there’s a six-minute SoulCycle workout that would make a great warmup, followed by a 16-minute yoga video and a 21-minute workout from Men’s Fitness that looks like it could make a good routine. So that’s almost a 45-minute workout, and Swagbucks would pay me to do it; not a lot of money — this isn’t going to be my new job — but making something is a pretty nice motivator and might get me moving. But on the other hand, the site will also pay you to watch cooking videos, so it might end up being a wash. Click here to sign up for the Swagbucks program or check out our detailed article on Swagbucks.com here: “Earn Up to $2,700 a Year Watching Videos, Answering Surveys.” Step it up with HealthyWage Swagbucks is a nice start, but there’s another website that can really get you moving by upping the amount of money you can make from your workouts considerably: HealthyWage. With HealthyWage, you set yourself a weight-loss goal, to lose a certain amount within a certain time, and wager money each month that you’ll meet your goal. For example, let’s say you wanted to lose 24 pounds in 12 months and you decide to wager just $25 per month, HealthyWage would pay you somewhere between $333 and $882.35 at the end of the year for losing that weight (according to the site’s calculator). So imagine yourself this time next year 24 pounds lighter and with your holiday shopping completely paid for, and that’s HealthyWage. Willing to put a little more on the line? Upping your wager to $100 per month would mean a payout at the end of the year between $1,333 and $1,950 if you meet that same goal. Just remember, if you don’t hit whatever goal you set for yourself, you’re out the money you wagered. Now, that’s powerful motivation. To play around with the site’s calculator and see what you’d be willing to commit to and how much you could win, click here to visit HealthyWage and get paid to get in shape.

Liquidation sales at the appliance and electronics chain begin on April 8. All 220 stores in 19 states will soon shut their doors forever in the coming weeks. HHGregg was the seventh-largest appliance retailer in America, behind Lowe’s, the Home Depot, Sears, Best Buy, Sears Hometown, and Walmart. Last month HHGregg officials from the Indiana-based company said 88 underperforming stores were going to be slated for closure. Then, just a few days later, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A letter of intent for a potential buyer of its assets was terminated following the legal filing, the Ledger-Enquirer reports. “Since filing for financial protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy code on March 6, 2017, we have continued to fight for the future of our company,” HHGregg President and CEO, Bob Riesbeck, said. “While we had discussions with more than 50 private equity firms, strategic buyers and other investors, unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our plan to secure a viable buyer of the business on a going-concern basis within the expedited timeline set by our creditors.” JUST IN: HHGregg announces company wide closure, plans to liquidate assets.https://t.co/p9MdWIUphk — CBS4 Indy (@CBS4Indy) April 7, 2017 A bankruptcy court for the Southern District of Indiana approved the request by HHGregg to liquidate its assets late yesterday afternoon. A company has been hired to oversee the going out of business sale of not only store merchandise, but office furniture, store fixtures, and any other equipment of value at retail locations and distribution centers. Shoppers in many of those same states have also seen their local Sears and Kmart stores close over the course of the past year. The HHGregg going out of business sale also means customers have just a few weeks left to return any previously purchased items they do not want or do not work and to use up gift cards. Because of the liquidation sale, the company has announced it will limit the return of goods on any items which were purchased before March 6 to purchases which cost $2,850 or less. Many of the furniture sets, televisions, and major appliances sold at the store carried a lot higher price tag than the noted amount, the INDYStar notes. HHGregg’s rapid descent, already remarkable, has accelerated. https://t.co/OZ9CIIOzZO — James Briggs (@JamesEBriggs) March 31, 2017 HHGregg has been in business for 62 years. The company was founded by Henry Harold Gregg and his wife, Fansy. The once successful company took on other big box retailers, like Best Buy, and continued to turn a profit. The inability to adequately adapt to internet shopping in our increasing e-commerce society reportedly played a significant role in the demise of the long-standing company. When foot traffic at HHGregg began to drop, the electronics and furniture store did not offer popular online shopping features, such as free shipping, quickly enough and only revamped its business model after weak holiday shopping sales in 2015. Riesbeck was hired as the CEO of the retailer in February 2016 – replacing Dennis May after he resigned. The new company head admitted the nearly constant changes in technology caused a significant disruption on how HHGregg had always done business. “One thing HHGregg used to make their money on was those big-box TVs people had to have delivered. And that’s how HHGregg was built through the years. Once it went to flat panels, and all of a sudden people realized they could put them in the backseat of their car, delivery is not that important anymore,” Reisbeck said. In an effort to increase sales, Riesbeck moved HHGregg away from its focus on electronics and into the “Fine Lines” brand of products – an upscale store-within-a-store concept. The line did offer some encouraging growth for the company, but it was not enough to compensate for the still plunging electronics sales. The once profitable retailer lost money for the past 24 months, and once again had an abysmal holiday shopping season in 2016. “I would say, we’re not unique in retail,” Reisbeck said last year when giving a brutally honest assessment of the state of the company. Do you think more retailers will be forced to close stores like HHGregg, Sears, and Kmart as online shopping becomes even more popular?

Just Muzak. Should you get a streaming music subscription? By Mike Tanasychuk Wednesday, Apr 5, 2017 at 10:00 am EDT 18 Comments Mike is a writer for iMore, as well as other sites under the Mobile Nations umbrella. Mike gets around. Whether or not you should get a streaming music subscription really depends on your listening habits. Streaming music services are all the rage right now, and I don't mean that they're merely trends to be blown away by the winds of change — they're the future of music. My favorite CD store, HMV, just closed up shop in Canada. Now there's nowhere to buy physical CDs, aside from the dwindling and tasteless selection that Walmart peddles. I've always resisted streaming music services in favor of more "purist" listening practices, like burning my CDs onto my laptop and then having them on my iPhone, rather than relying on Apple Music and the internet so I can stream. But gone are the CD drives and quickly dwindling is my patience for connecting, burning, waiting, transferring, and so on. My sister recently added me to her Spotify Premium family, and I must say that I'm falling in love with streaming music. Here are some pros and cons to help you decide. Why you should get a streaming music subscription Convenience Right off the bat, convenience is the biggest reason to get a streaming music subscription, be it Apple Music, Spotify Premium, Pandora, or whatever. You don't have to sit and wait for music to transfer from your computer to your phone; you can listen to that service on just about any device you might have, and if you want a friend to hear a tune, they can just go onto their service and listen — no need to email or bring a thumb drive over just for one song. It saves space The iPhone doesn't have an SD card slot (WHY NOT?!?), and if you've opted for the lowest storage option, you'll run out of space real quick once you start transferring songs and downloading apps. Have a streaming music subscription means you can carry all of your tunes with you all the time, without having to worry about your storage capacity. New music! I play the drums, and drumming to the same set of tunes can get kind of boring after a while. Luckily, with a streaming music subscription, I can just go find a curated playlist of music I like and I get to discover all these new tunes that I otherwise wouldn't have heard of. If you like a particular genre of music, but you're sick of the same bands, just search up the genre on your service of choice and you'll be introduced to new bands and new sounds. Share it! Many music streaming services let you share what you're listening to on Facebook and Twitter, allowing you to connect with other folks who have similar tastes. Using social media to share your tunes is way easier than sending people individual songs, and it lets you discover new tunes when other people share stuff with you. Futureproof As sad as it is, physical forms of music are falling by the wayside (despite the resurgence in vinyl). Music is moving in a completely digital direction, and if you can't and/or don't want to keep up with changing music formats, then a streaming subscription is the perfect way to futureproof yourself. You don't need to worry about file formats or any of that nonsense because the service takes care of it all for you. Service exclusives Artists are now releasing songs exclusively to specific streaming services. For instance, Jonathan Coulton's new album comes out soon, and he's only released the first single to Spotify. There are also other great contests and events that go on for specific artists, like ticket and instrument giveaways. Why you might not want or need a music streaming subscription $ Moolah $ If you're anything like me, you likely have a ton of CDs and have bought a bunch of your favorite music off of iTunes. Why would you want to pay a monthly subscription fee when you already have all the tunes you want? You don't listen often I listen to music all day while I work, but I just throw on YouTube and away I go. Otherwise, I don't have the time to sit down and listen to music as much as I'd like. To be perfectly honest, if my sister didn't already have Spotify Premium and was already paying for it, I don't think I'd have an account for myself. I just can't justify the cost when I know I wouldn't use it enough. Connectivity I work for a magician on the side and we make many a road trip to rural Canada. I mean rural. Ever heard of Lemberg, Saskatchewan? Me neither until a week ago. We rely on Apple Music to stop us from killing each other on 8-hour drives, and when you hit a dead zone, there's nothing worse than starting a song and having it stop dead 10 seconds in, never to return. If you're not receiving an LTE signal, streaming can be a pain in the ass. 3G can do just fine, but only if it's a strong 3G signal (trust me). If you live somewhere where your carrier doesn't exactly provide LTE, then streaming might suck, and that just plains sucks. You hate music Who blackened your soul? To stream or not to stream? If you're into music at all, the pros certainly outweigh the cons. You can discover new music all the time and you'll even find songs that you won't find anywhere else. At the end of the day, it's not a huge expense, usually starting around $10 per month. If you're sick of filling up your devices with music and you'd love to just have the world of tunes with you wherever you go, then a streaming music subscription is definitely for you. Even if you're the stationary sort and don't feel like YouTube hopping all day, a music streaming subscription can provide you with all the tunage you need to see you through your work day or your chill sesh while you lurk on Reddit.

I can down load any music for off line listening so i don't burnthrough my data by always streaming. I also can put a playlist on my Apple Watch to have music when I don't exercise with my phone. Spotify does the same thing but I can't sync a playlist to my Apple Watch. 0 3 days ago Reply sirchip I purposely picked up the 256gb phone just to have my music that I've bought over the years to be at my convenience. i'll probably will be one of the last ones to convert to stream even with 'unlimited' data with at&t. 0 3 days ago Reply Mike Tanasychuk I feel like I'll be in the same boat for my next iPhone purchase. You're not alone! 0 3 days ago Reply UdegbunamChuks I recently signed up for Neflix and Deezer after so many years of sourcing all my content from torrents. The experience is wonderful and I feel less guilty. lol. If most services are priced right, most users wouldn't resort to torrents and the likes 0 3 days ago Reply Lee_Bo While I'm an Apple Music subscriber, I also use Pandora free which works just fine. You get 30 seconds of commercials every 4-6 songs. 0 3 days ago Reply king3pj This is probably blaspheme on this Apple focused site but I have been subscribing to Microsoft's Groove Music service for quite a while now. Like most other premium music streaming services it's $10 per month, has everything I could want to listen to, and allows subscribers to store music for offline listening. The main reason I switched over from Spotify Premium is because they didn't have an Xbox One app. If I wanted to listen to my own background music while playing video games Groove was the only option. I think this may have changed recently but I'm not sure. Besides the Xbox One support Groove is also built directly into my Windows 10 PCs and the iPhone app works very well. I can't imagine there are many of us Groove Music users (especially on iMore) given how popular Apple Music, Spotify, and Google Play Music are but it is the best choice for me because of the variety of devices I use. 0 3 days ago Reply dov1978 I also use it as I also use a Lumia 950xl on Windows mobile and that's the main music app on there.

I do stream with SoundCloud (and download when available) since it's the service the most of what I like. I'd love to be able to subscribe to a service that offered me similar stuff at higher bitrate, but right now neither Apple Music, Spotify or Tidal give me what I'm after. 0 3 days ago Reply DarlaMack I have my subscription with Apple Music and stream all the time. Mostly for reasons mentioned in this article... saves on storage and convenience. But also for integration purposes. I have used Shazam since the beginning to search out music that is played around me or on a tv show that I know I would love to have. Shazam searches and finds it and Apple Music plays it... and the only cost I incur is if I decide to purchase it. 0 3 days ago Reply Derrick4Real No i don't stream. I don't have a need to. I have an enourmous music library. I've barely sold back a record that I've bought and i've been buying music since 1977. It's a monthly expense i don't need. $10 bucks here. $10 bucks there and they start to add up. i've had trials and i barely use them. I'd rather listen to my own music for free and i have plenty of albums i got that i've barely listened too. I never run out of music to listen too. Also the curation on these services always leaves a lot to be desired. Like their suggestions strike me as without a ton of logic at times. People use it to find new music. That's fine but I'm most new music hasn't been my thing. I'm old. fine. lol. It's just money spent for something i don't need. Another big thing is my LTE is so spotty with mountains and oceans i can't rely on streaming much of anything. I tend to download all my podcasts too because tons of times when i try to stream i get stuck in a store with a bad signal. I'd also add in the past two years the bulk of the time i'm listening to podcasts or audiobooks as opposed to music so i'm dedicating less time to music listening. Oh one last thing is my entire library is uploaded to google play so if I need music i have all of that to listen too remotely, again for free. 0 3 days ago Reply LeviV8 Does it count as streaming if I use offline cache on Spotify? :) Joke aside, I think Spotify is the best app for this purpose. I had Spotify way before I had an iPhone, so I didn't switch to Apple Music, just to be brand friendly :D I checked it out though, but I stayed with Spotify. 0 3 days ago Reply Paul5555p I'm currently almost done with the free 3 month trial for Apple Music and really tried to implement it into my routine, to no avail. I will not be renewing, just didn't seem all that great to me. I download all my music to all my devices and don't see any reason t change. I do from time to time use Amazon Music as I'm a Prime member and its included, it is nice perk.

Problem for me is that I like a lot of underground stuff. For example, you can't get Alienhand on any service, but you can just download it for free. http://www.alienhand.dk/ Sad thing is, on iOS, you can't add that music to the Music app. At least not without a Mac… 7 years into the "Post PC" era. And, with Apple Music, it's probably never going to happen.

Invented in 1879 to keep saloon employees from stealing, the cash register combines the functions of a calculator to add up the purchases and a lockbox to keep cash safe. It assumes that retail employees have no verifiable way to add up numbers. And it assumes customers are paying in cash. Nowadays, most people have a smartphone and pay electronically. So the assumptions are gone. Yet cash registers remain. The success of online retail demonstrates that you don't need a Victorian-era contraption to sell things. You can do it all electronically. But brick-and-mortar retail stores have a problem that online stores don't: shoplifting. Without a cashier verifying the purchase and providing a paper receipt, it's hard to stop some people from just taking stuff and walking out without paying. The whole cash register model now represents a ritual that exists mainly as an anti-theft system. That sounds like an easy problem to solve. Turns out it's not. Why Amazon Go isn't ready to go Amazon Go is that company's latest concept for disrupting brick-and-mortar retail. The company's vision is that you shop normally, then just walk out of the store without waiting in a line or interacting with a cashier or point-of-sale system. Amazon The Amazon Go concept store watches you shop and lets you skip the cash register. Amazon Go is a single 1,800-square-foot store in downtown Seattle that sells groceries as well as prepared food that's ready to eat. Amazon Go also features "Amazon Meal Kits," which are pre-portioned ingredients with recipes, a concept similar to Blue Apron. The Amazon Go store is not open to the public. Amazon has been developing the store's technology for years and "beta testing" the store with employees for months. A report in The Wall Street Journal claimed that Amazon intended to open last month but delayed the launch because of technical issues. That's not surprising. Amazon is attempting something very bold and new. Amazon is using a combination of computer vision, sensors and deep-learning algorithms to know who's buying what. Amazon says that its patented "Just Walk-Out Technology" uses artificial intelligence (A.I.) comparable to the A.I. used in self-driving cars. Here's how the store works. When you enter, you scan a QR code on the Amazon Go app at the front door. That scan announces to the store's system that you're there and preemptively authenticates the purchases you're about to make. Then you shop. Amazon's "Just Walk-Out Technology" has one job: to figure out what you're taking out of the store. As you remove items from the shelf, A.I. uses multiple inputs to figure out what you grabbed. Cameras watch you take it. Scales built into the shelves provide data to calculate the weight of what you took. Amazon's patent filing suggests that the system may also refer to past purchases to help identify current ones. In other words, intelligent software analyzes a video feed to determine that you removed something from the shelf that looked like a cupcake. It considers data from the shelf, which is also a scale, and calculates that you took something that weighs about as much as a cupcake. And it checks your purchase history — it knows you're a cupcake-eating maniac. After all that input, the software decides that you took a cupcake off the shelf and adds it to your list, which is kept up-to-date in real time as you shop. If you place an item back on the shelf, the item is removed from the list. It's possible, based on patent applications, that Amazon intends to use both face and body recognition (metrics like height and weight) to continuously identify you when you wander around the store picking up items. Here's the best part: When you're done shopping, you just walk out of the store. As you leave, sensors at the door detect that you're exiting, and your Amazon account is charged for the items you got. It's like shoplifting, except you have to pay for everything you took. The technology is advanced. It may be too advanced. A Bloomberg report said the Amazon Go system becomes overwhelmed when the store gets crowded, and that it's relying on humans to supervise the A.I. to make sure it correctly identifies the foods it's charging for. (Amazon did not respond to my request for an interview.) It appears that Amazon's "Just Walk-Out Technology" makes a lot of mistakes, which is probably OK within reason. But it also may crash, bringing the whole system to a halt, which is not OK. Amazon dominates retail already. Walmart is a global retail giant worth $215 billion (the company's value based on stock price). By comparison, Amazon is worth $430 billion -- twice the value of Walmart. It seems like Amazon has a sweet deal going with online retail. Why would they want to enter into the brick-and-mortar space? The truth is that there are many items that consumers won't buy without seeing or trying them in person. Think of couches, for example. You probably don't want to buy a couch unless you can feel how comfortable it is. There are other items, such as your lunch, that are too perishable for shipping. Amazon has been trying a range of ideas for breaking into the $800 billion U.S. grocery industry. The Amazon Fresh delivery service is now available in 20 U.S. cities. Prime Now delivers groceries from local grocery stores in a few locations. Subscribe & Save lets people subscribe to buy paper towels and a range of other non-perishable but frequently consumed items for delivery like other Amazon items. A system like Amazon's "Just Walk-Out Technology" adds convenience to shopping. But the real revolution is a quantum leap in behavioral data. In the same way that companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook track every mouse movement, every click, every scroll and every hesitation while you're browsing the Internet, Amazon Go's system potentially brings that level of customer awareness to the brick-and-mortar space. They'll know if you hesitated to buy that cupcake. They'll know you spent three minutes browsing the burrito options without finding something you wanted. They'll know exactly how long you were in the store, which sections you checked out and of course what items you bought, exactly. It's likely that Amazon will open the Amazon Go store to the public sometime in the next few months. They will probably have to limit the number of customers allowed in the store at the same time. And the "Just Walk-Out Technology" will make a lot of errors for the next few years, requiring human supervisors to monitor and correct those errors. For the foreseeable future, Amazon Go will be a half-baked mirage. Amazon will accept losses resulting from errors as the price of learning how to do no-cashier retail. Eventually, the payoff could be huge. Once Amazon makes "Just Walk-Out Technology" reliable and relatively error-free, the company can roll out stores nationwide, then worldwide. Like self-driving cars, however, automated stores that really work are years away, and for the same reason: A.I. just isn't good enough yet. Starbuck's Mobile Order & Pay is hot, but still has grande problems Starbucks is also working on the elimination of cash registers and cashiers. The company's app enables a service called Mobile Order & Pay, where you can order anything on the Starbucks menu via the app and pick it up without interacting with a cashier. The company last week opened a mobile-only store at its Seattle headquarters. Here's the company's dirty little secret: Mobile Order & Pay doesn't really work that well. (Starbucks did not return my request for comment.) Sometimes customers place their order at the wrong store. I've done this myself a few times. That means the product is wasted at the wrong store, and the customer has to wait in line like everybody else at the right store. Other times customers pick up somebody else's mobile order by accident. (I'm a heavy user of Mobile Order & Pay, and I live in constant fear that somebody else will get my tall drip -- clearly my coffee order reflects who I am as a person -- and I'll get their pumpkin spice latte with 12 shots of coconut syrup.) Mobile Order & Pay can be great for coffee thieves bold enough to just grab somebody else's order. In stores where this happens frequently, the drinks are placed out of reach, forcing Mobile Order & Pay users to wait for a barista to give them their order. Starbucks executives have hinted that they're working on perfecting Mobile Order & Pay. But making it function as it should will take years — and the development of more advanced technology. While Mobile Order & Pay is worthwhile for Starbucks (because their long-line problem is bad, coffee is so cheap and errors are fast and cheap to make right), it actually doesn't work well and isn't exportable to other retail situations that aren't selling what is essentially flavored water. Apple's 'automation' depends on an army of employees Apple was the first major retailer to enable a smartphone-based system where you can pick your product and waltz out of the store without interacting with a cashier, launching their EasyPay self-checkout system years ago. The Apple Store app enables you to process your purchase as if you were buying online, then walk out of the store with the item. This system isn't especially replicable. Apple doesn't use advanced technology for this feature. And one benefit of self-checkout should include cost savings because fewer employees are required. But with Apple, the opposite is true. The system works to deter theft only because Apple Stores employ dozens of employees, often for stores that are really a small single room. Apple's system works for Apple because that company sells very expensive items at mass market scale, enabling them to afford an army of watchful employees. Automated retail is years away Amazon, Starbucks and Apple create the illusion that the era of automated, smartphone-based brick-and-mortar retail is here. The truth is that the technology behind these stores doesn't work nearly as well as it appears to. And the systems developed thus far can't be extended to the wider world of retail stores. Someday, stores will enable you to skip the cash register altogether. But for now, I just don't buy it.

POLITICO Magazine Menu Our Latest Search politico.com Google Plus Facebook Twitter Search Close AP Photo 1600 Penn Trump’s White House Is a Family Business. That’s Not a Bad Thing. Critics complain about the presence of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump in the White House. But it’s a more promising model than most people appreciate. By Jeffrey Sonnenfeld April 08, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print When Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, made a surprise trip to Iraq earlier this week, the ensuing freak-out was all premised on one glaring rhetorical question: Is the Trump White House being run like a family business? Less asked, though no less important, is a follow-up: Would that be a bad thing? Story Continued Below I do not know Kushner, and have met Ivanka Trump only twice in passing, years ago while in Trump Tower visiting her father. But I’ve known Donald Trump since 2004, when he called me on the phone after seeing my criticisms of The Apprentice’s depictions of corporate leadership. In the years since, we’ve remained in touch. In late December, when I talked with then-President-elect Trump, he reflected great pride in the loyalty of his presidential transition team. I, perhaps unwisely, was the skunk at the lawn party, breaking his cheerful spirit and cautioning him that as they migrated into the White House, some of the members of his team were importing mixed motives which were not always in alignment with his priorities. Some of these people were opportunists driven largely by their own agendas and cozied up to him in sycophantic ways. I suggested something he surely already knew: The people on his team he could most trust were his family members. Sure, family businesses have role conflicts, succession struggles, and sibling rivalries—and the world’s most admired democracy and economy is hardly a mom-and-pop operation. At the same time, we’ve welcomed multiple Bushes, Roosevelts, and Adamses in the White House without acting out the pathologies of All in the Family. Yet there is skepticism. According to a recent Politico/Morning Consult survey, only 40 percent of Americans approve of Ivanka Trump working as a special assistant to the president. Though the announcement that she’ll occupy an official federal employee role was met with some outrage, it pales in comparison to the scorn that has been lobbed over the kaleidoscope of vital responsibilities forked over to her husband, adviser Jared Kushner. Without doubt, Kushner is the busiest person in Washington. His daunting portfolio includes huge chunks of both foreign policy and domestic policy: diplomatic relations with Mexico and Canada, strife in the Middle East, key trade deals, government efficiency, overhauling the Veterans Administration, combating opioid abuse, and a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, among other formidable responsibilities. It’s an astoundingly wide assortment—one that has, accordingly, been met with derision by comedians, pundits and journalists alike. It’s been a busy time for President Trump, late-night comedian Stephen Colbert recently quipped: “Every day, he gets to work, rolls up his sleeves, and gives a new job to Jared Kushner.” “Dennis Rodman has more foreign policy experience than Jared Kushner,” snarked Jimmy Kimmel. The family affair in the Trump White House is mocked by political pundits and comedians who complain that it’s a sharp departure from the U.S. system and American values. But it’s a more familiar model than is appreciated—and one with some promising elements. *** By virtue of their close relationship with the president, Jared and Ivanka are able to speak truth to power without fear of suspect motives. This is a major advantage of family enterprises. The great merchant banking families were able to cover the globe, operating in distant seaports, with primitive communication and painfully slow transportation by dispatching family members as their emissaries in these far off lands. With shared values, deeper bonds of trust, greater respect for risk taking, and longer time frames, family dynastic wealth has been a huge force in the success of global enterprises. Today, companies like Ford, Wal-Mart, Mars Inc., and Campbell Soup still benefit from large family stakes and faith in the mission of the enterprise. In the Trump White House, the blowback from the failure of health care reform, the immigration visa ban and other such mishaps did not escape follow-up scrutiny from the family, even as other staff members may try to elude their own roles and responsibilities. It is no coincidence that on Monday, Kushner flew to Iraq with General Joseph Dunford, one of the most respected uniformed officers to ever lead the Pentagon, despite Kushner’s pressing need to prepare for the Chinese delegation arriving in the U.S. days later. Kushner and President Trump knew that they needed to learn from this brilliant, honest, objective military superstar. The subsequent and immediate reformulation of the National Security Council restored the full membership of Dunford, CIA chief Mike Pompeo and the National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, while nixing the controversial role of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. The Kushner influence was on display this week, just as it was when it came time to change out the roles of top campaign advisers Roger Stone, Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort, or national security adviser Michael Flynn—let alone the selection of Mike Pence as Trump’s running mate over Chris Christie (who as a U.S. Attorney years earlier, had prosecuted Kushner’s father). The Trump White House is being managed like a family business, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. This is not to say that family business management dynamics do not often suffer from complex role conflicts. In Kushner/Trump case, these conflicts include potential ethical conflicts of interest, as well as tensions between professional duties and family roles. As the son-in-law of Trump, Kushner—with his own and his wife’s business empire of $740 million in real estate, retail jewelry, hotels, etc.—is under significant scrutiny. Just like other federal employees, both Jared and Ivanka are required by law to abide by transparency and ethics rules, and thus prohibited by taking any actions which enrich their personal financial situation. Kushner’s wide range of involvement in trade policies, tax reform and financial regulations could easily impact their real estate holdings and other interests. While Jared and Ivanka have divested from many of their most easily conflicted investments and enterprises, there are endless potential triggers. For example, Kushner’s past involvement with any Chinese state-owned enterprises is complicated by the reality that he now works with top Chinese leaders with influence over those enterprises. This will require close guidance with the Office of White House Counsel, the Office of Government Ethics, and outside counsel. Wisely, Jared and Ivanka have already hired Jamie Gorelick, a Clinton administration deputy attorney general and expert on legal ethics, to help guide them through the thicket of conflict-of-interest laws. As with a family business, guidance on how to handle the conflicts between professional duties and family roles is less easy. Jared and Ivanka are observant Jews and do not work on the Sabbath, spending the time with their family instead. In a 24/7 decision-making environment, this leaves the stretch from Friday evening through Saturday evening without their voices—even during times of crisis or when world leaders are visiting. Even family vacations are fraught, as was apparently the case when Jared and Ivanka took their children on a ski trip to Aspen during the closing days of the negotiations over health care reform. The trip was rumored to trigger Trump’s frustration and the resentment of Kushner’s White House colleagues. The resentment of other aides is likely to only mount should there be a major strategic disagreement or personality clash with other senior Trump administration officials, and there is a risk of unrest over charges of favoritism winning out over merit in key internal debates. Family businesses often struggle with the “blood is thicker than water” loyalty dilemmas. Similarly, termination, severance and other exits are hard concepts in family work setting because unless there are divorces or people are disowned, it is hard to be fired by the family. The long, unsavory battles between Jared’s father and uncle are a reminder just how emotional family disputes can be with irrational spillover to other settings making problem resolution and moving on to other topics more difficult. Should Jared want to quit, that may not be easy, given his father-in-law’s reliance upon him. And should there be tension in the Jared/Ivanka marriage, it would have pronounced consequences for Jared’s role in the Trump White House. *** In the New York Times earlier this week, columnist Frank Bruni warned that Kushner’s White House influence “exemplifies the degree to which Trump not only prizes the fresh eyes of people from outside of politics, which is sensible, but downright fetishizes them, which isn’t.” Now wait, haven’t we heard this resentment of outsiders before? It’s a charge that almost every new president faces. Bringing aboard youthful leaders with fresh, outsider perspectives as trusted top presidential advisers may have a mixed history of success, but critics may not realize that Kushner is not younger or less experienced than many prominent presidential advisers throughout history. In 1993, President Bill Clinton’s senior adviser Rahm Emanuel, communications director George Stephanopoulos, and press secretary Dee Dee Myers were very talented. But they were also incredibly young—just 33, 32 and 31, respectively—a bit younger than the 36-year-old Kushner, and similarly lacked executive-branch experience. Mack McLarty, Clinton’s chief of staff, was somewhat older at 46, but had never worked in Washington—his professional background was in the truck-leasing business—and got his coveted White House position largely because he was a friend of Clinton’s dating back to kindergarten. During the early days of the Clinton administration, William Safire of the New York Times complained about this kiddie crusade of unknown youngsters in the White House—staffers who dressed casually with pizza boxes strewn around as they worked on policy, dismissively referring to Stephanopoulos as “George Stuffing Envelopes.” The Agenda, Bob Woodward’s chronicle of Bill Clinton’s first term, likened the administration’s overlapping duties and decision-making roles to a bunch of schoolchildren all chasing a soccer ball down the field. It’s not exactly an endorsement of the setup, but at least a reminder that the disorganization of a young presidency isn’t an altogether new phenomenon. Prior to Clinton, the last Democrat to inhabit the White House was Jimmy Carter, whose close-knit set of campaign aides—dubbed the “Georgia Mafia”—moved into high positions in his administration without any experience in national politics. Hamilton Jordan was 33 when he served as Carter’s chief of staff, as was Jody Powell when he began his tenure as a senior adviser and press secretary to the president. And yet, despite their lack of experience, both wielded influence and broad portfolios that overshadowed the members of Carter’s Cabinet. Nor is it unprecedented for a president’s top aides to form a bubble around the Oval Office, as some have charged Trump’s aides with doing. Such was the case with President Richard Nixon’s inner circle of advisers, especially chief of staff H.R. Haldeman and chief domestic adviser John Ehrlichman, whom fellow White House staffers jointly referred to as “The Berlin Wall,” given their German names and predilection for isolating Nixon from outside influence. Even President Nixon, a man who had served eight years as vice president and six years in Congress, had inexperienced outsiders as aides: Ehrlichman was a land-use attorney who had never worked in government prior to becoming White House counsel in 1969, nor had 30-year-old Pat Buchanan nor 39-year-old William Safire, both Nixon advisers and speechwriters. Some complain about the breadth and ambiguity or Kushner’s roles. The Washington Post labeled Kushner a “shadow secretary of state,” quoting career diplomats complaining that his broad portfolio is unprecedented in U.S. history. Of Kushner’s status at the helm of American efforts in the Middle East, Henry Kissinger told Politico’s Annie Karni in February, “It’s not clear to me in what way he’s in charge of it, whether he’s in charge of it with supervision from the White House, or whether he’s supposed to be the actual negotiator. Nor has it been defined what they’re negotiating about.” Who would have thought we would need to remind the renowned Henry Kissinger, as he approaches 94, that he too was, in some ways, a minister without a portfolio during the Nixon administration, launching historic initiatives as varied as opening relations with the People’s Republic of China, ending the war in Vietnam, and detente with the Soviet Union before he was even secretary of state. Nixon’s actual secretary of state, the suave, connected William Rogers, was frozen out of such key policy arenas and left in the dark, completely eclipsed by Kissinger until eventually Nixon asked him to resign. Perhaps even more astounding is the model of Harry Hopkins, a top adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who actually lived in a bedroom in the second floor of the White House, which would certainly rival Jared and Ivanka for proximity to power. Hopkins, a onetime social worker who organized New York relief programs, was given a professional portfolio easily as broad as that of Kushner. Without any formal congressionally approved roles, Hopkins supervised the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Civil Works Administration, the massive Works Progress Administration, and the vital Lend-Lease program, through which the U.S. supported its wartime European allies with food, oil and material in exchange for land for military bases the U.S. still holds today. In the 1940s, he forged new relations with the Soviet Union and China in the early 1940s, and FDR enlisted Hopkins’ support in meetings with Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin in Cairo, Tehran, Casablanca and Yalta. It was widely accepted that Hopkins, like Kissinger, had more sweeping power than the entire bureaucracy of the U.S. State Department. It is also worth remembering that, as in business, the wisdom of experienced advisers and scholarly experts can be dangerously overstated as well. In 2001, when President George W. Bush named Donald Rumsfeld secretary of defense, Rumsfeld was perhaps the most experienced man in Washington—a former congressman who became an adviser to President Nixon, ambassador to NATO, chief of staff to President Gerald Ford, and Ford’s secretary of defense. But his distorted and arrogant style alienated virtually everyone in the Pentagon and many of his Cabinet peers, until he was dismissed after the mishandling of the Iraq War and its aftermath. David Halberstam’s book The Best and the Brightest brilliantly documents the misguided foreign policy forged by academic experts in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and the catastrophic consequences of those policies in the ill-fated Vietnam War. Likewise, Graham Allison’s Essence of Decision and Irving Janis’ GroupThink reveal the disastrous tunnel vision thinking of career State Department officials leading up to the Bay of Pigs fiasco. This is not to diminish the work of experts, nor to suggest that they should be ignored. Rather, perhaps it is time for nostalgia for the clubbiness of the best and the brightest to be left in the library shelves and not the corridors of the White House. Perhaps, too, it is time to stop the needless bomb-hurling at Kushner, a trustworthy, objective, smart, fresh voice working in the national interest, who unlike some of his colleagues in the White House, appears to work effectively and quietly with real facts and analysis rather than with public pronouncements, tweets, “alternative facts,” or threats. Thus far, Kushner has not squandered his trust with bravado or recklessness—a temptation that a senior adviser to an earlier head of state spoke to quite eloquently. Trust is as fragile as a liquid cupped in your hands, warned Thomas More, adviser to King Henry VIII: Once you separate the fingers, it is forever gone.

The free shred day will be held on Wednesday, April 26 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 57 Damonte Ranch Parkway, Unit D, just a few doors down from Doughboy's Doughnuts in the Walmart parking lot. This event is just in time for members in the community that are doing a little spring cleaning. Anyone in the community can attend the event and safely dispose of up to three boxes of personal documents, to include recyclable paper products, envelopes and newspapers. The shred event is free, but One Nevada has partnered with local non-profit organization, SPCA of Northern Nevada, to collect donations. A voluntary, suggested donation of $3 will go toward helping The SPCA of Northern Nevada programs. "Attending One Nevada Credit Union's free shred day is the safest way to properly dispose of those documents you need to shred that have been sitting around the house collecting dust," says Dana Pavlu, Damonte Branch Manager. "We are excited to be able to offer this free shred day to our members and the community so they can safely dispose of confidential documents." In addition to free shredding services, SPCA of Northern Nevada will have an information booth at the event and introduce pets up for adoption. It is National Kids and Pets Day so One Nevada's mascot, Bucky, will also be handing out goodies to children. For information, visit http://www.onenevada.org.

PRINCETON -- The four Gospels of the New Testament chronicle the life of Jesus Christ. When Charlie Hunt reads them, he sees a story and he puts it on the walls of Princeton's First Baptist Church. Hunt's first efforts at painting were inspired by cartoons he saw on television when he was five years old. He never made a career of it. Instead, he spent 22 years in the military, then worked as night manager at the Princeton Walmart. But then, FBC Pastor Mark Massaro asked for volunteers to paint Bible stories on the walls of the youth Bible education class space. Some children of the church painted a mural depicting the birth of Jesus. And another group of volunteers painted another scene from the life of Christ. Then Hunt volunteered. "I hadn't painted for 20 years," he said. He found, he said, that painting can be just like riding a bicycle. Hunt does his painting in his spare time. He started in 2015, and he estimates he has another two years' worth of work ahead of him before the life of Christ is told in mural form within the church. It's a good way to bring the words of the biblical books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John to life in a visual form for children and adults, he agrees. Hunt spends about 20 hours per week working on the murals. He first sketches a Bible scene on paper, then makes a scale grid. He free-hand sketches the same scene in larger dimension on a grid on the pressed wood walls that divide the FBC youth education classrooms. Once the scene is sketched on the wall, he can start to paint. "I come in early and work to mid-morning," he said. Those wooden walls eat away the art sketch pencils and absorb a lot of acrylic paint. Hunt estimates he started out with about 300 bottles of paint. It's hard to say how many he will have used before the project is completed. He climbs down from the ladder where he's been painting the crucifixion scene and walks down the corridor of the building where he also volunteers with the children's ministry. He points to the mural the children started with, and across the aisle to a corresponding scene of Jesus in the manger that he painted. Next to it, there's a scene of Jesus as a child in the temple in Jerusalem. Across the aisle in a corner, the florescent light casts an appropriate glow upon the rays of light emanating from the top of a mural that shows a dove depicting the Holy Spirit in the scene of Christ's baptism by John the Baptist. Hunt walks along the corridors, where more scenes are complete, and sketches are taped to blank spaces where the next scene will be painted. Across from the crucifixion scene, which is nearly complete, is a pencil sketch of Christ's ascension. "I enjoy doing it. It's something I found a passion with. When I was in school, I helped teachers in art classes. I got through biology by drawing pictures of dissections of bugs. "This, to me, is just like basketball or baseball is for other people. It's something I can do. This, I can do." × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

The petition, filed by Anthony Thomas on behalf of his daughter Elizabeth, alleges that teacher Tad Cummins, 50, had threatened his daughter with repercussions at school if she didn’t go with him for a meal. The document also alleges that Elizabeth Thomas was “scared of Cummins and felt in over her head.” Thomas disappeared from her home in Columbia, Tenn. on March 13. She and Cummins were caught on surveillance cameras visiting an Oklahoma City Walmart two days later, but have not been seen since. SEE ALSO Ex-student describes similar 'friendship' with teacher accused of kidnapping 0:0 A former student of a Tennessee teacher accused of kidnapping... Anthony Thomas’ petition asks Maury County Chancery Court to allow the family’s lawyer to take depositions of people with information about interactions between Thomas and Cummins, but who have been hesitant to come forward. The petition states that on the morning she disappeared, Elizabeth Thomas told a friend she was meeting a teenager named “Thomas” at a Shoney’s restaurant, but was “having second thoughts about spending the day with him.” “Thomas” is believed by authorities to be a reference to Cummins. The petition alleges that other students at Culleoka Unit School saw Cummins make physical contact with Thomas, including rubbing her back and shoulders. One student claimed to have seen Thomas sleeping on a hospital bed in the teacher’s classroom. The petition also alleges that following an alleged kissing incident between Cummins and Thomas at the school, Cummins allegedly told Thomas her college and work career was ruined, “causing her to believe that her best option was to leave with him.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Visa Checkout enables millions of consumers to pay in just a few clicks on any device around the web with some of the world’s top merchants. “Visa Checkout continues to simplify the online checkout process for consumers, while helping merchants increase sales and convert items in the cart to completed purchases,” says Sam Shrauger, senior vice president, digital solutions, Visa.  “Reaching 20 million enrolled accounts is a huge achievement and further affirms Visa Checkout’s purpose of bringing the trust and security of your Visa card to the evolving digital world.” As consumer adoption of Visa Checkout grows, so too does interest among brand name merchants in joining the platform. Among the merchants who have recently adopted Visa Checkout to improve their online shopping experience in order to increase conversion rates with additional customers include HSN, Alaska Airlines, Avis Budget, Cole Haan, Emirates Airline, FIFA, Marriott, Sam’s Club and Walmart. These new merchants join a growing list of 300,000 merchants, including Best Buy, Starbucks, Papa John’s and StubHub, among others. “At HSN, we are focused on developing innovative solutions that result in an unparalleled shopping experience,” said Ryan Ross, EVP of marketing, digital commerce and creative for HSN. “The Visa Checkout integration helped to attract new customers and drive incremental sales across all our platforms as we continue to lead the future of Boundaryless Retail at HSN.” In addition to reaching 20 million enrolled consumers, Visa Checkout is announcing it will continue to expand to new markets in 2017 with planned expansion to Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. They join Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China1, Colombia, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, UAE, United Kingdom and the United States (and territories) as markets that will or currently offer Visa Checkout. Given the growing rate of eCommerce and mCommerce, merchants and consumers are looking for ways to further simplify the checkout experience. Last week, Visa and Samsung announced a joint partnership that will allow Samsung Pay users in the US who link their Samsung Pay account with a Visa Checkout account to shop seamlessly at the more than 300,000 merchants that accept Visa Checkout. This partnership is made possible through Visa Checkout’s open platform and streamlined set of APIs, allowing both consumers and merchants to experience the benefits. Consumers with fingerprint authentication-enabled Samsung devices will be able to click the Visa Checkout/Samsung Pay co-branded button and touch the fingerprint sensor, without entering their username and password. Merchants can continue to use their existing Visa Checkout integration and get the benefit of this partnership.  - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Visa | online payment | checkout | More Finance & Capital Market Stories Dubia reports $19.9m profit for 2016 Qatar First Bank maintains assets value at $1.64bn Tamkeen, BDB increase funding support to entrepreneurs DGCX, DMCC, RakBank to develop bullion products Investcorp makes partial exit from PRO Unlimited Egypt implementing strong reform: Lagarde IFSB Council adopts guiding principles on disclosures Saudi NCB rolls out pan-EU real estate fund Insurance premiums in region hit $35bn in 2016 Takaud to take part in Bali forum UAE, Angola sign investment protection pact ENBD Capital completes UAE’s first IPO in 2017 Crestbridge extends footprint to Bahrain Pakistan's Meezan Bank selects BenchMatrix solution Mastercard adds Samsung Pay to online payment options KFH-Bahrain to reward new credit card clients Egypt non-oil business continues downtrend UAE, Saudi non-oil sector gains momentum in March New Bahrain laws a major boost to financial sector Investment leaders must transform to thrive: CFA Gulf Bank wins VIP customer service award Samsung Pay early access launches in UAE SWIFT forum tackles Egypt’s economic reforms Cardtek, Emcredit introduce national m-wallet in UAE ADES to float on the London Stock Exchange Copart, Al Ahlia Insurance ink strategic deal UAE ministry to use e-Dirham for payments to DHA ADIB shareholders agree 24.52pc dividend Ithmaar AGM approves listing on regional exchanges DGCX volumes hit 1.4m valued at $33.5bn Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Removing the impact of weather should add about 100,000 payrolls back to the total, in LaVorgna’s view, in-line with recent trends. Indeed, the household employment survey (which wasn’t weather affected) posted its best result since February 2016. Looking ahead, the economic calendar is relatively light with just updates on job openings and producer price inflation. Friday will be busier, with consumer price inflation and retail sales on the docket.

The Pennsylvania Department of Property and Supplies had begun reviewing the final plans for the project in January of that year. 25 years ago On April 14, 1992, Wal-Mart Inc. announced that it would build a regional distribution center in Clearfield County. The project was expected to cost $30 million and create 300 new jobs when it opened in the fall of 1993. 10 years ago In April 2007, members of the Borough Council mulled the possibility of making State College the fifth Pennsylvania municipality to outlaw smoking in enclosed public places.

Allen David Adams, 26, was booked at the Flagler County jail this afternoon on a manslaughter-drunk driving charge and a DUI-property damage charge in the death of his girlfriend, Brittany Lee Pitt, 26, in a motorcycle wreck on Old Dixie Highway last May. Adams, a Walmart forklift operator whose Harley Davidson sported a “Support Your Local Outlaws” decal, almost immediately posted bail on $102,500 bond. The wreck took place where the southbound exit off I-95 merges with Old Dixie Highway, on May 14, 2016, at 12:40 a.m. Adams was operating his 2014 Harley, going south on I-95 with Pitt sitting behind him. He took the exit and passed another vehicle on the ramp as he was approaching the yield sign at the intersection, according to his arrest report. Kenneth Tonak III, a 32-year-old resident of Hastings, was at the wheel of a black Chrysler Journey, an SUV, driving west on Old Dixie Highway, toward U.S. 1. Adams was supposed to yield to Tonak. He did not do so, violating Tonak’s right of way, according to the arrest report. Brittany Lee Pitt in an image from her Facebook page.When Adams realized that the Chrysler was immediately behind him, he gunned his motorcycle, accelerating across both lanes of the two-lane Old Dixie, toward the grassy shoulder on the south side of the road. The sudden acceleration caused Pitt to fall on the pavement around the yellow double-lines. Tonak tried to avoid hitting Adams’s motorcycle by swerving left into the opposite lane, but in doing so, he ran over Pitt, and the vehicle dragged the victim a distance. She was pronounced dead at Florida Hospital Flagler. She was the mother of a young boy. She was from Spring Hills, as is Adams, a resident of 5521 Ashland Drive. Adams’s recorded blood-alcohol level was 0.089 and 0.091, just over the legal limit. Tonak, to, was over the limit: his tests both showed 0.082 blood-alcohol level. Tonak, who had three passengers in his car– was charged with drunk driving, a first-degree misdemeanor. The DUI-manslaughter charge Adams faces is a second-degree felony that carries a minimum prison sentence, if he is convicted. He also faces a first-degree misdemeanor charge for DUI-property damage. Adams and Pitt were staying at Tomoka State Park. They were returning from a concert in Jacksonville, where, as Adams told an investigator, they’d had a few drinks. Adams, not familiar with the area, had gone in the wrong direction–west, instead of east, when he made the turn off I-95. Recommend or share: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr Questions?

The family has proposed developing the Atascadero ranch into a residential community with 494 single-family lots of at least 1 acre, 93 units of multifamily housing, 2,285 acres of open space and 16.9 miles of public trails. Victor Montgomery with RRM Design Group talks about the major aspects of the Eagle Ranch project. David Middlecamp The Tribune A view from Eagle Ranch near Atascadero. Judith Hildinger 1 of 2 i By Bob Kelley LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Hearings have begun in Atascadero on whether the city should annex the proposed Eagle Ranch project. Looking at all of the maps, pictures and proposed benefits of the development, some people may say, “What a great project!” While serving on the Atascadero Planning Commission for seven years and the City Council for eight years, I was somewhat involved with the project getting to where it is today. That process has taken close to nine years, mostly in an attempt to come up with an environmental impact report that may be acceptable. On three occasions, I met with the owners of the ranch and their consultant. At each of those meetings, I said it appeared the project would not pencil out or, in other words, was not revenue neutral. They agreed. I have always wondered why anyone would want to go forward and support what appears to be a failed project from the beginning. I still feel that way today. Current Mayor Tom O’Malley is on record from a previous joint Planning Commission and City Council meeting stating that the Eagle Ranch project would have to be “revenue-neutral at a minimum.” I, too, took that position. One point of concern: In 1996, the incorporated cities in the county came to an agreement that if county property were to be annexed into a city, the county would retain two-thirds of the property tax revenue and the city would get one-third. It has always been said that residential properties do not generate enough revenue from property taxes to support needed services. Consider: With the base tax rate at 1 percent, owners of a home valued at $600,000 pay $6,000. From that amount, the city of Atascadero normally gets about 16 percent, or $960. But under the revenue-neutrality agreement, the county would retain two-thirds of that amount, leaving the city with just $320. I have asked for years what the amount of tax would have to be in order for a residence to be revenue neutral. I have never received an answer because I think there is no answer. The discussion of renegotiating the property tax issue with the county so that the city of Atascadero could receive its rightful share has been going on for years. To the best of my knowledge, nothing has changed. Any change in the agreement has to be done in a public forum. It needs to be considered by the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors and requires a positive majority vote. (The Atascadero City Council also would have to approve a new revenue-neutrality agreement.) Until that time, there should be no decision of any type on the Eagle Ranch project. At this time, the project is not revenue neutral. Even if the county agreed to give Atascadero its full share of property tax revenue, it still appears the Eagle Ranch project in no way can come close to being able to cover future costs of the infrastructure and services it will require. The city does not have a good record of structuring financial conditions for projects that require expensive improvements. For example, had the Wal-Mart project gone forward, taxpayers would have been left with an unfunded $8 million tab to complete the 101/Del Rio roundabouts. People of Atascadero need to become proactive and require the city to disclose the financial agreements that will be in place between the city, the county and Eagle Ranch prior to any acceptance of any portion of the project. This time, don’t settle for hearing the city say, “We have it handled.” Should the city approve this without ample proof of revenue neutrality, the only ones to benefit will be a government bureaucracy that will require more taxes from all of us to support what they have approved — a financially negative project. Bob Kelley is a former Atasacadero city councilman. He also served on the city’s Planning Commission.

Skelton was an alumnus of the school. Western Missouri military academy dating to 1880 will close Associated Press 11 hrs ago (…) Charlie Riedel Cadets at Wentworth Military Academy wait for the arrival of a casket carrying the late former Missouri congressman Ike Skelton before his funeral service at the school Monday, Nov. 4, 2013, in Lexington, Mo. Skelton was an alumnus of the school. LEXINGTON, Mo.   •    A western Missouri military academy that dates to 1880 and includes federal lawmakers, business titans and a famous zoologist among its alumni will fold at the end of next month, given waning enrollment, rising costs and an aging campus. Wentworth Military Academy and College's two top administrators announced the closure in letters Friday to cadets, students, parents and alumni, saying the assets of the site in 4,700-resident Lexington about 50 miles east of Kansas City will be liquidated as part of "an orderly closure." "Although everyone regrets this decision, we are proud that Wentworth successfully achieved its mission for 137 years, and many, many cadets and students obtained the knowledge and developed the character to be successful," board chairman Regis McDonald and president Michael Lierman wrote in a letter to alumni. Allan Hallquist, a Kansas City lawyer who has represented Wentworth for the past quarter century, said Saturday that Wentworth has 220 cadets who boarded there. Fifty-five of them are high school students and the rest enrolled in its two-year college program. The site also has roughly 300 civilians taking classes there. "Wentworth has struggled for more than five years to break even and has tried different options," including hiring consulting firms to bolster recruiting and develop alumni fundraising, Hallquist told The Associated Press. "But they continued to run deficits and are projected to dig a deeper hole." The accrediting Higher Learning Commission placed Wentworth on ongoing probation in November 2015, citing "concerns related to integrity regarding the college's finances and resources to support its academic programs and operations." The commission was to revisit that matter Monday, according to its website. Wentworth's prominent alumni include the late U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Lexington; Wal-Mart co-founder James "Bud" Walton and zoologist Marlin Perkins, who hosted "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom" for more than two decades before his death in 1986. Perkins also was the longtime director of the St. Louis Zoo. Wally Hulver, a 79-year-old insurance industry retiree who graduated from Wentworth in 1956, called the news "really a shame." Wentworth "taught you a lot about life, about how to treat people.

By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Published: April 9, 2017 2:29 AM This year, Google has overtaken Apple to become the “most valuable global brand,” as per the rankings. Just like last year, technology brands dominated the top 10. EACH YEAR, valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance values the brands of thousands of the world’s biggest companies. For the ranking, a brand’s strength is assessed (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, preference, sustainability and margins) to determine what proportion of a business’ revenue is contributed by the brand. This is projected into perpetuity and discounted to determine the brand’s value. This year, Google has overtaken Apple to become the “most valuable global brand,” as per the rankings. Just like last year, technology brands dominated the top 10. The ranking is based on interviews with more than three million consumers plus data on the financial and business performance of each company, using data from Bloomberg and the company Kantar Worldpanel. Here, we list the top 10 brands in the world and what makes them valuable… Google Brand value: $109.4 bn Last year’s rank: 2 The last time Google was at the top of the ranking of the most valuable brands in the world was six years ago. Its ranking in the most valuable brands was helped by a 20% growth in ad revenues. As per Brand Finance, the company “remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income.” Though Google has largely benefitted from increased revenues, its brand strength score is also a factor in its success. Apple Brand value: $107.1 bn Last year’s rank: 1 After five years at the top, Apple lost its crown in 2017. As per Brand Finance, Apple “has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected.” It further explained that the tech giant has “over-exploited the goodwill” of its customers, namely because of its failure to generate significant revenues from products like the Apple Watch. Also Watch: Amazon Brand value: $106.3 bn Last year’s rank: 3 Amazon’s significant brand value growth meant it came close to securing the top spot in 2017. It continues to be a force in reshaping the retail market and started to move into physical stores by expanding its Amazon Fresh delivery service, opening brick-and-mortar stores, and launching its checkout-free Amazon Go store. AT&T Brand value: $87 bn Last year’s rank: 6 AT&T was at the heart of one of the biggest shifts in media in recent years with its $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner. The company overtook Verizon as the most valuable telecom brand. After its 2015 acquisition of DirecTV, it took a mono-brand approach and integrated the two logos, which has helped with its recognition among consumers, as per Brand Finance. Microsoft Brand value: $76.2 bn Last year’s rank: 4 With every new product release, it seems, Microsoft is increasingly trying to go against Apple’s customers. Its advertising is increasingly going after the Cupertino company and its products, like the Surface Studio computer, even look similar to a Mac. Samsung Brand value: $66.2 bn Last year’s rank: 7 Despite the scandal of the Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, the South Korean company went up one spot in the rankings. Financially, it quickly bounced back from the smartphone scandal, buoyed by stellar growth in its chip business. The company faced another scandal to start off 2017, as the group head was arrested in the midst of a corruption scandal. Verizon Brand value: $65.8 bn Last year’s rank: 5 Verizon dropped down from its fifth spot last year after signing up fewer subscribers than Wall Street analysts expected. It did, however, see its revenue grow. The company made some significant moves to set itself up for the future and grow a media division with the acquisition of Yahoo, video start-up Vessel and media company Complex. Walmart Brand value: $62.2 bn Last year’s rank: 8 Walmart beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations with revenue reaching $133 billion, driven by a 36% growth in e-commerce sales. It maintained its eighth spot on the ranking from last year. It also made a move to improve its employee welfare and started to pay them more last year. The retailer is already working on its own version of the store of the future. Facebook Brand value: $61.9 bn Last year’s rank: 17 2016 was a good year for Facebook. In April, CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined its 10-year plan, which would focus on artificial intelligence, increased connectivity around the world and virtual and augmented reality. The company’s revenue grew by 51% in 2016 and shows no sign of stopping in 2017. ICBC Brand value: $47.8 bn Last year’s rank: 13 Chinese state-owned bank ICBC is the world’s largest and also the most valuable bank in the world. This year, the bank pulled ahead of Wells Fargo to become the most valuable bank, as well as the most valuable financial brand in the Brand Finance rankings. The bank had steady financial results in 2016 with net profits growing by 1 billion yuan ($145 million). No Comments.

Makes Most of Its Money The mighty iPhone is still Apple’s biggest revenue driver, but it’s also a double-edged sword. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 8, 2017 at 3:23PM It shouldn't surprise anyone that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money from the iPhone. After its initial launch in mid-2007, the iPhone gradually replaced the iPod as Apple's biggest revenue driver. Between fiscal 2008 and 2016, Apple's iPhone shipments surged from 11.6 million to 211.9 million. During that period, Apple's annual revenue rose from $32.5 billion to $215.6 billion. The seminal iPhone helped Apple crush former mobile kings Nokia and BlackBerry, sparked a tech shift which turned Microsoft and Intel into underdogs, and made it the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of about $750 billion. Let's take a closer look at how important the iPhone is to Apple, and why its success is also a double-edged sword. Apple's iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. How much does the iPhone matter to Apple? The annual launch of new iPhones remains one of the biggest tech events of the year for consumers, tech journalists, Wall Street analysts, and investors. But demand for the phones has clearly been slowing, due to competition from high-end Android rivals and the saturation of major markets like the U.S. and China. That's why last year's 211.9 million shipments actually represent an 8% decline from the 231.2 million units the company shipped in 2015. However, analysts believe that the tenth-anniversary iPhone 8 -- which will likely feature a glass body, edge-to-edge bezel-less OLED screen, and numerous hardware improvements -- will get growth back on track. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski believes that iPhone shipments in calendar 2017 will reach 230 million. Last quarter, Apple's iPhone sales grew 5% annually and accounted for a whopping 69% of the company's top line. Apple produces iPhones for about $200 and sells them for over $600. That total excludes R&D, marketing, and other expenses, but it still allows Apple to make a lot more money than Android OEMs, which are selling their devices at much thinner margins. That's why research firm Strategy Analytics reported that at the end of 2016, Apple raked in 79% of the entire smartphone industry's profits, despite controlling just 18% of the global market. That's also why Apple constantly promotes its devices as luxury products. It's also how Apple takes prisoners But it's not just the hardware revenue that matters to Apple -- the iPhone also represents the easiest way to lock users into iOS. After iPhone users start buying apps and media from the App Store and iTunes, they're less likely to leave behind their purchases by switching to Android devices. Image source: Apple. Apple clearly knows that its lock-in strategy works. That's why it boldly launched an "upgrade" program which lets people pay for their iPhones on a monthly basis for two years. That plan also gives customers AppleCare+ coverage, and works with all carriers since users are buying an unsubsidized device. After 12 months, users can switch to the latest iPhone to reset the payment process.  It's highly unlikely that an Android OEM can launch a comparable "forever" plan, since Android users can easily swap between handset brands without losing all their Google Play content. It's a launchpad for Apple Services That brand loyalty makes the iPhone an ideal launch pad for Apple's growing Services business, which includes the App Store, iTunes, iBooks, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that Apple plans to grow its software services to offset its gradual slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple's Services revenue rose 18% annually and accounted for 9% of its top line last quarter, but there have been a few speed bumps. Apple claims that Apple Pay's user base tripled over the past year, but Loup Venture recently claimed that just 13% of iPhone users have ever used the service. Wal-Mart still doesn't accept Apple Pay, and the service is still being trampled by Tencent's WePay and Alibaba's AliPay in China. Apple Music hit 20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2016, but questions about the platform's profit margins persist. Why is the iPhone a double-edged sword? It's easy to see why the iPhone is a double-edged sword. As long as iPhone sales are rising year-over-year, investors will be happy. But once interest in the iPhone finally fades, Apple needs new products and services to pick up the slack. Mac sales rose and iPad annual sales fell last quarter, but their combined sales only accounted for 16% of Apple's revenues. The Apple Watch still generates so little revenue that it's included in the Other Products category, along with iPods, Apple TV, and Beats audio devices. No one is sure what Apple's next big move will be -- whether it be new hardware products, media acquisitions, or connected cars -- but most investors agree that it needs to reduce the weight of the mighty iPhone on its top line.   Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

They can live and work here without visas. Their children attend local schools. They pay federal and state taxes, just like the rest of the community. But in all but the fewest cases they will never be able to qualify for Medicaid or Medicare under current law. The large community of people here from the Marshall Islands, located roughly halfway between Australia and Hawaii, fall into a peculiar gap of the US health care system — and it has left a great many of them in the most precarious of limbos. READ NEXT: A boy who can’t speak depends on Medicaid. What happens to him if it’s cut? While some have health insurance through their work, those who aren’t working or are elderly do not. Many don’t see a doctor unless it’s an emergency — a risky approach in a community where type 2 diabetes is startlingly common. “Most, by the time they see us … their chronic conditions are way out of control or they have other things that could have been caught by health care maintenance, like cancers. By the time they’re seen, it’s advanced,” explained Dr. Sheldon Riklon, a family medicine doctor who is one of only two Marshallese doctors in the US and who was recently recruited to practice in northwest Arkansas. Dr. Sheldon Riklon is one of only two Marshallese doctors in the US and was recently recruited to practice in northwest Arkansas. Photo by Kenneth M. Ruggiano/STAT The special status of the Marshallese is conferred by a treaty called the Compact of Free Association, commonly known as COFA. (It also covers the nations of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia.) It was struck when the Marshalls, formerly under a US trusteeship, gained their independence in 1986. Some see the treaty as a debt payment of sorts. For a dozen years after World War II, the US used the Marshall Islands as a nuclear testing ground; 67 nuclear tests were conducted there. Some parts of the country — whose islands have a combined landmass about the size of the District of Columbia, but stretch over 4,500 square miles of ocean — remain uninhabitable. To this day, the US maintains control over the waters of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and retains a naval base there. Arkansas happens to be home to the largest community of Marshallese in the continental United States. Many work in Springdale’s ubiquitous factories, where they process chickens or make candles or package baby wipes. But they aren’t US citizens and so don’t legally qualify for social safety net programs. Some states have tried to address the situation. Oregon has passed a law adding COFA migrants back into its state Medicare program, and similar legislation is working its way through the Washington state legislature. But even without the passage of new legislation in Washington, access to health care seems easier there for the Marshallese than in Arkansas, which has not amended its Medicaid and Medicare programs. In Springdale, people will tell you that if a family member gets really sick, they’ll head out of state. “If their health deteriorates and they know their health condition is deteriorating, they will leave us to go to Seattle because they know that they can have better health coverage in Seattle,” said Robin Thomas, administrator of a community clinic in Springdale that serves the Marshallese community. “As long as they can work and make money, they want to be here.” Michael Duke is an anthropologist at the University of Memphis who is studying the health needs of the Arkansas Marshallese. As he sees it, there’s inequity in their situation. “They pay federal income taxes but they don’t get back a lot of these services that citizens get,” Duke told STAT. “It would be one thing if they didn’t pay into the system. But they are paying into the system and subsidizing Americans, and not being able to benefit from those [services] themselves.” Some in the community need health services badly. Riklon splits his time among several clinics in cities that are strung along Interstate 49 like beads on a necklace. Fayetteville, Springdale, Lowell, Rogers, and Bentonville, the corporate home of Walmart. READ NEXT: Mumps outbreaks are spiking — and raising questions about vaccine effectiveness One of those clinics cares for Marshallese diabetes patients; it is operated with grant funding by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, at its Fayetteville campus. “When I treat them and I know that they have no insurance, I do my best to keep them off insulin. Because insulin is very expensive,” Riklon said. Melisa Laelan knows that too well. Laelan, 38, is the director of the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese, a group that advocates for the community. She is also a court translator, the first certified Marshallese court translator in the country. A few years ago she was working at a baby wipes factory. Her mother, who was living with Laelan, had diabetes. She did not have insurance, and she didn’t qualify for Medicaid. She died of complications of diabetes. “Her insulin was costing me $300 a month. … There were times that we had to go without those,” Laelan admitted. Jirkai Tatak, 52, is also a diabetic. He works as a pressman, printing the local issue of the Democrat Gazette. To avoid the penalty the Affordable Care Act levies on people without health insurance, Tatak purchases the cheapest plan available to him. It covers little, he said. Tatak cannot afford to buy insurance for his wife and their two children who live with them; the premiums would leave the family nothing to live on. What does he do if he gets sick? “That’s the question,” Tatak replied. “That’s the question.” It’s a question the Marshallese here have been asking for years, one echoed by local health service providers who struggle to cope with the community’s health needs. Local lawmakers appear to have heard their concerns. In mid-March the state Legislature passed a resolution calling for the inclusion of Marshall Islands-born children in ARKids First, Arkansas’s Medicaid program for children under 19. Crushed by defeat, patients and providers vow to fight on to expand Medicaid in Kansas The state health department is drafting the rules change that will be submitted to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services for approval. Backers of the resolution hope the change can be implemented by the end of the year, if not sooner. Sandy Hainline Williams, a nurse coordinator for the Marshallese and Latino communities at a Springdale clinic, said getting the Marshallese children into ARKids is a good place to start. Trying to get the state to change its Medicaid and Medicare rules to allow low-income Marshallese adults to qualify is a tougher challenge. “It’s been difficult to ask to put this population into our Medicaid program as adults because we don’t have a firm grasp on how many there are. So we’re asking for an unknown sum,” she said. Some people estimate there are between 8,000 to 10,000 Marshallese in Springdale and the surrounding area. Others say the figure may be approaching 14,000. Whatever the actual number, the city has a good-sized chunk of the global Marshallese population, estimated to be around 85,000. Outreach workers from the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese have been signing up members of the community for the Affordable Care Act if they can. Not everyone can afford it. The Marshallese could qualify for Medicaid or Medicare if they become US citizens, but the path to citizenship is difficult, if not impossible, for many.

Ruggiano/STAT The size and makeup of Marshallese families contribute to the dilemma. People tend to live in multigenerational households — a great-grandmother and grandmother might be living with two related families in the same dwelling. A Marshallese man with a job might be helping to support his sister’s children. But insurance policies don’t typically allow people to add on grandmothers or nieces and nephews. Even if they did, the costs would be out of reach for these families. Some of the newcomers speak little English, and don’t understand how health care delivery works in the US. In the Marshall Islands, people who need care go to a clinic, where the consultation, tests, and medicines prescribed will typically cost about $5. “They arrived here and they did what they know how to do. They went to the emergency rooms. You can’t hit an emergency room just to be triaged for under $280 anymore. So they were mounting up $1,000 bills for nothing and just got overwhelmed financially,” Hainline Williams said. A number of Springdale’s hospitals have charitable programs. But the application process is complex, often requiring documentation that the Marshallese don’t have. “If you hand them a packet of papers 30 to 70 pages long, they don’t get them completed. So a lot of them didn’t make applications,” Hainline Williams said. Jebé River, 61, a slender woman who is looking after her 12-year-old grandson, finds the situation bewildering. Through a translator, she explained that she tried to apply for the ACA, but missed the enrollment period. “It’s a lot easier in the islands,” she acknowledged.

Charlie Riedel AP Band members marching in the American Royal Parade in 2008 came from Lexington, Mo.,’s Wentworth Military Academy, which will shut down this spring amid money problems. Keith Myers The Kansas City Star file photo 1 of 2 i By Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Wentworth Military Academy and College, an institution in Lexington, Mo., for 137 years, will close its doors for good when the current semester ends May 31. Letters dated April 7 went out to cadets, students, parents and alumni of Wentworth telling them that declining revenues and increased expenses made it “impossible for Wentworth to continue providing the level of education and services expected, while remaining financially viable.” Allan Hallquist, a lawyer with Kansas City law firm Husch Blackwell who represents Wentworth, confirmed the upcoming closure. “The academy has had declining revenue, declining enrollment and increased expenses for a period of time,” Hallquist told The Star in an interview on Saturday. “They have had for a number of years a generous, loyal alumnus who funded the deficit while they have considered different strategies for increasing revenue. But they have not been able to operate in the black.” Hallquist declined to identify the alumnus. He said Wentworth planned an orderly wind up of its operations, settling of its debts and liquidation assets after this, its final semester, ends. “The Wentworth board decided to close with dignity and with an orderly fashion now as opposed to continuing to operate with a deficit and at some point in the future face with a brick wall and they would lose control,” Hallquist said. Wentworth, a private institution, had 220 cadets who boarded at the campus, 55 of which were high school students and the rest enrolled in its two-year college program. Another 300 civilian college students took classes at Wentworth. Wentworth, with its stately campus situated one block off Main Street in Lexington, about 50 miles east of Kansas City, counts the late Missouri Congressman Ike Skelton among its prominent alumni. James “Bud” Walton, co-founder of Wal-Mart, attended as well. The academy fell on difficult times in recent years. On November 5, 2015, the Higher Learning Commission put Wentworth’s accreditation status on probation. The commission cited concerns about Wentworth’s finances and resources to support academic programs. The commission was set to review Wentworth’s accreditation status on Monday, according to its website. According to Wentworth’s nonprofit filing with the Internal Revenue Services, the academy posted a $1 million loss for the year ending May 31, 2016. Hallquist said that there was no precipitating event that led to the Wentworth board’s decision to close. “Honestly, it’s an ongoing inability to operate in the black for a military academy in a small, rural Missouri town,” Hallquist said. Lexington Mayor Jerry Brown, former superintendent of Wentworth, told The Star that the Lexington City Council on Tuesday would discuss the academy’s situation. “We would like to continue this facility in Lexington,” Brown said. “Maybe reuse and maybe refurbish to some extent.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Missouri Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:02 John Glenn laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery Pause 2:21 Five things to know about Kansas City's new marijuana law 1:02 Strange Music Inc.'s move into pop music 1:30 Driving electric: A robust network of charging stations in KC encourages motorists to go electric 1:32 Work of student journalists leads to principal's resignation 2:27 Thursday update: forensic searching continues after discovery of human remains in Cass County 1:12 In January, family of Jessica Runions found a man's body two weekends in a row 1:06 Take a walk with Tech N9ne 0:36 Surveillance shows woman trying to stop vehicle theft by spraying man with gasoline 2:26 Meet the Editorial Board: Colleen McCain Nelson Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 8 days ago Side-by-side demonstration of home fire sprinklers 1:52 8 days ago Side-by-side demonstration of home fire sprinklers 4:13 14 days ago Kirksville parents seek justice for Green Beret son slain in Jordan 4:18 22 days ago Mizzou wrestler Joey Lavallee on making NCAA final View more video Missouri After 137 years, Wentworth Military Academy in Missouri to close Prescription drug monitoring: Missouri Sen.

Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com FORISTELL • “I see they’re closed, but I still gotta ask questions,” said Nick Damaso, after pulling down the gravel driveway marked with the shrimp-emblazoned sign for Triple J Farms, near Foristell. Damaso, a resident of nearby Lake Sherwood, walked to the door, determined to learn more. His curiosity was justified, since it’s not often one comes across a shrimp farm in Missouri. But here, about 650 miles removed from the nearest ocean saltwater, Triple J Farms is making its move into inland shrimp aquaculture. In place of the sea, the operation has crammed eight round pools plus an additional water storage tank into a modestly sized indoor facility — enough to stock up to 28,000 Pacific whiteleg shrimp. In November, the farm welcomed its first delivery of post-larval shrimp and made its first sale in February when that shipment completed its roughly three-month growth cycle into jumbo-size specimens as long as a human hand. The novelty of the business might raise some eyebrows and attract visitors such as Damaso for tours, but Jeff and James Howell — the brothers who operate the farm — hope its regional uniqueness can become a selling point. So far, the farm has served customers only over the counter at its Foristell facility, but the Howells are aiming to attract business from restaurants looking to buy locally produced and responsibly raised seafood. “We’d love to partner with a restaurant,” Jeff Howell said. “There’s nobody yet (in St. Louis) with farm-to-table seafood.” Triple J sees an opportunity to step into that void. “A lot of people today, they don’t know where their main protein comes from,” James Howell said. That’s especially true, the brothers say, for seafood in the U.S., more than 90 percent of which is imported. Shrimp, like many kinds of seafood, is prone to overfishing. But the majority of the world’s supply is farmed — not caught — with Asian countries such as China, Thailand and Vietnam dominating production. Shrimp aquaculture in Asia is its own cause of environmental concern, with shrimp farms’ discharge of effluent representing a significant pollution issue in coastal areas. The opportunity to provide a locally sourced alternative was compelling enough to draw the Howell brothers away from former jobs in excavation and helping on the family’s farm of row crops near Defiance. The idea originated with their father, Dave Howell, who read about shrimp farms as a market for soybean meal in a Corn and Soybean Digest article several years ago. Triple J doesn’t use soy-based feed, but the story piqued a lasting interest in aquaculture that Dave eventually passed to his sons. “I just thought it was something different and no one was doing it around here,” said Dave, who co-owns the business along with a third son, Jason. “And I love shrimp.” Now Jeff and James’ around-the-clock attention is commanded by the undertaking, which requires constant management of water temperature, oxygen levels, alkalinity and other variables crucial to shrimp survival. The operation does not discharge any of its water, recycling it through the system and relying on the bacteria that coexist with the shrimp to consume the waste and keep the water clean. Perhaps surprisingly, the Howells aren’t alone as Midwestern shrimp producers. They buy their shrimp larvae from an Indiana facility and are aware of a few other shrimp farms around Missouri. And they point out that the state has had other types of aquaculture take root in unlikely — and creative — places, such as an old Walmart building converted into a tilapia farm in Chillicothe. In fact, some experts think Triple J could be among the pioneers for a broader trend in regional aquaculture. “There are a number of farmers in the state that are attempting to do this,” said David Brune, an aquacultural engineer with the University of Missouri who has specialized in saltwater shrimp farming for the past 20 years of his career. “We’re right on the edge of this taking off. I think it’s going to be big once we establish a few successes.” Though not familiar with the Howells’ new operation, Brune echoed their belief that a robust market can be found for their product, even at a substantially higher price than the cheap, imported shrimp that floods the U.S. “I think everyone understands that there is a huge market for locally grown, environmentally responsible shrimp production,” said Brune, explaining that the 90 percent of seafood imported into the country represents an annual outflow of $12 billion to $14 billion. “The potential is huge, the volume is huge, the price is high.” He says the environmental benefits of aquaculture extend to energy. On a per unit basis, shrimp and fish production beat other major sources of animal protein. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis “Marine shrimp and fish production can be done at about 5 kilowatt-hours of energy per pound of product,” Brune said. He said that energy footprint is dwarfed by totals for chicken (8 kilowatt-hours), pork (24 kilowatt-hours) and beef (35 kilowatt-hours). Though the technical challenges of raising them are considerable, Brune says shrimp can offer some of the best bang for their buck in aquaculture, with domestically grown varieties able to fetch up to $20 per pound. Triple J is currently charging $18 a pound for their largest shrimp, according to their website. “There just isn’t any other product out there that can grow so quickly and command such a high price,” Brune says. That growth rate and abundance is on firsthand display at Triple J Farms, where each tank of 3,500 shrimp yields about 150-200 pounds every three months. “When you think about the size of facility that this is, that’s a lot of food you’re producing,” Jeff Howell said. Triple J’s main challenge for now is establishing itself and finding reliable consumers for all that shrimp. And eventually the farm hopes to expand into the business of shrimp breeding. “We’re either gonna be really smart or really dumb, because we don’t have any competition,” Jeff Howell jokes, assessing Triple J’s outlook. But Brune thinks others are watching Missouri’s shrimp-producing pioneers closely to see how they fare. “A lot of farmers like the idea of producing a high-value product like this,” he said. “What I want to happen is these key farmers become successful as quickly as possible. Once they become successful, they become a model for all other farmers.” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Updated: April 9, 2017 @ 12:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go! Life Buy/Sell Business Close Seth Perlman Payday loan signage. (AP file photo by  Seth Perlman) top story Why the payday loan industry is declining in Missouri By Walker Moskop St. Louis Post-Dispatch Walker Moskop 14 hrs ago (…) Payday loan signage. (AP file photo by  Seth Perlman) Seth Perlman In Missouri, home of some of the most relaxed consumer lending laws in the nation, the payday loan industry has been shrinking for years. After the Legislature changed the state’s usury laws to allow high-interest, short term loans in the 1990s, storefronts began popping up across the state. By 2005, there were 1,335 licensed lenders operating. Today, there are 653. The 1.62 million loans taken out last year, according to a recent state survey, was a little more than half of what it was 10 years before. Part of that decline is simply a shift to different types of loans. Many payday lenders haven’t closed — they now focus on installment loans. Rather than a two-week, lump-sum payment period (which may be rolled over as many as six times), installment loans are paid back in chunks over four or more months, but can still carry triple-digit annual interest. The number of installment lenders (many of which still offer payday loans) more than tripled from 2005-2013, to 976. But that growth stalled, and in 2016, several dozen installment lenders didn’t renew licenses. Most lenders are private, so overall industry profits are difficult to track. But according to the annual financial reports installment lenders are required to file with the state, some of the largest lending chains are either treading water or closing stores as their revenues drop. It’s unclear to what degree Missourians are taking on fewer risky loans, or if they’re simply shifting to other forms of subprime credit. “There’s a perception companies are making money hand over fist,” said Al Leving, who stopped offering payday loans at his the Loan Machine stores years ago but still sits on the board of the United Payday Lenders of Missouri. “Many people have closed stores in recent years because the business has not been profitable.” Driven out by competition or regulation? There are a variety of factors contributing to the struggles of brick-and-mortar short-term lenders. It’s possible there was an overextension that occurred as the payday loan industry exploded in the early 2000s, leading to an oversupply of stores. The recession likely put many smaller lenders out of business. And the growing availability of products such as online installment loans and subprime credit cards has taken away some of the market. The number of online-only licensed lenders in the state has tripled since 2012, to 197. “I think the story is more market-driven than regulatory driven,” said Alex Horowitz, a Pew Charitable Trusts researcher who studies small dollar loans. Lenders interviewed by the Post-Dispatch, on the other hand, were quick to blame federal regulators. Rules proposed last year by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, they argue, will add to their costs, reduce their customer base and put most of them out of business. The proposed rules would require lenders to assess a borrower’s ability to repay, implement income verification measures, limit loan rollovers, and provide more disclosures related to payments. Seeing the writing on the wall, chains have closed struggling stores, Leving said. A spokesman for one of the nation’s largest payday lenders, Advance America, said it shuttered several Missouri locations last year. State records indicate some small lenders that had only one or a handful of locations are no longer operating. Transitioning from payday to installment loans — which must be at least $500, under Missouri law — requires having more capital on hand, Horowitz said, a transition that some smaller lenders might struggle with. Many companies that focus on high-interest short term loans, particularly those who rely heavily on payday loan profits, have had credit ratings downgraded, in part due to the industry’s gloomy regulatory outlook. It’s unclear when the rules, which have received fierce opposition from lenders, will be implemented, or whether they’ll be revised. President Donald Trump has been critical of the CFPB, and many lenders are hopeful that the new administration or Congress will prevent the rules from taking effect. The CFPB, however, has more independence than other agencies, and its director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee, can only be removed for cause. Cordray’s term expires in July 2018. Earlier this month, U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of the Trump administration, argued in court that the agency’s structure is constitutional and that Trump should have be able to remove Cordray. “The people I’ve talked to were very relieved when Trump won the election,” said Roy Hutcheson, an Alabama businessman who operates 49 Title Cash of Missouri stores. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis He said business in Missouri suffered less than in other states. According to filings with the state, his revenue from payday and installment loans dropped from $12.8 million in 2013 to $11.2 million in 2015, the most recent year available. Charge-offs rose by more than 20 percent, to $2.8 million, and the business turned a profit of $400,000 before taxes, according to the filings. “We’ve been in decline for four years,” he said. Some of it is due to regulations and competition from online lenders, he said, and some of it was because his customers hadn’t recovered from the recession. “Everybody’s been telling us (the economy) has been getting better,” he said, “but I don’t see the results.” Like other lenders interviewed, Hutcheson said that in some instances banks, under pressure from the Justice Department, have cut off relationships with his stores. In some areas, he said, he can’t find a bank, so his employees go to Walmart and use cash to get a money order, which they scan and send to a bank in Alabama to be deposited. One of the nation’s largest title lending chains, TitleMax, has also seen loan volume and revenue decline in Missouri; it has closed several stores. The company’s profit dropped from $16 million before taxes in 2014 to $14 million in 2015, the most recent year a state filing was available. Its loan volume fell from $55 million to $50.6 million, and the number of cars it repossessed in the state dropped from 8,960 to 8,137. The company didn’t respond to an interview request. The state’s largest payday lender, QC Holdings, of Overland Park, Kan., saw its operating income in Missouri drop from $54 million in 2013 to $37 million in 2015, according to state filings. It voluntarily delisted from the Nasdaq exchange to save money on compliance costs. According to 2016 filing, nationwide, QC lost $5.1 million through the first nine months of the year, partly due to one-time expenses including the cost of closing stores in several states and a legal settlement. In previous filings, the company attributed flagging revenue to regulatory pressure and increased competition, including from online lenders. The company referred an interview request to an industry trade group, which declined to answer questions about a specific company. What’s next? Consumer advocates have long argued that payday lenders take advantage of vulnerable customers and that their business models depend on customers repeatedly renewing loans — thus racking up more interest and fees — before repaying. While some advocates may cheer the industry’s struggles, it’s unclear how a continued shift away from payday loans could affect cash-strapped borrowers. Online loan products tend to be more expensive than identically structured in-person loans, and while installment loans may give the borrower more time to repay, they can still carry high interest and fees over time. Ed Groshans, an analyst at Height Analytics, said many current payday borrowers couldn’t qualify for a loan if the current CFPB proposal was implemented. Nor do they qualify for less expensive alternatives, he said, like a personal loan from a credit union. “I’m not a fan of the payday lending industry, but I’m not a fan of just lopping it off,” Groshans said. “The industry wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t a need.” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Penney releases list of 138 store closures, including 7 Michigan stores NEW YORK - Retail stores are cutting jobs at the sharpest pace in more than seven years, evidence of a seemingly inexorable shift away from employee-heavy stores as Americans increasingly shop online. A combined 60,600 retail job losses over the past two months have had less to do with the health of U.S. consumer spending than with changes in buying habits. In the age of Amazon, traditional stores, from J.C. Penney to Macy's, have accelerated store closures and are experimenting with the use of fewer employees to staff the remaining stores. The industry has also been bruised by a string of bankruptcy filings, most recently from Payless ShoeSource. The company announced this week that it was closing nearly 400 stores, nearly 10 percent of its fleet. The job cuts in the retail industry, unwelcome as they are, are still a relatively minor burden for the overall U.S. economy. But for Americans seeking a foothold in the job market, the pullback represents a painful obstacle. Retail accounts for nearly one-third of first-time jobs in the United States, so a retrenchment by the industry's employers can block access to the job market for many. As shopping on the web has expanded, retail jobs have represented a declining share of the labor market. They now account for 10.9 percent of jobs, compared with 11.6 percent in 2000, says Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, a research firm. And experts expect more store closings — and job losses — in coming months. "It's principally about the impact of online shopping and how consumers are shopping differently than ever before," Niemira said. "It's harder for the industry to consistently do well and make money." Take Fernando Ramirez, a 19-year-old restaurant server and college student, who was looking Friday to buy some sweaters at a Kohl's in Tustin, California. Ramirez said he stops at a department store or mall once or twice a week to see what's available. But most of his buying is done on the web. "It's mostly to browse and see what they have," said Ramirez, who lives in Tustin, Calif. "I do more of my purchasing online now." The two-month contraction in retail jobs — 30,900 lost in February and 29,700 in March — marked the largest two-month decline since December 2009, when the industry shed 62,200 jobs. That month's loss had signaled the end of a prolonged decline in the industry resulting from the Great Recession. The retail industry losses for February and March were contained in Friday's U.S. jobs report from the government. The report offered an overall mixed message: Hiring in the United States dropped to its weakest pace in nearly a year, but the unemployment rate managed to reach its lowest level in nearly a decade. The jobs report pointed to dire problems confronting many of the stores populating shopping plazas and malls. Department and general merchandise stores — a category that includes Macy's and Wal-Mart — shed 34,700 workers last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Retailers involved in high-priced big ticket items such as furniture stores and auto dealers barely added jobs. Nor are wages keeping pace. Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 percent average increase for all U.S. workers. The struggles of many traditional retailers can be traced most of all to Amazon and other online retailers. Amazon's Prime membership program, costing $99 a year, has been a juggernaut, with services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members disproportionately buy more and spend more. In the process, Amazon has redefined the standards for its rival retailers. They now feel more pressure to limit costs while expanding services and offers for shoppers, from free shipping to non-stop discounting, which take a toll on profit margins. It's hardly just Amazon. One online-only retailer, Chewy.com, sells an array of pet supplies beyond what's generally available in physical stores, including high-end organic pet food. The fast-growing company plans to add about 3,200 jobs this year, raising its head count to 6,900. Though traditional retailers are expanding their own online presences, those operations require far fewer workers. The labor involved in selling an item online through a distribution center can be 50 percent less than if it were sold in a store, estimates Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners, LLP, a consultancy. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC, a research firm, says he expects earnings for the first quarter for the 113 retailers he tracks to drop 6.8 percent. That would be the worst quarterly performance since 2013. Stores are also increasingly adopting technology that reduces the need for employees, like shopping kiosks and iPads where shoppers can buy online while in a store. And some traditional stores like Macy's are testing self-service in some of their shoe departments. In the restaurant industry, executives have touted the benefits of automation for customers. Ordering kiosks, for instance, can help speed up lines and improve order accuracy. Though it's still early, chains including McDonald's and Panera have introduced ordering screens in some stores. And some sit-down chains have introduced table-top ordering tablets. One of the hard realities of the new shopping era is evident at the Richmond Town Center outside of Cleveland, where the number of employees working at stores appeared to exceed the slim number of shoppers on a cold spring afternoon Friday. Two of the mall's three anchors— Sears and Macy's — have closed in the past year. The third, J.C. Penney, is slated to close in June. Tiffany Fulton was cutting through J.C. Penney to get a new battery for a watch. She doesn't shop at the mall regularly, she said, and her buying habits, especially for clothes, involve stocking up "every blue moon" and then not shopping again for six months or even a year. She said she goes to the mall every once in a while for some "retail therapy." "If I need to feel better, I might stop by," Fulton said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

That means the Blue Apron IPO date could be just months away. Right now, there are a lot of questions about the Blue Apron IPO. The company still isn't profitable (founded in 2012), and the meal delivery space in the United States is extremely competitive. But TechCrunch had an interesting theory on why Blue Apron could be rushing an IPO: to attract acquisition offers. The increasing competition is undoubtedly the biggest challenge for Blue Apron moving forward… Sun Basket, another meal kit delivery service, just hired investment bankers in mid-March for IPO preparation. Sun Basket touts celebrity Justine Kelly (appeared on "Iron Chef America") as its executive chef and is racing towards a public offering despite being founded just three years ago. HelloFresh, Plated, Home Chef, and Purple Carrot are also competitors to Blue Apron. It's Simple – and Incredibly Profitable: This two-step investing strategy has uncovered more than 400 double- and triple-digit peak-gain winners. The next one's coming up soon – don't miss it. Learn more… If Blue Apron ever wants to become profitable, the company may need to sell itself. The best strategy for CEO Matt Salzber and his management team is keeping their positions and having the resources of a larger business behind them. Two companies that could have interest in Blue Apron are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE: PEP). Walmart has expanded into online grocery pickup and delivery, which helps it keep up with online retailers. Pepsi has diversified itself with healthy offerings like probiotic drinks and juice smoothies, so Blue Apron would provide an even more diverse revenue source. But there is one clear front-runner to acquire Blue Apron before the IPO… After the Blue Apron IPO Date, This Company Could Swoop In Join the conversation.

Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn’t add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn’t last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors’ views of the U.S. economy. “It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports,” he said. Wren said the economy probably won’t grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor’s 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn’t move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months, employers had added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That’s just a bit slower than the monthly average from 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn’t last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from “The O’Reilly Factor.” Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O’Reilly, the network’s most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week. Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn’t doing enough to oversee the bank’s sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers’ permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX hardly budged. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was little changed. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, stocks, cents, after, fargo, wells, Other stories from today: Google expands fact checking in news searches Uber fires back at Google spinoff in self-driving car case U.S. regulators accuse Google of underpaying female workers     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   How much do you approve of the job performance of President Trump?

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Letter: Paris Agreement commitments By Karen Jackson For the Deseret News Published: April 8, 2017 6:00 a.m. Updated: yesterday 4 Comments “It’s wrong," says Michael Bloomberg, referring to the belief that the U.S. can no longer meet Paris Agreement commitments or that American leadership on climate will end due to the roadblocks of the current administration. Sierra Club analysis agrees and asserts that much of our commitment can be reached through local actions. Basic economics support these assertions. Since 2010, 250 coal mines in the U.S. have become financially unviable and more are scheduled to close. Wind power is two-thirds the price of electricity from coal and is widely available. Apple, Wal-Mart and 79 other corporations are leading by signing agreements to cut emissions — all without any legislative action from Washington. As powerful consumers, we are driving the clean energy market with solar installations, bike transportation, recycling and reusing, eating less meat and line-drying our clothes. And we can join grass-roots organizations like Citizens Climate Lobby, which meets regularly with Congress to discuss legislation for a livable world, including a fee on carbon. As Americans, we take our personal and international commitments seriously. We will not ignore opportunities for clean energy and healthy communities or discourage ourselves with mistaken beliefs.

Department and general merchandise stores — a category that includes Macy’s and Wal-Mart — shed 34,700 workers last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Retailers involved in high-priced big ticket items such as furniture stores and auto dealers barely added jobs. Nor are wages keeping pace. Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 percent average increase for all U.S. workers. The struggles of many traditional retailers can be traced most of all to Amazon and other online retailers. Amazon’s Prime membership program, costing $99 a year, has been a juggernaut, with services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members disproportionately buy more and spend more. In the process, Amazon has redefined the standards for its rival retailers. They now feel more pressure to limit costs while expanding services and offers for shoppers, from free shipping to non-stop discounting, which take a toll on profit margins. It’s hardly just Amazon. One online-only retailer, Chewy.com, sells an array of pet supplies beyond what’s generally available in physical stores, including high-end organic pet food. The fast-growing company plans to add about 3,200 jobs this year, raising its head count to 6,900. Though traditional retailers are expanding their own online presences, those operations require far fewer workers. The labor involved in selling an item online through a distribution center can be 50 percent less than if it were sold in a store, estimates Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners, LLP, a consultancy. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC, a research firm, says he expects earnings for the first quarter for the 113 retailers he tracks to drop 6.8 percent. That would be the worst quarterly performance since 2013. Stores are also increasingly adopting technology that reduces the need for employees, like shopping kiosks and iPads where shoppers can buy online while in a store. And some traditional stores like Macy’s are testing self-service in some of their shoe departments. In the restaurant industry, executives have touted the benefits of automation for customers. Ordering kiosks, for instance, can help speed up lines and improve order accuracy. Though it’s still early, chains including McDonald’s and Panera have introduced ordering screens in some stores. And some sit-down chains have introduced table-top ordering tablets. One of the hard realities of the new shopping era is evident at the Richmond Town Center outside of Cleveland, where the number of employees working at stores appeared to exceed the slim number of shoppers on a cold spring afternoon Friday. Two of the mall’s three anchors— Sears and Macy’s — have closed in the past year. The third, J.C. Penney, is slated to close in June. Tiffany Fulton was cutting through J.C. Penney to get a new battery for a watch. She doesn’t shop at the mall regularly, she said, and her buying habits, especially for clothes, involve stocking up “every blue moon” and then not shopping again for six months or even a year. She said she goes to the mall every once in a while for some “retail therapy.” “If I need to feel better, I might stop by,” Fulton said.

Photo by Jefferson Siegel BY ALBERT AMATEAU | Harold “Heshy” Jacob, who along with former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and William Rapfogel, former director of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, formed a triumvirate of political influence and power on the Lower East Side, died at the age of 71 last month. He had been ill for several months before his death on June 23. At Heshy Jacob’s funeral at the Bialystoker Synagogue just off Grand St., rabbis, politicians and real estate developers were among the crowd. Also among the mourners were Silver, currently out on appeal after his recent corruption conviction, and Rapfogel, who pleaded guilty two years ago to stealing $9 million from his organization. In their day, Shelly, Willie and Heshy, as they were known in the neighborhood, dominated politics in the largely Orthodox Jewish community, which was losing ground to Latino and Asian newcomers. Explaining the dominance of the three men on local politics, Heshy told the Forward, the renowned Jewish journal of the Lower East Side, “We put in time and effort for the people. It’s not that we simply are despots.” Heshy’s power base was his position as general manager of two of the original four Grand St. co-ops, Hillman House and East River House. He had previously managed the Seward Park Co-ops and Amalgamated Co-ops, as well. An editor of the Grand St. News once quipped that Heshy was “at times more general than manager.” A Dec. 5, 2001, Villager article about the co-ops selling briskly after going market rate, noted that Jacob prided himself on having operated the complexes without increasing carrying charges for nine years. “It doesn’t mean it will go on forever, but it does mean we watch every dollar,” he said. “There’s no job that I ask my men to do that I haven’t done myself. If they have to jackhammer a surface, I’ve used a jackhammer myself and I know how it should be done and how long it should take. I watch the commodities market to time heating-oil purchases to get the best price.” A member of Hatzolah, the Jewish volunteer ambulance service, since the early 1960s, Heshy was a founder of its branch on the Lower East Side. (A parade of Hatzolah ambulances was part of the cortege that carried Heshy’s body to its resting place in Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, Long Island.) A 2005 police incident, in which Heshy’s son Shalom was arrested for trying to force his way past an Emergency Medical Service team and its police escort into the apartment of an elderly woman in distress, illustrates the complexity of Heshy’s neighborhood influence. Shalom, a Hatzolah supervisor and a resident of the same building, 575 Grand St., as the woman, insisted that Hatzolah take over attending to her. He was arrested and taken to the Pitt St. police station, but not until Heshy, also a resident of the same building in the East River Houses, turned up with a group of residents as supporters. They all trooped down to the police station and argued for three hours, leaving only after a Manhattan chief of patrol turned up, with Shelly Silver following. It wasn’t until the following day that misdemeanor charges were filed.

Photo by Clayton Patterson Heshy was instrumental in convincing the limited-equity co-ops, built by labor unions in the 1930s, to go private. The privatization was a windfall for the original residents. Heshy also fought for 40 years to keep low-income housing from being built in what was left of the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area, or SPURA, five blocks between Rivington St. and the Williamsburg Bridge. Supporters of low-income housing charged that their opponents — who included Silver and Rapfogel as well as Jacob — wanted to prevent more Latinos and Asians from coming into the neighborhood and reducing Orthodox Jewish influence. Heshy insisted that the neighborhood had enough low-income housing, built in the late ’60s, and needed instead commercial development that would create jobs. In a Dec. 30, 2010, article in The Villager on then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s SPURA proposal, Jacob told the newspaper that if 300 of the planned 1,000 units in the project were low-income, then the whole SPURA site – including what had already been built up to that point — would effectively be 70 percent low-income. “They want a site 70 percent low-income — I oppose it,” Jacob stated bluntly. “That’s not called integration. That’s called segregation. … If you added 1,000 market-rate units, the site would still be 53 percent low-income. “We don’t live in Russia or China — people live where they can afford it,” said Jacob, who was not known for his political correctness. “I’d like to ask the mayor, how many low-income people live in his neighborhood? None.” Two decades earlier, Jacob had proposed a plan to make SPURA into an “international mall,” with restaurants, shopping and entertainment. The idea was for a mix of cuisines and entrepreneurs, he said, “Jews, Italians, Chinese, Hispanic, black, Polish, Russian, Mexican, Cuban — a beautiful quilt representing all the ethnic groups.” The city, though, didn’t bite on his proposal. Back in 2010, Jacob supported a Costco or Wal-Mart at SPURA, but said, “I would require them to say 50 percent of people that work there would be from the Lower East Side.” In 2013, the city announced a new mixed-use plan, known as Essex Crossing, calling for 1,000 units of housing, half of them for low-, moderate- and middle-income tenants, a new Essex St. Market, parkland and a museum. Explaining his own preeminence in the neighborhood, Heshy told the Forward in 2013, “If you’re the person that, if somebody has a problem, he goes to you day and night, and you take the time and effort to help them, then they think you’re in charge.” Harold Jacob was born on E. Fifth St. and Avenue D to Shalom and Chana Yaakov. His father died when he was a child and the family moved to Grand St. Educated in a local yeshiva, Heshy studied further with prominent neighborhood rabbis. He served for a time in the office of Harrison Goldin, the city comptroller in the administration of Mayor Ed Koch. Heshy’s wife of 50 years, Esther, survives, as do a brother, Marvin, a sister, Layla Wollman, his sons, Shalom and Dov, his daughters, Rompy Klug, Yocherad Wenz and Aliza Malek, and several grandchildren.

A combined 60,600 retail job losses over the past two months have had less to do with the health of U.S. consumer spending than with changes in buying habits. In the age of Amazon, traditional stores, from J.C. Penney to Macy’s, have accelerated store closures and are experimenting with the use of fewer employees to staff the remaining stores. The industry has also been bruised by a string of bankruptcy filings, most recently from Payless ShoeSource. The company announced this week that it was closing nearly 400 stores, nearly 10 percent of its fleet. The job cuts in the retail industry, unwelcome as they are, are still a relatively minor burden for the overall U.S. economy. But for Americans seeking a foothold in the job market, the pullback represents a painful obstacle. Retail accounts for nearly one-third of first-time jobs in the United States, so a retrenchment by the industry’s employers can block access to the job market for many. Online Chat: DJ Kachman, the Veterans Affairs Department’s director of mobile and security technology transformation lead, on April 10, at 1 p.m. Advertisement As shopping on the web has expanded, retail jobs have represented a declining share of the labor market. They now account for 10.9 percent of jobs, compared with 11.6 percent in 2000, says Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, a research firm. And experts expect more store closings — and job losses — in coming months. “It’s principally about the impact of online shopping and how consumers are shopping differently than ever before,” Niemira said. “It’s harder for the industry to consistently do well and make money.” Take Fernando Ramirez, a 19-year-old restaurant server and college student, who was looking Friday to buy some sweaters at a Kohl’s in Tustin, California. Ramirez said he stops at a department store or mall once or twice a week to see what’s available. But most of his buying is done on the web. “It’s mostly to browse and see what they have,” said Ramirez, who lives in Tustin, Calif. “I do more of my purchasing online now.” The two-month contraction in retail jobs — 30,900 lost in February and 29,700 in March — marked the largest two-month decline since December 2009, when the industry shed 62,200 jobs. That month’s loss had signaled the end of a prolonged decline in the industry resulting from the Great Recession. The retail industry losses for February and March were contained in Friday’s U.S. jobs report from the government. The report offered an overall mixed message: Hiring in the United States dropped to its weakest pace in nearly a year, but the unemployment rate managed to reach its lowest level in nearly a decade. Read the latest on Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. The jobs report pointed to dire problems confronting many of the stores populating shopping plazas and malls.

(Courtesy: TBI) COLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) – Court papers filed in connection with the disappearance of a 15-year-old Tennessee girl and a former teacher allege that she feared the man and he told her she would face repercussions at school if she resisted him. The petition was filed by Anthony Thomas on behalf of his daughter, Elizabeth Thomas, who disappeared from her home in Columbia on March 13. The court papers ask Maury County Chancery Court to allow the family’s lawyer to take depositions of people with information. The petition alleges that the father learned that Tad Cummins had threatened his daughter with repercussions at school if she didn’t go with him for a meal. The document also said Elizabeth Thomas was “scared of Cummins and felt in over her head.” PHOTOS: AMBER Alert for Elizabeth Thomas An AMBER Alert remains in effect for both of them and Cummins is currently listed as one of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation’s Top 10 Most Wanted. Neither has been heard from since they disappeared on March 13, and they were seen once on surveillance footage at an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Walmart two days later. Elizabeth is a 15-year-old white female with hazel eyes who stands 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male, who stands 6 feet tall, weighs approximately 200 pounds, and has brown hair and eyes. He’s believed to be armed with two handguns. It remains unknown if they were still traveling in Cummins’ silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. Anyone with information on their whereabouts is urged to call 1-800-TBI-FIND.

They're less fond of the hefty price tag that sometimes comes with all the Easter candy and Easter gifts that go inside of the basket. While it is possible to spend a small fortune on gourmet goodies, a little careful shopping can help your dollar go further this holiday. Syda Productions / Shutterstock.com Jellybeans Cost: Approx. $1-$3.99 for up a 9-ounce bag (depending on brand) Love them or hate them, Easter just wouldn't be the same without jellybeans. There are so many different flavors of jellybeans available that it's easy to make a personalized Easter basket with these sweet and tart candies. A 9-ounce bag of standard jellybeans costs $1 in most stores. To save money, buy the large bag and divvy the jellybeans up into individual plastic sandwich bags you likely already have in your kitchen. Slightly smaller packages of gourmet jelly beans — like Jelly Belly jellybeans — are more expensive, but they are ideal for kids with specific flavor preferences or who like a vast assortment of flavors. You can also pick up a 2.75-ounce bag of organic jellybeans for less than $2.50. And-One / Shutterstock.com Chocolate Bunnies Cost: Approx. $2-$4 (depending on size and brand) Like jellybeans, chocolate bunnies are a classic Easter candy. Most commonly available in white, milk or dark varieties, approximately 90 million chocolate Easter bunnies and similar chocolate confections are sold each Easter season. Chocolate rabbits average $2-$4 each, depending on size and brand, at retailers like Target. From Candy to Cards: How Much Americans Spend on the Easter Holiday Julie Clopper / Shutterstock.com Peeps Cost: $1 for a pack of 4 original Peeps Peeps — those colorful chick- and bunny-shaped marshmallows — add whimsy to all kids Easter baskets. Peeps can be purchased in many different sized packages and colors. Nowadays, they're also available in milk-chocolate covered and raspberry white-fudge dipped flavors. You can even buy limited edition Peeps Oreo cookies, which feature marshmallow Peeps flavored creme. Peeps average $1 for a pack of four or less than $2 for a three-pack of the raspberry white fudge-dipped variety. Elina Manninen / Shutterstock.com Sidewalk Chalk Cost: $1 for a 6-pack of egg-shaped chalk As the weather becomes nicer, parents are on the lookout for fun, inexpensive activities to enjoy outdoors. That's where sidewalk chalk comes in. Sidewalk chalk offers plenty of playtime fun for younger kids. As long as there's bare pavement, your children will have a space to create. A 20-count box of sidewalk chalk costs just $1 at a dollar store. Some stores also carry egg-shaped sidewalk chalk, which is ideal for an Easter gift. A packet of six colored chalk eggs costs just $1. Pra Chid / Shutterstock.com Bubbles Cost: $1 for a 3-pack of four-ounce bubbles Bubbles serve as another special playtime treat for the kiddos that's perfect for springtime fun outdoors. Like chalk, bubbles can be purchased at a discount or dollar store. A pack of three 2-ounce bottles costs just $1, and the size is perfect to tuck into an Easter basket without taking up too much space. Save More: The Best Generic Brands to Save Money Mahony / Shutterstock.com Plant Kits Cost: Approx. $1-$2.49 for plant kits Grow-your-own plant kits — which usually come with a small pot, soil and seeds — are a precious gift that help teach children responsibility. Some kits include cute character pots like ladybugs or bumblebees along with grass seeds. Plant kits from certain dollar stores come with seeds for easy-to-grow flowers like daisies and violets. Milosz_G / Shutterstock.com Small Toys Cost: $1 or more (depending on toy) Possibly the easiest way to make a personalized Easter basket is to select a toy that matches a child's interest from the dollar section at retailers like Walmart and Target. While the toy will likely not be as high quality as one that could cost upwards of $10, you'll at least be giving something that can be enjoyed for the day. Africa Studio / Shutterstock.com Tips for Assembling Kids Easter Baskets Assembling Easter baskets for kids is simple. Grab the items you've purchased above, and then follow these tips: Select a basket that matches each child's favorite color. For instance, if a child's favorite color is yellow, choose a yellow basket or small metal pail. You can also craft a basket out of yellow construction paper. Fill each basket with Easter grass or use shredded tissue paper. If you need to purchase Easter grass, stores like Target offer a variety of colors and styles for $2 or less. Put small Easter gifts — such as candies or pencil erasers — inside hollow plastic eggs. Arrange each basket with the largest item in the back, as viewed by the child receiving it. Other large items can be placed around the perimeter of the basket. Set small items atop the grass so they're easily found. Easter baskets don't have to cost an arm and a leg to be enjoyed by kids. As seen here, even those on a limited budget can buy Easter candy and gifts to create custom-tailored baskets their young ones will love.

By Lia Sestric | April 8, 2017 You don't have to be Chip or Joanna Gaines from the HGTV show "Fixer Upper" to appreciate Home Depot. It's one of the largest home improvement retailers, with more than 2,200 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Whether you're buying paint or going for a full bathroom remodel, chances are you can save money at Home Depot. Use these savvy tips to save on your next purchase. ©Home Depot Use Home Depot Coupons, Discount Gift Cards and More If you really want to rack up home improvement savings, make sure you're taking advantage of all available coupons and discounts. Military service members, for example, earn 10 percent off at Home Depot. Just bring a military I.D. when you shop. Veterans also qualified for a 10 percent discount on Memorial Day in 2016. You can also find discounts on sites like CouponSherpa.com and Groupon. In late March, Groupon advertised a promotional code for 20 percent off lighting purchases made online. Meanwhile, CouponSherpa.com found deals for 20 percent off small appliances at Home Depot, plus cash-back deals on LG appliance bundles. On sites like GiftCardGranny.com, you can buy discounted gift cards. People who don't want their gift cards securely sell them on the site. You can currently save 4 percent on Home Depot gift cards of varying values. If you subscribe to text alerts from Home Depot, you will get a coupon sent to you via text message for $5 off your next purchase. You must spend $50 to use the coupon. With text alerts, you'll also hear about the latest promotions at Home Depot. Belen Strehl / Shutterstock.com Learn How to Spot Markdowns You can find home improvement deals throughout the store — if you know how to spot them. You can often find clearance items and price markdowns on end caps in the store, so it's good to actively look as you walk the aisles, said Lori Felix of money-saving blog MoreWithLessToday.com. "You might get lucky and find just what you are looking for," she said. The price tags can tell you whether a price is a final markdown, Felix said. Here's how it generally works: Prices ending in .06 are a clearance item and has six weeks until the price drops again. Prices ending in .03 have three weeks before being taken off shelves. It's best to get the product then. If you're shopping for paint, you also don't want to miss the aisle with the "oops" paint rack. You can find big discounts on paints that are either the wrong tint or were not the color the customer requested. Related: 7 Best Home Renovations That Will Pay for Themselves ©Home Depot Don’t Buy Tools — Rent Them With hundreds of tools and pieces of equipment available to rent at Home Depot, you don't need to buy tools you'll only ever use once. Whether you're moving, in the midst of a DIY home renovation project, or you're just sprucing up the garden, see if the item you need can be rented. Check Home Depot's site for tools like trimmers and edgers, chainsaws, drain cleaners and moving equipment. You can rent supplies by the hour, day, week or month. For example, say you want a cement mixer to build a fire pit in your yard. You can purchase a Kushlan motor cement mixer for $397 or rent the same one for $46 a day. You'll save more than $300 for equipment you'll probably only use once, which is much easier on your wallet. Home Depot / Shutterstock.com Ask for a Better Deal If you want a discount on a Home Depot product, ask for it. Consumer and money-saving expert Andrea Woroch said it can work. "I recently went undercover with 'Today' show's Jeff Rossen, for 'Rossen Reports,' about haggling and how to save more at big box stores," she said. "One of the stores we targeted was Home Depot. I was able to save an additional $50 off of a washing machine and dryer that were on sale by negotiating." Sales associates usually don't have the power to give you a better deal. But if you ask to speak to a manager, he might be more willing to negotiate with you to seal the deal, Woroch said. "Use tactics like reviewing recent sales that you missed or upcoming ones that you may qualify for now," she added. Learn: How Haggling Is Saving Me Hundreds of Dollars a Year ©Home Depot Watch for Exclusive One-Day Deals Home Depot's Special Buy of the Day offers online exclusive deals to save on home improvement projects. They are one-day, online-only deals while supplies last. One recent daily deal was for a 52-inch Hampton Bay ceiling fan for $109.99, down from $149. A 68-inch Altura ceiling fan that normally retails for $269.99 was also on sale for $199.99, a savings of $70. If you never want to miss a deal, you can sign up to be on the Special Buy of the Day email list. So, if you're waiting for a hot deal on a new refrigerator or another item, the newsletter is a good place to start. ©Home Depot Get a Price Match Best Buy, Target and Walmart are known to have the best price-match guarantees. But don't overlook Home Depot. If you find a lower price on an identical in-stock item at a local competitor's store, Home Depot will match the price, plus take 10 percent off. You'll need to take a competitor's ad or a photo of the item and price to Home Depot to get the price match. Online purchases also qualify for an price match. However, these purchases are not eligible for the additional 10 percent discount. The retailer won't give you a price match on special orders, volume discounts, labor and installation, sales tax, rebates or free offers. Also, the price match doesn't apply to third-party, auction or discount sites. ©Home Depot Pick Up Home Depot Rebates Before you make a big purchase, such as a major appliance, visit Home Depot's online rebate center to see what saving opportunities are available. Some products might even offer an additional item rather than money back. "The majority of Home Depot rebates are tied to federal tax credits (materials) or prepaid [debit] cards from a few specific brands," said Brent Shelton, shopping expert with FatWallet.com.

Penney store, in New York. The last two months saw the largest decline in retail jobs since December 2009, when the economy was coming out of deep funk. But the combined 60,600 job losses have less to do about the economy and more to do with shoppers’ dramatic shift in spending online. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK (AP) — Retail stores are cutting jobs at the sharpest pace in more than seven years, evidence of a seemingly inexorable shift away from employee-heavy stores as Americans increasingly shop online. A combined 60,600 retail job losses over the past two months have had less to do with the health of U.S. consumer spending than with changes in buying habits. In the age of Amazon, traditional stores, from J.C. Penney to Macy’s, have accelerated store closures and are experimenting with the use of fewer employees to staff the remaining stores. The industry has also been bruised by a string of bankruptcy filings, most recently from Payless ShoeSource. The company announced this week that it was closing nearly 400 stores, nearly 10 percent of its fleet. The job cuts in the retail industry, unwelcome as they are, are still a relatively minor burden for the overall U.S. economy. But for Americans seeking a foothold in the job market, the pullback represents a painful obstacle. Retail accounts for nearly one-third of first-time jobs in the United States, so a retrenchment by the industry’s employers can block access to the job market for many. As shopping on the web has expanded, retail jobs have represented a declining share of the labor market. They now account for 10.9 percent of jobs, compared with 11.6 percent in 2000, says Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, a research firm. And experts expect more store closings — and job losses — in coming months. “It’s principally about the impact of online shopping and how consumers are shopping differently than ever before,” Niemira said. “It’s harder for the industry to consistently do well and make money.” Take Fernando Ramirez, a 19-year-old restaurant server and college student, who was looking Friday to buy some sweaters at a Kohl’s in Tustin, California. Ramirez said he stops at a department store or mall once or twice a week to see what’s available. But most of his buying is done on the web. “It’s mostly to browse and see what they have,” said Ramirez, who lives in Tustin, Calif. “I do more of my purchasing online now.” The two-month contraction in retail jobs — 30,900 lost in February and 29,700 in March — marked the largest two-month decline since December 2009, when the industry shed 62,200 jobs. That month’s loss had signaled the end of a prolonged decline in the industry resulting from the Great Recession. The retail industry losses for February and March were contained in Friday’s U.S. jobs report from the government. The report offered an overall mixed message: Hiring in the United States dropped to its weakest pace in nearly a year, but the unemployment rate managed to reach its lowest level in nearly a decade. The jobs report pointed to dire problems confronting many of the stores populating shopping plazas and malls. Department and general merchandise stores — a category that includes Macy’s and Wal-Mart — shed 34,700 workers last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Retailers involved in high-priced big ticket items such as furniture stores and auto dealers barely added jobs. Nor are wages keeping pace. Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 percent average increase for all U.S. workers. The struggles of many traditional retailers can be traced most of all to Amazon and other online retailers. Amazon’s Prime membership program, costing $99 a year, has been a juggernaut, with services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members disproportionately buy more and spend more. In the process, Amazon has redefined the standards for its rival retailers. They now feel more pressure to limit costs while expanding services and offers for shoppers, from free shipping to non-stop discounting, which take a toll on profit margins. It’s hardly just Amazon. One online-only retailer, Chewy.com, sells an array of pet supplies beyond what’s generally available in physical stores, including high-end organic pet food. The fast-growing company plans to add about 3,200 jobs this year, raising its head count to 6,900. Though traditional retailers are expanding their own online presences, those operations require far fewer workers. The labor involved in selling an item online through a distribution center can be 50 percent less than if it were sold in a store, estimates Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners, LLP, a consultancy. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC, a research firm, says he expects earnings for the first quarter for the 113 retailers he tracks to drop 6.8 percent. That would be the worst quarterly performance since 2013. Stores are also increasingly adopting technology that reduces the need for employees, like shopping kiosks and iPads where shoppers can buy online while in a store. And some traditional stores like Macy’s are testing self-service in some of their shoe departments. In the restaurant industry, executives have touted the benefits of automation for customers. Ordering kiosks, for instance, can help speed up lines and improve order accuracy. Though it’s still early, chains including McDonald’s and Panera have introduced ordering screens in some stores. And some sit-down chains have introduced table-top ordering tablets. One of the hard realities of the new shopping era is evident at the Richmond Town Center outside of Cleveland, where the number of employees working at stores appeared to exceed the slim number of shoppers on a cold spring afternoon Friday. Two of the mall’s three anchors— Sears and Macy’s — have closed in the past year. The third, J.C. Penney, is slated to close in June. Tiffany Fulton was cutting through J.C. Penney to get a new battery for a watch. She doesn’t shop at the mall regularly, she said, and her buying habits, especially for clothes, involve stocking up “every blue moon” and then not shopping again for six months or even a year. She said she goes to the mall every once in a while for some “retail therapy.” “If I need to feel better, I might stop by,” Fulton said. ___ AP Economics Writer Christopher S.

As new details continue to emerge in the kidnapping of the 15-year-old, here are some quick details that have surfaced so far about the case. 1. Elizabeth went missing on March 13 prompting Tennessee law enforcement authorities to issue an Amber Alert for the teen. 2. After doubts were raised of her ex-teacher being involved in her abduction, Maury County’s Culleoka Unit School — where Elizabeth is a student — fired Cummins from his job as a health science teacher. 3. School documents dated Jan. 23 showed a student saw Cummins and Elizabeth kissing. The incident was later reported to authorities. 4. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation listed Cummins under the state’s “Top 10 Most Wanted” for the suspected abduction of Elizabeth. Read: New Details Emerge On Tennessee Teacher Suspected Of Kidnapping Teen Elizabeth Thomas 5. Amid Cummins' disappearance along with his teenage student, his wife, Jill, filed for divorce last month citing “irreconcilable differences” and alleged he was “guilty of inappropriate marital conduct.” 6. On March 30, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation released a video footage showing the pair at a Wal-Mart store in Oklahoma City on March 15. "The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing," authorities said in a release. 7. Several false reports have surfaced about the sighting of Elizabeth and Cummins, including the recent one Thursday at Milwaukee airport. According to local reports, a passenger aboard a flight from Milwaukee to Minneapolis reported seeing Elizabeth and Cummins, but when police rushed to the airport they found it to be a false alarm. 8. Elizabeth’s father Anthony Thomas said in a recent petition that Cummins was a “masterfully manipulating predator” who pressured his teenage student to go out with him by threatening her with “repercussions at school.” 9. Elizabeth’s father also said in the petition that at least two witnesses — both minors — from his daughter's school have information that may help authorities find the teenager. 10. Some theories, which have been cited in a court filing, suggest that Cummins convinced Elizabeth to leave with after making her feel guilty of the kissing incident. 11. Elizabeth had reportedly told her siblings and friends that she was frightened of Cummins.

The royal couple were conducted round the facility by managers to enable them acquaint themselves with the multimillion dollar shopping mall, the first of its kind in the Garden City. South African property developer and investor, Atterbury Property, put up tructure on 18500m² space. Christened the Kumasi City Mall, the facility was constructed at a cost of US$95million. It is Atterbury’s fourth successful retail mall in Ghana, following on the heels of a trio of developments in Accra – [Achimota, Westhills and Accra malls]. Atterbury said the mall, with potential for a future 10,000m² expansions, would give the city of Kumasi its first one-stop environment with shopping and entertainment under one roof when it opens on April 20. Kumasi City Mall’s anchor tenants are Shoprite and Walmart brand Game Stores, with a retail mix including food, convenience, banking, services, fashion, electronics and a cinema, club and children’s games for entertainment. The facility will be managed by AttAfrica, who would be responsible for its day-to-day running and operations. Cobus van Heerden, retail director at Atterbury Property Development, told the African News Agency that this was the first big development the company had undertaken in Kumasi.

Penney store, in New York. The last two months saw the largest decline in retail jobs since December 2009, when the economy was coming out of deep funk. But the combined 60,600 job losses have less to do about the economy and more to do with shoppers‚Äô dramatic shift in spending online. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) By: Anne D'Innocenzio The Associated Press Published on NEW YORK — Retail stores are cutting jobs at the sharpest pace in more than seven years, evidence of a seemingly inexorable shift away from employee-heavy stores as Americans increasingly shop online. A combined 60,600 retail job losses over the past two months have had less to do with the health of U.S. consumer spending than with changes in buying habits. In the age of Amazon, traditional stores, from J.C. Penney to Macy's, have accelerated store closures and are experimenting with the use of fewer employees to staff the remaining stores. The industry has also been bruised by a string of bankruptcy filings, most recently from Payless ShoeSource. The company announced this week that it was closing nearly 400 stores, nearly 10 per cent of its fleet. The job cuts in the retail industry, unwelcome as they are, are still a relatively minor burden for the overall U.S. economy. But for Americans seeking a foothold in the job market, the pullback represents a painful obstacle. Retail accounts for nearly one-third of first-time jobs in the United States, so a retrenchment by the industry's employers can block access to the job market for many. As shopping on the web has expanded, retail jobs have represented a declining share of the labour market. They now account for 10.9 per cent of jobs, compared with 11.6 per cent in 2000, says Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, a research firm. And experts expect more store closings — and job losses — in coming months. "It's principally about the impact of online shopping and how consumers are shopping differently than ever before," Niemira said. "It's harder for the industry to consistently do well and make money." Take Fernando Ramirez, a 19-year-old restaurant server and college student, who was looking Friday to buy some sweaters at a Kohl's in Tustin, California. Ramirez said he stops at a department store or mall once or twice a week to see what's available. But most of his buying is done on the web. "It's mostly to browse and see what they have," said Ramirez, who lives in Tustin, Calif. "I do more of my purchasing online now." The two-month contraction in retail jobs — 30,900 lost in February and 29,700 in March — marked the largest two-month decline since December 2009, when the industry shed 62,200 jobs. That month's loss had signalled the end of a prolonged decline in the industry resulting from the Great Recession. The retail industry losses for February and March were contained in Friday's U.S. jobs report from the government. The report offered an overall mixed message: Hiring in the United States dropped to its weakest pace in nearly a year, but the unemployment rate managed to reach its lowest level in nearly a decade. The jobs report pointed to dire problems confronting many of the stores populating shopping plazas and malls. Department and general merchandise stores — a category that includes Macy's and Wal-Mart — shed 34,700 workers last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Retailers involved in high-priced big ticket items such as furniture stores and auto dealers barely added jobs. Nor are wages keeping pace. Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 per cent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 per cent average increase for all U.S. workers. The struggles of many traditional retailers can be traced most of all to Amazon and other online retailers. Amazon's Prime membership program, costing $99 a year, has been a juggernaut, with services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members disproportionately buy more and spend more. In the process, Amazon has redefined the standards for its rival retailers. They now feel more pressure to limit costs while expanding services and offers for shoppers, from free shipping to non-stop discounting, which take a toll on profit margins. It's hardly just Amazon. One online-only retailer, Chewy.com, sells an array of pet supplies beyond what's generally available in physical stores, including high-end organic pet food. The fast-growing company plans to add about 3,200 jobs this year, raising its head count to 6,900. Though traditional retailers are expanding their own online presences, those operations require far fewer workers. The labour involved in selling an item online through a distribution centre can be 50 per cent less than if it were sold in a store, estimates Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners, LLP, a consultancy. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC, a research firm, says he expects earnings for the first quarter for the 113 retailers he tracks to drop 6.8 per cent . That would be the worst quarterly performance since 2013. Stores are also increasingly adopting technology that reduces the need for employees, like shopping kiosks and iPads where shoppers can buy online while in a store. And some traditional stores like Macy's are testing self-service in some of their shoe departments. In the restaurant industry, executives have touted the benefits of automation for customers. Ordering kiosks, for instance, can help speed up lines and improve order accuracy. Though it's still early, chains including McDonald's and Panera have introduced ordering screens in some stores. And some sit-down chains have introduced table-top ordering tablets. One of the hard realities of the new shopping era is evident at the Richmond Town Center outside of Cleveland, where the number of employees working at stores appeared to exceed the slim number of shoppers on a cold spring afternoon Friday. Two of the mall's three anchors— Sears and Macy's — have closed in the past year. The third, J.C. Penney, is slated to close in June. Tiffany Fulton was cutting through J.C. Penney to get a new battery for a watch. She doesn't shop at the mall regularly, she said, and her buying habits, especially for clothes, involve stocking up "every blue moon" and then not shopping again for six months or even a year. She said she goes to the mall every once in a while for some "retail therapy." "If I need to feel better, I might stop by," Fulton said. ___ AP Economics Writer Christopher S. Rugaber in Washington, AP Food Writer Candice Choi in New York, AP Writers Mark Gillispie in Cleveland and Amy Taxin in Tustin, California, contributed to this report.

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! BENGALURU: Wonderchef, a kitchen appliance and cookware brand promoted by celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor, has raised Rs 40 crore from French group Labruyere Eberle to fund a new manufacturing unit and expand into new categories. Confirming the investment, Wonderchef managing director Ravi Saxena said, "We are looking at opening our own factory by the end of the year, which will cater to 40% of our manufacturing, and expand our new category of large appliance and penetrate into new markets." He said the French group is looking at doubling its stake in the company to 8-10% with further investments. Founded in 2009 by Saxena and Kapoor, the company sells premium kitchen appliances, cookware and bakeware products. Vincent Labruyere, CEO of Labruyere Eberle, said, "We want to focus our investments towards growing companies in consumer goods industry in India and Wonderchef perfectly fits with this strategy." Over the last two years, the French group has invested in India in related businesses. It has picked up stake in the two wine companies Sula and Grover Zampa, and is a large franchisee of Pizza Hut and KFC restaurant outlets in India. The group is also a partner of Walmart rival, Carrefour, globally. In 2015, Wonderchef had received Rs 30 crore funding from Zurich-headquartered investment firm Capvent. According to industry experts, the branded kitchen appliance and cookware market is Rs 15,000 crore in India now and growing 12% year on year with players like Prestige and Hawkins having a large market share. Experts said it will take another 5-7 years for premium cookware sector to make a dent as the consumers are spending on modular kitchens but are still price conscious when it comes to buying expensive cookware.

A loss-prevention officer with the Walmart, 6001 Mahoning Ave., provided police with surveillance footage of a white male leaving the store without paying for the merchandise early Thursday. Police said he collected items in a cart, went to the housewares department and put the items into a tote bag. He then walked out of the store with the items in the tote bag. The merchandise included groceries, several security cameras and several computer routers. Boy, 14, faces charge BOARDMAN A 14-year-old boy faces a felony charge after an incident reported at Glenwood Junior High School, according to a police report. Jerolnashiah Wiggins, 14, of Melrose Avenue is charged with felonious assault for the incident reported March 31. A township police officer responded to the school for a report of a fight in a hallway. A student reportedly suffered injuries including bruises, scratches, cuts to their gums, a bloody nose and a possible concussion. Police arrested the teenager Thursday at his home, according to the report. Roads to close LIBERTY Beginning Monday, Anderson-Morris Road over state Route 11 will be closed through late June for a bridge replacement.

TidewaterBiz Farm Fresh cuts Virginia Beach headquarters staff Tara BozickContact Reportertbozick@dailypress.com Privacy Policy Farm Fresh is reducing its Virginia Beach-based headquarters staff by 21 positions as part of its parent company's decision to shift merchandising to a Maryland office, a company spokesman confirmed. Farm Fresh owner SuperValu is basing its merchandising team for Farm Fresh, Shoppers and Shop 'n Save East at Shoppers in Bowie, Md., and plans to add merchandising staff there, Supervalu spokesman Jeff Swanson said. Twenty-three operations positions will remain in the Virginia Beach office on Seahawk Circle, Swanson said. The company is reducing its Farm Fresh operations and store support roles from 60 positions to 40 remaining jobs, he said. The change doesn't affect Farm Fresh stores, hourly store employees or day-to-day store management, Swanson said. Employees who are affected can apply for new or open positions or will qualify for severance, he said. Farm Fresh President Micky Nye will become regional vice president of operations for Farm Fresh, Shoppers and Shop 'n Save East, Swanson said. "Communicating news of this nature, in particular the reduction in some positions at Farm Fresh, is always difficult because of the impact to our employees," Swanson said in an email.

Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646.

Despite sharp gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index amid optimism about business-favorable policies and infrastructure spending under the Trump administration, supermarket and wholesaler stocks veered in the opposite direction. “There has been some basic rotation into industries that are perceived to be beneficiaries of any potential stimulus spending or infrastructure investment by the new administration,” said Chuck Cerankosky, an analyst with Northcoast Research, Cleveland. “Secondly, I think we had a meaningful pickup in new store development and store expansions, and maybe it snuck up on the industry in a way that while there was some deflation out there, chains were fighting to get sales and customers to their new space, and it put pressure on margins and in turn on earnings.” Phoenix-based Sprouts Farmers Market was a notable exception to the downward trend in food retailing stocks, as the natural-and-organic specialist saw its share price spike 22.1% in the first three months of 2017, to $23.12, after a report that the company had held preliminary merger talks with Albertsons Cos. Neither company confirmed the report. Cerankosky said Sprouts may be able to maintain a higher valuation with a strong first-quarter earnings report next month. “If not, and the takeover speculation goes away, then the stock price pulls back,” he said. News also resuscitated the share price of Canadian retailer Empire Cos., parent of the Sobeys chain, whose share price had plummeted last year in wake of its struggles to improve the performance of the Safeway stores it acquired in Western Canada. In January, Sobeys tapped Canadian Tire veteran Michael Medline as president and CEO to spearhead a turnaround effort. Despite posting a weak fiscal third quarter in March, Empire’s stock maintained an upward trajectory through the first quarter and closed nearly 30% higher for the calendar year-to-date, at $20.32. Walmart, which in February posted its best comparable-store sales performance in four years and continued to make inroads in e-commerce, also saw gains in the first quarter, with its stock up 4.3%, closing at $72.08. The company posted fiscal fourth-quarter comps of 1.8%, versus expectations of 1.3%. Costco’s stock also saw gains in the first quarter, up 4.7% to $167.69, and the company continued to drive both dollar and tonnage gains with sharp pricing on deflated grocery items. “Sales decelerated middle two quarters of calendar 2016, then things began to pick up in the latter part of the calendar year, which I think gave investors a fair amount of relief that the warehouse club retail model continues to attract new customers and excitement and discretionary spending,” said Cerankosky.

Marvin Lacy, 71, who listed an address in the 400 block of East Church Street, Champaign, apparently made the claim in an attempt to drum up sympathetic customers for his failing business, police reports indicate. Lacy pleaded guilty Thursday before Judge Roger Webber to a single count of disorderly conduct, a felony, admitting that on May 13, 2016, he lied to an Urbana police officer about receiving a piece of U.S. mail that he said contained a cardboard sign with magazine letters glued to it with a racially motivated threat. Police learned through investigation that Lacy had actually persuaded an employee of his business, Lacy's Kansas City Style BBQ, 119 W. Main St., to mail the package for him. The employee told police he did not know what was in the package but, upon learning what it was, surmised that Lacy did it to drum up business. In exchange for Lacy's plea to the disorderly conduct, the state dismissed a separate case charging him with theft for switching clearance price tags with regular tags on meat at Wal-Mart on North Prospect Avenue on four occasions in February and March last year. As part of his sentence, he was ordered to repay the store $241.17. Court records show Lacy had prior convictions dating to 1992 for possession of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, obstructing justice, theft and making a false bomb report.

Print   Email   Font Resize Healthy Living Health Department offers tips for 'Cooking on a Dime' Check unit prices, use bargain saving apps By Callie Jones Journal-Advocate news editor Posted:   04/05/2017 09:26:55 PM MDT Northeast Colorado Health Department Community Health Navigator Kathy Anderson, left, talks about the importance of checking prices on canned foods, while Jessa Hatch, public information officers, makes a pot of chili at the health department's presentation on "Cooking on a Dime" Tuesday, March 28, at Sterling Public Library's "It's Not Rocket Science" program. Joining them for the presentation was Penny Stumpf, health promotion and wellness manager. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Just because you're on a tight budget doesn't mean you can't have healthy meals. Jessa Hatch, public information officer, Kathy Anderson, community health navigator, and Penny Stumpf, health promotion and wellness manager, with the Northeast Colorado Health Department, gave a presentation on "Cooking on a Dime" at Sterling Public Library's It's Not Rocket Science program last week. Hatch and Anderson made up a batch of chili for the event because, they said, it's easy, you can feed a lot of people with it, it's cheap and it's healthy. "What I love about chili is you can add everything to it, and everyone makes it differently, and everyone has different sides," Hatch said. Jessa Hatch, public information officer for Northeast Colorado Health Department, holds up a bag filled with ingredients to make a cheap meal as guests at the department's "Cooking on a Dime" presentation try to guess how much the meal costs to make. The winner got to take home the bag of ingredients to make the meal for themselves. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Ingredients used in the chili included: One can of corn, one can of black beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of chili beans, one can of tomato sauce, one can of chili-ready tomatoes, one onion, one pound of beef and one package of chili seasoning. Total cost of the meal, which serves six to eight, was $11.17, about $1.86 per person for six servings. "You can't really go anywhere and get cheaper than that and the really nice thing, like Jessa said, is you have control of what you're putting in it," Anderson said. If you're trying to stretch your chili and make it go farther, or make it healthier for children who don't like to eat vegetables, Anderson recommended adding corn, celery, zucchini, diced peppers, etc. Advertisement Hatch recommended when shopping for canned foods, look for no salt added or lower sodium, because it's much healthier. Also, always look at the unit price on canned food, because while two cans of beans, for example, might be the same size, they are often different prices and if you're looking at a bigger versus smaller can, while the bigger can might seem like the better deal that's not always the case. They used a package of chili seasoning for the chili they made, because it was less supplies to bring with them, but Anderson encouraged people to buy bottles of individual spices and not the seasoning packets, because while you may have to pay a little bit more up front for the individual spices, they will last a whole year, so you will be able to use it for more than one meal, ultimately saving money. Plus, Hatch noted, a lot of times the seasoning packets have a lot of salt and added sodium. Additionally, Hatch recommended buying fruits and vegetables when they're in season, because prices tend to rise when they're not in season. Anderson talked about the benefit of making a meal at home versus eating out, because it's usually cheaper. If you buy a hamburger at a restaurant, for example, it will only feed one person, but if you buy one pound of ground beef at the store you can easily make four quarter pound hamburgers. You can also buy larger packages of beef and freeze all of it or part of it, to make it last longer. The U.S. Department of Agriculture offers several nutrition assistance resources such as MyPlate, Community Corner, Recipe Finder, and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). A USDA information sheet that was shared at the program, offers a number of tips for saving money when shopping for groceries. First, look at your resources. Know how much money you have to spend on food; make a shopping list based on the money you have; buy only the amounts of fresh foods you can use before it spoils; and consider frozen or shelf stable items that last longer. Before going to the grocery store, check what foods you already have. Once that's done, ask yourself: What meals and recipes can I make using the foods I have? Can I mix foods together to make a tasty and nutritious meal? Which foods do my family need for good health? Then, plan what recipes you will make using your list of foods and use other foods on your list, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains to complete the menu. Once you plan your menus, make a new list for missing foods you need to buy. Don't go shopping when you are hungry, so it's easier to stick to your shopping list. To get a good deal, you can use bargain saving apps such as Savings Catcher, a Wal-Mart app, or ibotta; use couponing apps and websites, such as bargainrate.blogspot.com; turn your receipt into cash with apps such as receipthog.com; or search newspapers and other places for local deals. Also, Anderson mentioned if you have a coupon for something and the store is out, ask for a rain check. "There are lots of good ways to save money if you're willing to look around," Hatch said. The next "It's Not Rocket Science" program, Tuesday, April 25, will be on cake decorating.

Part of that is due to budget cuts and merging school systems.

Business Mariano's to launch online shopping and pickup at select locations Mariano's in Oak Lawn Steve Metsch / Pioneer Press The Mariano's store in Oak Lawn, seen in 2015, will launch use of the ClickList online shopping option this summer. The Mariano's store in Oak Lawn, seen in 2015, will launch use of the ClickList online shopping option this summer. (Steve Metsch / Pioneer Press) Greg TrotterContact ReporterChicago Tribune Mariano's shoppers soon will be able to buy groceries online for pickup at select locations, piano music at checkout not included. Mariano's is the latest Chicago-area grocery retailer to announce a new online shopping option for busy consumers on the go. Later this month, Mariano's will launch ClickList at its Vernon Hills location, followed by stores in Oak Lawn and Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood this summer. Shoppers will be able to order their groceries for pickup through the ClickList app or website for a flat fee of $4.95. Mariano's plans to add ClickList to seven more stores by the end of the year, with continued rollout in the chain's 41 stores planned for next year, said Lauren Edmonson, Mariano's e-commerce manager. Dominick's demise led to boom, but now grocers face reality: New rivals, online shift Greg Trotter The mad dash for your grocery dollars, triggered by the 2014 Dominick's closing that left 72 stores up for grabs, is just now slowing to a crawl. Jewel-Osco and Mariano's, which collectively hold more than 30 percent of the market share in the Chicago area, plan to open a combined five stores this... The mad dash for your grocery dollars, triggered by the 2014 Dominick's closing that left 72 stores up for grabs, is just now slowing to a crawl. Jewel-Osco and Mariano's, which collectively hold more than 30 percent of the market share in the Chicago area, plan to open a combined five stores this... (Greg Trotter) "As much as we're about the in-store experience, we're also about convenience. This is very much to make people's lives easier," Edmonson said. Customers will be able to shop more than 30,000 items and indicate preferences — such as green bananas or ripe avocados — through the app, Edmonson said. A limited selection of prepared foods also will be available online, including items like smoothies and rotisserie chickens. Once the order is filled, a Mariano's employee will call the person who placed the order to check if anything else is needed, she said. Alcohol will be available for purchase through the service, pending regulatory approval of the given municipality, Edmonson said. The race is on for grocery stores competing for online shopping dollars. By 2025, online grocery shopping is projected to grow to 20 percent of all grocery spending, or $100 billion in annual sales, according to research from the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. Malls look to grocery stores as a 'survival tactic' Thomas Heath For decades, department stores like Macy's and Sears have anchored sprawling suburban malls. Now as their business has languished and they board up shop, another sort of tenant is trying its luck in their place: grocers. "There has been a real acceleration of anchors closing their operations,"... For decades, department stores like Macy's and Sears have anchored sprawling suburban malls. Now as their business has languished and they board up shop, another sort of tenant is trying its luck in their place: grocers. "There has been a real acceleration of anchors closing their operations,"... (Thomas Heath) The models vary quite a bit. Some chains, like Meijer, are partnering with third-party shopping and delivery services. By contrast, Mariano's is doing it in-house and focusing on pickup, instead of delivery, in the Chicago market, though it will explore partnering with third-party delivery services at select city locations yet to be determined, Edmonson said. Mariano's will add, on average, about seven employees per store who will be trained in food selection and safety, Edmonson said. The gradual one-store-at-a-time launch in the Chicago area will allow the chain to work out any "bugs or kinks," she said. It's no small investment, but Mariano's has a parent company with deep pockets. Kroger, which acquired Mariano's parent Roundy's in 2015 for about $800 million, has been gradually rolling out ClickList in stores nationally in the past year or so. Amazon tries to bag a big chunk of grocery market with pickup locations Angel Gonzalez Amazon.com's latest experiment is a clear indication of where it's seeking a big chunk of its future bread and butter: the massive world of grocery retail.

(Angel Gonzalez) In doing so, Kroger seeks to compete with online retailers like Amazon and Jet.com, as well as Wal-Mart, which is expanding its free pickup service nationally but doesn't offer it in the Chicago area. Jewel-Osco, the largest traditional grocery store chain in Chicago, also is considering e-commerce but so far has been mum on details. gtrotter@chicagotribune.com Twitter @GregTrotterTrib Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune A version of this article appeared in print on April 04, 2017, in the Business section of the Chicago Tribune with the headline "Mariano's adding online shopping, store pickup - ClickList service launching this month in Vernon Hills, with gradual expansion" — Today's paperToday's paper | Subscribe In Bronzeville, new Mariano's store reflects a change long coming CVS to offer curbside pickup in Chicago area Will curbside pickup ever catch on?

WATCH: Joey and Rory Feek: Remembering the Sweetest Moments From Their Final Year Together Joey, one half of the country and bluegrass duo Joey+Rory, died of cancer at age 40 on March 4, 2016, months after electing to end treatment and enter hospice care. She had just married Rory when recording her first songs, which were independently released, but failed to make waves in the country music scene. “When this album was recorded in 2005, Joey and I were still newlyweds, or at least we felt like we were," Rory says in a press release. "Though we had hopes for the record at the time, it wasn’t meant to be, and so this collection of music sat quietly on a shelf for the last 10 years or so, waiting for the right time to come along, when maybe somehow, someone would care. A time like now." WATCH: Rory Feek Gets Candid on Life and Love After Joey's Death in New Book "It is one of the great joys of my life to dust these songs off and bring life to them again," he adds. "Not just the songs, but also the stories and the life of the special woman that these songs represent." The album is available online via iTunes, Amazon, Target, Walmart, Cracker Barrel and Gaither.
