The company has been mostly bulletproof for a decade, but there are some storm clouds on its horizon. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Sep 5, 2016 at 4:35PM Warehouse clubs exist because in exchange for a membership fee they offer low prices, albeit sometimes in inconvenient quantities. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has thrived by serving an audience of members looking for deals. The retailer courts bargain-hunters by cleverly curating its selection of merchandise. The chain always has certain staples such as milk, coffee, and healthcare supplies, while shifting up the rest of its mix. That makes its stores a bit of a scavenger hunt. You might enter knowing you need K-cups, cereal, or washing machine detergent pods, only to happen upon a great deal for a snowboard. Not every item is actually a deal, but generally the prices are good, and the merchandise mix, heavy use of sampling, and low-cost snack options keep people coming back. For 10 years that basic formula has produced a near-steady rise in the company's stock price. Until recently there was no reason to believe that might change anytime soon, but there are signs that after an impressive run, Costco stock does face risks from digital competitors, specifically Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) which generally have the warehouse club beaten when it comes to price selection. As these rivals improve delivery -- something both have invested heavily in -- Costco may have something to fear. Over the past 10 years Costco has mostly gone straight up. Image source: YCharts.com. What should Costco worry about? Costco offers two things to its customers -- good prices and a shopping experience. Amazon and Wal-Mart, to a lesser extent, already have the warehouse club beaten when it comes to price plus convenience. In most cases, the online sites offer comparable if not better pricing on most items Costco sells without requiring the bulk purchases the warehouse chain forces for many items. For example, Costco, Wal-Mart, and Amazon all sell generic versions of Prevacid, the popular acid-reflux medicine, with the best deal in all cases being on a three-pack containing six weeks' worth of pills. Amazon and Wal-Mart, however, also offers the option to buy a single 14-pill pack or a 28-dose two-pack -- as well as some larger-than-three-pack offers. In general, the three-pack is the best price per pill at all three chains (prices can vary), but Amazon and Wal-Mart allow people more choice. That may not matter when it comes to pills, but some Costco customers may not want to buy deodorant six at a time or cereal packaged in two extra-large boxes. Amazon and Wal-Mart have offered those advantages for years, but they haven't been able to match the immediacy of shopping in a store. That gave Costco (and physical Wal-Marts) a reason for being that digital players could not match. In recent years, however, Amazon has bridged that gap, with Wal-Mart working hard and spending big to catch up. The online leader now offers Sunday delivery, same-day delivery in some markets, and even nearly immediate service in limited areas. Amazon has also made two-day delivery a standard, with incredible reliability to the point that if a consumer doesn't need something immediately, why not order it from the online giant and not have to leave the house? Going forward, Amazon -- and eventually Wal-Mart -- could have drone deliveries, trucks with 3-D printers roaming the country, and advanced predictive software that brings items from warehouse to customer even faster. When that happens, Costco, which has mostly ignored its digital operations to keep the focus on its stores, has something to worry about. Should Costco shareholders worry? For the Costco customer who visits the store because it's entertaining, faster online shipping and better prices or selection at Amazon.com or Wal-Mart.com shouldn't matter. The shopper perusing the warehouse club based on getting a good deal, however, may eventually be swayed to drop his or her membership. For now, Costco has an immediacy advantage over its rivals. Going forward that may not be the case, as Amazon and Wal-Mart's digital arm -- which now includes Jet.com -- both shorten the delivery window. That represents a risk for all retailers, but Costco could ultimately feel a pinch it has so far avoided. As Amazon ups the delivery bar and Wal-Mart scurries along behind it, Costco members may decide that visiting a store -- especially one that charges an annual fee for the privilege -- isn't worth it. When that happens, and the day isn't that far off, Costco memberships, sales, and ultimately share price may suffer. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Sep 5, 2016 at 8:51AM Image Source: Motley Fool.Â  Dollar store chains got slammed last month asÂ Dollar GeneralÂ (NYSE:DG),Â Dollar TreeÂ (NASDAQ:DLTR), andÂ Five BelowÂ (NASDAQ:FIVE) all posted disappointing earnings reports. As the chart below shows, all three stocks fell by 11% or more. DG data by YCharts The culprit appeared to be a resurgentÂ Wal-MartÂ (NYSE:WMT), which has invested to clean-up stores, raise wages, bring back greeters, and eliminate out-of-stocks. In its most recent quarter, the retail giant posted comparable sales growth of 1.6%, its best performance in several years. Wal-Mart has also lowered prices on key traffic drivers such as fresh produce, and branded and private-label goods, helping to poach customers from dollar store chains. Dollar store stocks had thrived in recent years, finding a retail niche with low-income customers that had been ignored by other companies as well as one that was not affected byÂ Amazon.comÂ or the rise of e-commerce. However, that trend may be changing as the three companies above cited similar competitive threats. At Dollar General, same-store sales increased just 0.7% in its most recent quarter as management noted the effects of food deflation and a decline in food stamp participation rates and benefit levels. CEO Todd Vasos said, "the competitive environment intensified in select regions of the country." At Dollar Tree, meanwhile, comparable sales growth slowed to 1.2% as management also noted a "challenging retail sales environment." Dollar Tree also lowered its full-year revenue guidance and said it expected full-year comparable sales to be in the low-single digits. Five Below, on the other hand, fared better than its competitors with a comparable sales increase of 3.1%. Five Below tends to sell fewer staples than Dollar General and Dollar Tree, making it less of a direct competitor with Wal-Mart. Five Below's CEO also sounded more optimistic than his rivals, but, nonetheless, the company was affected by the weak reports from its peers, falling 11% in the quarter. Earnings growth remains strong Despite falling stock prices and weakened sales, earnings growth was solid at the dollar stores in the last quarter. At Dollar General, which had the sharpest drop last month, earnings per share still increased 14% to $1.08 due to a 6% increase in revenue, a modest reduction in expenses, and a share buyback program that reduced shares outstanding by more than 4% in the last year. With a profit margin near 6%, Dollar General remains one of the most efficient retailers on the market. Dollar Tree, meanwhile, has successfully integrated its Family Dollar acquisition, and saw gross margin improve 190 basis points to 30.3%, and Selling, General, and Administrative expenses fall 120 basis points to 23.1%. As a result, operating margin jumped from 4.1% to 7.1%.Â Strong earnings growth caused Dollar Tree to actually raised its full-year EPS guidance to $3.67-$3.82, despite lowering its revenue guidance. Finally, Five Below saw operating income jump 36% on a 20.8% increase in sales, and raised its full-year EPS guidance to $1.28-$1.32 even though it sees comparable sales growth slowing in the current quarter. On the other hand, despite worrying dollar store investors, Wal-Mart is actually seeing profits fall as it steps up investments in stores, and adjusts its business model to the e-commerce era. The lesson seems to be that the recent dip in dollar store stocks was more a result of bloated valuations rather than weak performance, as even with modest comparable sales growth, profits are still growing at a solid pace.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Sep 4, 2016 at 6:41PM Image source: Getty Images. Smart investors always think for themselves. However, with some research supporting the wisdom of crowds, investors may also be well served by keeping an eye on the top-performing and most popular stocks to buy today. Here's a brief rundown of five of the most popular stocks on the market today. Apple As the world's largest and most profitable publicly traded company, technology colossus Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hardly a surprise appearance on this list. In fact, Apple is so popular among investors that its shares are roughly 3 times more heavily traded than some of the more popular broad-market ETFs. Popular Stock Name Market Cap Avg. Daily Volume Average Analyst Rating Apple $579.4 billion 33.4 million Buy Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Â  However, Apple offers investors a lot more than just liquidity. Even if the forthcoming iPhone 7 were to end up a dud, demand for new iPhones would simply transfer from one Apple product cycle to the next, setting up an iPhone "supercycle" in late 2017. Chipotle Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is a divisive entry on this list. Its notable expansion over the past decade has been rocket fuel for its financial results and stock-price performance. But more recently, Chipotle's food-poisoning woes have tainted the company for many investors. Not that it isn't a longtime Fool favorite -- or still a popular stock: Popular Stock Name Market Cap Avg. Daily Volume Average Analyst Rating Chipotle $12.0 billion 1.08 million Hold Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Â  The shares are down roughly 50% versus the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. But the current weakness appears unlikely to permanently impair what had been one of the most successful restaurant concepts since McDonald's pioneered fast food in the middle of the 20th century. Shake Shack The new kid on the block, January 2015 IPO Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), was billed as the next Chipotle. But it's gone from enjoying a spectacular post-IPO to seeing a sell-off. Today, its shares are down roughly 20% from its IPO level, as the market struggles to sense of whether Shake Shack has the growth potential to justify its forward earnings multiple of 63. Regardless, the company enjoys plenty of interest from the investment community. Popular Stock Name Market Cap Avg. Daily Volume Average Analyst Rating Shake Shack $1.3 billion 1.05 million Hold Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Â  The fundamentals underpinning its continued growth story appear compelling. In addition to a 37% year-over-year sales increase last quarter, Shake Shack saw its comparable same-store sales grow 4.5%.Â  The average analyst seems to have settled the tension between major potential and the lofty stock price by suggesting investors stand pat, though those looking for a company with multibagger potential might consider Shake Shack shares today. Wal-Mart In today's low-yield environment, dividend investing is all the rage, making Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer and longtime dividend aristocrat, a natural stock of interest. The company's 2.8% yield and 41 consecutive annual dividend increases are well above average, but they aren't the only reason to like Wal-Mart's stock today. Popular Stock Name Market Cap Avg. Daily Volume Average Analyst Rating Wal-Mart $222.8 billion 10.1 million Hold Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Â  Wal-Mart recently completed a roughly $3 billion purchase of e-commerce start-up Jet.com in what many analysts, myself included, saw as a renewed commitment from Wal-Mart to challenge Amazon.com's superiority in this increasingly important segment. Amazon enjoys a number of structural advantages, some of which Wal-Mart has the resources and skill sets to replicate. It has more help now, considering Jet's management helped build several e-commerce challengers to Amazon, including Diapers.com. Costco Another longtime Fool favorite and market-beater, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) might be the most interesting name on this list, thanks to its unique business model, in which it sells bulk items at wholesale costs and generates profits from high-margin membership fees. It's no accident that Costco's stock has outperformed the market over the last one-, five-, and 10-year periods, not to mention its entire lifetime. That's an impressive accomplishment, and one that helps explain its popularity among investors. Popular Stock Name Market Cap Avg. Daily Volume Average Analyst Rating Costco $72.8 billion 2.23 million Buy Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Â  However, like Wal-Mart, Costco is a mature company. As of its most recent earnings report, it had nearly 47 million members, and it's fair to ask how much further it can grow that membership base. Sustaining above-average growth could be challenging, and given the generational growth story in e-commerce, the Costco of today appears better suited for income investors than for those seeking long-term revenue growth.

PUSHBACK: Merkelâs CDU beaten by anti-immigrant AfD in state election: exit pollâ¦. Â» September 4, 2016 OBAMA FINDS AN ALLY IN WAL-MART, WHOSE STORES HE ONCE SHUNNED, Bloomberg notes. And since itâs Bloomberg, itâs worth adding the âUnexpectedly!â â or as Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute tweets, Bloombergâs article is âA classic of the âcorporatism, how does it work?â genre:â As a freshman senator with his eye on the presidency, Barack Obama said heâd never shop at a Wal-Mart and held the company up as an emblem of corporate greed. Today, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is one of Obamaâs most reliable corporate allies, a go-to partner thatâs backed the White House on more than a dozen business initiatives, particularly Obamacare and climate change. And speaking of âunexpectedly,â a flashback to 2011, when Wal-Mart went âBack to Basicsâ, which Richard Pollock, then with PJM dubbed âA Cautionary Tale for the Left:â The failure, in large part, can be pinned to Leslie Dach: a well-known progressive and former senior aide to Vice President Al Gore. In July 2006, Dach was installed as the public relations chief for Wal-Mart. He drafted a number of other progressives into the company, seeking to change the companyâs way of doing business: its culture, its politics, and most importantly its products. Out went drab, inexpensive merchandise so dear to low-income Americans. In came upscale organic foods, âgreenâ products, trendy jeans, and political correctness. In other words, Dach sought to expose poor working Americans to the âgood lifeâ of the wealthy, environmentally conscious Prius driver. Dachâs failure should be a cautionary tale for President Obama: last week he scolded a blue collar man in Pennsylvania for driving an SUV, and he has previously admonished Americans to get out of their gas-guzzlers and into electric cars. Dachâs failure should also put Michelle Obama on notice; she has been pushing her White House organic vegetable garden as a model for working Americans. Like other real-world experiments, the Wal-Mart story exposes the failure of progressivism in the marketplace, as the Dach strategy has been a fiasco: the merchandising turned off low-income (and largely Democratic-leaning) customers. Says former Wal-Mart executive Jimmy Wright: The basic Wal-Mart customer didnât leave Wal-Mart. What happened is that Wal-Mart left the customer. First being in bed with Hillary, then Al Gore, then Obama. Iâm not sure how those associations help Wal-Mart stay focused on its core business, but I guess itâs worth it for the cocktail parties and the protection from what Michael Walsh has described as a criminal organization masquerading as a political party.

Published Sep 4th, 2016 10:38 am mtilley@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Pat Walker, who along with husband Willard, gave millions to Arkansas organizations and University of Arkansas athletic programs and was a member of the Arkansas Womenâs Hall of Fame, has died. She was 97. She is preceded in death by Willard. The Walkers had two children, Patricia and Johnny, and seven grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. Pat was born in Boise, Idaho, in 1919, and raised in Tulsa. She met Willard while she was working in a department store in Coffeyville, Kan. Willard Walker was hired by Sam Walton, co-founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., to manage what was then his Five and Dime store in Fayetteville. Walker would become an executive with the retailer. In October 1970, when Wal-Mart went public, it offered 300,000 shares for $15 each. Each share sold for $16.50 on the first day, and the company initially had only 800 shareholders. The Walkers were among the 800, and would later earn billions from the initial public offering. In 1986, the Walkers formed the Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation. By 2010, it had given more than $125 million to numerous charities and organizations in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. In addition to being a member of the Arkansas Womenâs Hall of Fame, Pat Walker was recognized as one of the Most Distinguished Women in Arkansas, was a lifetime board member of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute, received the 2002 American Heart Association Tiffany Award, received the Distinguished Service Award from the Razorback Foundation, was inducted with Willard into the Towers of Old Main, were members of the University of Arkansas Chancellorâs Society and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and received the UAMS Distinguished Service Award. U.S. Rep. Steve Womack, R-Rogers, said Walker was âgracious and elegant.â âPat Walker was one of the most gracious and elegant people Iâve ever known. Her heart for philanthropy is an inspiration, and she was not only a gift to those who knew her, but a gift to all of Northwest Arkansas. She truly cared about people and our community, and through her generosity, ensured a brighter future for both. All of Northwest Arkansas mourns her loss,â Womack said in a statement provided to Talk Business & Politics. Pat Walker Ed Clifford, who spent 17 years with Wal-Mart Stores and is now CEO of The Jones Center, said what the Walkers did ânot only in Northwest Arkansas, but the state of Arkansas and really beyond â¦ is just astounding.â Clifford said the last time he saw Pat Walker was in October at the Jones Center annual gala. âShe was really struggling at that time, but she made it a point to come, and I was really honored by that,â Clifford said, adding that her attendance was an example of her commitment to supporting causes in which she believed. âShe really represented the family and the philanthropy so well. Itâs just an amazing story,â Clifford said. Clifford, who also was head of the Bentonville-Bella Vista Chamber of Commerce for 11 years before moving to The Jones Center, said Pat Walker is part of a unique story for Northwest Arkansas in terms of philanthropic women. He said the accomplishments of Pat Walker, Bernice Jones, Helen Walton, Johnelle Hunt and Marilyn Bogle are âastounding in terms of reach,â and said none may ever be able to fully know how many people they have helped. Clifford reminded that Hunt and Bogle are still active in their respective philanthropies. Following are just some of the organizations to benefit from the Walker foundation: â¢ Willard Walker Graduate School at the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas. â¢ In 1996, the Pat Walker Theater was dedicated at the Springdale High School. â¢ The Pat Walker Health Center was dedicated in November 2004, at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville. â¢ In 2004 the Walker Charitable Foundation gave $21.5 million to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, with $15 million of that to support the Harvey and Bernice Jones Eye Institute. â¢ A $5 million donation from the Walker foundation resulted in the Pat and Willard Walker Family Memory Research Center at the Donald W. Reynolds Institute on Aging at the UAMS campus in Little Rock. â¢ In 2007, the University of the Ozarks dedicated the Pat Walker Teacher Education Program after an almost $3 million donation from the foundation. â¢ The Pat Walker Center for Seniors at Washington Regional Medical Center was opened in April 2008. â¢ In 2010, Arkansas Childrenâs Hospital named the Pat Walker Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in honor of Patâs commitment to healthcare. â¢ In 2011, the foundation gave $2.5 million to support the University of Arkansas Football Center, which at the time was estimated to cost around $35 million. âThe Walker Charitable Foundation and the Walker Family have been long-time benefactors of the University of Arkansas and Razorback athletics. They are the namesakes of the Walker Family Training Center, which includes the Willard and Pat Walker Pavilion and the Razorbacksâ spectacular 18,000-square-foot weight room facility,â noted a UA statement about the $2.5 million donation. âThe Walkers made the lead gift to initiate the construction of Baum Stadium, a venue consistently ranked as one of the top college baseball facilities in the nation. The Walkers also made a gift for the construction of Bud Walton Arena, which includes the Willard and Pat Walker Entry.â â¢ The Walker foundation in 2012 gave $1.5 million to UAMS to build the 8,000-square-foot Student Clinical Education Center at the UAMS Fayetteville location. Also receiving significant support from the Walker Charitable Foundation: NorthWest Arkansas Community College, John Brown University, Arkansas Childrenâs Hospital, Brandon Burlsworth Foundation, Single Parent Scholarship Fund of Northwest Arkansas, Ozark Guidance Center, Circle of Life Hospice, The Jones Center for Families, the Fayetteville Public Library, the Springdale Public Library, and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. âEducation is one of the largest components in helping people grow,âÂ Pat Walker said in a 2011 report from Siloam Springs-based John Brown University.

Main Street. Staff and area residents joined together Friday to celebrate the remodeling of the Canton Walmart at 2071 N. Main Street. Â  The event included a ribbon cutting marking the grand reopening of the store. Â  According to store manager Mike Noonan, the store tries to remodel every seven years. The process this time took 13 to 14 weeks. Â  The changes at the Canton store include expansion of the food area, the garden center and the electronics area, as well as introducing shotguns and rifles for sale. Â  âIt looks great,â said Noonan. âI think everyone will enjoy the new shopping experience.â Â  During the ceremony, the National Anthem was sung by the Burnham family, followed by presentations to a number of Walmart associates who have been with the store since it opened. Â  Checks were also presented to a number of charities, including $1,000 to Spoon River Partnership for Economic Development, $8,741 to Childrenâs Hospital of Illinois, $1,000 to Big Brothers Big Sisters, $1,000 to Camp Big Sky and $1,000 to Youth Acres. Â  A representative of Camp Big Sky presented Noonan with a plaque thanking Walmart for its help. Â  After the ceremony, cake and other refreshments were served. Â  âThe project represents Walmartâs reinvestment in the store, its customers and the community,â according to a Walmart press release.Â âThe remodel provides a new fresh look, inside and out; an electronics department nearly double in size; and an expanded grocery line of groceries. The store now features a gun department as well. Customers can also expect a new and improved customer service center with Money Services and Walmart Pickup. Shopping is more convenient than ever as Canton residents can shop millions of items on Walmart.com, many of which can be shipped for free to any Walmart store through Walmart Pickup.â Â  âWe are looking forward to re-introducing our store to the community with expanded offerings and a fresh look. Our everyday low prices will remain the same, but weâre adding greater convenience and a new and improved local grocery shopping experience,â said Noonan. Â  On Saturday, Sept. 3, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday, Sept. 4, from noon to 5 p.m., customers can enjoy a grand reopening event with sampling and family friendly activities.

Wal-Mart is returning less cash to shareholders through its dividend this year. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Sep 3, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: Wal-Mart. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) total dividend payment to its shareholders declined about 0.8%. Barring any unexpected changes to the company's quarterly dividend payment, which it raised for the 43rdÂ consecutive year in February, Wal-Mart will have its first-ever decline in total dividend payments. Wal-Mart has been supporting minor increases in its dividend per share rate through the use of share buybacks over the past few years. In each of the past three years, management has increased the dividend by just $0.01 per quarter, just about the bare minimum to keep its streak of annual dividend increases alive. With dividend growth slowing to a crawl, and now a decline in total dividend payment, should investors be worried about Wal-Mart's ability to continue increasing its payout? Let's take a look at some numbers to figure out where Wal-Mart's dividend stands. The payout ratio Dividends don't just magically appear in the middle of every quarter. Companies pay them out of their earnings. Whatever they don't pay out as a dividend is retained by the company for investment or a rainy day. What's leftover is aptly called retained earnings. A key way to determine the safety of a company's dividend is to see what percentage of earnings it currently pays out to shareholders. That's called its payout ratio. Importantly, investors ought to use forward-looking projections (management's forecast or analysts' estimates) to calculate payout ratios. Here's how Wal-Mart stacks up against some of its key competitors,Â Target (NYSE:TGT)Â and Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Company Dividend Earnings Forecast Payout Ratio Wal-Mart $2.00 $4.25 47% Target $2.40 $5.00 48% Costco $1.80 $5.95* 30% *Analyst consensus estimate for fiscal 2017 ending in August 2017. Data source: Company financial reports and Costco's investor relations page. Table source: Author. Wal-Mart's payout ratio is right in line with its biggest competitor, Target, but well above Costco's. Note, however, that Wal-Mart's dividend yield is 2.8% versus Costco's 1.1%, so it should be expected that it pays out a much higher portion of earnings. Target's yield, for reference, is 3.4%, notably better than Wal-Mart's despite similar payout ratios. But Wal-Mart has something going for it that Target doesn't: superior earnings stability. Earnings stability Earnings stability provides investors with a better idea of how reliable management's or analysts' outlooks are for the future. The less variability in earnings from year to year, the more likely the predictions are to prove accurate. It also means the future of the dividend is relatively safe provided the payout ratio isn't hovering above 100%. There are a couple factors I'll focus on with regard to earnings stability: revenue fluctuation and financial leverage. Revenue fluctuation is fairly clear cut: How much does revenue fluctuate from year to year? Wal-Mart's revenue is about as stable as it gets. Over the last five years, its total revenue grew about 10%. Over the last three years, the most Wal-Mart's revenue moved was up 1.77%. Target has seen larger revenue swings in each of the last four years. One of the biggest factors that makes Wal-Mart's revenue so stable is that it appeals to shoppers in both good and bad economic times. During a recession, more people will shop at Wal-Mart versus higher-priced retailers. During a period of economic growth, regular Wal-Mart shoppers may spend more. The other factor to consider is the business's financial leverage: how much debt the company holds as a percentage of its operating income. Businesses with a high amount of leverage will see an outsized impact on their bottom lines when revenue declines since interest expenses effectively add another fixed cost to the business. One way to evaluate a company's financial leverage is to look at its interest coverage. That is what percentage of operating profits goes toward paying interest expenses. Company Operating Profit (TTM) Interest Expense (TTM) Interest Coverage Wal-Mart $23.95 billion $2.31 billion 9.6% Target $4.99 billion $1.02 billion 20.4% Data source: Company financial reports, Yahoo! Finance Table source: Author Wal-Mart has significantly less financial leverage than Target, which means it's prone to less fluctuation in net earnings from changes in its operating profit. Coupled with its comparably more stable revenue, Wal-Mart's earnings projections are likely more accurate than Target's. That's also evidenced by the narrower range Wal-Mart provided ($4.15 to $4.35) compared to Target ($4.80 to $5.20). One final factor The last factor to consider is management's stance toward the dividend. Wal-Mart has been paying a dividend since 1974, and it's raised that dividend every year. But the slowing dividend payment indicates that management is starting to lean toward investing more of its earnings back into the company. Specifically, management has been investing heavily to grow its e-commerce business. It expects to spend $900 million on its e-commerce operations this year, and another $1.1 billion next year, up from $700 million last year. What's more, it just spent another $300 million in cash and $3 billion in stock to acquire Jet.com. Considering Wal-Mart's decline in online sales growth over the previous few years, the investment in e-commerce is necessary to take back market share in one of the fastest-growing retail avenues. The investments have already started paying off with digital sales revenue accelerating last quarter, and that's before the Jet.com acquisition. Management may decide to return its focus to the dividend after it secures its position in e-commerce. In the meantime, they should expect management to continue with the minimum to keep its name on the list of Dividend Aristocrats. So, despite the decline in total dividend payments, it doesn't seem like the dividend is in any doubt. That's not to say there aren't better options for investors looking to invest in the retail space. Adam Levy has no position in any stocks mentioned.

newslink News Sports Opinion Life Obituaries Classifieds Jobs Garage Sales January 6, 2017 | Today's Paper | Submit News | Subscribe Today Wal-Mart cutting 7,000 jobs Local Business Sep 2, 2016 NEW YORK â Wal-Mart is cutting about 7,000 back-office store jobs over the next few months as it centralizes its invoice and accounting departments, expanding a test it announced in June. The nationâs largest private employer said Thursday that the cuts will take place in all its namesake stores, confirming the move reported by The Wall Street Journal. The goal is to get workers out of the backrooms and onto the selling floors as Wal-Mart faces increasing competition from online leader Amazon.com. Wal-Mart said it believes most of the displaced workers will find new jobs that involve direct contact with shoppers and that the change was not a downsizing move. The customer-facing jobs would include positions like working in the online pickup department or as pharmacy technicians. The company said it was too soon to be specific about wage levels for the displaced workers. Spokeswoman Deisha Barnett said it would depend on what new positions they obtained. âIt will be guided by the roles that will be available and the roles that associates choose to go after,â Barnett said. But Making Change at Wal-Mart, a campaign backed by the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, said displaced employees who do get store jobs will likely take pay cuts, calling the back-office jobs âsome of the better positions at Wal-Mart.â âThey could come with a higher salary, and also allowed a worker to be at a desk as opposed to be on their feet all day,â Jess Levin, a spokeswoman for Making Change at Wal-Mart, said in a statement.

Andy Haldane says the country's strong economic performance since the June referendum has been a surprise, and the economic forecasting profession "is to some degree in crisis." Before the referendum, many forecasters said a vote to leave the EU could cause the pound to fall by as much as 20 percent and push the economy back into recession.

He was walking from his parking space. Tim Vizer tvizer@bnd.com i By George Pawlaczyk and By Beth Hundsdorfer News-Democrat LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story EAST ST. LOUIS On a warm Saturday evening on June 9, 2012, a tour boat set off on a 75-minute cruise carrying tourists along the Chicago River who paid to see the cityâs famous downtown architecture. It ended with a fireworks show. The public paid $65.40 for a pair of tickets, $25 for parking at Navy Pier, and $15.59 for a pizza â all charged to a no-limit American Express card supported by taxpayers in East St. Louis Township, one of Illinoisâ poorest communities. These costs were charged to a publicly-supported American Express card issued to Township Supervisor Oliver Hamilton, who is the subject of a federal investigation. Travel costs to Chicago for this same weekend were placed on another publicly-supported American Express card issued to his sister, June Hamilton Dean, who receives $33,000 a year as a consultant to the township and is a member of the East St. Louis City Council. Oliver Hamilton and June Hamilton Dean have declined to comment. Â  According to state law, the $105.99 outlay for the tour and pizza was supposed to benefit the public, the legal requirement whenever taxpayer money is spent. The tripâs costs were among tens of thousands of dollars in questionable charges from 2012 through July of 2016 â from Christmas hams to $291 spent at an IKEA store and enough gas to get to the moon. âVacations, IKEA furniture, even gourmet hams being put on publicly-supported charge cards gives a whole new meaning to pork barrel spending,â said Curtis Kalin, a spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Citizens Against Government Waste. âNo public official should dine out on the taxpayerâs dime,â Kalin said, âThis flagrant abuse of tax dollars for personal amusement and entertainment is shameful. It is a textbook case of how lax government oversight inevitably leads to a jaw-dropping level of waste. Local taxpayers deserve better. We encourage law enforcement officials who are investigating this disgraceful saga of corruption to follow wherever it leads.â But the Chicago tour cost was miniscule when compared to the nearly $40,000 in more than 750 separate gas purchases during four and a half years charged to Oliver Hamiltonâs card. This was enough fuel to power Hamiltonâs current vehicle, a 2015 Chevy Silverado pickup, 243,000 miles â or to the moon with 13,000 miles to spare. And the gasoline spending is dwarfed by single-day charges at big-box stores, including $5,092 at the Walmart in OâFallon on Aug. 30, 2012; $12,500 at the Collinsville Walmart on Dec. 12, 2012; $8,073 at the Home Depot in Collinsville on July 1, 2013; $6,996 at the Walmart in OâFallon on Aug. 23, 2013. In all, $280,000 was charged on three, publicly-supported American Express cards issued to Hamilton, his sister and Yvette Johnson, the townshipâs administrative assistant, who also declined comment. Of this, about $230,000 was charged by Hamilton. Hamiltonâs card has a $1,000 monthly limit by the township board, but this has been ignored. Specific credit card costs are not noted in township board minutes. And the credit card spending has continued, even though the most recent outside audit in 2014 warned that the township was on the brink of bankruptcy. The News-Democrat obtained monthly statements through the Freedom of Information Act for all township American Express Statements from Jan. 1, 2012, to July 29, 2016. But actual store receipts were provided only for an 18-month period â the last six months of 2014 and for 2015, the subject of a previous article. The BND has spent the past three months reporting on questionable township spending that included expensive car washes, trips to Las Vegas and tens of thousands of dollars for building supplies. The spending, which two board members said they were not aware of, has resulted in a federal grand jury investigation. The grand jury will meet Sept. 20 at the U.S. District Courthouse in East St. Louis to hear testimony, according to a copy of a subpoena issued to several people in the township. Everyday purchases Statements for credit cards issued to Hamilton and his sister showed hundreds of everyday purchases â from a few dollars at a fast-food restaurant to hundreds and even thousands of dollars from online stores, airlines, hotels, gift shops, large retail outlets, pharmacies and restaurants. Hamilton Deanâs card statements showed a series of purchases during the trip to Chicago and back in 2012. The charges on the way up on June 8 included: âªÂ  $59.75 for gas in Pontiac plus snacks for $22.74. âªÂ  Lunch in Farmersville for $45.94 and dinner at Mattsonâs Steakhouse in Burbank east of Chicago for $77.70. On June 9, the day of the boat ride, her card was charged: âªÂ  $40.53 at Portilloâs Hot Dogs in Oaklawn, $18.77 at a Snappyâs Convenience Store near Chicago and $70 at Chicagoâs Bistro Restaurant. There was also a $30.20 charge at a Walgreenâs retail store, one of several Walgreenâs purchases over the years on Hamilton Deanâs card. She did not respond to a written question asking whether the pharmacy charges paid for prescription medicine. The return drive on June 10 showed charges of: âªÂ  $52.47 for gas in Chicago, $64.36 for gas in Hamel, and $23.69 for snacks. âªÂ  $35.08 at Culverâs Restaurant in Bloomington. âªÂ  And when the card was back in the metro-east Sunday evening, $92.16 at Longhorn Steakhouse in OâFallon. Hamilton Deanâs card also was used to charge $291 at an IKEA furniture store in Bolingbrook just before Christmas in 2012. On that same day, the card was used to pay an $85 bill at Brio Tuscan Grille in Lombard, in northern Illinois. Three days later, it was used to charge $500.69 at Target in Fairview Heights. Three days before Christmas in 2012, Hamilton Deanâs card was charged $171.95 at the Honey Baked Ham store in Olivette, Mo. She did not respond to a written question asking who ate the ham. On June, 12, 2013, Hamilton Deanâs card was used to pay for two purchases of $1,413.50 each from Konik and Co., of Skokie, which sells promotional supplies including âpolitical campaign kits.â Five days later, her card was charged $480.55 for a three-day vehicle rental at Enterprise Rent-A-Car in Berkeley, Mo. She did not respond to a written question about the purpose of the purchases. Previously, Hamilton Dean has said her card was used by others with her permission to attend meetings for Cease Fire, a discontinued Chicago-based, anti-violence program that was criticized by the Illinois Inspector General for faulty record-keeping. However, a check of Cease Fire newsletters did not list any meetings by the organization in Chicago during the boat tour weekend of June 9-10, 2012. Cease Fire pay records show that Hamilton Dean had no association with the program until shortly before it was discontinued by Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2014, when she was paid $4,075 as a financial consultant to the program. Oliver Hamilton, the township supervisor, regularly ate at restaurants outside the township, the financial records showed. He charged $102.53 at Eleven Eleven Mississippi Street in St. Louis, a restaurant that features ârustic Tuscan cuisine.â Another $91.50 was charged at Fischerâs Restaurant in Belleville. Hamiltonâs smallest dining purchase was $2.59 at a Kentucky Fried Chicken in St. Louis. His most expensive restaurant tab was at the Casino Queenâs Sevens Sports Bar and Nightclub, where his township card was charged $165.28. Hamilton also apparently bought gifts, including $419 charged at Things Remembered, a gift shop in Belleville. He made two trips to a Radio Shack in East St. Louis and spent $100 each time. And he used the public credit card to make thousands of dollars worth of purchases through the online Amazon Marketplace. In January 2013, there was $93.14 charged on Hamiltonâs card at Burlington Coat Factory in Fairview Heights. He has used the public card to pay for numerous hotel charges including the Westin and Sheraton in Chicago, and the Hyatt in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, purchased through Expedia.com. Hamilton also spent more than $3,000 on car washes, detailing and oil changes. Gasoline purchases Hamiltonâs spending at gas stations dominated the monthly American Express bills paid for by the township. During a previous interview, before he stopped talking with reporters on the advice of his attorney, Hamilton said the gasoline was used to fill gas cans for lawn mowing, even though a company owned by his friend and business associate, Ernest Walker, was paid $1,500 a month to mow township property. The BND unsuccessfully sought a copy of the township mowing contract to determine if Walkerâs contract covered gas. Hamilton made 775 separate gas purchases over the 4 1/2-year period for which records were made available, mostly at an Exxon station in East St. Louis and a GasMart in St. Louis. He purchased $100 or more of gas on 89 days during the the period. On 33 other days, he bought at least $150 in gas. On seven days, he bought $200 or more in gas. The record single-day gas buy was $265.72 in three trips to GasMart on Oct. 13, 2012. The card statement showed this was for 72 gallons, enough fuel to power Hamiltonâs Silverado pickup about 1,150 miles. Yet the American Express records showed he returned to the same GasMart four days later and bought 21 gallons for $74, and the next day spent $100 at the Exxon station. An attendant at GasMart in St. Louis told reporters, who showed him a photo of Hamilton, âI remember him. He drives a pearl-colored truck. He buys gas and cigarettes. I see him all the time.â The monthly credit card statements show Hamilton used his township credit card twice at a BP station in Osage Beach, Mo., at Lake of the Ozarks. He did not respond to a written question asking what township business he was conducting there. During a two-week road trip in 2013 through Missouri, Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and finally Mississippi, where he has a home, Hamiltonâs township credit card was charged $548 for gas alone. On Aug. 11, the day after Hamilton returned to the metro-east, he charged $108.26 for an oil change, car wash and detailing at the Auto Spa in Fairview Heights. The township board approved the $1,000 monthly spending limit for Hamiltonâs card in February 2012 but records show it was exceeded every month that followed, including a high of $23,359 in January of 2013. Lori Riverstone-Newell, associate professor in the Department of Politics and Government at Illinois State University, was asked what the public can do if the spending limit is ignored. âItâs complicated, but some resolutions will define the jurisdiction and penalties for violations, generally reserving jurisdiction to the board or council. If there is a code of ethics, penalties for violations should be found there,â Riverstone-Newell said in a written comment. âAs to criminal charges, the U.S. Attorney should be notified to investigate,â she said. âThe chance of recovering the loss to the township is pretty slim, although part of a criminal penalty might be restitution. The board members will probably be able to hold their positions while the investigation is underway, but they should be pressured to resign.â George Pawlaczyk: 618-239-2625, @gapawlaczyk Beth Hundsdorfer: 618-239-2570, @bhundsdorfer A sample of unquestioned credit card charges According to township meeting minutes, the four-member East St. Louis Township trustee board has never questioned charges made on the townshipâs American Express credit cards issued to Supervisor Oliver Hamilton and his sister, June Hamilton Dean, a township financial consultant.

McDonald's and the global revolution of fast food workers NYC Fight for $15 rally Liz Cooke, CC BY By Annelise Orleck Monday, September 5, 2016 6:16 AM UTC 0 comments When it comes to their wages, McDonaldâs workers around the world are not âLoving Itâ â and they havenât been shy about expressing their discontent over the past four years. But this Labor Day, Americaâs fast food workers can celebrate victories that have improved wages for some of them. And they can applaud a global labor movement of low-wage workers that they helped spark and continue to inspire. In April, fast food workers led the most global strike in history. It took place in 300 cities, in more than 40 countries in every region of the globe. It was a day of action against what activists called âMcJobsâ â low-wage, precarious work. And it caught the attention of the world. From Manhattan to Manila, from Tokyo to Toronto, fast food workers were joined in living wage protests by home health care workers, airport workers, retail workers and millions of others who are fully employed but do not earn enough to make ends meet. Earlier in the year, 27-year-old Florida McDonaldâs worker Bleu Rainer drove from Tampa across the state to protest outside of the Republican debate at the University of Miami. Chanting, âWe work, we sweat. Put $15 in our checks,â he says protesters succeeded in injecting the fight for a living wage into the feisty Republican debate, where billionaire candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows by insisting that wages in the U.S. are already too high. When Americaâs low-wage workers, a disproportionate number of whom are African-American, convened in Richmond, Virginia this August, they vowed to continue fighting and tied their struggle to the larger battle to overcome American racism. They coined the new slogan: Black Work Matters. As a labor historian, I became interested in the global fast food workers movement, which uses history, popular culture and social media to organize and make its case. Over the last year, Iâve talked to fast food workers in Tampa, New York, Los Angeles, Manila, Philippines and Phnom Penh, Cambodia, among other places. They are literally hungry for change and they are making change happen. A global network Like popular culture, the problems of todayâs work world are global. As the slogan goes, âMcJobs Cost Us All.â Vast, transnational low-wage employers like McDonaldâs and Wal-Mart drive wages down for everyone. With more than half of U.S. workers earning less than US$30,000 a year in 2014, the poverty line for a family of five, it is not a surprise that the Fight for $15 movement has attracted workers of all kinds. The movement is bigger than just the United States. In Manila, young Filipino activists in the RESPECT Fast Food Worker Alliance staged singing, dancing flash mobs in their nationâs legislature to demand labor protections. And, in Moscow, fast food workers staged protests to highlight the fact that they were not teenagers working for âgoing outâ money but adults trying to support families with inadequate wages. Where did all this anger come from? In 2015, 52 percent of fast food workers in the U.S. received public assistance to make ends meet. Many had to work two and three jobs. Some commuted to work from homeless shelters. Maia Montcrief from Long Beach, California, told me that she lives in a one-bedroom apartment with six people. She is one of the lucky ones. Though fast food workers have protested at many global and localized chains, the main focus of their movement has been McDonaldâs. With 36,538 restaurants in 119 countries, McDonaldâs is the worldâs second-largest private employer. Only Wal-Mart employs more. âBecause McDonaldâs has employees everywhere,â activist Bleu Rainer told me, âeverything they do has a global impact that affects all workers.â Bleuâs story Rainer is a 27-year-old McDonaldâs worker. âIâve worked in the fast food industry in North Carolina and Florida,â Rainer told me, âand in eight years Iâve made no more than eight dollars and five cents an hour.â He said that even when he was offered a promotion to manager, his salary did not increase. Bleu Rainer. âI have witnessed the torture of not having enough to afford rent, which led to me sleeping from house to house,â Rainer says. âOne time I even had to sleep at bus stops because I was homeless. I have had to rely on food stamps just to get a good meal and when those food stamps run out itâs back to nothing at all. Sometimes I think to myself: Iâm working so hard every day. So why am I still hungry? Why am I not making a living wage? Why canât I feed myself?â Beginning in 2012, Rainer and a small group of New York City fast food workers kicked off a protest against poverty wages. It was a decidedly 21st-century movement. They used one-day flash strikes instead of long-term actions that hurt workers more than employers. They deployed social media to organize and publicize their actions. And they gleefully subverted expensive corporate slogans â especially the McDonaldâs jingle âIâm Lovin' It,â the first worldwide ad campaign for the burger giant, which they paid Justin Timberlake $6 million to sing on TV. âPoverty Wages: Not Lovin' Itâ became the slogan of a new movement, and signs with those words soon appeared in as many countries and as many languages as the original version. When I first met Rainer in Tampa, he was helping to organize a broad coalition of low-wage workers: fast food workers, home health care attendants and adjunct college professors â none of whom made enough money to pay their bills. As we sat together at a table in a West Tampa Cuban diner, the professors made clear that they saw themselves paddling in the same boat as fast food workers and home health care aides. They earned around $8 an hour, worked on short-term contracts and had absolutely no job security. âThey try to convince us weâre better, weâre the elect,â said Cole Bellamy, who teaches 12 courses a year. âBut thatâs the lie they tell us to keep us quiet.â âWe are all fast food workers,â said graduate student Keegan Shephard. âOr maybe we are all professor adjuncts,â said Rainer. The successes Their campaign has been remarkably successful in a short period of time. This March, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the McDonaldâs corporation is a joint employer of those who work in franchise-owned restaurants, a huge victory for fast food activists. Last summer, New York state granted a $15 minimum wage to the stateâs 180,000 fast food workers. Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles also passed $15 living wage ordinances. This spring, the state of California, which has a population of nearly 40 million people, passed a phased-in statewide $15 wage. The wages of federal food workers have been raised. Wal-Mart has raised its minimum. McDonaldâs offered increases to those who work in restaurants owned outright by the corporation, which pressured franchise owners to do the same. Four years ago, when the first fast food workers' strikes were held in New York and Chicago, the $15 minimum wage seemed a fantasy. Now it is a reality in many of the largest labor markets in the U.S., and it is fast food workers who launched the tidal wave. Yet, with all this success, the life of an average fast food worker is still difficult, at best. One reason most fast food workers are so poor is because their wages are so low. But it is also because computers scheduling shifts change workersâ hours at the drop of a hat, making it impossible for parents of young children to plan child care or to know for sure whether they will be able to pay their bills each month. Algorithms, I have learned through numerous interviews, maximize efficiency for the company and cut labor costs whenever possible. Workers believe they are used to intentionally keep workers' hours low enough that they are not covered under state and federal labor laws and can be seen as part-time or temporary workers. One McDonaldâs worker I met in New York City in 2015, who depended on his full-time salary, showed me a paycheck for two weeksâ work that totaled $109. Contrary to public opinion, most fast food workers are not teenagers on their first job but adults supporting families. The average fast food worker is 29 years old. Over 25 percent are parents. Nearly one in three have college degrees â or are working their way through college. This is not the first time that restaurant workers have organized. Restaurant unions have, in different eras, been strong in some big cities, especially New York and Las Vegas. But this is the first time that fast food workers have organized, and it is definitely the first time that they have organized in conjunction with a range of other low-wage workers and on a global scale. Massimo Frattini, a former hotel worker from Milan who is one of the global coordinators for fast food workersâ actions, told me that he was stunned by the worldwide response when the first global strike took place in 2014. On that day, fast food workers in 230 cities, in 34 countries, on six continents, walked off the job to dramatize their need for a living wage, full-time work and union recognition. The scale of the strike surprised pretty much everyone: the workers, the organizers and definitely McDonaldâs. Workers staged mock trials of a weeping Ronald McDonald for wage theft in the streets of Seoul. They shut down McDonaldâs in Brussels and in Londonâs Trafalgar Square. âWe were not aware of how organized workers were in the fast food sector in the Philippines or Thailand or New Zealand,â Frattini said. "But the truth is they knew that alone, they were helpless against these massive corporations. But maybe together they could raise the issue on the global stage. And they could provide better services and negotiate better agreements for their members.â Over the next year, workers from New York, Chicago, and 150 U.S. cities met with workers from Denmark, Argentina, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and numerous other countries. The Service Employees International Union in the United States and Frattiniâs international union of food, hotel and farm workers, which represents 12 million workers in 120 countries, paid for these meetings. Workers compared notes on wages and working conditions. Workers from McDonaldâs and Kentucky Fried Chicken from every continent on Earth began planning strategy for global living wage agreements. One of the original organizers, Naquasia LeGrand, was just a 22-year-old kid from Brooklyn who was tired of working three jobs. She looked back during the summer of 2016 on what she had helped start in 2012. She said: âWe triggered something epic that had never been done.â Indeed they had: a global fast food workers' revolution.

Home Latest News Featured News Past Issues Our Opinion About Us Contact Find Hardcopy Find Hardcopy Facebook Twitter Instagram Stay Connected RSS for posts Unions Are the Path to Well-Paying Jobs September 5, 2016 | Filed under: Labor,Latest News | Posted by: Sana by Richard Bloomingdale RICHARD BLOOMINGDALE Any job can be a well-paying job if itâs a union job! That lesson has been lost to many Americans deceived by decades of attacks from well-funded corporate interests and their political allies. Politicians like to talk about jobs, good-paying, middle-class jobs that can sustain American families. Have these jobs always existed? No. These jobs, and the dignity they bring to working families, were fought for by a strong labor movement. Before jobs were low paying to the point that people lived in company houses or tenements with multigenerational family members in the same space. They rarely had a car and certainly did not own their home. How, and why, did that change? Unionization and organizing changed it all. President Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, leveling the playing field for workers to organize. So as unions formed in the big industrial and craft sectors, workers gained a seat at the table through collective bargaining. It was at those tables that workers voiced their right to a share of the product of their labor. No longer did all the profits go to the 1%; some of those profits were paid to the workers who actually made the products. As a result, America experienced an era of broad-based prosperity unlike any ever seen before. And while union density only reached its height at 35% of the American workforce, many employers in non-union companies paid a decent wage to keep from losing their employees. As we see Americanâs income and middle class stagnate, while union density shrinks, the income going to the 1% grows. This is no accident; most (not all) employers reward shareholders at the expense of workers. One prime example is Walmart. We see the Waltons and their shareholders getting richer and richer, while their employees qualify for food stamps and Medicaid. Â Ultimately, Walmart gets richer at the expense of the taxpayers. But what if Walmart was union? Workers, through their union, would have representation and bargain for a share of the success and profit from their work. The workerâs share would be a higher wage, a health-care plan and maybe even a pension. Higher wages would lead to increased spending at other stores, maybe even the purchase of a home. In John Kennedyâs words, a rising tides lifts all boats. How do we get back to the those good old days of a growing middle class? One word â organize! Â Since President Roosevelt signed the NLRA, greedy employers and unscrupulous lawyers have figured out ways to get around the law and, in some cases, break the law. They break union organizing laws intended to level the playing field for workers who want to form unions because, in their greedy minds, it is better to pay paltry fines created 80 years ago than have a union. It is time to strengthen the law and significantly increase fines, creating economic and personal disincentives that deter illegal anti-organizing and union-busting practices. Workers need to be active in elections. If we are going to change the law, we need to elect people who are going to vote to level the playing field. We need to be make the phone calls, go door to door, visit worksites and provide our members with the information they need to make informed decisions about candidates running for office. So, if you want a return to the middle class, get out there! Organize your workplace and help us elect people who will protect your right to have a voice at work. And donât forget to vote on Nov. 8! Richard Bloomingdale is president of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Sep 5, 2016 at 8:51AM Image Source: Motley Fool.Â  Dollar store chains got slammed last month asÂ Dollar GeneralÂ (NYSE:DG),Â Dollar TreeÂ (NASDAQ:DLTR), andÂ Five BelowÂ (NASDAQ:FIVE) all posted disappointing earnings reports. As the chart below shows, all three stocks fell by 11% or more. DG data by YCharts The culprit appeared to be a resurgentÂ Wal-MartÂ (NYSE:WMT), which has invested to clean-up stores, raise wages, bring back greeters, and eliminate out-of-stocks. In its most recent quarter, the retail giant posted comparable sales growth of 1.6%, its best performance in several years. Wal-Mart has also lowered prices on key traffic drivers such as fresh produce, and branded and private-label goods, helping to poach customers from dollar store chains. Dollar store stocks had thrived in recent years, finding a retail niche with low-income customers that had been ignored by other companies as well as one that was not affected byÂ Amazon.comÂ or the rise of e-commerce. However, that trend may be changing as the three companies above cited similar competitive threats. At Dollar General, same-store sales increased just 0.7% in its most recent quarter as management noted the effects of food deflation and a decline in food stamp participation rates and benefit levels. CEO Todd Vasos said, "the competitive environment intensified in select regions of the country." At Dollar Tree, meanwhile, comparable sales growth slowed to 1.2% as management also noted a "challenging retail sales environment." Dollar Tree also lowered its full-year revenue guidance and said it expected full-year comparable sales to be in the low-single digits. Five Below, on the other hand, fared better than its competitors with a comparable sales increase of 3.1%. Five Below tends to sell fewer staples than Dollar General and Dollar Tree, making it less of a direct competitor with Wal-Mart. Five Below's CEO also sounded more optimistic than his rivals, but, nonetheless, the company was affected by the weak reports from its peers, falling 11% in the quarter. Earnings growth remains strong Despite falling stock prices and weakened sales, earnings growth was solid at the dollar stores in the last quarter. At Dollar General, which had the sharpest drop last month, earnings per share still increased 14% to $1.08 due to a 6% increase in revenue, a modest reduction in expenses, and a share buyback program that reduced shares outstanding by more than 4% in the last year. With a profit margin near 6%, Dollar General remains one of the most efficient retailers on the market. Dollar Tree, meanwhile, has successfully integrated its Family Dollar acquisition, and saw gross margin improve 190 basis points to 30.3%, and Selling, General, and Administrative expenses fall 120 basis points to 23.1%. As a result, operating margin jumped from 4.1% to 7.1%.Â Strong earnings growth caused Dollar Tree to actually raised its full-year EPS guidance to $3.67-$3.82, despite lowering its revenue guidance. Finally, Five Below saw operating income jump 36% on a 20.8% increase in sales, and raised its full-year EPS guidance to $1.28-$1.32 even though it sees comparable sales growth slowing in the current quarter. On the other hand, despite worrying dollar store investors, Wal-Mart is actually seeing profits fall as it steps up investments in stores, and adjusts its business model to the e-commerce era. The lesson seems to be that the recent dip in dollar store stocks was more a result of bloated valuations rather than weak performance, as even with modest comparable sales growth, profits are still growing at a solid pace.

The employees at these positions currently will be transitioned into different jobs within the company. Earlier in the summer, Walmart tested the automated cash-counting process in around 500 of its almost 6,400 stores. Bookkeeping will move from back offices of individual stores to a centralized location at the Walmart headquarters. Employees Loved the Jobs Employees offered their opinions of the current positions to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the decision: âThe jobs are coveted as a rare desk job in retail. âYou are not running around the store on your feet all dayâ and receive decent pay, said a Wal-Mart store accounting employee who earns about $13 an hour, or $27,000 a year. âEverybody wants to get in there. The jobs never open up,â said this person, who has worked at the store for nine years. [â¦]Â âRight now Iâm getting my resume together,â said one Wal-Mart employee who works in invoicing earning about $15 an hour. After almost 21 years with the company the employee said she isnât interested in moving back out to the store floor.â Cashiers and Truck Drivers Are Also on the Automation Chopping Block MacDonaldâs upcoming automation attempts are another example of the shift in manual labor jobs. As theÂ former McDonaldâs USA CEO Ed Rensi stated inÂ an interview on the FOX Business Networkâs Mornings with Maria: âItâs cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee whoâs inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries â itâs nonsense and itâs very destructive and itâs inflationary and itâs going to cause a job loss across this country like youâre not going to believe.â While Rensi attempted to tie automation to workersâ attempts to raise minimum wage to $15, itâs clear that automation will happen regardless: As soon as it becomes financially feasible, it will be instated. Self-driving cars will similarly remove âtruck driverâ as a possible career path across America, where it has remained a stable job for decades. Automation, in every form, is coming for low wage jobs. Image: Wikimedia Related Tags: automation, robot, trends, walmart Did you like this article?

Walmart, Target, Banks, Costco, Kmart â Sales, Deals, Closings US News What Is Open Labor Day? Walmart, Target, Banks, Costco, Kmart â Sales, Deals, Closings By Jack Phillips, Epoch Times | September 5, 2016 AT 9:00 AM Last Updated: September 5, 2016 4:51 pm On Labor Day, Monday, Sept. 5, 2016, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Publix, Kmart, Kroger, Kohl's, Whole Foods, Trader Joes, are all open. Costco is closed. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) Labor Day is Monday, Sept. 5, and itâs a federal holidayâbut that doesnât mean major chain stores are closed. Post offices are closed and mail wonât be delivered Monday. FedEx Express, Ground, Home Delivery and SmartPost as well as UPS are also not delivering on Monday. All banks are closed on Labor Day. The Federal Reserve and stock markets are also closed. Schools are also closed for the most part. Hospitals and emergency rooms are usually open. All courts,Â from the local to federal level,Â are shut down. The department of motor vehicles offices (DMV) are closed for the holiday. However, most stores are open on Labor Day, including Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Kmart, Kohlâs, and othersâsome with deals. According to Holidayshoppinghours.com: âBIG BOX STORES are OPEN on Labor Day: Walmart, Kmart, Target, Home Depot, Loweâs, Trader Joeâs, Bass Pro Shops, Cabelaâs, PetSmart, Kohlâs, Belk, Bed Bath & Beyond, Staples, Office Max, Office Depot, Best Buy, Academy Sports + Outdoors, etc.â Stores like CVS, Rite Aid, Duane Reade, and Walgreens are also open on Labor Day.Â Costco is closed. Most convenience stories like 7-Eleven and Circle K are open. History of Labor Day According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the day celebrates the âcreation of the labor movement and is dedicated to the social and economic achievements of American workers. It constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our country.â âThe first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday, September 5, 1882, in New York City, in accordance with the plans of the Central Labor Union. The Central Labor Union held its second Labor Day holiday just a year later, on September 5, 1883,â the website says. It added: âThe character of the Labor Day celebration has undergone a change in recent years, especially in large industrial centers where mass displays and huge parades have proved a problem. This change, however, is more a shift in emphasis and medium of expression. Labor Day addresses by leading union officials, industrialists, educators, clerics and government officials are given wide coverage in newspapers, radio, and television.â Editorâs Picks Top Chinese Leadership to Reshuffle in 2017 The Internetâs Growing Environmental Footprint âFake Newsâ Crackdown Spreads Around the World Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

(AcciÃ³n Visual/Diana Arias/Wikimedia Commons) Share Written by Grace Dobush September 05, 2016 For dedicated readers, all a library needs to be exciting are some well-stocked shelves of books. But as Denmarkâs award-winning new âcitizen spaceâ shows, libraries can come in all kinds of creative and unusual forms. Here are eight libraries from around the world sure to intrigue bookworms. The graveyard library (Wikimedia Commons) The Jewish cemetery in the Austrian town of Krems an der Donau was desecrated by Nazis, with all written records and some burial stones lost. Today, in addition to a 42-meter-long memorial showing the names of 127 local Jews who were murdered or displaced during the Holocaust, the graveyard contains a series of bookshelvesâa project by artists Michael Clegg and Martin Guttmann. The Open Library consists of three bookshelves in the size and shape of gravestones, with glass doors protecting books in English, German and Hebrew about Jewish philosophy and the history of death. The library that straddles international borders (Wikimedia Commons) The Haskell Free Library, which opened in 1905 and includes an opera house, lies on the border of the United States and Canada. The entrance from Derby Line, Vermont, is on Caswell Avenue; the entrance from Stanstead, Quebec, is on Church Street. A black line demarcating the border between the two countries cuts diagonally across the reading room floor, which contains a mix of French and English books. Because you donât have to go through customs to enter the library (as long as you exit the same way you entered), border patrol has caught some criminals attempting to use the library for nefarious purposes. The library inside a former Walmart Everythingâs bigger in Texas, and that includes its libraries. The McAllen Public Library took over an old Walmart for its new 123,000-square-foot main branch, four times the size of its previous location. (The big box store had moved into a larger space down the street.) After a $24 million renovation completed in 2011, the border city of McAllen now boasts the largest single floor public library in the United States, which was also recently named the most beautiful library in Texas. The âWeapons of Mass Instructionâ Argentine artist Raul Lemesoff turned a 1979 Ford Falcon into a tank-like âWeapon of Mass Instructionâ (Arma de InstrucciÃ³n Masiva). Heâs driven the car all around the country, to schools, slums and rural areas, delivering free donated books to anyone who wants them. The Argentinian car can carry up to 2,500 books, and Lemesoff also has built book cars in the United States and Holland. The choice of the Falcon is meaningful: During Argentinaâs military dictatorship in the 1970s and â80s, death squads commonly used Falcons to kidnap citizens. The book-loving camel Author Jambyn Dashdondog has operated the Childrenâs Mobile Library of Mongolia for more than 20 years, traveling across the vast country by camel, horse and now van. He brings books to kids in provinces without access to libraries, sometimes staying in one location for days so the children can read as many books as they can. Since 2011, heâs gotten support from the charity Go Help. Books on bikes The Pima County Public Library is taking another mobile approach to reaching patrons. The systemâs three Bookbikes can be found at community events around Tucson, Ariz., distributing free books and library cards. Many more library systems have now geared up to go mobile in the past five years, including Boston, Buffalo, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Sacramento. The Biblioburros (By AcciÃ³n Visual/Diana Arias/Wikimedia Commons) Elementary school teacher Luis Soriano is famous in northern Colombia for riding his two donkeys, Alfa and Beto, around the countryside on weekends. His Biblioburros have brought books and hope to poor children in the drug-war-torn area for nearly 20 years. Soriano has now built a foundation to build a permanent library in his hometown of La Gloria to house the more than 5,000 books heâs collected. Reading inside the box The administration of the public library in Nice, France, is hidden inside a giant surrealist sculpture of a blockhead. Artist Sacha Sosno, who worked in Nice until his death in 2013, designed it to be the largest occupied sculpture in the world. The striking sculpture is 28 meters high, containing seven floors.

Could these crates of oranges be a metaphor for a data centre? Oh yes 5 Sep 2016 at 08:28, Chris Mellor Analysis September 7 sees Dell Technologies absorb EMC and its VMware holding. Storage-watchers are seeing lots of overlap between the Dell and EMC storage products and wondering if there is going to be a product cull. So far there are no signs of this and it could be useful to ask if Dell + EMC is going to be a traditional few-products-for-broad-markets company or a storage supermarket. A traditional storage products company has non- or minimally-overlapping products, such as all-flash arrays or hyper-converged infrastructure appliances (HCIA) or NAS filers, and pushes these as the best products in the market against competing products; Nutanix appliances versus SimpliVity, EMC VxRail or Cisco HyperFlex ones, for example. A server company wishing to have storage software use its servers will often have a meet-in-the-channel strategy with validated software suppliers products running on, for example, Cisco or Lenovo servers, and being available to Cisco and Lenovo channel partners. These software products, such as HCIA software oroducts from Maxta and others, can and often do overlap and compete, but the server vendor does not care; whatever software a customer wants to run on its servers is fine by it. Even when a server vendor then gets actual skin in a product category game, such as Cisco OEM'ing Springpath HCI software for its HyperFlex HCIA , then it will carry on with now-competing, meet-in-the-channel alternatives. Hold this thought, and let's consider, as an analogy, car manufacturers such as Volkswagen and supermarkets such as Walmart and others. For both, the idea of overlapping products is no problem. Volkswagen Let's list a few Volkswagen car brands: Audi; Bugatti; Seat; Skoda; Lamborghini; Porsche; and VW itself. There is a massive amount of overlap: Prestige sports cars: Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche Four-door saloons (sedans): Audi, Seat, Skoda, VW SUVs: Audi, Porsche, VW, Skoda... City runabouts: Audi, Seat, Skoda, VW ... VW would argue that its separate brands have their separate identities, and the sub-segments in the car market have strongly-defined sub-sub-segments, and price band separations, such that a Porsche 911 buyer is not an Audi RS8 buyer or a Bentley or Bugatti Veyron or Lambhorguni buyer. And the varying brands and their products prosper. Such is life in the consumer car buying market. The brands compete in a broad sense but fundamentally co-operate as sales outlets for VW automotive components. Lamborghini competes more, much more, with non-VW brands/suppliers such as Ferrari than it does with other VW brands. Supermarkets A supermarket sells multiple overlapping brands in many product categories. It can even sell its own brands against the suppliers whose brands it stocks on its shelves. What a supermarket wants to do is maximise sales revenue from its floorspace. If some customers prefer main brands for cereals and others the supermarket's own brand then it will stock both kinds and give them shelf space in proportion to their sales revenue and promotional activities. A Walmart or Tesco has no issue in recognising that different customers want different, overlapping brands in any given category. As long as different customers buy different brands then any functional overlap is obviated. The same can be true in smaller shops, such as electrical wholesalers and decorators' merchants, which sell to tradespeople, with own-brand goods competing for business with mainstream supplier brands. All-in-all these are business organisations which exist to sell, and mostly but not always, make products for customers to buy, and if different customers want products that overlap with separate products bought by other customers, then all is well and good. Business is a supermarket. EMC EMC has been criticised for product overlap in the past and its response has been that it's better to overlap products than leave gaps between them which EMC's competitors could use as doorways into its customer base. Object storage has been a classic case of this, with EMC offering separate Centera, Atmos, Isilon and VIPR products at one point in 2013. An EMC insider told us back then: "The thing about overlapping products is the company won't leave a gap anywhere where a competitor can grow unchallenged." We can say that EMC's organisation almost encouraged, and certainly didn't prevent, products with overlapping functionality. Possibly its execs thought that having internally competitive products would produce stronger products and ones that developed features and functionality faster. Dell and hyper-converged Dell has three storage array product lines; SC (Compellent) Fibre Channel arrays, PS (EqualLogic) iSCSI arrays, and PowerVault (for SMEs), and these don't overlap that much. It doesn't have a separate filer line, preferring to overlay file access technology on top of the SC and PS arrays. Neither does it have a separate all-flash array line, or software-defined storage or in-house-developed or acquired object storage line. Instead it OEMs Scality object storage. Nor does not have its own in-house developed hyper-converged offering. Instead it resells VMware and EMC products and has an OEM deal with Nutanix: VMware Virtual SAN Ready Nodes using Dell PowerEdge servers VMware Virtual SAN support for Dellâs Hybrid Cloud Platform (reference architecture with vRealize). EMC resell VxRail appliances which use VMwareâs VSAN VxRack Node (SW-defined storage building block) System 1000 FLEX rack-scale hyper-converged system XC Series â the OEMâd Nutanix HCIA software on Dell server hardware EMC and Nutanix compete strongly, as do Nutanix and VMware to a lesser degree, since Nutanix started producing its own hypervisor. This product profligacy with hyper-converged contrasts with product parsimony elsewhere in storage. However the profligacy is par for the relatively uncommitted server vendor course; witness Cisco and Lenovo. Now Dell, a supporter of partial product overlap in the hyper-converged space, is buying EMC, a supporter of much product overlap. EMC, Dell and hyper-converged Even though Dell is buying EMC, which is mounting an energetic push of its own hyper-converged VxRail and VxRack products against other suppliers, including Nutanix, Dell will not stop selling the XC hyper-converged system, with its OEM'd Nutanix software. It renewed the Nutanix OEM deal in June, and EMC Converged Systems president Chad Sakac said EMC, once inside Dell, will continue with the XC OEM'd Nutanix system. He said: "It's pretty straightforward: Dell is 20 to 30 per cent of the Nutanix business today, or about 420 customers. It's not the right customer move to sever that relationship. Therefore, we'll offer a choice." If we apply this point of view to mid-range hybrid SAN arrays then the logic is that, after September 7, Dell-EMC will continue selling the Dell SC (Compellent) arrays as well as the Unity (EMC VNX) arrays, even though they overlap in function and market positioning. The two arrays may move to using common components such as enclosures, power supplies, fans, drives and controllers but the brands and separate engineering functions will survive. If we apply this point of view to object storage then the Dell-Scality OEM deal will survive the EMC acquisition as well, joining ECS, ISilon, etc In general then, this positions Dell-EMC as a storage supermarket and not a traditional storage supplier. Is this sustainable? Is Dell/EMC (Demcell?) going to function like Volkswagen? Future mercy-killing For someone like Chad Sakac who runs the converged systems area, overlapping products are fine. If some of his customers are buying XC Nutanix systems and others VxRail, then that's fine. You don't force VxRail down the XC buyers' throats; that would be like punching them in the face Sakac memorably said. Whatever the customers buy in the converged/hyper-converged line then, as long as it's from Dell/EMC, Sakac wins. No problem. He's running a small supermarket and likes a quasi-Volkswagen approach. Yet execs running product groups, under pressure to maximise their revenues, will be incentivised otherwise. When development budget time comes around, Exec A, making VNX, will say something like $1m invested in VNX will deliver $50m in revenues over two years, whereas $1m invested in PS will only deliver $5m over that time. So give me the PS $1m as well and I'll deliver $70m over two years. You can imagine arguments like this up and down the company with stronger product line execs looking to strangle their weaker brethren. In EMC II CEO David Goulden did what prior CEO Joe Tucci had done and went for overlap and internal competition. El Reg's assessment is that he'll do the same in Dell-EMC with a wider enterprise storage product portfolio. That will be fine when the company is growing but the arguments will burst out when budgets get constrained. Product line execs will be screaming out for survival if they are majorly threatened, or demanding development funding to outspend and out-develop the competition and so get back to growth â and not have their budgets reduced because weaker product lines are being supported.. When that happens, what then? Will Dell retain a quasi-Volkswagen approach or will it slough off failing brands and mercy-kill weaker product lines? We reckon they'll go for the mercy kill approach â but not this year. That's our stake in the ground.

Could these crates of oranges be a metaphor for a data centre? Oh yes 5 Sep 2016 at 08:28, Chris Mellor Analysis September 7 sees Dell Technologies absorb EMC and its VMware holding. Storage-watchers are seeing lots of overlap between the Dell and EMC storage products and wondering if there is going to be a product cull. So far there are no signs of this and it could be useful to ask if Dell + EMC is going to be a traditional few-products-for-broad-markets company or a storage supermarket. A traditional storage products company has non- or minimally-overlapping products, such as all-flash arrays or hyper-converged infrastructure appliances (HCIA) or NAS filers, and pushes these as the best products in the market against competing products; Nutanix appliances versus SimpliVity, EMC VxRail or Cisco HyperFlex ones, for example. A server company wishing to have storage software use its servers will often have a meet-in-the-channel strategy with validated software suppliers products running on, for example, Cisco or Lenovo servers, and being available to Cisco and Lenovo channel partners. These software products, such as HCIA software oroducts from Maxta and others, can and often do overlap and compete, but the server vendor does not care; whatever software a customer wants to run on its servers is fine by it. Even when a server vendor then gets actual skin in a product category game, such as Cisco OEM'ing Springpath HCI software for its HyperFlex HCIA , then it will carry on with now-competing, meet-in-the-channel alternatives. Hold this thought, and let's consider, as an analogy, car manufacturers such as Volkswagen and supermarkets such as Walmart and others. For both, the idea of overlapping products is no problem. Volkswagen Let's list a few Volkswagen car brands: Audi; Bugatti; Seat; Skoda; Lamborghini; Porsche; and VW itself. There is a massive amount of overlap: Prestige sports cars: Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche Four-door saloons (sedans): Audi, Seat, Skoda, VW SUVs: Audi, Porsche, VW, Skoda... City runabouts: Audi, Seat, Skoda, VW ... VW would argue that its separate brands have their separate identities, and the sub-segments in the car market have strongly-defined sub-sub-segments, and price band separations, such that a Porsche 911 buyer is not an Audi RS8 buyer or a Bentley or Bugatti Veyron or Lambhorguni buyer. And the varying brands and their products prosper. Such is life in the consumer car buying market. The brands compete in a broad sense but fundamentally co-operate as sales outlets for VW automotive components. Lamborghini competes more, much more, with non-VW brands/suppliers such as Ferrari than it does with other VW brands. Supermarkets A supermarket sells multiple overlapping brands in many product categories. It can even sell its own brands against the suppliers whose brands it stocks on its shelves. What a supermarket wants to do is maximise sales revenue from its floorspace. If some customers prefer main brands for cereals and others the supermarket's own brand then it will stock both kinds and give them shelf space in proportion to their sales revenue and promotional activities. A Walmart or Tesco has no issue in recognising that different customers want different, overlapping brands in any given category. As long as different customers buy different brands then any functional overlap is obviated. The same can be true in smaller shops, such as electrical wholesalers and decorators' merchants, which sell to tradespeople, with own-brand goods competing for business with mainstream supplier brands. All-in-all these are business organisations which exist to sell, and mostly but not always, make products for customers to buy, and if different customers want products that overlap with separate products bought by other customers, then all is well and good. Business is a supermarket. EMC EMC has been criticised for product overlap in the past and its response has been that it's better to overlap products than leave gaps between them which EMC's competitors could use as doorways into its customer base. Object storage has been a classic case of this, with EMC offering separate Centera, Atmos, Isilon and VIPR products at one point in 2013. An EMC insider told us back then: "The thing about overlapping products is the company won't leave a gap anywhere where a competitor can grow unchallenged." We can say that EMC's organisation almost encouraged, and certainly didn't prevent, products with overlapping functionality. Possibly its execs thought that having internally competitive products would produce stronger products and ones that developed features and functionality faster. Dell and hyper-converged Dell has three storage array product lines; SC (Compellent) Fibre Channel arrays, PS (EqualLogic) iSCSI arrays, and PowerVault (for SMEs), and these don't overlap that much. It doesn't have a separate filer line, preferring to overlay file access technology on top of the SC and PS arrays. Neither does it have a separate all-flash array line, or software-defined storage or in-house-developed or acquired object storage line. Instead it OEMs Scality object storage. Nor does not have its own in-house developed hyper-converged offering. Instead it resells VMware and EMC products and has an OEM deal with Nutanix: VMware Virtual SAN Ready Nodes using Dell PowerEdge servers VMware Virtual SAN support for Dellâs Hybrid Cloud Platform (reference architecture with vRealize). EMC resell VxRail appliances which use VMwareâs VSAN VxRack Node (SW-defined storage building block) System 1000 FLEX rack-scale hyper-converged system XC Series â the OEMâd Nutanix HCIA software on Dell server hardware EMC and Nutanix compete strongly, as do Nutanix and VMware to a lesser degree, since Nutanix started producing its own hypervisor. This product profligacy with hyper-converged contrasts with product parsimony elsewhere in storage. However the profligacy is par for the relatively uncommitted server vendor course; witness Cisco and Lenovo. Now Dell, a supporter of partial product overlap in the hyper-converged space, is buying EMC, a supporter of much product overlap. EMC, Dell and hyper-converged Even though Dell is buying EMC, which is mounting an energetic push of its own hyper-converged VxRail and VxRack products against other suppliers, including Nutanix, Dell will not stop selling the XC hyper-converged system, with its OEM'd Nutanix software. It renewed the Nutanix OEM deal in June, and EMC Converged Systems president Chad Sakac said EMC, once inside Dell, will continue with the XC OEM'd Nutanix system. He said: "It's pretty straightforward: Dell is 20 to 30 per cent of the Nutanix business today, or about 420 customers. It's not the right customer move to sever that relationship. Therefore, we'll offer a choice." If we apply this point of view to mid-range hybrid SAN arrays then the logic is that, after September 7, Dell-EMC will continue selling the Dell SC (Compellent) arrays as well as the Unity (EMC VNX) arrays, even though they overlap in function and market positioning. The two arrays may move to using common components such as enclosures, power supplies, fans, drives and controllers but the brands and separate engineering functions will survive. If we apply this point of view to object storage then the Dell-Scality OEM deal will survive the EMC acquisition as well, joining ECS, ISilon, etc In general then, this positions Dell-EMC as a storage supermarket and not a traditional storage supplier. Is this sustainable? Is Dell/EMC (Demcell?) going to function like Volkswagen? Future mercy-killing For someone like Chad Sakac who runs the converged systems area, overlapping products are fine. If some of his customers are buying XC Nutanix systems and others VxRail, then that's fine. You don't force VxRail down the XC buyers' throats; that would be like punching them in the face Sakac memorably said. Whatever the customers buy in the converged/hyper-converged line then, as long as it's from Dell/EMC, Sakac wins. No problem. He's running a small supermarket and likes a quasi-Volkswagen approach. Yet execs running product groups, under pressure to maximise their revenues, will be incentivised otherwise. When development budget time comes around, Exec A, making VNX, will say something like $1m invested in VNX will deliver $50m in revenues over two years, whereas $1m invested in PS will only deliver $5m over that time. So give me the PS $1m as well and I'll deliver $70m over two years. You can imagine arguments like this up and down the company with stronger product line execs looking to strangle their weaker brethren. In EMC II CEO David Goulden did what prior CEO Joe Tucci had done and went for overlap and internal competition. El Reg's assessment is that he'll do the same in Dell-EMC with a wider enterprise storage product portfolio. That will be fine when the company is growing but the arguments will burst out when budgets get constrained. Product line execs will be screaming out for survival if they are majorly threatened, or demanding development funding to outspend and out-develop the competition and so get back to growth â and not have their budgets reduced because weaker product lines are being supported.. When that happens, what then? Will Dell retain a quasi-Volkswagen approach or will it slough off failing brands and mercy-kill weaker product lines? We reckon they'll go for the mercy kill approach â but not this year. That's our stake in the ground.

Business 7 0 0 September 4, 2016 Post Office Hours Labor Day 2016: Is There Mail Delivery On Monday, September 5? Cheryl P Labor Day is a big day for cookouts, parties, and sleeping late, but for others, itâs a regular work day, with many retail stores like Walmart and Target open for business as usual. However, the annual federal holiday always creates some confusion for people who are trying to find out if the post office is open and if letter carriers will be out delivering mail to homes and businesses on Monday, September 5. Whether you are waiting for a bill to arrive in your mailbox, need to get to the post office to send out a package, or are waiting for a mail carrier, FedEx, or UPS delivery at your business, hereâs the scoop on which mail delivery services will be operating on Labor Day 2016. How much #mail we deliver in a day may take your breath away. pic.twitter.com/RACPa8KT5Z â U.S. Postal Service (@USPS) August 30, 2016 According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Labor Day is a federal holiday observed on the first Monday in September. While many businesses, such as malls, restaurants, and supermarkets, are open on September 5, most government offices, including the U.S. Post Office, will be closed on Monday. Although Alternet reports that the post office has been delivering Amazon packages on Sundays since 2015, when regular mail is typically not delivered, donât expect to see that package arrive on Monday. Of note, commentary on the Amazon forum page indicates that some customers have received packages on other federal holidays, so there is a chance that some post office workers will be making Amazon package drop-offs on Monday. Thanks again @USPS & @amazon pic.twitter.com/TvkK8PeTk6 â Jon D (@psujdr) August 29, 2016 Need to mail a package or check your post office box? You will have to wait until Tuesday, September 6 when all U.S. Post Office locations reopen and mail delivery resumes. If you need stamps, many grocery stores and convenience stores sell them at the register, but your mail wonât go out until the federal holiday is over. What about UPS and FedEx? Will they be delivering packages, and can you stop by one of their local offices and ship a package on Monday? Weâve got a #FridayFeeling that weâre about to have a great #labordayweekend! pic.twitter.com/T1f8IjGKQw â FedEx (@FedEx) September 2, 2016 If you have an urgent package to mail out on Monday, you will have to wait until Tuesday to mail it out or drive it to its destination yourself. Although both UPS and FedEx offices will be closed on Monday, September 5, there are some exceptions for those who are waiting for a package to be delivered. According to UPS, if you are expecting a package that has been mailed via the UPS Express Critical service and itâs due to be delivered on Monday, September 5, it should be delivered as scheduled. FedEx reports that it will be closed on Monday, but Fedex Custom critical packages that are set for delivery on September 5 will be delivered. Labor Day isnât the only day that the U.S. Post Office, FedEx, and UPS are closed for business. According to RedCort, nine other holidays are observed in 2016, and that means more days off to come for some and a regular workday for others. In addition to U.S. Post Office and other federal offices, most banks and credit unions are closed on federal holidays. The sixth federal holiday of 2016 is observed this Monday, September 5 and there are four more holidays to go before say goodbye the 2016 and usher in 2017. Hereâs the full list of 2016 federal holidays if youâre still not sure when you may (or may not) have a day off. 2016 Federal Holidays New Yearâs Day â January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day -January 18 George Washingtonâs Birthday -February 15 Memorial Day â May 30 Independence Day â July 4 Labor Day -September 5 Columbus Day â October 10 Veterans Day â November 11 Thanksgiving Day â November 24 Christmas Day â December 26 Do you have to work on Monday, or are you lucky enough to get the holiday off?

(KABC) AP Sunday, September 04, 2016 LOS ANGELES -- Some major retailers are scrambling to work out contingency plans to get their merchandise to stores as the bankruptcy of the Hanjin shipping line has thrown ports and retailers around the world into confusion. They don't have a lot of time. Giant container ships from the South Korean-based Hanjin shipping line are marooned with their cargo of what experts say are lots of TVs and printers, but also loads of home furnishings and clothing. Hanjin, the world's seventh-largest container shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets being frozen, ships from China to Canada were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. It's also been a factor in shipping rates rising and could hurt some trucking firms with contracts to pick up goods from Hanjin ships. The South Korean giant represents nearly 8 percent of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market. While some retailers may already have merchandise for the holiday season affected, experts say what's most important is that the issue be resolved before the critical shipping month of October. "Retailers always have robust contingency plans, but this degree of uncertainty is making it challenging to put those plans in place," said Jessica Dankert, senior director of retail operations for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade alliance with members including companies like Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target. J.C. Penney said Hanjin is one of several ocean freight carriers that it uses and when it learned there might be an issue it began to divert and reroute its containers. It said it uses "a variety of transportation methods and ports" and right now does not expect a significant effect on the flow of merchandise. Target Corp. said it is watching the situation closely and Wal-Mart said it is waiting for details about Hanjin's bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to its merchandise before it could assess the effect. As of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals, said Hanjin Shipping spokesman Park Min. The Seoul-based company said one ship in Singapore had been seized by the ship's owner. At the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's busiest port complex, three Hanjin container ships ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet (213 meters to 304 meters) long were either drifting offshore or anchored away from terminals on Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater. "Hanjin called us and said: 'We're going bankrupt and we can't pay any bills - so don't bother asking,' " said J. Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which provides traffic control for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That's meant cargo headed to and from Asia is in limbo, much to the distress of merchants looking to stock shelves with fall fashions or Christmas toys. "Someone from the garment industry called earlier today asking: 'How long is this going to go on, because I've got clothing out there,'" Louttit said. Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which tracks international imports to the United States, said the situation isn't yet dire but could become so. October is the busiest month for cargo from South Korea to the U.S., accounting for about 11.5 percent of the annual total. But South Korea's maritime ministry said Hanjin's troubles would affect cargo exports for two to three months, given that August-October is a high-demand season for deep-sea routes. The Retail Industry Leaders Association wrote to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruptions. It said the bankruptcy is rippling through the global supply chain and could cause significant harm to consumers and the U.S. economy. "There (are) millions of dollars' worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this," said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation's vice president for supply chain and customs policy. The confusion might also sink some trucking firms that contract with Hanjin to deliver cargo containers from ports to company loading bays. "They've got bills to pay - they could literally close their doors over this," said Peter Schneider, Fresno-based vice president of T.G.S. Transportation Inc. Other shipping lines may take on some of Hanjin's traffic - but at a price. Since many vessels already are operating at high capacity, shippers may wind up paying a premium to squeeze their containers on board, said Jock O'Connell, international trade adviser to Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics. The price of shipping a 40-foot container from China to the U.S. jumped up to 50 percent in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco. The price from China to West Coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said. Hanjin's bankruptcy was a major factor, he said. Global demand and trade have suffered since the 2008 recession, but steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels. That weaker trade and overcapacity have sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years. A few months ago, Poskus said, prices hit historic lows globally - down to as much as $600 per container from Shanghai to Los Angeles. That wouldn't even cover fuel costs for the huge ships, he said. Poskus expects the spike in prices to last a month or two. With about 5 percent of ships in the global trading fleet sitting idle, he believes there is room to take over Hanjin's capacity and carriers already are discussing the possibility of adding ships. But he said prices would have to rise in order to be sustainable.

Trugman View author archive Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) September 3, 2016 | 9:00pm Modal Trigger Shutterstock More On: workforce Women won't earn as much as men for 170 years City agencies slow to diversify despite vows to increase minority hires: report Use this excuse next time you want to call in sick Crisis of un-work: more and more men skip jobs, watch TV instead Within this economy and its superficially healthy 4.9 percent unemployment numbers lies a double-edged crisis. Itâs a crisis within a crisis. Historically, 5 percent to 6 percent unemployment was considered âfull employmentâ in America. But todayâs workforce isnât exactly your grandparentsâ workforce. Then again, it may be. Some 24 percent of seniors over 65 years old are now in the US workforce. Yes, one-quarter of our seniors must now work to get by. The Silver Tsunami has struck Americaâs workforce, and it isnât pretty. In America, the dream of retiring in your 60s is quickly becoming more of a fantasy than a realistic goal. And itâs astonishing how the quality of jobs here has diminished over the past 10 years. Gone is upward mobility. For every tiny tech startup that employs 20 to 100 people, thereâs a Walmart, which announced a 7,000-person headcount reduction on Thursday. And Walmart is cutting its âhighest-paid hourly workers in accounting and invoicingâ and jobs that are mostly held by âlong-term employees,â the company said. Those are good middle-class jobs with good benefit packages, and Walmart, like IBM, Microsoft and others, isnât retraining. It is relieving of service. So imagine youâre in your late 50s, youâve worked hard and risen to the level of manager and are comfortable that in another five to seven years, you could save enough to retire from your current job at age 65. There are plenty of good, legitimate reasons to work past age 65. But having to work to afford the out-of-pocket expenses not covered by Medicare and a feeble Social Security check is a hardship. At Home Depot, I see an elderly man who always asks me if I need help carrying my purchases. He is well into his 70s, and as we walk to my car and talk, I always push the cart and do the heavy lifting. Iâve asked him why he does this. His wife is ill and Home Depot has great health-care benefits, he says. So Fridayâs 4.9 percent is about as reliable as a campaign promise. That is, not very.

Liz Cooke, CC BY Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn When it comes to their wages, McDonaldâs workers around the world are not âLoving Itâ â and they havenât been shy about expressing their discontent over the past four years. But this Labor Day, Americaâs fast food workers can celebrate victories that have improved wages for some of them. And they can applaud a global labor movement of low-wage workers that they helped spark and continue to inspire. In April, fast food workers led the most global strike in history. It took place in 300 cities, in more than 40 countries in every region of the globe. It was a day of action against what activists called âMcJobsâ â low-wage, precarious work. And it caught the attention of the world. From Manhattan to Manila, from Tokyo to Toronto, fast food workers were joined in living wage protests by home health care workers, airport workers, retail workers and millions of others who are fully employed but do not earn enough to make ends meet. Earlier in the year, 27-year-old Florida McDonaldâs worker Bleu Rainer drove from Tampa across the state to protest outside of the Republican debate at the University of Miami. Chanting, âWe work, we sweat. Put $15 in our checks,â he says protesters succeeded in injecting the fight for a living wage into the feisty Republican debate, where billionaire candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows by insisting that wages in the U.S. are already too high. When Americaâs low-wage workers, a disproportionate number of whom are African-American, convened in Richmond, Virginia this August, they vowed to continue fighting and tied their struggle to the larger battle to overcome American racism. They coined the new slogan: Black Work Matters. As a labor historian, I became interested in the global fast food workers movement, which uses history, popular culture and social media to organize and make its case. Over the last year, Iâve talked to fast food workers in Tampa, New York, Los Angeles, Manila, Philippines and Phnom Penh, Cambodia, among other places. They are literally hungry for change and they are making change happen. A global network Like popular culture, the problems of todayâs work world are global. As the slogan goes, âMcJobs Cost Us All.â Vast, transnational low-wage employers like McDonaldâs and Wal-Mart drive wages down for everyone. With more than half of U.S. workers earning less than US$30,000 a year in 2014, the poverty line for a family of five, it is not a surprise that the Fight for $15 movement has attracted workers of all kinds. The movement is bigger than just the United States. In Manila, young Filipino activists in the RESPECT Fast Food Worker Alliance staged singing, dancing flash mobs in their nationâs legislature to demand labor protections. And, in Moscow, fast food workers staged protests to highlight the fact that they were not teenagers working for âgoing outâ money but adults trying to support families with inadequate wages. Where did all this anger come from? In 2015, 52 percent of fast food workers in the U.S. received public assistance to make ends meet. Many had to work two and three jobs. Some commuted to work from homeless shelters. Maia Montcrief from Long Beach, California, told me that she lives in a one-bedroom apartment with six people. She is one of the lucky ones. Though fast food workers have protested at many global and localized chains, the main focus of their movement has been McDonaldâs. With 36,538 restaurants in 119 countries, McDonaldâs is the worldâs second-largest private employer. Only Wal-Mart employs more. âBecause McDonaldâs has employees everywhere,â activist Bleu Rainer told me, âeverything they do has a global impact that affects all workers.â Bleuâs story Rainer is a 27-year-old McDonaldâs worker. âIâve worked in the fast food industry in North Carolina and Florida,â Rainer told me, âand in eight years Iâve made no more than eight dollars and five cents an hour.â He said that even when he was offered a promotion to manager, his salary did not increase. Bleu Rainer. âI have witnessed the torture of not having enough to afford rent, which led to me sleeping from house to house,â Rainer says. âOne time I even had to sleep at bus stops because I was homeless. I have had to rely on food stamps just to get a good meal and when those food stamps run out itâs back to nothing at all. Sometimes I think to myself: Iâm working so hard every day. So why am I still hungry? Why am I not making a living wage? Why canât I feed myself?â Beginning in 2012, Rainer and a small group of New York City fast food workers kicked off a protest against poverty wages. It was a decidedly 21st-century movement. They used one-day flash strikes instead of long-term actions that hurt workers more than employers. They deployed social media to organize and publicize their actions. And they gleefully subverted expensive corporate slogans â especially the McDonaldâs jingle âIâm Lovinâ It,â the first worldwide ad campaign for the burger giant, which they paid Justin Timberlake $6 million to sing on TV. âPoverty Wages: Not Lovinâ Itâ became the slogan of a new movement, and signs with those words soon appeared in as many countries and as many languages as the original version. When I first met Rainer in Tampa, he was helping to organize a broad coalition of low-wage workers: fast food workers, home health care attendants and adjunct college professors â none of whom made enough money to pay their bills. As we sat together at a table in a West Tampa Cuban diner, the professors made clear that they saw themselves paddling in the same boat as fast food workers and home health care aides. They earned around $8 an hour, worked on short-term contracts and had absolutely no job security. âThey try to convince us weâre better, weâre the elect,â said Cole Bellamy, who teaches 12 courses a year. âBut thatâs the lie they tell us to keep us quiet.â âWe are all fast food workers,â said graduate student Keegan Shephard. âOr maybe we are all professor adjuncts,â said Rainer. The successes Their campaign has been remarkably successful in a short period of time. This March, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the McDonaldâs corporation is a joint employer of those who work in franchise-owned restaurants, a huge victory for fast food activists. Last summer, New York state granted a $15 minimum wage to the stateâs 180,000 fast food workers. Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles also passed $15 living wage ordinances. This spring, the state of California, which has a population of nearly 40 million people, passed a phased-in statewide $15 wage. The wages of federal food workers have been raised. Wal-Mart has raised its minimum. McDonaldâs offered increases to those who work in restaurants owned outright by the corporation, which pressured franchise owners to do the same. Four years ago, when the first fast food workersâ strikes were held in New York and Chicago, the $15 minimum wage seemed a fantasy. Now it is a reality in many of the largest labor markets in the U.S., and it is fast food workers who launched the tidal wave. Yet, with all this success, the life of an average fast food worker is still difficult, at best. One reason most fast food workers are so poor is because their wages are so low. But it is also because computers scheduling shifts change workersâ hours at the drop of a hat, making it impossible for parents of young children to plan child care or to know for sure whether they will be able to pay their bills each month. Algorithms, I have learned through numerous interviews, maximize efficiency for the company and cut labor costs whenever possible. Workers believe they are used to intentionally keep workersâ hours low enough that they are not covered under state and federal labor laws and can be seen as part-time or temporary workers. One McDonaldâs worker I met in New York City in 2015, who depended on his full-time salary, showed me a paycheck for two weeksâ work that totaled $109. Contrary to public opinion, most fast food workers are not teenagers on their first job but adults supporting families. The average fast food worker is 29 years old. Over 25 percent are parents. Nearly one in three have college degrees â or are working their way through college. This is not the first time that restaurant workers have organized. Restaurant unions have, in different eras, been strong in some big cities, especially New York and Las Vegas. But this is the first time that fast food workers have organized, and it is definitely the first time that they have organized in conjunction with a range of other low-wage workers and on a global scale. Massimo Frattini, a former hotel worker from Milan who is one of the global coordinators for fast food workersâ actions, told me that he was stunned by the worldwide response when the first global strike took place in 2014. On that day, fast food workers in 230 cities, in 34 countries, on six continents, walked off the job to dramatize their need for a living wage, full-time work and union recognition. The scale of the strike surprised pretty much everyone: the workers, the organizers and definitely McDonaldâs. Workers staged mock trials of a weeping Ronald McDonald for wage theft in the streets of Seoul. They shut down McDonaldâs in Brussels and in Londonâs Trafalgar Square. âWe were not aware of how organized workers were in the fast food sector in the Philippines or Thailand or New Zealand,â Frattini said. âBut the truth is they knew that alone, they were helpless against these massive corporations. But maybe together they could raise the issue on the global stage. And they could provide better services and negotiate better agreements for their members.â Over the next year, workers from New York, Chicago, and 150 U.S. cities met with workers from Denmark, Argentina, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and numerous other countries. The Service Employees International Union in the United States and Frattiniâs international union of food, hotel and farm workers, which represents 12 million workers in 120 countries, paid for these meetings. Workers compared notes on wages and working conditions. Workers from McDonaldâs and Kentucky Fried Chicken from every continent on Earth began planning strategy for global living wage agreements. One of the original organizers, Naquasia LeGrand, was just a 22-year-old kid from Brooklyn who was tired of working three jobs. She looked back during the summer of 2016 on what she had helped start in 2012. She said: âWe triggered something epic that had never been done.â Indeed they had: a global fast food workersâ revolution.

There are certain areas of the downtown including HEB and Walmart that are included in these tax areas that create funds. TIRZ stands for Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone and many of the faÃ§ade improvement grants small businesses have been using to improve the front of their buildings come from TIRZ. In 2016, $110,000 was committed to matching faÃ§ade improvement grants. Funds are matching and businesses and organization must qualify and complete the work. One of the major projects coming up that TIRZ helped fund is the Sparta Road and Loop 121 road improvement project. Total TIRZ committed the Sparta 2017 improvement project was $286,287. The intersection at Martin Luther King and Main Street will need to be improved. Traffic will increase as residents use the road to reach Loop 121 and the football stadium. The University of Mary Hardin-Baylor is constructing a theatre at this intersection â facility like no other in this part of the state. Heading North on Main Street, the intersection will be improved, allowing residents to turn left. There will be a public hearing dealing with these suggested improvements. TIRZ has committed $155,742 toward these improvements. As the Belton community grows, a town with no retail businesses to speak of in the mid-1990s to todayâs robust retail growth, major transition work is needed. As businesses grow, so does the tax base. Belton is not where it should be, but it isnât where it used to be. A little over 20-years ago, if you lived in Belton, your tax dollars went to Temple and Killeen. Beltonâs TIRZ budget reflects that growth Belton has been experiencing. In 2015, the funds collected were $582,392. In 2017, funds collected for TIRZ is estimated to be $708,762. Funds that can be used has increased 21.6 percent over that time period. Local retailers are so vital to a community if you want parks, roads and quality of life. From 2015-17 TIRZ will have contributed to $4,197,000 in local improvement projects. In 2017, there are two planned faÃ§ade improvement grants at Millerâs BBQ and the building at 100 South East Street. Each are $20,000 in matching grant funding. Capital improvement projects are planned for Christmas wreaths for downtown, and sidewalk improvements on East Street. In 2017, a library park is planned on the south side of the building. Pavement is being pulled up to save two live oak trees near the Lena Strong Public Library. A mini-reading section is planned where two parking places used to be. Funds will be contributed to a new Bell County Parking lot near the old jail, signage is planned for downtown and areas leading into town, new sidewalks for the south side are planned, and water line replacement is planned for the south side of town â again TIRZ funds are used. Possible projects planned with TIRZ funds are a 6th Ave. gateway similar in some ways to Central, East Street sidewalks, and improvements on Nolan Creek Trail.

Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year â enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production â one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farmâs total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Hopes to serve as model Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. âThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we donât have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,â Jackson said. Although much of Appleâs manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States â and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, and its 270 retail stores around the country. One of Appleâs biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Appleâs move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flatsâ energy, but Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. âRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,â said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. âRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.â Doubling capacity In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawattsâ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. âWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,â said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. âEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.â Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonaldâs and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart. Electric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Instituteâs director of utility innovation. One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply. Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats. ATM analogy Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid â a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. âThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,â she said. Robert Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. âTheyâre actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,â Shapiro said. âBut theyâre deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.â To keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. âThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,â Tawney said. âBut because thereâs a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-Â­carbon benefit.â Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companiesâ full energy needs. Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operationsâ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores. Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyersâ alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the companyâs director of sustainability. But that was possible, he said, only because of the plantâs location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&Gâs partners. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible. âIf we had our preference, weâd just be able to say, âWe want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,âââ Jackson said. âThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable â and if we didnât have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.â More Business articles Â» Â  Â  RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.

WASHINGTON (TNS) â For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the 2007-09 recession has arrived every week or two for years â in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has limited economic recovery, with many workers getting few if any raises. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurring solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures, amplified by laws providing minimum-wage increases in California, New York and elsewhere, also are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonaldâs and JPMorgan Chase increased what they pay their lowest-level employees. âA pay increase is the right thing to do,â JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently in announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers, customer service representatives and other employees to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the current $10.15. âWages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,â he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated from the presidential campaigns of Republicans and Democrats. When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available, from $57,724 in 2000. âHousehold incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,â Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. âThink of it â¦ youâre making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.â Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is the loss of bargaining power caused by a drop in the share of private-sector unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. As a result, the share of money flowing into households from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest and dividends, according to a study last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes, further stifling overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth, job openings are near record levels. Thatâs forced employers to raise pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall â they reached a seven-year high of 2.7 percent year-over-year in July â an improvement from the tepid 2 percent during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1 percent, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workersâ purchasing power. In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce. From 2010 to 2013, new jobs that paid between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions, according to research released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs in fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. Some states and localities have tried to accelerate wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasnât budged since 2009. In April, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hour by 2022. Also in April, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region â faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas â and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. As the states with the nationâs largest and third-largest populations moved to increase their minimum wages, large companies realized that theyâd soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. âWe certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country,â McDonaldâs chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan said during an earnings call in July âIt has, from a purely business standpoint, created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,â said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. âA lot of companies â¦ were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,â she said. Early last year, Wal-Mart became the first major employer to announce raises for its lowest-paid workers. It now pays them at least $10 an hour once they finish the companyâs training program. Wal-Mart is spending $2.7 billion over two years to increase pay, bringing the average full-time hourly rate for its workers to $13.38. Brett Biggs, the companyâs chief financial officer, predicted the investment âwill pay off long-term.â âWhether itâs lower attrition rates in the stores, better motivated associates, we think weâll see the benefits from that,â he told an investor conference in June. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz cited similar reasons after announcing this summer that the company would raise base pay for its workers by at least 5 percent in October. The companyâs baristas earn an average of about $9.40 an hour, according to Glassdoor. âWhat we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice,â Schultz told analysts on an earnings call in July. After saying last year that he opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage, Trump this summer said he thought it should be raised to at least $10. The Democratic Partyâs official platform calls for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. âRaising the federal minimum wage wonât just put more money in the pockets of low-income families, it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods,â Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told a Michigan crowd last month. âWe need to get incomes and wages rising, and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer.â Tags Wage Worker Employee Company Gain Minimum Wage Job MARC WEHRS Follow MARC WEHRS Close Get email notifications on MARC WEHRS daily!

Employers are experimenting with flexible hours and more generous work-from-home policies; more of them are providing both male and female workers with paid parental leave; theyâre even installing beer taps in the workplace. The situation isnât perfect by any means. Wages for jobs in the middle of the income spectrum arenât benefitting from the infinitesimal growth that the lowest paying positions are experiencing (just ask teachers). The gap between the richest and poorest workers grows wider by the day. Many Americans have simply given up looking for a job. But thereâs been a renewed emphasis on workerâs rights in recent years. Things like paid leave, an increase in the minimum wage, and equal pay for women were largely overlooked during the recession, but have been top priorities for business leaders, the media_, and politicians recently. Hereâs where labor issues stand in 2016: Â© Fox Business Â  Wage Growth Wage growth hit 2.6% for the past year in June, the highest level since the Great Recession. As Glassdoorâs Andrew Chamberlain explains, under ânormalâ conditionsâi.e., before the recessionâwage growth averaged 3% to 3.5% per year. In 2014 it was 2.1%, and in 2015 it was 2.3%. But these numbers donât tell the whole story. Wage growth is highly local, and varies drastically depending on industry. Glassdoor, which collects anonymous salary information, studied growth across 200 different job titles. It found that some jobs are seeing double-digit gains. Unsurprisingly, those include jobs in the technology, health care, and financial sectors. Certified nursing assistants and sales managers have gotten nice raises. Strategists, financial advisors, and front-end developers are also enjoying wage gains well above the economy-wide average. Meanwhile, a more diverse set of jobs have actually suffered wage loss, like copywriters, delivery drivers, and property managers. Yet as MONEY reported, itâs the lowest-paying jobsâsuch as those at gas stations and food and beverage stores like Starbucks âthat are actually seeing the biggest gains, thanks to increases in the minimum wage at the state and local level and a more educated workforce. Target, Walmart, and JPMorgan all recently announced wage increases for their lowest-paid workers. â[M]any of the private-sector jobs that have been added since the Great Recession are either in high-paying professional service sectors or in lower-paying industries such as retail, with few well-paying jobs available for workers without advanced degrees,â writes the Brookings Institute. But as the unemployment rate drops and the workforce becomes increasingly more educated, employers will be forced to increase wages from the current minimum if they want to fill vacancies. As more jobs open up, wages are expected to grow further. But the growth will likely be slow. âIn our view, wage growth outside of low pay sectors is likely to gradually increase as the overall labor market tightens,â economists from Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a recent report provided to Bloomberg. âHowever, the trend will be slow, and will likely remain below that of low pay sectors.â Meanwhile, an increase in the federal minimum wage, which currently sits at $7.25 (though many states and localities have instituted their own, higher minimums), has been a central fight of labor groups for several years. Recently, the Fight for $15, which advocates for a $15 minimum federal minimum wage, has made inroads across the country: Seattle, Los Angeles, New York State, and California have all said they will phase in $15 minimums over the next few years. Over half of Americans favor increasing the federal minimum wage to $15, according to Pew, but it is a highly partisan issue. Per Pew, â82% of Clinton supporters favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15, while nearly as many Trump supporters (76%) oppose it.â Opponents of raising the minimum wage say this will cause layoffs, as small businesses are squeezed. Higher wages will encourage employers to outsource to cheaper labor pools or automate positions. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a $15 minimum wage bill Tuesday, saying individual businesses should set their own wages. Â© TheStreet Â  Salary Transparency/Pay Equity Equal pay has become one of the most visible efforts for gender equality in the workplace in recent years. Women across the country, from A-list celebrities to professional athletes to tech workers, are speaking out against unfair pay practices in their industries and demanding more. On average, women still make significantly less than men, at all levels, regardless of experience, education, or hours put in at the office. The latest attempt to close the gap has been salary transparency: The Equal Opportunity Commission announced in January it wanted to institute a rule requiring companies with over 100 employees to disclose the compensation of their personnel, broken down by race and gender. In the private sector, Buffer, a social media_ firm, gained attention when it made all of its employee salary information publicly available in a Google doc. Read Next: Where Womenâs Workplace Equality Stands in 2016 Companies like Salesforce have reviewed their pay practices internally and made adjustments. SAP, a software company, found that this practice benefitted male workers as well as female, as members of both genders were given a pay hike. Forbidding prospective employers from asking about pay history in job interviews is also picking up steam. Massachusetts became the first state to institute such a policy; New York City hopes to follow suit. And Tuesday, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate from Washington, D.C., announced she would propose a similar bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. Â© TheStreet Â  Parental Leave Policies Likewise, the U.S. has reached a tipping point when it comes to instituting paid parental leave policies in the workplace. Tech companies like Facebookhttp://time.com/money/4129990/facebook-paid-parental-leave/">Facebook; and Amazon are leading the charge, but employers across sectors have realized that, to remain competitive and retain talented workers (and cut down on turnover costs), they need to offer at least some paid leave. Research shows that paid leave helps close the wage gap between men and women; it also allows men to take on some share of care-taking and household duties, which still disproportionately fall on women. These are good things for working women, and good things for families. Itâs also been spotlighted in this yearâs presidential election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has outlined a proposal for paid parental and medical leave. Republican nominee Donald Trumpâs position is less clear, but his daughter Ivanka Trump, who he has said is an important advisor to his campaign, advocated for paid leave policies at the Republican National Convention. And the vast majority of workers on both sides of the political aisle want some type of paid leave policy. Â© Provided by MarketWatch Â  Freelancers/Gig Economy More than 53 million Americans work as freelancers, according to Upwork. The percentage of independent workersâfreelancers, contractors, and tempsâis expected to reach 40% of the workforce by 2020. Even retirees are taking on gig work. Depending on you who you ask, this is either an indication that work as we know it is ending, or the natural progression of Americaâs entrepreneurial spirit. Sure, freelancers can make their own hours, but they must worry about covering their insurance and other costs. Contractors may have the freedom to bounce between projects, but they are rarely guaranteed maternity leave, paid vacation, a 401(k), or health benefits. Whether or not you think freelancing and gig economy jobs are good for workers and the economy, however, theyâre here to stay. And there are a lot of unique problems facing these workers. For example, just 12% of contractors are offered some type of retirement plan, like a 401(k), from their employers. Other problems speak to larger structural issues of gig economy work. âIn the rapid growth of the online gig economy, many workers have felt squeezed and at times dehumanized by a business structure that promises independence but often leaves them at the mercy of increasingly powerful companies,â writes the New York Times. Uber drivers across the globe have made headlines for their efforts to unionize and be considered employees, rather than independent contractors. With an ever-increasing proportion of the population looking to make a living in the gig economy, these are issues that shouldnât be overlooked. These are issues that future administrations in Washington and employers across America will be compelled to address. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, has specifically called out gig economy workers in some of her campaign rhetoric. âIâll crack down on bosses that exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages,â she said during an economic speech in July in New York City. Â© Fox Business Â  Restructuring the Work Week Another trend gaining traction is the restructured work week: Firms are allowing more employees to work from home or shift hours away from the standard 9-to-5. Others are cutting back on the 40-hour work week altogether. Amazon recently announced it was launching a pilot program of 30-hour days for some employees (at a pay cut, natch), while companies in Sweden became the envy of the working world for their 30-hour week experiments. Proponents of flexible hours and shorter weeks argue that the modern economy calls for them. Numerous studies have shown that humans can only be productive for so long. In other words, in an economy that doesnât directly rely on manual labor as it did in the past, the 8-hour work day is no longer efficient. âIt is found that working hours up to 25â30 hours per week have a positive impact on cognition for males depending on the measure and up to 22â27 hours for females,â a study out of the University of Melbourne on over-40 workers reads. âAfter that, working hours have a negative impact on cognitive functioning.â This flexibility also benefits parents and those caring for sick relatives. And for those companies who want to retain the best of the best workers, flexibility is key. According to the Huffington Post, â61 percent of full-time independents cite the âability to control my own scheduleâ as the top reason to work solo, compared with only 38 percent who cite money as the most important motivator.â SPONSORED: Get smart advice on picking a college and paying for it, check out MONEYâs best college value rankings, and find the school that best fits your student, all at the MONEY College Planner.

Source: WDAM LAMAR COUNTY, MS (WDAM) - The Huddle House restaurant on U.S. 98 unexpectedly closed, and employees saidÂ they were notÂ notified and have notÂ received their paychecks. âI literally showed up for work and (there) was no one here," saidÂ Rosna Sloan, now a former employee. "The doors were locked. I was scheduled to come in at 6 oâclock. (There) was no one here. They had taped something on the door talking about new management or whatever. Nobody called me thatâs supposed to hand over the paychecks that the place was even closed.â Mickey Smith is another one of the almost 30 people who lost his job with no explanation and still has not been paid. "Came in overnight, stole our payroll," Smith said. "Stole the money that we work for, (and) closed the store down without our notification. Ran off with everything without notifying his employees that he was closing.Â We want our money, and we want our money now.Â Not only do we want our money, we got people that got families. We got people who got kids. They need to work. This is totally unfair." Sloan said,Â âI donât have a job, and I havenât been paid. They owe me two checks.â Aside from not receiving recent checks, Smith and Sloan saidÂ they previouslyÂ had problems verifying the validity of the paychecks they did receive and often could notÂ find a business that would cash their checks. âYou go places trying to cash your check, and Walmart (doesn't) even want to cash your check," Sloan said. "You know Walmart will cash anybodyâs check. They wonât cash these checks. They even gave us a check that didnât have a serial code at the bottom before. We have to come up here, and they have to pay us because we canât go (anywhere) else. Now Iâve got bad credit because of a check that I worked for. Itâs no good. That falls back on me because you got my information on this check. You donât have yours. You have mine.â Smith agreed saying, âWe have damaged our name, our credibility, in the city of Hattiesburg. We canât even get a paycheck cashed anywhere. If you go anywhere, we got checks, employees got checks that (have) bounced all over Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and itâs a shame.â Smith places the blame on the man he saidÂ owns the building's lease, and saidÂ his actions are criminal. WDAM 7 reached out to Huddle House's director of Franchise Development for Mississippi, but received no comment. âThis man ran off with our paychecks," Smith said. "Not only one paycheck, he owes us more than one paycheck, and we want our money. Itâs not right. Not only do we want our money, we want our jobs.â Copyright WDAM 2016. All rights reserved.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive LovinGrace ministry helps young Carthage women Monday SepÂ 5,Â 2016Â atÂ 8:43Â AM Women from Carthage have been among the 47 of those 18 to 24 years old receiving help from a Joplin ministry over the last two years. By Rich Brown Women from Carthage have been among the 47 of those 18 to 24 years old receiving help from a Joplin ministry over the last two years. The non-denominational ministry, LovinGrace, has reached out to young homeless women or those in transition with, as the name implies, lots of love and grace. The building where the women are housed until they are able to independently care for themselves is located at 1414 Euclid Ave. in Joplin with no fees charged. However, the women are responsible for their own food except for a free supper served each day Sunday through Thursday, thanks to a grant from the Walmart Foundation.. As many as eight women can be housed at one time with most of the residents stayingÂ  eight to 10 months before being able to go out on their own, according to Stephanie Meek, executive director. After opening its doors in February of 2014, LovinGrace provided a temporary home for nine women the first year, 23 last year and 15 so far this year. A group of people with Royal Heights United Methodist Church in Joplin are responsible for having a vision for the ministry. Their hearts were particularly set on doing something for young women who were aging out of foster care with no support system to sustain them. That vision has since expanded into helping all young woman with no support system, such as those who are homeless, as well as with no family support. âMany of the women are looking forward in their lives without a safe place to be or a group of people who are supporting them in whatever their dreams may be,â said Meek, a former counselor at Joplin and Neosho high schools, as well as a former on-call crisis counselor at Ozark Center in Joplin. LovinGrace emphasizes education and employment and in so doing helps residents further their education and find jobs. âEvery woman who comes here has a different story and some are not ready for our program,â Meek said. âSome who have just been released from alcohol and drug treatment programs are often not really ready for our program because they are still struggling with some of their addiction issues and still in treatment.â When coming to LovinGrace, the women are asked what their career goals are and what it is that they want to go forward with in their lives. âThey come to us with a great many needs, such as food, shelter and clothing, and we gradually fill those needs and get them on their feet,â Meek said. âThen they can start thinking about the quality of life, such as education, employment and spirituality. We try to give them the opportunity to experience those quality-of-life things.â Since the women are admitted to LovinGrace knowing that it is faith-based, it is no surprise that they are asked to attend the church of their choice once a week. âWe do have young ladies who are resistant to church because of the experiences they may have had, so we just try to show them by living our spirituality and letting them see that it is not all that bad,â Meek said. âWhat we ask in lieu of church attendance is that they donate their time in service organizations.â Churches also connect with LovinGrace by sending members to lead the women in devotions. A resident assistant lives at the facility, where tours may be arranged by contacting Meek. More information may be obtained by writing LovinGrace, 1414 Euclid Ave. or P.O. Box 576, Joplin 64802. You may also call the ministry at (417) 540-8640 or send email to director@lovin-grace.org.

How the supermarkets stack up 14:02 Monday 05 September 2016 0 Have your say SHOPPERS could soon be getting more for their money as supermarkets gear up for the latest instalment of a raging price war in the sector. Analysts expect Asda to be the next major player to pull the trigger following Morrisonsâ announcement of its latest round of cost cuts on Sunday, with selected meat and poultry prices slashed by 12%. The move marks Bradford-based Morrisonsâ second post-Brexit price reduction after cutting prices on more than 1,000 products by an average of 18% at the start of August. It has prompted speculation over a fresh price war between major supermarkets Morrisons, Tesco, Asda, Sainsburyâs and discount grocers Lidl and Aldi. âThe next in line to cut prices significantly will be Asda,â Nicla Di Palma, an equity analyst at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said. âThey have been a big market share loser in the past 18 months and Walmart, the parent company, have deep pockets and will want to invest in prices,â Ms Di Palma added. Asdaâs market share was last calculated at around 15.5%, compared to Morrisons at 10.5%, Sainsbury at 16% and Tesco around 28%, according to Kantar Worldpanel. The Leeds-based grocerâs new CEO, Sean Clarke, may embark on a âsophisticated strategyâ involving a âbig refreshâ of existing stores and products - but cost cuts will be a faster-acting cure, Ms Di Palma said. Asda last month reported its worst quarterly performance on record, posing a 7.5% fall in like-for-like sales in the second quarter. Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, agreed that Asda and Tesco are likely next to drop prices. However, he stressed that cuts alone w ill not win over British shoppers. He noted that Morrisons boss David Potts has âdelivered a revolutionâ over the past year, in part by focusing on a package of improvements beyond price tags. âIf Morrisonsâ strategy was just about price, it wouldnât have made the progress it has over the last 12 months,â Mr Black said, pointing to the companyâs focus on merchandise, advertising, marketing and the overall shopping experience. However, a weaker pound could ultimately push up costs in the months ahead. Sterling has fallen about 11% against the US dollar since the EU referendum, and more than 9% against the euro. The weaker pound will raise the cost of food imports, which will hurt the already-low profit margins of the UKâs major grocers. âIt would be natural to expect the supermarkets to try to pass on those to consumers as the operating margins are already thin and the supermarkets canât really afford to make even less money, or even lose money,â Ms Di Palma said. âIt is worth noting that Morrisonâs âPrice Crunchâ is for a minimum of three monthsâ, according to Morrisonâs release. Hence, Morrisons has some leeway to increase prices if input costs rise,â she said. Morrisons is set to report second quarter earnings on September 19.

"If Morrisons' strategy was just about price, it wouldn't have made the progress it has over the last 12 months," Mr Black said, pointing to the company's focus on merchandise, advertising, marketing and the overall shopping experience. However, a weaker pound could ultimately push up costs in the months ahead. Sterling has fallen about 11% against the US dollar since the EU referendum, and more than 9% against the euro. The weaker pound will raise the cost of food imports, which will hurt the already-low profit margins of the UK's major grocers. "It would be natural to expect the supermarkets to try to pass on those to consumers as the operating margins are already thin and the supermarkets can't really afford to make even less money, or even lose money," Ms Di Palma said. "It is worth noting that Morrison's 'Price Crunch' is for a minimum of three months', according to Morrison's release. Hence, Morrisons has some leeway to increase prices if input costs rise," she said. Morrisons is set to report second quarter earnings on September 19.

A recent one â scribbled in the messy handwriting of a small child â reads, âI love you so much.â Itâs attached to a silver frame displaying a grainy picture of Michael Vincent Allen that sits on an end table in the home of Nataleeâs grandparents. Randy and Stephanie Allen are raising their granddaughter now, determined to teach her that police officers arenât bad, even though one of them awaits trial for killing her father. In August 2012, Michael Vincent Allen, suspected of fleeing earlier from another officer, led police on a high-speed chase through the eastern Dallas suburbs. He was unarmed, his white GMC pickup struck by a police car, when Garland police Officer Patrick Tuter finished firing 41 shots at Allen. Allen, 25, died at the scene. An internal Garland police department review found that Tuter, a seven-year police veteran, violated the departmentâs use-of-force and pursuit policies. In 2013, he was indicted by a Dallas County grand jury on a manslaughter charge. His lawyer has previously said the officer believed Allen had a gun. âI know thereâs good police in there,â said Randy Allen. âI know we couldnât make it without police, but itâs just a few of them everywhere that makes it seem so bad.â At least 881 officers were involved in police shootings in Texasâ largest cities between 2010 and 2015, according to data compiled by The Texas Tribune. Tuter is one of seven to face criminal charges for pulling the trigger in that period. None have been convicted, so far. The use of lethal force by police remains under intense scrutiny nationwide. Fatal police shootings in places like Missouri, Minnesota and Baton Rouge have led to protests and calls for increased police accountability. Officers became targets of gunmen in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Amid the heightened scrutiny, the Texas numbers underscore how rare it is for police to face criminal prosecution. In the vast majority of cases, investigators and grand juries determine that officers were justified in using their weapons. By law, police officers arenât supposed to shoot unless they believe their lives or the lives of others are in immediate danger, and that judgment is the filter through which all shootings are investigated. It takes overwhelming evidence for fellow officers, prosecutors or jurors to decide to challenge an officerâs decision, even in controversial incidents where circumstances or evidence raise substantive concerns that shootings were unjustified or constituted excessive use of force. âCops are expected to go out and deal with the things that go on in the world that most of us would just assume donât happen, donât exist,â said Kevin Lawrence, executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association. âEspecially if weâre talking about a situation thatâs going on at 2 or 3 oâclock in the morning where the [expletive] has already hit the fan, there may not be any good solutions for those officers. There may not be any good options. Thereâs only the least bad option.â Of the 881 officers involved in cases examined by the Tribune, at least 10 were fired for their actions during a shooting and 14 were suspended. Another was given a written reprimand. Additional incidents where officers faced no discipline or criminal charges have been controversial, and criminal justice experts say the numbers illustrate how extreme the circumstances must be for an officer to be charged or indicted. âEither it wonât reach a grand jury, a grand jury will decide not to press charges ... or in the rare instances that it goes to trial, more than likely theyâre found innocent or not guilty,â said Scott Bowman, an associate criminal justice professor at Texas State University. âIt has to be particularly egregious [for an officer] to be found guilty.â The most recent police shooting-related conviction officials could recall in the 36 cities the Tribune examined was in 2005, when Houston police officer Arthur Carbonneau was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide for the death of a 14-year-old special education student. Carbonneau was sentenced to 60 days in jail and five yearsâ probation for the 2003 shooting of Eli Escobar II, who was being held down by another officer when he was shot. Carbonneau had been dispatched to investigate an assault at an apartment complex, according to news reports. Escobar was unarmed and not involved. Carbonneau chalked up the incident to an accident, saying his gun went off accidentally when Escobar bumped his hand during a struggle. More recently, an officer with the Conroe Police Department, which is not included in the Tribuneâs analysis, was convicted of manslaughter in 2014. Sgt. Jason Blackwelder, who was off duty, killed Russell Rios, an unarmed 19-year-old community college student, by shooting him in the back of the head as he fled a Wal-Mart where he was suspected of shoplifting. Seven criminal cases It takes a rare confluence of circumstances for a police officer to face criminal charges over a shooting. Among the seven cases found by the Tribune, two shootings were fatal, and most involved an unarmed individual: 1Video footage appeared to be key in the case of Dallas police Officer Cardan Spencer, who was indicted and fired over a nonfatal 2013 shooting. Spencer and his partner were dispatched to the home of Bobby Bennettâs mother, who called for help with her mentally ill son. The officers pulled up to a cul-de-sac and advanced toward Bennett, who stood up from the rolling computer chair he was sitting in on the street. In a matter of seconds, he was falling to his knees after Spencer shot at him four times, hitting him once. At first, Bennett was charged with aggravated assault of a public servant. Police said Spencer pulled the trigger after Bennett approached the officers with a knife in an âaggressive manner.â But the charges were dropped within days after a neighborâs video surveillance showed Bennett standing still with his arms â and the knife â at his sides. Spencer was fired 10 days after the shooting. He was indicted six months later. Since then, the city and Bennett reached a $1.6 million settlement in a civil suit. After several delays, Spencerâs trial was recently set for Dec. 12. His lawyer declined to comment on the details of the case. 2Circumstances seemed to play a bigger role in the indictment of Austin police Detective Charles Kleinert, who was charged with manslaughter for shooting and killing Larry Jackson Jr. in 2013. Kleinert was investigating a bank robbery when he confronted Jackson, who was not involved in the robbery, after learning that Jackson allegedly used a fake name at the bank earlier in the day. Jackson fled after a few minutes of questioning. Commandeering the vehicle of a woman driving nearby, Kleinert pursued him and drew his weapon when he caught up to Jackson underneath a bridge. The two men struggled, and Kleinert said he accidentally fired while trying to punch Jackson, fatally shooting the unarmed man in the back of the neck. Jacksonâs family contends he was on his hands and knees when he was shot. In charging Kleinert, a Travis County grand jury concluded that the detective behaved ârecklessly.â The manslaughter charge against the Austin detective was eventually dismissed by a federal judge after his legal team argued Kleinert was entitled to immunity because he was a member of an FBI task force. Jacksonâs family received a $1.25 million settlement from the city. Kleinertâs attorneys did not respond to a request for comment on the case. 3Responding to a 911 call about a man with a knife in 2015, Fort Worth police Officer Courtney Johnson shot Craigory Adams in the arm. Adams dropped to one knee after being ordered to drop his âknife,â which turned out to be a barbecue fork. Thatâs when Johnsonâs gun went off. Johnsonâs lawyer has said it was an unintentional discharge. A Tarrant County grand jury in March indicted Johnson on a charge of aggravated assault by a public servant. Johnsonâs next court date is set for Tuesday for a status conference. 4In 2010, El Paso Officer Jorge Gonzalez shot at Andres Cortez after Cortez rear-ended the off-duty officerâs vehicle. Gonzalez said Cortez hit his girlfriend, a fellow officer, while fleeing. Cortez had said he was trying to get his car out of moving traffic when Gonzalezâs wife began beating on the car. Police said Cortez put his car in reverse, backed up and then put the car in driving gear with Gonzalezâs girlfriend in his path. Thatâs when Gonzalez shot. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing by the police department but was indicted on one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and one count of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. He continued to work for the department after his indictment until he was fired in 2014 in an unrelated case for rule violations, according to Jim Darnell, Gonzalezâs attorney. His lawyer said he acted in self-defense and in defense of his girlfriend during the 2010 shooting. Gonzalezâs gunshot paralyzed Cortez from the neck down. He died more than five years later. Gonzalez has yet to stand trial. His case has been delayed several times; it was recently reset for January. 5Responding to a carjacking call in late 2013, Dallas police Officer Amy Wilburn followed a maroon car speeding through the outskirts of the city into a small condominium complex. When the driver bailed out, she rushed toward the car, which was still in motion. She pulled her gun and fired at 19-year-old Kelvion Walker, who was in the passenger seat. Her attorney has said Wilburn demanded to see Walkerâs hands, and feared he was reaching for a gun when he did not comply. Walker was unarmed and said he had his hands up. Walker said he wasnât involved in the carjacking, and was hospitalized and underwent surgery after the shooting, according to news reports. Wilburn was indicted on an aggravated assault charge in 2014 â the first indictment of a police officer in Dallas since the early 1970s. Wilburn was terminated for violating departmental policy three weeks after the shooting, before she was indicted. Wilburnâs trial is scheduled for January. Her lawyer declined to comment on the details of the case. 6After a four-day trial, a Harris County jury last year found former Pasadena Officer Michael Martin not guilty in the 2011 shooting of an unarmed 20-year-old man, according to news reports. Martin, who was fired for his actions during the shooting, was facing a maximum of one year in jail for the class A misdemeanor of âofficial oppression.â Prosecutors had used two police dash cams and surveillance footage from a convenience store that showed Martin pulling Victor Hernandez over in a parking lot. Martin had said he couldnât see Hernandezâs left arm and claimed he shot him in the face after thinking he was reaching for a weapon. Prosecutors insisted the video footage showed that Hernandezâs left arm was on the door with his hand on his face â at odds with Martinâs accounts. Martinâs attorney told the Tribune he argued at trial that the video showed Martin shooting in reaction to âapparent danger.â A jury concluded there wasnât enough evidence to convict. Hernandez took his grievances to federal court in a civil lawsuit filed in 2013. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2014. 7While on patrol in August 2012, Garland police Officer Patrick Tuter recognized Michael Vincent Allenâs truck as the same vehicle that recently fled from another officer. The car chase that ensued turned deadly when it reached a cul-de-sac in Mesquite where Tuter shot at Allen 41 times, stopping twice to reload and striking him three times. The Garland Police Department first reported that Allenâs truck had collided with a Garland police car and thatâs when Tuter shot, fearing for the safety of the officers. In a statement released 10 days later, the department said âfurther investigationâ revealed that Allen had not rammed into Tuterâs squad car; Tuter had actually struck Allenâs truck. Tuter was terminated by Garland six months later and indicted more than a year later, accused of ârecklesslyâ causing Allenâs death. His trial was recently rescheduled for Dec. 12. Tuterâs lawyer declined to comment on the case for this story. The trials for Spencer, Wilburn and Tuter were delayed several times â partly due to a change in leadership at the Dallas County District Attorneyâs office after the 2014 elections. Susan Hawk recused herself from the cases when she took the helm of the DAâs office, requiring the appointment of special prosecutors who had to get up to speed on the cases. Officers have wide latitude Officers have considerable latitude in using deadly force under a legal standard known as objective reasonableness, which was set by the U.S. Supreme Court. Police can use deadly force if they encounter a situation in which they have reasonable fear based on what a reasonable officer would conclude under the same circumstances. âUltimately, [a grand jury has] to decide did the officer commit a crime,â said Robert Rogers, a Dallas-based defense attorney representing Spencer, Wilburn and Tuter. âYou have to believe that the officer shot the person in cold blood or was unreasonable in their belief that the person presented a deadly threat.â Rogers would not discuss the specific cases involving his clients. As criminal investigations unfold, police departments also carry out in-house administrative investigations that can lead to other disciplinary actions. While most officers do not face criminal charges, a few have faced some sort of consequence, including termination, for fatal mistakes or potentially deadly actions that violated use-of-force guidelines or other internal policies. Some officers â including Spencer and Wilburn â were terminated for violating departmental policy and publicly condemned by their chief of police before a decision was made on criminal charges. Itâs a chain of events that law enforcement groups abhor. The Texas Municipal Police Association has publicly criticized police chiefs for quickly firing officers, insisting that police departments should wait for all the facts to avoid coloring criminal proceedings and grand jury investigations. âOur position is that we should always always wait until a complete vetting of the case,â said Lawrence, the associationâs executive director. âWhat we should all be saying is wait for the facts to come out and weâll go from there.â With a public thatâs increasingly demanding accountability and transparency, police chiefs are left to strike a balance, but they themselves can face reprimands. Earlier this year, Austinâs city manager punished police Chief Art Acevedo for comments he made in the aftermath of a controversial police shooting that the police union claimed showed he prematurely judged the officerâs actions. âYouâre going to have certain people that line up one way or the other based on their pre-existing biases,â said Rogers, the criminal defense attorney. âAnd then you have a lot of people in the middle.â Those are the people who can be swayed one way or the other by news coverage, the release of videos and comments made by department leadership, he added. But for some community leaders and activists, even just a few questionable cases are enough to cast a shadow over a powerful system thatâs granted the power to end someoneâs life. âThe difference with these [Dallas] cases is that those folks lived,â Sara Mokuria, co-founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality, said of the indictments in Dallas. âWhen people survive and thereâs more than just one account, thereâs more of a potential to actually have some form of justice.â Before Wilburn, a police officer in Dallas had not faced criminal charges since the 1973 shooting of Santos Rodriguez, a 12-year-old boy who with his brother was pulled out of bed by police over accusations that they had robbed $8 from a vending machine at a convenience store, according to news reports. The boys denied it, leading to a game of Russian roulette during which Dallas police Officer Darrell Cain shot and killed Rodriguez while he was handcuffed inside a squad car. Cain was indicted and later convicted of murder. He was sentenced to five years in prison but was released after two-and-a-half years. Even in the few cases in which officers are brought up on criminal charges, prosecutors face a daunting task in winning a conviction â or even getting to court. Prosecutions of officers rarely result in lengthy jail time or even convictions. Only five of the seven officers the Tribune identified still face criminal charges. âWe know he did wrongâ Tuterâs trial is a day that couldnât come soon enough for the Allens, who are planning to testify. When they speak about their sonâs shooting and the toll itâs taken on their family, itâs clear that the Allens are desperate. They are desperate for answers, questioning why Tuter shot at Michael so many times. They are desperate for justice, holding on to hope that Tuter could be convicted, though they were surprised he was even indicted. And they are desperate for closure, while accepting their grasp on it may be tenuous because their son will remain gone. âWe know he did wrong, but he shouldnât have got the death sentence,â said Stephanie Allen, Michaelâs mother. âHe shouldâve went through the court system just like everybody else.â Her sunken eyes drift off regularly when speaking of Michaelâs death, and she often ends her statements with a slight shake of her head â disappointment and grief still evident in her words almost four years after the shooting. âI think [Tuter] did wrong, and I hope he pays for it,â she says of upcoming trial. âI want him to never forget Michael. Because I wonât.â The Texas Tribune is a nonpartisan, nonprofit media organization that informs Texans â and engages with them â about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

Education Databases: Searchable databases on demographics, test scores, financial information and te By Richard Bloomingdale / Published: September 5, 2016 Article Tools Font size â + Share This â â RICHARD BLOOMINGDALE, PRESIDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA AFL-CIO Any job can be a good paying job if itâs a union job. That lesson has been lost to many Americans deceived by decades of attacks from well-funded corporate interests and their political allies. Politicians like to talk about good-paying, middle class jobs that can sustain families. These jobs were fought for by a strong labor movement. Before, jobs were low paying to the point that people lived in company houses or tenements. Unionization and organizing changed it all. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, leveling the playing field for workers to organize. So as unions formed in the big industrial and craft sectors, workers gained a seat at the table through collective bargaining. It was at those tables that workers voiced their right to a share of the product of their labor. No longer did all the profits go to the 1 percent; some of those profits were paid to the workers who actually made the products. America experienced an era of broad-based prosperity unlike any before. And while union density only reached its height at 35 percent of the American workforce, many employers in nonunion companies paid a decent wage to keep from losing their employees. While union density shrinks, the income going to the 1 percent grows. This is no accident. Most employers reward shareholders at the expense of workers. One prime example is Wal-Mart. We see the Waltons and their shareholders getting richer while their employees qualify for food stamps and Medicaid. Wal-Mmart gets richer at the expense of taxpayers. But what if Wal-Mart was union? Workers, through their union, would have representation and bargain for a share of the profit from their work, a higher wage, a health care plan and maybe even a pension. Higher wages would lead to increased spending. In John Kennedyâs words, a rising tide lifts all boats. How do we get back to a growing middle class? One word: organize. Since President Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act, employers and lawyers have figured out ways to get around the law and in some cases, break the law. It is better to pay paltry fines created 80 years ago than have a union. It is time to strengthen the law, creating economic and personal disincentives that deter union-busting practices. If we are going to change the law, we need to elect people who are going to vote to level the playing field. We need to be make the phone calls, go door to door, visit work sites and provide members with the information they need. So,organize your workplace and help us elect people who will protect your right to have a voice at work. And donât forget to vote Nov. 8.

E-Magazines Wages, long stagnant, show signs of improvement By Jim Puzzanghera Los Angeles Times Sep 5, 2016 0 WASHINGTON â For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the 2007-09 recession has arrived every week or two for years â in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has limited economic recovery, with many workers getting few if any raises. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurring solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures, amplified by laws providing minimum-wage increases in California, New York and elsewhere, also are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonaldâs and JPMorgan Chase increased what they pay their lowest-level employees. âA pay increase is the right thing to do,â JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently in announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers, customer service representatives and other employees to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the current $10.15. âWages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,â he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated from the presidential campaigns of Republicans and Democrats. When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available, from $57,724 in 2000. âHousehold incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,â Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. âThink of it â¦ youâre making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.â Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is the loss of bargaining power caused by a drop in the share of private-sector unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. As a result, the share of money flowing into households from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest and dividends, according to a study last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes, further stifling overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth, job openings are near record levels. Thatâs forced employers to raise pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall â they reached a seven-year high of 2.7 percent year-over-year in July â an improvement from the tepid 2 percent during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1 percent, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workersâ purchasing power. âWe have turned the corner, and today the wage gains that are happening are far in excess of inflation,â said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at recruiting website Glassdoor. âAs long as we keep seeing steady job gains in the monthly jobs report and near-record job openings, itâs inevitable weâre going to see wage growth pick up,â he said. Chamberlain said Glassdoor data show that competition for workers has pushed wage growth up sharply for some skilled professions. Pay for business system analysts is up about 10 percent compared with a year ago, while sales consultants saw a 7 percent gain and pharmacy technicians 6 percent. Many of those sales consultants are in the technology industry, which saw average wages rise 3.6 percent last year in the 10 top markets, including Silicon Valley, Seattle, New York City and Los Angeles, according to a report from financial and professional services firm JLL. In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce. From 2010 to 2013, new jobs that paid between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions, according to research released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs in fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. Some states and localities have tried to accelerate wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasnât budged since 2009. In April, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hour by 2022. Also in April, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region â faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas â and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. As the states with the nationâs largest and third-largest populations moved to increase their minimum wages, large companies realized that theyâd soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. âWe certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country,â McDonaldâs chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan said during an earnings call in July âIt has, from a purely business standpoint, created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,â said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. âA lot of companies â¦ were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,â she said.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Tensions rise over ârolling coalâ in trucks print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2777530 false David Kasnic / The New York Times A crowd watches during the Illini State Pullers event at the McHenry County Fair in Woodstock, Illinois, in August. Click here to enlarge image Tensions rise over ârolling coalâ in trucks By Hiroko Tabuchi / New York Times News Service Published Sep 5, 2016 at 12:02AM MONTROSE, Colo. â There is a new menace on Americaâs roads: diesel truck drivers who soup up their engines and remove their emissions controls to âroll coal,â or belch black smoke, at pedestrians, cyclists and unsuspecting Prius drivers. Sgt. Chris Worthington of the Montrose Police Department here is out to stop them. âYou can hear those trucks across town, driving like idiots,â he said on a recent Friday evening patrol. He is among the first law enforcement officers in the country to be trained at âsmoke schoolâ to pick up the skills to police the coal rollers. He lost sight of one truck cruising in the opposite direction, trailing plumes of smoke. But another, a Ram 3500 fitted with two steel smokestacks, was parked in a Wal-Mart parking lot. The owner, Pryce Hoey, insisted his truck was emissions compliant, but nevertheless agreed to demonstrate its smoke-generating prowess. âI just wanted something different,â Hoey said, revving the engine and releasing two black pillars of smoke into the evening air before Worthington shut him down. âPeople who see it giggle. They think itâs funny.â Depending on whom you ask, rolling coal is a juvenile prank, a health hazard, a stand against rampant environmentalism, a brazen show of American freedom. Coal rollersâ frequent targets: walkers, joggers, cyclists, hybrid and Asian cars and even police officers. A popular bumper sticker reads âPrius Repellent.â Many document their feats online. Coal rollers also have their own reality TV show. And while official tallies of coal rolling do not exist, there are signs that smoke, whether from intentional belching or not, is a growing public nuisance. In Colorado, complaints over diesel smoke have risen 5 percent over the last two years. In California, complaints about smoking vehicles to the California Air Resources Board have jumped from less than 700 a month, on average, two years ago to more than 1,000 now. State legislatures, as well as local law enforcement agencies, are starting to take action. Last year, New Jersey became the first state to explicitly ban rolling coal, going beyond the federal laws that already prohibit drivers from tinkering with emissions controls. A similar bill is on the table in Illinois, while Colorado and Maryland have defeated proposed bans. The birth of rolling coal Rolling coal has origins in truck pulls, in which pickups compete to pull a heavy sled the farthest. Drivers modify their trucks to pump excessive fuel into the engines, increasing horsepower and torque. Stripped of emissions controls, the trucks also bellow thick, black smoke. At a recent truck pull at the McHenry County Fair in Woodstock, Illinois, the fumes were part of the draw. âWhen the smoke goes black, donât look back,â read one manâs T-shirt. âWe pull for bragging rights,â said Scott Vivian, president of the Illini State Pullers league, the eventâs organizer. âAnd smokeâs a big part of it.â Shane Johnson has named his Ford F-250 truck, with its 1,500-horsepower Duramax engine, Public Enemy. He pulled the sled almost all the way down the dirt track, spewing a column of smoke into the summer sky. âItâs an adrenaline rush,â he said. Still, fans of truck pulling insist â and environmental officials largely agree â that it is harmless entertainment. When the EPA completed new truck emissions standards this month, it emphasized that it did not intend to go after trucks used in motor sports. There is, in fact, disdain among truck-pull enthusiasts toward coal rollers, whom they view as wannabes sullying their sport. âI hate those guys. I used to do it, smoke out friends, but I grew out of it,â Johnson said. âGives diesel a bad name.â The police âsmoke machineâ Raymond Elick runs the smoke school at the Colorado Health and Environment Department, training police to spot coal rollers. It is more art than science. In Colorado, a bill that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor died in a GOP-controlled state Senate in April. Still, an obscure Colorado state law, a holdover from the days when diesel was far dirtier, allows officers to cite coal rollers that blow smoke for at least five seconds at more than 40 percent opacity, or thickness. Using a âsmoke machineâ that burns toluene, Elick has trained 55 police officers to discern smoke opacity: Zero percent opacity is clear air; 100 percent opacity lets no light through. âIf itâs smokinâ, itâs broken,â Elick said. âIf you see a smoky truck running down the street, thatâs probably 40-50 percent, and thatâs pretty darn smoky,â he said. âIf all of the light disappears over that path, if itâs a really bad coal roller, it could be approaching 100 percent.â Buying tuning kits online âTuningâ passenger vehicles to override emissions controls is relatively easy, with appropriate gear. Online retailers like Amazon and eBay sell aftermarket products that render emissions equipment inoperable. Truck owners intent on rolling coal need only to turn to the Discovery Channel reality show âDiesel Brothersâ for guidance. The show, which has more than 2.2 million viewers an episode, follows Heavy D, Diesel Dave and a team of mechanics in Utah who âbuild the baddest diesel trucks ever seen on the planet.â Some of the modified trucks are offered for sale with no emissions controls on DieselSellerz.com, a site affiliated with the show. The Diesel Brothers have alarmed health professionals. Even short-term exposure to diesel smoke can increase the probability of heart attacks, strokes, lung disease and cancer, said Brian Moench, president of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment. âYou have created a growing business transforming lawful, emission-compliant vehicles into illegal, pollution-belchingâ trucks, Moench wrote in a letter to the Diesel Brothers. âTo what purpose?â Heavy D, or David Sparks, said through a representative that there was âa misunderstanding on the modification process of trucks on the show.â The Discovery Channel declined to comment. Enforcement troubles Anyone who tampers with emissions-control equipment violates the Clean Air Act, which prohibits the selling or installing of any component intended to bypass emissions equipment and carries penalties of up to $2,500. Enforcing that ban on the street is difficult, however. Moves in a handful of states to follow New Jerseyâs explicit coal-rolling prohibition have been opposed by those who argue that a ban would be regulatory overkill. Guzzardi, the Illinois representative and an avid cyclist, has been pushing a bill that would impose an additional fine of up to $5,000 for anyone caught coal rolling. âWhy should I get a giant blast of smoke in my face from someone who doesnât approve of my transportation method?â he said. But a bid in Colorado that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor was defeated in April. âAre we overreaching here?â Mark Scheffel, a Republican state senator, argued in committee. âItâs just kids with too much time and money on their hands.â 14961068 View next article in Nation & World Â  Â  Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Matt Pare', left, and teammate Adam Sonabend accept meager living circumstances. (John McDonnell / Washington Post) Washington Post Twitter Facebook Â Email Â Reddit Â SMS AUGUSTA, Ga. â They trickled into the mid-July night, a rain-shortened loss beginning their Friday night early. A 25-year-old catcher hung back. Matt ParÃ© chatted with teammates and underwent a long treatment session as other Augusta GreenJackets players exited through a clubhouse door wedged open with a broken bat. He kept himself awake with a marathon shower. By the time ParÃ© dressed, he had the clubhouse to himself, along with what was left of the GreenJacketsâ postgame buffet. âWhat have we got, Sarge?â he called toward clubhouse manager Kristopher Nichols, a former Army drill sergeant who appreciates â and usually rewards â ParÃ©âs resourcefulness. ParÃ© is the oldest player for the San Francisco Giantsâ Class A affiliate, and he begins most homestands by waiting out his teammates in order to stockpile free food. Far away from major league baseballâs mighty salaries and Hollywood glitz, ParÃ© is among the thousands of minor leaguers who survive on baseball earnings below the federal poverty line. Baseball has in recent years parlayed renewed popularity into record earnings, leveraging apparel and media demands into $9.5 billion in revenue last year; its 30 franchises averaged $23 million in profits in 2015, and many of its minor league affiliates saw attendance figures and team values continue a steady climb. But the overwhelming majority of players in professional baseballâs extensive player development system never see a cut of that wealth. More than 80 percent of draft picks will never reach the big leagues, and most live on salaries of less than $10,000 per season; the starting salary for a first-year player, paid only during the regular season, is $1,100 a month. âYou always question yourself: Should I be doing this?â said ParÃ©, who says he is making about $7,500 in salary during this 22-week season â a little more than $340 a week, or about $8.50 an hour. ParÃ© shares a two-bedroom apartment with three teammates. He has, in four years as a professional ballplayer, accumulated a mountain of credit card debt. His experience is typical among players on professional baseballâs ground floor, highlighting that financial struggle is, as much as promotional nights and floodlit nostalgia, a minor league tradition. One that might, according to a lawsuit filed against Major League Baseball two years ago, violate federal and state minimum wage laws. âThe organization traces its roots to the nineteenth century,â reads the suit, filed in a California district court and led by 41 former players. âUnfortunately for many of its employees, its wage and labor practices remain stuck there.â MLB has denied that its organizational structure is unlawful, saying it provides opportunity to thousands of young athletes who want to make it to the big leagues. Indeed, many players say the sacrifices are worth it. âIn reality I just wanted a chance,â said Wilmer Difo, a Dominican-born player who, before being called up by the Washington Nationals last year, spent five seasons in the minor leagues and spent the majority of the 2013 season sleeping on an air mattress in an apartment with five other players. âThatâs everyoneâs dream, to get to the major leagues. But itâs not always going to be like that. Not everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone, but there are a lot of people that depend on it anyway.â Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated to reporters in July that additional regulation could ultimately lead to smaller minor league rosters or fewer teams. The lawsuit has nonetheless turned a spotlight on a shadowy corner of a game in which players routinely put in 60-hour work weeks and face continual personal and professional obstacles in the name of chasing a dream. Athletes from Latin America are particularly at risk. Many come to the United States from impoverished backgrounds with little or no knowledge of English, and lack both the cultural understanding of life in the country and network of family and friends that can help ease the burden. They are guaranteed a salary, health insurance and not much else. But there are reasons they keep playing: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershawâs $33.8 million annual salary is the gameâs richest, and the average major league player earns $4.4 million per season. When the GreenJacketsâ season began, their highest salary belonged to Adam Sonabend, an undrafted 24-year-old catcher. His biweekly paycheck, after taxes, is $671. Thatâs enough for Sonabend to have his own bedroom, which is more than his three roommates can say. GreenJackets pitchers Michael Connolly and Jake McCasland share a room, and ParÃ© sleeps on a mattress on the dining room floor. Before heading home on this July night, ParÃ© loaded a serving bin with chicken thighs and vegetarian lasagna; Nichols encouraged him to take as much as he wants. At nearly midnight, ParÃ© finally headed for the clubhouse door, carrying his bounty with both hands. Only enough to eat Barb Rothstein used to stay up late after her husband went to bed, opening beers and listening to the young menâs stories. Barb and Bob invited the first of the players on the Norwich Navigators, at the time a New York Yankees Class AA affiliate, to live rent-free in their Connecticut basement in 1996. Two years later, after visiting a few Latin American prospectsâ apartment shocking for both its grime and the landlordâs price gouging, there were a dozen players and two wives spread through the house on futons, a mattress in their living room, sharing a room with their son. âIâm not the warm and fuzzy type,â Barb would say much later. âBut there was something about their living situations that I just couldnât stand.â Some of the tales common on the minor league circuit are amusing: how smaller prospects sometimes climb into the team busâs luggage bin to sleep, the way a good meal on the road is a jug of peanut butter before flies or sweaty fingers contaminate it, that it was a good bet the teamâs bat boys were paid more per hour than the players. âI would be very confident to say that anyone working in that stadium was making more than we were, no matter what job they had,â said Brett Newsome, a former Nationals farmhand and one of dozens of current and former minor leaguers interviewed for this story. Newsome is among the co-plaintiffs in the lawsuit against MLB. Players travel with air mattresses, sometimes the only constant in a life of change, and essentials arenât easy to come by. One former first-round draft pick said teammates often asked him to âover-orderâ baseball equipment from sponsors and distribute the extras within the clubhouse. Luxuries are even rarer: A trick known throughout the minors is to buy a television from Walmart, use its box as a stand and return the TV on the 89th day of a 90-day return policy for a refund. Other stories are sad. Many of the Dominican players had been discovered in their early teens by buscÃ³nes, or searchers, the unlicensed scouts who work on commission and compel young and hopeful athletes to abandon their educations to play baseball full-time. The controversial system, in which players guarantee the buscÃ³n up to half of any future signing bonus in exchange for exposure to major league teams, is an inexpensive way for franchises to expand their scouting networks and for poverty-stricken families to go all-in on a high-risk gambit. If a player does eventually sign, he is sent to some faraway outpost to begin the climb through baseballâs ranks. From there they attempt to gain footing in a new culture and are taught to play ball without complaints while nonetheless sending portions of their meager earnings to their families back home. Difo said he made between $400 and $500 every two weeks â or, he said in Spanish, âonly enough to eatâ after sending his mother a couple hundred dollars from each paycheck â until his salary multiplied six-fold when he was added in 2014 to the Nationalsâ 40-man roster. Another former player, the Venezuela-born pitcher Jose Mejias, signed with the Philadelphia Phillies at age 16 and spoke so little English he only felt comfortable communicating with hand gestures. After a few months, teammates started calling him âEl Mudo,â or The Mute. John Wesley, a former minor league player and pitching coach, said he used to sneak water to Dominican players because their apartmentâs tap output was brown and the young men could not spare $1.50 for a bottle. âThese poor kids,â said Wesley, who coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system. âItâs a pyramid scam: Everything goes to the top. Nothing comes down.â The Rothsteins, one of many host families who offer housing to minor leaguers, fit dozens of players in their 2,000-square foot house until a few years ago. Barb said they came to love their guests, and when one player moved up the ladder or gave up the dream, another took his place. In 2008, after the Giants took over the Norwich team, a tall 24-year-old pitcher named Garrett Broshuis moved in. He was from small-town Missouri and bookish, and like Barb, he too collected stories. Every once in a while, as he and Barb shared a few of their favorites, heâd wonder aloud if the system would ever change. Challenging a system Broshuisâs office window overlooks downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River, a wall decorated with reminders of an old life and a new one: his rookie card next to his admittance to the Missouri Bar Association. âI still love the game,â Broshuis said, though a decade after signing a contract to play professional baseball, he was declaring war on it. In February 2014, he filed the lawsuit against MLB, its 30 franchises and former Commissioner Bud Selig. In it, he referred to the league as a âcartel.â A former all-American at Missouri, he had tried, years earlier, to keep quiet and play. When a group of fans in Norwich watched him push-start the broken-down pickup he shared with a teammate, he shook it off as paying his dues. When he invited his then-girlfriend to his meager apartment, finding a room flooded by a neighborâs toilet upstairs, he assured himself brighter days awaited. He chronicled his experiences in articles for the Sporting News, though he squashed the grittier anecdotes and submitted the entries to the Giants for approval. But as the years passed, the stories ate away at his resolve: the Venezuelan teammate who struggled each month to send $20 back home to his pregnant girlfriend, the young pitchers worrying each month about how theyâd pay their student loans. He was told by team officials that he was lucky to play, that the system had been in place for decades, that if he wanted to make more money, he should get better. Four days after his final game in 2009, he took the Law School Admission Test and was later accepted into Saint Louis Universityâs law school. He spoke with professors about a long-term plan to challenge a system that succeeded in part because the hopeful and desperate athletes continued to accept it for one prevailing reason: They always had. MLB filed an answer to the suit last year, denying the allegations in Broshuisâ complaint. A league spokesman declined an interview request for this story, referring the Washington Post to a June statement comparing players to âartists, musicians and other creative professionals who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act.â âLike those professionals,â the MLB statement went on, âit is simply impractical to treat professional athletes as hourly employees.â Ways to cut costs ParÃ© was on his 38th consecutive hour awake â games on consecutive nights and in stadiums 426 miles apart, one pitch to the head in the first one, a nine-hour bus ride in which he wasnât allowed to sleep because he was being evaluated for a possible concussion â and now it was approaching midnight. He put the leftover chicken and lasagna into the fridge, and when he opened the sliding pantry door it fell off the track. âBelieve it or not,â he said of the apartment, âthe last place was worse.â In this complex west of town, roughly 10 units are filled â packed, in some cases â with GreenJackets players and coaches. In here, the air conditioning rumbles and the front door must be slammed to close; ParÃ© sat on carpet singed in places by a previous tenant, examining the lens on his video camera. All four players in this second-floor apartment hold second jobs at least part of the year. Connolly works construction during offseasons, McCasland is a substitute teacher and Sonabend spends part of the morning hours organizing online inventory for a pharmaceutical company. None pays especially well, but they provide enough financial oxygen to keep the dream alive. ParÃ© makes YouTube videos that poke fun at the plight of a âhomeless minor leaguer,â a light-hearted look at the lonely hours and inelegant lifestyle the common fan rarely sees. âYou can sponsor a player right now,â he implores viewers in one video inspired by those old âSave the Childrenâ ads. ParÃ© ends most videos by soliciting donations, and a good month â he collected $83 in July â means he doesnât have to negotiate food prices at Waffle House. A 26th-round draft pick out of high school by Houston in 2009, ParÃ© elected to play at Boston College rather than accept the Astrosâ offer, which he said included a $200,000 signing bonus. He tore a meniscus as a sophomore, and scouts never viewed him the same. He wasnât drafted after his junior and senior seasons, but after a tryout in June 2013, the Giants offered him a contract â this one offering $1,000 to sign. He met Sonabend, another undrafted former college catcher, at a voluntary camp last year before spring training. They traded stories and agreed that luck and persistence had led them to the professional ranks. Sonabend reached Class AA Richmond last season, collecting a salary increase because of service time at a higher level, and this spring they were assigned to Augusta. Sonabend and ParÃ© agreed to room together with Connolly and McCasland, collaborating on ways to cut costs: ParÃ© sleeping in the dining room because the other residents pay for the internet, Sonabend buying eggs a few times a week in exchange for use of ParÃ©âs SUV. Evenings are spent at the ballpark or at fan events; ParÃ© has perfected the art of asking boosters for donations. This year the roommates have scored eyedrops, a few jugs of coffee, laundry detergent, a sofa and a potholder set. As Friday turned to Saturday, ParÃ© not yet able to wind down, Connolly and McCasland came in through the front door and one of them wrestled it closed. âI brought lasagna!â ParÃ© announced, but his roommates had stopped at a restaurant on the way home. Connolly wished he had known. âThat couldâve saved me some bucks,â the 24-year-old pitcher said. ParÃ© returned his attention to the camera, a few ideas in mind for new videos, and Connolly approached the pantry. The door again fell off the track, and Connolly slammed it. âThis whole place is a joke,â he said, and all ParÃ© could do was laugh. Waiting for the phone to ring ParÃ© was living rent-free in a cousinâs spare bedroom last fall when the email arrived: âThe purpose of this Notice,â it read, âis to inform you of the existence of a collective action lawsuit against Major League Baseball.â A group of former minor leaguers had formed a movement against the league, and hundreds more were adding their names. He thought about it and talked to people he trusted. He read articles about the attorney who had once played for the same organization now leading a charge against MLB. ParÃ© wondered if, like the 1968 uprising that ultimately led to free agency, a victory here would be good for the game. And in the end, he couldnât be certain it would. He believed the Giants (who through a spokeswoman declined to comment for this article) and MLB had, all told, been good to him. Around 2,300 current and former players would opt-in on the suit, but ParÃ© would not be one of them. He didnât want to take a side. He reported for spring training last February, reconnecting with Sonabend and Connolly, who also received the email but refused to add their names. âIf I signed it,â Connolly said, âit would almost be like me not appreciating the opportunity.â Sonabend saw it similarly. âI knew what I was getting into,â he said, âand I worked for it anyway.â Last month, a California magistrate judge stripped the suit of its conditional class-action status. A setback, Broshuis admitted, but earlier this month the same judge granted a request to reconsider the class certification; a hearing is scheduled for Dec. 2. For now, Broshuis and the 41 co-plaintiffs wait, and for different reasons so do the young men in the apartment in west Augusta: ParÃ© increasingly realistic about his baseball fate, Sonabend seeing how a former baseball castaway can climb, Connolly defiantly hopeful that the phone will someday ring, a voice on the other end inviting him to a higher level in the game and a better lifestyle. âItâs only going to be a couple years and you filter out,â Connolly said, âor you get that paycheck everybody dreams about.â Published: Sept. 4, 2016, 10:22 p.m.Â  Tags: baseball, minor leagues Click here to comment on this story Â» â Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER 1 of 14 KeiLi Harmston's outfit is punctuated with a backpack featuring a Parisian puppy. âWe own a Jack Russell beagle,â she said. âHe's a pretty good jumper. I like dogs of all kinds. I'll probably be a vet. The backpack came from Target and I suppose it cost 15 dollars.â BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER 1 of 14 Madison Morrill figures that someday she'll ride horses in a rodeo. I usually ride Holly or Maggie at camp. Her dress and vest are from Target. "I got the boots at Justice. I think that they cost about $200 dollars."

My haircut is new, and this shirt has a pocket that I can put my money in. I have $26.â BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER 1 of 14 Amber Palmer's cowgirl boots are new. âThey cost 25 dollars.

I like the jewel on the front of my dress.â BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER 1 of 14 Gideon Buinicky said that all of his clothes are new on the first day of school. "This is a plaided shirt and the shorts have lots of pockets to carry toys. Mom got them at Walmart." Gideon was most excited about his shoes, however. "These Skechers have memory foam so I'll probably be able to run faster this year." BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER 1 of 14 Star Wars fan Aryck Marquez got a bag imprinted with the BB-8, Poe Dameron's loyal droid. "My mom got it at the mall. It think it cost about $40."

"But my favorite color is green," she said. BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER 1 of 14 Local clothing companies RVCA and Volcom dominated the t-shirt landscape at Arovista. Landen Templeton's RVCA shirt accentuated his teal shorts. "I think it cost $26 at Tilly's". We asked Landen what "RVCA" means. "Hmmm...Rutabagas in Vans keep California Active." Close. The combination of Greek and Latin letters translate into "clothing." RVCA is pronounced "Ruca" - Latino slang for girlfriend. BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER 1 of 14 Priscilla Murillo got the skirt and dress at Target and the shoes at Walmart. Her outfit features characters from Shopkins toys.

The Justice stores for girls have edged ahead of Target and Walmart as the place to get cool school clothes. However, the Target Dog still wears the crown for boysâ clothing. Street Style visited third-graders on the first day of school at Arovista Elementary in Brea to see what they were wearing to begin the year. Local shirt companies Volcom and RVCA have left Hollister in the dust. Puppies adorn the book bags for girls. For the boys, âStar Warsâ and camouflage reign.

Hanjin is responsible for about 7.8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market, according to the letter. The South Korea-based Hanjin filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, prompting terminal operators, truckers and others to stop handling the companyâs cargo for fear of not getting paid. On the one hand, experts say bigger problems could be avoided. The South Korean government is encouraging Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. to purchase parts of Hanjin, which could resolve any shipping issues before the all-important holiday shopping season gets fully underway. However, there are no guarantees that plan will work, which could stifle sales at the most important point in the year for U.S. retailers. Among the retailers that could be most impacted by the Hanjin bankruptcy are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.47% , Target Corp. TGT, +0.33% J.C. Penney Co Inc. and other clothing retailers that are already facing issues, from competition with e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. to a shift in purchasing from âstuffâ to âexperiences.â âFrom a retail perspective Iâd look beyond the âmy box of sweaters is stuck on a boat somewhereâ and focus on the mid-term,â said Christopher Rogers, research analyst at Panjiva, a global trade data and analytics company. âWhile September is a busy season, October is what really matters for the holidays. Arguably thatâs plenty of time for people to make alternative arrangements.â While Rogers says the Hyundai deal can put things âback to normal by next week,â shipping rates have already jumped, âincreasing retailersâ costs immediately.â There are alternatives. There are 17 shipping companies that have at least half the capacity or more of Hanjin, said Rogers. Among those that are bigger, according to shipping industry monitor Alphaliner, are COSCO Container Lines and the operator with the most share of capacity, APM-Maersk. But moving quickly is most important. Retailers have some timing flexibility, according to Brandon Levey, chief executive officer at Stitch Labs, an inventory management software company. âBut itâs usually a matter of weeks,â he said. âIt wouldnât be months because then youâre crossing seasons.â For brands, the situation is even more risky. Money spent on merchandise that languishes on a ship or in a port canât be recouped in sales. Not only does it have an impact now, but could impact inventory planning, according to Levey. âWhen money is tied up in goods that youâre not able to sell, thereâs less money for future seasons,â he said. The National Retail Federation is also thinking long term. âRetailersâ main concern is that there is millions of dollars worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,â said Jonathan Gold, vice president for supply chain and customs policy, in a statement about the Hanjin bankruptcy. âRetailers are working with all of their service providers to find ways to get their cargo moving to ensure that there is no or limited interruption in the supply of merchandise.â The Global Port Tracker, a report published by the NRF and Hackett Associates, forecasts that major U.S. ports will handle 1.61 million twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, of cargo in September, down 0.6% year-over-year. A TEU is a measurement of a shipâs cargo capacity. Last year, a long-term slowdown of dock workers on the West Coast that began in the fall of 2014 led to a significant drop in the amount of cargo coming in and out of ports, Craig Shearman, vice president of government affairs public relations at the NRF, told MarketWatch. The problem was critical enough that the White House got involved. â[T]he low point was 1.2 million containers in February 2015,â said Shearman. âThat was the month an agreement was reached on a new contract. The numbers then soared to 1.73 million containersâan all-time recordâin March 2015 after the backlog was freed up. It took through May 2015 to really work through all of the backup.â Source: MarketWatch 2016-09-05 hellenicshippingnews tweet Share Previous: Olga Caroline Sea trial Next: Brazil oil, gas output rises 6.2 pct in July vs year earlier Related News Oil edges up; strong dollar, OPEC doubts make buyers cautious 07/01/2017 Dollar up as solid U.S. jobs report sets stage for Fed hikes 07/01/2017 MARKETS SNAPSHOT FOR 06/01/17 07/01/2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

USA Update What's the key to preventing train crashes? What's theÂ one thing that traditional retail stores, even discount stores like Walmart, don't want you to know? They're charging way more forÂ tech accessories than they need to. By David Dritsas, Brad's Deals September 4, 2016 Save for later Saved A Walmart store in La Habra, Calif. Jae C. Hong/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of What's theÂ one thing that traditional retail stores, even discount stores like Walmart, don't want you to know? They're charging WAYÂ more forÂ tech accessories than they need to. Typically, stores that sell tech products make very little on big ticket items like HDTVs, and because of this, they price the cables and other accessories at a premium.Â The goal is to get a better profit margin off the accessories by upcharging, making it seem essential and urgent that you buy these things now, and hoping thatÂ you load up on them on your way out the door. As a retail tech expert, I implore you notÂ to fall into this trap. Buying certain kinds of tech accessories in-store is a huge waste of money. Buy online instead and you'll get the same products without the added in-store cost. Here are my picks for six kinds of items to ALWAYS buy online. Recommended: Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Cables Cables are probably the number one item that stores overcharge for. Even before the dawn of the internet,Â savvy tech shoppers knew that you were better off ordering cables from a catalog rather than shelling out too much for them at RadioShack. Whether you are buying a speaker wire, a USB cord, an HDMI cord or Apple lightning cables, you are much better off looking for cable online at sites likeÂ Amazon,Â Newegg, or at low-overhead direct-to-consumer companies likeÂ Monoprice. Test your knowledge Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 01/05 For example, at Monoprice, you can get aÂ 10ft HDMI Cable for $3.99Â (plus around $2 for shipping), which is 50% less than even Amazon for a similar cable.Â The cheapest 10ft cable you can find at Best Buy? $39.99!Â That's a 10x markup for the same product! Phone and tablet cases We know, theÂ sales folks at phone stores are really good at making you feel like you need to have a phone case before you walk out the door, lest you drop and break your new iPhone on your way to the car! But answer me this, has that EVER happened to you? Stay strong, friend. Put your new phone in your bag and leave it un-cased for the time being. You can get one later, for much, much less, online. If you're not picky, you can find tons of generic plastic cases onÂ AmazonÂ andÂ eBay, often for just a few dollars, such as thisÂ non-brand hard case iPhone 6Â for $5.49 shipped. But if you are more discriminating, even top brands can be found on those sites for less. For example, we found thisÂ Mophie Juice Pack Battery Case for Samsung Galaxy S5Â (with a built-in 3,000 mAh Battery) for $19.99 shipped. It costs at least $37 anywhere else. Even brands likeÂ OtterboxÂ andÂ Body GloveÂ sometimes run special discounts on their own direct sales sites that result in lower-than-retail prices. All it takes is a little searching for what you want and you'll save money. Glass screen protectors In the same vein, Brad's Deals blogger Caroline Thompson fell for this trapÂ last year, when she upgraded to anÂ iPhone 6S: "The guy at T-Mobile made it seem like I NEEDED to buy this $39 glass screen protector because, after two years of wear and tear, my previous iPhone had a small crack in the screen. He 'sweetened' the deal by putting the cost of the screen protector on my bill, which was fine until the end of the month, when I had to pay $30 extra on my already pricy phone bill. After about a year, the screen protector was cracked, so I decided to look online for a new one. I found a deal forÂ TWO of these glass screen protectors on Amazon for $7.99, and felt like an idiot for paying 10x more than I needed to the first time." Computer accessories Computers are like cars; once you get one, you realize there are all sorts of other items you need to make it run smoothly. Computer retailers are of course hoping you will buy that stuff from them: don't. Beyond just the markup, there's much more variety in both pricing and brands online. Brand varietyÂ is key. Most brick-in-mortar stores, in an effort to keep inventory manageable, will onlyÂ carryÂ a few of the many good brands out there for things like WiFi routers, modems, or back up drives. If you're notÂ sure about a brand, keep an eye on customer reviews to avoid the lemons. Of course,Â AmazonÂ is a natural online contender and often you will find good prices there. Right now, you canÂ get thisÂ Logitech wireless mouseÂ on Amazon for $12.81, which isÂ more thanÂ 50 percent less than its price any other store. But be careful! Amazon is not always the cheapest. Do your research and check out other online retailers that also carry large selections, such asÂ NeweggÂ andÂ B&H Photo. Oddly enough, evenÂ Staples' weekly deals sectionÂ can have some best of web pricing on computer accessories that they only offer online. For example, this popularÂ Apple Airport Time Capsule 2TB router and backup drive, is, at the the time of this article, $199. That's $75 less than anywhere else online. HDTV screen cleaning kits We can't even begin to tell you how ridiculously overpriced these things are! Do yourself a favor and just make your own. Seriously, it's just 50 percent distilled water (distilled is key) and 50 percent clear white vinegar. That's it. Even Walmart will charge you $9 for just a few measly ounces of the stuff, whereas you can make a gallon for just a few bucks. EvenÂ the cleaning cloths are not special. All you need is a microfiber cleaning cloth, which you may already have on hand, or which you can get in bulk for a as low as $6 and use for a variety of things around the house. Laptop bags and backpacks AÂ good carrying case for your laptop or tablet is a common purchase that everyone has to make at some point. The problem is, the retailers know this. As with computer accessories, the brand selection is lacking and the deals are few and far between when you shop in store.Â This is not so when you shop online. TheÂ deals on these can be in unusual places. For example, this I found thisÂ Samsonite laptop bag on theÂ official Samsonite eBay storeÂ forÂ only $14.99 with free shipping. This would sell for $40 or more anywhere else. Other online stores thatÂ often runÂ great deals on laptop bagsÂ areÂ BuyDig,Â AdoramaÂ andÂ Academy Sports. And all of those stores offer free shipping. This story originally appeared on Brad's Deals.

Now is your chance to share them and get involved in your community. A community workshop for the Russellville Comprehensive Plan -- branded as Reimagine Russellville 2040 -- will begin at 6 p.m. Thursday inside City Hall. James Walden, an urban planning manager with the Garver Team in Little Rock and acting city planner, said the purpose of the meeting is to inform the public about the purpose of the comprehensive plan and get input on the issues facing the community as well as recommendations to address these issues. "The workshop will be a big kickoff for the community," he said. "We went through the Steering Committee and that process. Now it's time to give the people the opportunity to Reimagine Russellville. It's also an opportunity for us to see what some of the issues are facing the community. "Public engagement is extremely important. For this to be an effective plan, we need to know what folks think are the issues. At the same time, it is incredibly powerful in terms of when you have a steering community you have 10-12 people thinking about things. When you get a lot more community engagement, not only do you increase the number of people you are contacting, they are so familiar with so many other parts of the community. It is making sure the plan addresses what the community is facing." Walden said the process of revising Russellville's Comprehensive Master Plan has gone "really well." "We've prepared a map that shows what the lane usage is actually like in the city, where homes are, commercial buildings are, single-family to multi-family units, things like Walmart and other commercial," Walden explained. "We've also taken a look at neighborhood units called character units. We've done a demographic review of the community and have some interesting insights. "We want to get input from the community before we start talking about any future plans. Before we want to do this, we need to do that, and that's very important before we formulate anything. Some of the things we've identified with the demographic review are the fact that the population will reach about 40,000 before 2040. How do we incorporate that future growth within the city to provide jobs for those individuals? How will the economy look in that time frame." Since the steering committee meetings were in May, Walden said his team has researched existing conditions, looked at a demographic profile, conducted a lane-use survey and a neighborhood survey. "A lot of people are interested, and we've gotten good engagement. Those are the critical points, having that interest," he said. "Russellville is at a point right now where people are asking questions and we are one trajectory. Do we want to stay on that same trajectory, or how do we look at what we want for the future. Not that the trajectory is bad, but people are asking, what do we want to be? Where do we want to go?" Walden pointed out that the East Main Street area has a lot different character than what West Main Street does. How they relate to one another is part of the plan. "We'll also look at are some of these areas and potentially at how these areas will transform, how that relates to the surrounding neighborhood," he said. "If the project is that the city will grow to 40,000 by 2040, there must be an understanding of transportation, an understanding of issues that will exist for connectivity, bicycles, walking and lane usage." Another thing Walden said he noticed is that Russellville's daytime population is about 40,000, with a nighttime population of over 28,000. Pope County's entire population is 62,000, he said. "During the community workshop, we want to understand what issues are within the community, what challenges we are going to face within the next 25 years, what issues are looming on the horizon we need to do something about, and what are some things that folks would like to see? What direction would they like to head?" he said. "The primary focus will be about issues -- what the future vision of the community needs to be." If for some reason you cannot attend Thursday's community workshop, there is another way residents can give feedback about the future of Russellville. Go online to the website russellville.planyourcity.com, which Walden called a portal that can be used for feedback. It includes an application where you can take a photo on a map of the city and describe what you think is good or bad about a particular place or what could be fixed. "Someone has already gone on there and had a comment about sidewalks on South Knoxville," he said. Copyright 2017 The Courier - Your Messenger for the River Valley. All rights reserved.

Myrtle Beach police responded to the Wal-Mart store at 541 Seaboard St. Saturday afternoon to find 20-year-old Kelsey Samantha Crowe detained in the storeâs loss prevention office. The department storeâs security guard told officers he watched Crowe take items from the health and beauty section to the menâs clothing section where the guard says she concealed the items in her purse. Crowe told police her sister had escaped detection from a similar, previous theft âso she thought she would try it,â according to the incident report.

By Nick Sambides Jr., BDN Staff Follow on Twitter Find on Facebook Posted Sept. 04, 2016, at 10:29 a.m. Last modified Sept. 05, 2016, at 6:42 p.m. MILLINOCKET, Maine â Sean DeWitt recognizes that a developer would probably be crazy to buy the former Millerâs Department Store building on Penobscot Avenue. And thatâs precisely why he wants to do it. The buildingâs first floor is partly collapsed and other parts resemble small ocean waves. Roof leaks have created mildew and mold issues. The basement floods, the plumbing is backed up and pigeons who apparently donât care much about sanitation live on the second floor, DeWitt said. But DeWitt is far from crazy. The president of Our Katahdin, a local nonprofit volunteer community and economic development group, said the organization plans to buy the tax-acquired building from the town for $2,000 to raze or revitalize because group members figure that the building is so decrepit no one else will touch it. âWe went looking for the worst building we could find,â DeWitt said. The store was the Katahdin regionâs last large retail clothing and electronics store that shuttered in March 2008 after poor sales forced its closure. Located at 230 Penobscot Ave., Millerâs was junior in size only to Wal-Mart in Lincoln about 30 miles south. Since then, the building has remained vacant. Our Katahdin will use grant money and fundraisers to pay for the revitalization, DeWitt said. Maine Department of Environmental Protection workers have begun hazardous materials assessments of the property that will be ready in a month. âWe want to try to apply the same methodology to this building that we apply to our projects. The buildingâs has been sitting there since 2008,â DeWitt said. âWe said, what if we were able to get everyone around the table to see what this could be?â Our Katahdin members would like to rebuild on the site rather than leave it empty. Such a large empty space within the first block of Penobscot Avenue, one of the townâs main thoroughfares, âwould be a gap toothed grin for the downtown. We canât have it,â DeWitt said. Town Councilor Jesse Dumais applauded the groupâs plans. âI think they are attempting to do great work,â Dumais said Saturday. âI think the struggle that a lot of businesses have in Millinocket is that a lot of business space needs work done to it before anybody can move into it.â DeWitt helped launch OurKatahdin.com, the nonprofitâs website, in December 2014. Since then, the group has raised $28,185 that has helped finish 18 community development projects, according to its website. The finished projects include the creation of an investment portfolio, the funding of a Millinocket fireworks show and East Millinocketâs SummerFest in 2015, repair of Millinocketâs downtown gazebo, the revitalization of Hillcrest Park and the purchase and placement of economic development signs and banners, according to its website. Volunteer groups have done most of the townâs economic development revitalization work, but the Town Council supports that work, and it also has been lending a hand. Councilor Charles Pray and Town Manager John Davis met last month with federal officials under an initiative begun by independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and supported by Republicans U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin. The meeting with the U.S. Economic Development Assessment team went well, Pray and Davis told councilors during their Aug. 25 meeting. The team arose from Kingâs persuading federal officials to treat the dissipation of northern Maineâs paper industries like a natural disaster. The team met with leaders from across northern Maine as part of an effort to focus economic development and relief efforts. State officials hope the work will lead to millions of dollars of economic aid coming to northern Maine. Meanwhile, Our Katahdin hopes to close on the sale of the Miller building Sept. 9, DeWitt said. Anyone interested in volunteering or donating money to the Our Katahdin group should visit its website, ourkatahdin.com.

BUSINESS Our long stagnant-paycheck nightmare may finally be nearing an end Starbucks workers Ted S. Warren / Associated Press Starbucks workers prepare coffee during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle in March. Starbucks workers prepare coffee during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle in March. (Ted S. Warren / Associated Press) Jim Puzzanghera For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the Great Recession hasÂ arrivedÂ every week or two for yearsÂ â in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has plagued the recovery, with many workers seeing few if any raises as they struggle to make ends meet. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurringÂ solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures,Â amplified byÂ laws providing significant minimum-wage hikes in California, New York and elsewhere, alsoÂ are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such asÂ Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonaldâs and JPMorgan Chase increased what theyÂ pay their lowest-levelÂ employees. A pay increase is the right thing to do. â JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon âA pay increase is the right thing to do,âÂ JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently inÂ announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers,Â customer service representatives and other employeesÂ to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the currentÂ $10.15. âWages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,â he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated fromÂ the presidential campaigns ofÂ Republicans and DemocratsÂ as stagnating incomesÂ have fueled voter frustration about the economy.Â  When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available,Â from $57,724 in 2000. âHousehold incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,â Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. âThink of it â¦ you're making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.â Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is theÂ loss of bargaining power caused by aÂ drop in the share of private-sectorÂ unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. California's job growth continues in July, but unemployment rises Natalie Kitroeff California again put up solid employment numbers in July, adding 36,400 new positionsÂ in a month that also brought stellar job news for the nation overall.Â  But the stateâsÂ unemployment rate went up for the second month in a row, rising to 5.5% in July from 5.4% in June, according to state data... California again put up solid employment numbers in July, adding 36,400 new positionsÂ in a month that also brought stellar job news for the nation overall.Â  But the stateâsÂ unemployment rate went up for the second month in a row, rising to 5.5% in July from 5.4% in June, according to state data... (Natalie Kitroeff) As a result, the share of money flowing into householdsÂ from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest andÂ dividends, according to a studyÂ last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes,Â further stiflingÂ overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth,Â job openings are near record levels. That's forced employers to hike pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4% for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall -- they actually reached a seven-year high ofÂ 2.7% year-over-year in JulyÂ âÂ an improvement from the tepid 2% level during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1%, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workersâ purchasing power. âWe have turned the corner, and today the wage gains that are happening are far in excess of inflation,â said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at recruiting website Glassdoor. âAs long as we keep seeing steady job gains in the monthly jobs report and near-record job openings, itâs inevitable weâre going to see wage growth pick up,â he said.

It's snowing in the Sierra. It started snowing Jan. 4, and you can already see what Mother Nature has wrought. Chamberlain said Glassdoor data show that competition for workers has pushed wage growth up sharply for some skilled professions. Pay for business system analystsÂ is up about 10% compared with a year ago, while sales consultants saw a 7% gain andÂ pharmacy technicians 6%. Many of those sales consultants are in the technology industry, which saw average wages rise 3.6% last yearÂ in the 10 top markets, including Silicon Valley, Seattle, New York City and Los Angeles, according to a report from financial and professional services firmÂ JLL. The burgeoning Los Angeles tech industry showed the biggest increase in average annual payÂ â 13.2%, to $114,540, which includes benefits and stock options.Â  In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that the wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce.Â  From 2010-13, newÂ jobs that paidÂ between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions,Â according to research released recentlyÂ by theÂ Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Â  But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs inÂ fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. âThe tide has begun to turn,â William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in unveiling the study. âFor the first time in quite a while, gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.â But economists said thereâs still a long way to go to get wages growing atÂ a level to reverse the damage to household incomes from the recession. âWage growth is picking up, but itâs stillÂ below what youâd expect in a well-functioning economy,â said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodyâs Analytics. That level is aboutÂ 3.5% a year.Â If the labor market continues to improve, the economy should start producing those types of wage gains in 2017, he said.Â  âThatâs been the missing ingredient, the last step in the jobs recovery,â Zandi said. Some states and localitiesÂ have tried to accelerate that wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasnât budgedÂ since 2009.Â  In April, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hourÂ by 2022. On the same day, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region â faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas â and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. See the most-read stories in Business this hour Â» As the states with the nationâs largest and third-largest populations moved to increase theirÂ minimum wages, large companies realized that theyâd soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. âWe certainly are mindful of wage increases in variousÂ states throughout the country,â McDonaldâs chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan told investors during an earnings call in JulyÂ  âIt has,Â from a purely businessÂ standpoint,Â created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,â said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage.Â  âA lotÂ of companies â¦ were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,â she said. Early last year, Wal-Mart becameÂ the first major employer to announce raises for its lowest-paid workers. It now pays them at least $10 an hour once they finish the companyâs training program. Wal-Mart is spending $2.7 billion over two years to increase pay, bringing the average full-timeÂ hourly rate for its workers to $13.38.

We have eight employees:Â two office workers, two groundskeepers, two maintenance personnelÂ and two security guards. No one has complained about their hourly pay, which has been the bare minimum. Instead, they seem pleased that they... (Donie Vanitzian) Brett Biggs, the companyâs chief financial officer, predicted the investment âwill pay off long-term.â âWhether it's lower attrition rates in the stores, better motivated associates, we think we'll see the benefits from that,â he told an investor conference in June. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz cited similar reasons afterÂ announcing this summer that the company would raise base pay for its workers by at least 5% in October. The companyâs baristas earn an average of about $9.40 an hour, according to Glassdoor.Â  âWhat we want to try and doÂ is really get aheadÂ of anyÂ federalÂ orÂ state mandateÂ to be the employer of choice,â Schultz told analystsÂ on an earnings call in July. After saying last year that he opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage, Trump this summer said he thought it should be raised to at least $10.Â The Democratic Partyâs official platform calls for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. âRaising the federal minimum wage won't just put more money in the pockets of low-income families, it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods,â Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told a Michigan crowd last month. âWe need to get incomes and wages rising, and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer.â jim.puzzanghera@latimes.com Follow @JimPuzzanghera on Twitter MORE BUSINESS NEWS SpaceX rocket exploded in an instant.

The plans Oldacre presented include the construction of two roundabouts, one between Chick-fil-A and Wal-Mart and the other at the Hobby Lobby entrance to the property, and the creation of a road within the parking lot to connect the roundabouts andÂ improve traffic flow. The western entrance will also be redesigned. âThis is too nice a property. Itâs got real good bones ... Thereâs no reason it canât be significantly improved,â Oldacre said. Oldacre said the development firm also plans to construct several new retail spaces: 150,000 square feet of anchor retail space on the west end of the property, located in the city of Birmingham; three smaller buildings constructed on existing parking spaces; and a retail site replacing the vacant Outback Steakhouse location. The firm is in talks with national retailers for these new spaces, Oldacre said, as well as existing vacant spots and the OfficeMax, which is planned to close. Other changes include new monument signs, additional lighting, new paint, landscaping and metal awnings to replace the current fabric ones. Oldacre said he watched the property for many years and felt that its location gave it a lot of potential, but access problems and appearances made it less successful than he feels if could be. He pointed out that thousands of cars pass by the shopping center every day on Lakeshore Parkway and I-65. The incentive Oldacre McDonald is asking for is to split additional sales tax revenue (defined as any increase beyond current sales tax levels) for up to 10 years or $5 million in total. If the council agrees to the proposed incentives, Oldacre said construction would begin before the end of 2016 and the first of the retailers in the new spots could open up by summer 2017, with the larger anchor spots to follow. Mayor Scott McBrayer and several council members expressed their support of the development plans. The finance committee will review the proposal and discuss it further at their next meeting. At the council meeting later on Aug. 8, the council also: âº Changed its next meeting from Aug. 22 to Aug. 29. âº Decided to ask for public comment at their Aug. 29 meeting about proposed changes to the Neighborhood Preservation District zoning ordinance about roof heights. The city has already held an official public hearing, but decided to set a time for additional comments due to homeowner concerns. âº Approved funding $54,000 to conduct a citywide master plan. âº Approved funding $1,000 to purchase an ad in the Annual Birmingham Bowl official fan guide. âº Amended the ordinance appointing municipal election poll workers due to changes in the list of workers. âº Approved road closures at Brookwood Village from 1 to 10 p.m. on Sept 22 and 29 for the Brookwood Live Concert Series. âº Approved the acceptance of the Champions ADECA Grant for the Homewood Board of Education. âº Carried over discussion of a $353,000 FEMA SAFER grant to fund the creation of three new firefighter positions for two years. Fire Chief John Bresnan said the grant does not come with obligations to maintain the positions after those two years, but will allow the department to have 17 people on duty for each shift instead of 16. Along with the recent construction of a training center, Bresnan said itâs possible the department could be evaluated for a better ISO rating, decreasing home insurance rates. The council voted to further discuss some questions about the grant at its next meeting before accepting it. âº Set a Sept. 12 public hearing for a rezoning application at 822 Columbiana Road, where the owner wants to construct four residential townhomes. âº Set a bid opening date for Sept. 19 for citywide paving projects.

Residents look at a display of the proposed Interstate 65/Lakeshore Parkway intersection as a Volkert representative, center, describes the planâs details. Homewood residents were invited to Second Presbyterian Church on Aug. 18 for a public involvement meeting on potential Interstate 65/Lakeshore Parkway intersection modifications. The proposed change would be a diverging diamond interchange, meaning there is a brief part of the road where lanes cross over and drive on the opposite side of the road. This type of intersection is intended to help reduce congestion and delays, said Alabama Department of Transportation region engineer DeJarvis Leonard. âBy doing a divergingÂ diamond, we allow the ramps to free-flow,â Leonard said. Changes which would take place in this project include: âº Removal of the existing southbound ramp for I-65 and building a new ramp âº A single left turn lane from eastbound Lakeshore Parkway to Wildwood Parkway âº Right-in and right-out access at the shopping center with Wal-Mart and Samâs Club âº A westbound Lakeshore Parkway auxiliary lane between I-65 southbound ramps and Wildwood Parkway âº An eastbound Lakeshore Parkway auxiliary lane between Wildwood Parkway and I-65 southbound ramps Plans also include a sidewalk that travels through the middle of the interchange, with plans to connect to the Shades Creek Greenway. Leonard said he has heard positive reactions to the interchange, especially from individuals who have seen these interchanges at work in neighboring states, and that if plans and funding are approved for the project, it would be the first diverging diamond interchange in the state. âHomewood was innovative about wanting to introduce this design,â he said. Greg Cobb of the Homewood department of engineering, planning and zoning said he believes it will make the intersection more efficient. âItâs going to be great,â he said. âThey canât build it fast enough to suit me.â Most of the work would be done in the current right-of-way, excepting a small triangle of right-of-way â located off of the Samâs Club parking lot â that will need to be purchased. This, however, will not affect any parking at the Samâs Club, and the project will not impact local residential areas. Some residents attended the public involvement meeting with concerns that their homes or their land would be affected. Lakeview Estates resident Jennifer Caldwell said she attended because she thought it might encroach more on the residential areas. After seeing the plans, however, she said those concerns were alleviated. âItâs not going to encroach like I thought,â she said. The new interchange, Caldwell said, seemed like it would be good for traffic flow and make the intersection easier to navigate. A few concerns she had, however, included the potential danger of the sidewalk. While a sidewalk would make a good addition, she said she would prefer to see a crossover where the sidewalk intersects with the interstate ramps, rather than the current plan where pedestrians walk across a lane of traffic. Caldwell also said she hopes to see a plan for the open area which will be left when the southbound ramp is removed. Landscaping in the area would be a good improvement, she said. This was the first public involvement meeting regarding the project, and Leonard said final plans should be available in a year. At this time, however, funding wouldnât be available until 2020. âIf theyâre going to do it, Iâd rather them go ahead and do it,â Caldwell said, noting that 2020 seemed a long way off. Â  Once construction starts, the project would take between nine months and a year to complete. Residents are encouraged to submit their comments or concerns about the project by Wednesday, Sept. 7.

See Offers Opinion Posted September 4, 2016 increase font size Commentary: Research shows recyclingâs not very manly Men tend to 'avoid or even oppose green behaviors in order to safeguard their gender identity,' a University of Notre Dame study finds. By Danielle Paquette The Washington Post Share Comment Read Article Researchers have known for decades that women tend to beat men on environmental metrics. They generally use less fuel and energy. They eat less meat. Theyâre more concerned about climate change. James Wilkie, a business professor at the University of Notre Dame, wanted to understand what drives this gender eco-friendliness gap. After years of exploring psychological bias, he and his colleagues developed a theory. Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store â âMenâs resistance may stem in part from a prevalent association between the concepts of greenness and femininity and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are feminine,â they assert this month in the Journal of Consumer Research. âAs a result of this stereotype, men may be motivated to avoid or even oppose green behaviors in order to safeguard their gender identity.â The researchers conducted a set of experiments, each designed to gauge if we actually do ascribe gender to green products and whether such perceptions impact our willingness to use them. They found people consistently connect environmentally conscious goods to their idea of femininity. The first survey of 127 college students asked respondents if they thought green products appeared masculine, feminine or neither. Most participants, both men and women, said items designed to protect the planet seemed feminine. Another group of 194 students took an online quiz instructing them to imagine two grocery store shoppers, one carrying a green reusable bag and another toting a plastic sack. The quiz asked: Which seemed more eco-friendly, wasteful, masculine and/or feminine? The green shoppers seemed to respondents more eco-friendly and feminine, regardless of their gender. The plastic shoppers came off as more wasteful and masculine. The researchers next gave a group of men phony gift cards and told them to pick from a selection of batteries, which included a green option. In both a faux Walmart and an online shopping scenario, the men avoided the green choice. âSelf-perceptions of femininity suggest that threats may also influence private behavior,â the authors wrote. Wilkieâs team also found men in the studies were more likely to donate to an environmental nonprofit group that had a âmasculineâ logo â one with darker colors and bold fonts â than to an organization that displayed lighter tones and âfrillyâ letters. Logos didnât have an impact on where women said theyâd want to donate. A similar trend emerged in an experiment at a BMW dealership. When presented with two versions of the same âgreenâ car, men favored the one called the âProtection Modelâ over the âEco-friendly Model.â Women, meanwhile, werenât particularly swayed by either title. âStereotypical feminine behavior and attitudes are more in parallel with taking care of the environment,â Wilkie said of the findings. âMale traits tend to conflict with this idea of maintaining a nice environment for other people.â Wilkie blames stereotypes. People who care about the environment are perceived as nurturing, gentle caretakers. Pop culture says theyâre barefoot hippies with long hair and flower crowns. That image clashes with traditional masculinity. Previous research, Wilkie noted, suggests that men are socially penalized more for breaking gender norms when it comes to the products they use â or even the drinks they order. âIf a man at a bar were to order a girlie drink, he might get some looks,â Wilkie said. âHe might get some snickers. He might even get into a fight.â A woman requesting something that reads masculine, such as, say, a whiskey on the rocks, probably wouldnât encounter that problem. âSome people might even be impressed,â he said. Carrie Preston, director of the Womenâs, Gender and Sexuality Program at Boston University, said itâs concerning that feminine-seeming goods or actions repel some men. âThat says whatâs feminine is bad, is lesser, is second class,â she said. âAlthough menâs and womenâs roles have changed significantly, masculinity hasnât changed as much.â Caring about what people think of your drink choice or grocery bag may seem silly. Thereâs nothing inherently feminine about recycling, and some would argue that femininity itself (and how itâs marketed) is a cultural creation. Still, a 2011 survey from the global marketing firm Ogilvy and Mather found 82 percent of adults in a nationally representative sample said âgoing greenâ is more ladylike than manly. Marketers are unlikely to shatter gender expectations overnight â or nix the belief that feminine is lesser â but a packaging or messaging tweak could draw more men to the green movement. âDespite a prevalent stereotype that green consumers are more feminine than non-green consumers,â the researchers wrote, âwe show that menâs inhibitions about engaging in green behavior can be mitigated through masculine affirmation and masculine branding.â Danielle Paquette is a reporter who covers the intersection of people and policy.

Once again, resale sites have reported a surge in trade-ins of old iPhones ahead of the announcement. Though prices offered for trade-ins will start dropping closer to the big day, consumers can still lock in high enough prices to break even â or earn a profit â by trading in their old gadget and upgrading to a new phone. The iPhone 7 16-gigabyte version will likely cost around $22 a month on a two-year contract, depending on the carrier, $199 with a two-year wireless contract for the same version or $299 for a 64-gigabyte version, in-line with previous iPhone launches, experts say. With most offers, itâs possible to sell an old iPhone to a resale site or online retailer for more than the cost of the new phone, although you will need to sign a two-year contract. And note that those who bought an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus last year and still have time left on their current contract would likely have to pay an early termination fee. The resale market became more lucrative for consumers with the added competition last year after Apple (AAPL)Â  and Wal-Mart (WMT)Â entered. Resale site Glyde offers $409 for a 16-gigabye iPhone 6S (or $326 for a 6) and $447 for a larger 6S Plus (or $355 for a 6 Plus). Another such site NextWorth offers up to $350 for the 16-gigabye 6S in pristine condition (or $245 for a Plus), and up to $364 for the 6S Plus with the same memory (or $285 for a 6 Plus). And rival Gazelle offers up to $300 for the 16-gigabye iPhone 6S and up to $200 for the iPhone 6 (and a maximum of $325 for the 6S Plus).

For gift cards only, Amazon (AMZN)Â  will give you around $331 for a 16-gigabye iPhone 6S or $400 for a 6S Plus, while Apple will give you up to $225 for an iPhone 6 and $250 for an iPhone 6 Plus (Apple doesnât currently offer trade-ins for the 6S models online). At Walmart stores, the value for an iPhone 6S 16-gigabye is roughly $275 to $300, depending on the carrier; for the 6S Plus, a 16-gigabye has a trade-in value of $325 to $350. âWe expect around a 15% decline in pricing for old iPhone models around the expected September launch,â says Glyde spokesman Matthew Reardon. âIf people have a replacement phone they can use between now and the launch, itâs a great time to sell.â But for consumers who have second thoughts about upgrading, some resale sites allow you to hang on to your phone after agreeing to a trade-in deal. NextWorth gives customers a 30-day grace period between signing a contract and handing over their phone; resale site Gazelle offers a 45-day grace period. (Glyde has no grace period as itâs a peer-to-peer seller.) See also:Â This isnât a normal iPhone upgrade â and Apple will be just fine Analysts predict that the new iPhone 7 will still come in two screen sizes â 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches in width to compete with the larger Androids â and possibly come without a headphone jack, have a significantly improved camera and may even be waterproof (for those who have dropped their previous phones in the pool or the toilet bowl) and may even ditch the 16 gigabyte version, as apps and photos eat up memory on the device. (Apple did not respond to request for comment.) As Appleâs new-device releases become more frequent, the company must work harder to convince people to upgrade each year, says Brian Colello, technology analyst at research firm Morningstar. While the smartphone market is getting saturated in the U.S., the iPhone 7 will likely have a big impact, analysts say. A lot of shoppers have been waiting for Apple to deliver a bigger screen and that alone will spur an impressive upgrade cycle. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook is hoping that the upgrades and fanfare surrounding the iPhone 7 upgrade will put pressure on Samsung. Thus far, resale sites have been reporting a surge of trade-ins for all of the most recent models. Resale site Decluttr.com says there has been 73% increase in sales in the past month alone, and is predicting an influx of iPhone 6 and 6s models following Appleâs press conference on Wednesday.

They donât have a lot of time. Giant container ships from the South Korean-based Hanjin shipping line are marooned with their cargo of what experts say are TVs, printers, home furnishings and clothing. Hanjin, the worldâs seventh-largest container shipper, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. Ships from China to Canada were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. Itâs also been a factor in shipping rates rising and could hurt some trucking firms with contracts to pick up goods. The South Korean giant represents nearly 8 percent of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the U.S. market. While some retailers may already have merchandise for the holiday season affected, experts say whatâs most important is that the issue be resolved before the critical shipping month of October. âRetailers always have robust contingency plans, but this degree of uncertainty is making it challenging to put those plans in place,â said Jessica Dankert, senior director of retail operations for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade alliance with members including companies like Best Buy, Walmart and Target. J.C. Penney said Hanjin is one of several ocean freight carriers that it uses and when it learned there might be an issue it began to divert and reroute its containers. It said it uses âa variety of transportation methods and portsâ and right now does not expect a significant effect on the flow of merchandise. Target Corp. said it is watching the situation closely and Walmart said it is waiting for details about Hanjinâs bankruptcy proceedings and the implications to its merchandise before it could assess the effect. As of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals, said Hanjin Shipping spokesman Park Min. Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which tracks international imports to the United States, said the situation isnât yet dire but could become so. October is the busiest month for cargo from South Korea to the U.S., accounting for about 11.5 percent of the annual total. But South Koreaâs maritime ministry said Hanjinâs troubles would affect cargo exports for two to three months, given that August-October is a high-demand season for deep-sea routes.

SHARE Prosecution lays out timeline of opportunity around Lester Jonesâ behavior By Gabrielle Porter Saturday, September 3, 2016 Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein used testimony presented at court to outline Lester Jonesâ actions the week of Paige Birgfeldâs disappearance. Those include: â  Monday, June 25, 2007: With his wife out of town, Jones called Birgfeldâs Models Inc.âs phone after 9 p.m., with cell records placing him near the office where she housed her escort business. Experts said it is likely they had a conversation. A surveillance video showed a car that looks similar to one of Jonesâ cars circling the parking lot of the business without stopping. Later that evening, Jones apparently went home and used his computer to look at pornography until early the next morning. â  Tuesday, June 26: Jones spoke to his wife after 5 a.m., and apparently was viewing pornography on his computer within the same hour before going to work. In the afternoon, he missed a call from his wife, but she reaches him after 8 p.m. on his cellphone, which is hitting off a tower that would place him near Wells Gulch in rural Delta County. That night, Jones drove to the North Avenue Walmart and bought a pre-paid TracFone, according to surveillance footage. The packaging for the phone is later found in the trash at Jonesâ work. Jones was later using his computer to look at pornography again. â  Wednesday, June 27: Jones spoke to his wife early in the morning again, viewed pornography on his computer again, and went to work. The TracFone purchased the night before was activated, and at about 10 a.m., is used to make a call to Birgfeldâs phone. It makes more calls to the Models Inc. phone, which are apparently unanswered. At nearly 8 p.m., Jones used his personal phone to call Birgfeld again, which appears to be when he spoke with her and set up an appointment for that night. Instead of going herself, Birgfeld sent an older woman who formerly baby-sat her children. The older woman gave Jones a massage, but told law enforcement he said it wasnât what he wanted. Jones viewed pornography on his computer again that night. â  Thursday, June 28: The TracFone made a call to Birgfeld, who spent the day picnicking with her ex-husband in Eagle. Birgfeld called the number back in the early evening after checking her voicemails. Birgfeld, who told her ex-husband she would be seeing clients that night although she hadnât originally planned to, spoke to him last shortly before 9 p.m. She was complaining about being re-routed by a car accident nearby, and was near Bob Scott RV, according to cellphone records and testimony. Some people reported seeing her pulled off the side of the road about the same time. Birgfeld wasnât seen again until her remains were found in Wells Gulch in 2012. Jonesâ computer didnât show any usage that night. â  Friday, June 29: Jones spoke to his wife later than usual and was back to viewing pornography on his computer that night. Birgfeldâs car was seen undamaged in the Walker SMS parking lot, close to Bob Scott RV. â  Saturday, June 30: Jonesâ wife came home, and Birgfeldâs car was seen undamaged again in the Walker SMS parking lot. â  Sunday, July 1: Jones spent most of the day with his wife, but left about 9 p.m., claiming he might have left the lights on at his workplace, Bob Scott RV. He returned between 10 p.m. and 10:10 p.m. About the same time, Birgfeldâs car was found on fire in the Walker SMS parking lot with the license plates missing. â  Monday, July 2: Jones checked The Daily Sentinelâs website from his computer and looked at a photo of Birgfeldâs burned car.

City Manager Bill Prokop requested the committee allocate $78,876 out of $287,000 in transportation impact fees from the construction of a new Walmart to fund a traffic study of Sea Island Parkway. City Council approved the contract to be handled by Ward Edwards in July, counting on the committee to cover the costs. At its Aug. 8 meeting the committee postponed a decision, saying not enough information had been given. When it met again Aug. 22, County Councilman Jerry Stewart said the committee agreed the study needed to be done, but was not sure how it should be funded. âWe have a problem now and it will only get worse,â Prokop told the committee. Heavy traffic is a burden created not by the city, but the county as a whole, Prokop said. An estimated 1,400 homes are coming to the Ladyâs Island area with the development of a Harris Teeter grocery store, the Whitehall neighborhood and a Parkerâs gas station, adding 1,500 to 4,500 vehicles to the peak driving times of 6-8 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. Prokop said about 4,353 vehicles drive to the area from the east during those times and another 1,651 come over from the Woods Bridge. Stewart said his main concern about using impact fees was whether there would be enough to cover the work the study reveals to be necessary to relieve congestion. âIâm concerned about the magnitude of the overall costs to solve the needs of this area,â Stewart said. County Council chairman Paul Sommerville said only the study will reveal what is needed and how much it will cost to do it. âThe study is critical to that area. I think it is absolutely appropriate to use impact fees because they are to fund adverse impacts that happen because of a development project,â Sommerville said. âI commend the city for being committed to funding it and realizing the need for it to be done.â County Councilwoman Alice Howard said traffic often backs into the city and town of Port Royal, and if she was on the committee she would vote to allocate the funds. Sommerville made a motion to approve $78,876 from the Walmart impact fees to cover the study and it was supported unanimously. The overall contract with Ward Edwards is $87,000. Prokop said the study is underway and will be complete by the end of November, with a final report to come before the end of the year.

Follow 162K Hot Topics: Chicago Beating ObamaCare Trump Transition Megyn Kelly Another Female Reporter Worries Over Why Hillary Can't 'Humanize,' Overcome Her Cold 'Caricature' By Tim Graham | September 2, 2016 | 5:28 PM EDT Share it Tweet it 0 shares In the August 29 print edition of the Christian Science Monitor Weekly, reporter Linda Feldman took on the long-standing problem of the Democrats: âCan Hillary Clinton now âhumanizeâ? The candidate finds whe needs to overcome a caricature.â Why canât she project warmth? The âcore challengeâ is âgetting voters to look beyond the caricature of her â and to actually like her.â Liberal reporters canât face the idea that sheâs not resonating.Â  In focus groups this month of âWalmart moms,â the descriptions of Clinton were devastating, even among women who may vote for her. Words like âemotionless,â âcoldâ and âuntrustworthyâ flowed freely.â Itâs a âcaricatureâ that sheâs âuntrustworthyâ? Or that her tolerance of her husbandâs serial adultery seemed âemotionlessâ? But then Feldman turned to blame sexism and that vast right-wing conspiracy:Â  Why is Clinton so challenged on the likeability front? Women voters blame sexism, echoing the findings of political scientists who say women candidates are more constrained in their behavioral options than men because of gender norms. Female politicians, for example, have to be careful not to get âtoo huggyâ with voters.Â  Feldman never cites any political science to back up her assertion, and notes that Sen. Elizabeth Warren âhas no problem displaying what voters perceive as authentic emotion in a political speech.â She then turns to close Hillary pal Diane Blair. The papers of Clintonâs close friend Diane Blair, who died in 2000, shed some light on why Clnton has built up a protective shell over the years. In 30 years of friendship, Ms. Blair observed Clinton in a series of high-profile roles and saw how the Clintonsâ opponents sought to derail them.Â  She also saw how Hillary Clintonâs spearheading of health-care reform, early in her husbandâs first term, ignited a fierce backlash â a reaction for which Clinton was unprepared. As mentioned before, reporters love turning to "close friends" to testify about how wonderful/victimized/misunderstood Hillary was, and in Diane Blair's case, they routinely ignore how these friends shared in her dishonesty. What Bill Clinton adultery? Feldman concluded âBy now, Clintonâs negative image seems so baked into public consciousness, it may be impossible to change....But with an image-challenged Trump on the ballot against her, it may not matter.â Follow Tim Graham Bio | Archive Tim Graham is Executive Editor of NewsBusters and is the Media Research Centerâs Director of Media Analysis More from Tim Graham Like this article?

While polls seem to indicate that Hillary Clinton is the candidate to beat, there are still alternative party candidates and, of course, Donald Trump working hard to make sure the election is a tight one.Â  We were curious to hear what issues were most important to real moms and which candidates they plan to vote for. Are moms all "with her" in the Hillary camp? Or is the "Walmart Mom" demographic going for Trump?Â  Unsurprisingly, our interviews with moms from all over the country reveal just how diverse we actually are. From write-in choices and third party candidates to a strong showing for Hillary, there is no single answer to the question "Who do moms want to vote for?"

Normally, youâd pay $9.99 every 30 days on a standard single license, which amounts to a slightly steeper $120 (technically, $119.88) a year. $99 works out to $8.25 a month, arguably a not-so-hefty deduction thatâs still something, not to mention extremely unusual for Apple, and perhaps most importantly, it undercuts arch-rival Spotify. 12-month Apple Music access codes can be obtainedÂ online from Walmart and PayPal, as well as in physical Apple stores nationwide. A similar offer is on across the pond, for British audio streamers, who get the service at Â£100 instead of Â£120, full advance one-year payment also required. Your move, Spotify.

Talking heads point to everything from her lack of trustworthiness to even the color of her pantsuits to explain why the momentum is shifting away from her. But the real culprit can be found in the one issue that most acutely impacts average Americans: the flailing US economy. Fridayâs employment numbers didnât show that the economy is falling off the cliff, but it does continue to head in the cliffâs direction, with a marked reduction in job creation. Itâs further proof that the Obama economy is a dud â and so is the policy approach that President Obama employs and that Clinton would copy. Itâs also further proof that Trump still has a clear opening for attack if he can just give his obsession with immigration a break for long enough to make the point. Just look at Fridayâs job numbers. Sure, unemployment holding steady at just 4.9 percent sounds good, and the Dow is comfortably above 18,000. But a broader measure of unemployment, known by economists as underemployment because it includes part-timers looking for more steady work, remains at a more alarming 9.7 percent. The dirty little secret is that those âofficialâ unemployment numbers â touted by Obama as evidence that his agenda of high taxes, massive regulations and European-style socialism is working â are belied by more realistic economic statistics. Economic growth as measured by GDP is barely existent; the amount of people in the labor force who are working or want to work remains at recent historic lows; wages are up, but barely. The last eight years were a great time to buy stocks â thanks to the Fedâs decision to keep interest rates so low, thereâs practically nowhere else to put your money. That is, if you had a job and enough disposable income to do so. Yes, this is a great economy for many wealthy investors or Silicon Valley coders. And sure, you can always find a part-time job at Wal-Mart. As we saw again on Friday, the real data show that almost everyone else has gotten the shaft, which is why Trump remains in the race with the following caveat: He isnât winning ground so much as Hillary is losing it. Even as Clintonâs unfavorable ratings have skyrocketed to Trumpian levels, his poll numbers have remained virtually flat at around 40 percent. Clinton is slipping, as manyÂ Americans become fed up with her email and Clinton Foundation antics and lies about those antics. Democrats I speak to are alarmed by this, but they (and many smart GOP operatives) still think Trumpâs a long shot because he continues to forgo a sustained attack on the insipid Obama economy that Clinton would be forced to defend by virtue of her party affiliation â if, of course, someone actually attacked Democratsâ economic record and put Clinton on the defensive. Thatâs part of the Trump conundrum: He has a great plan to lower taxes and cut red tape, thus creating jobs. But he almost never compares it to Clintonâs Obamanomics redux. He harps on immigration by playing on peopleâs most base fears (the countryâs changing ethnic makeup) without explaining why they really should be fearful: the true economic insanity that occurs when you flood the country with cheap labor that will further depress wages, not to mention the multitudes that will tap into a growing welfare state that the country can ill afford. Following Fridayâs weak jobs number, a growing number of economists are now predicting that Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen wonât raise rates until after the election. Wall Street might cheer that move (or lack of one) because cheap borrowing rates are deemed good for stock speculation, and it might seem with the Dow heading toward 20,000 that Clinton has even more wind at her back as Election Day approaches. But the stock market has been a lousy indicator of the true state of the Obama-Clinton economy; the rich have gotten richer and the poor are working part-time at Wal-Mart. Again, if youâre a stock market speculator, youâve done well; if your money is in the bank, well, you got hosed. The American people, often intuitively, know this. They just need a certain GOP presidential candidate to remind them about it from time to time. Charles Gasparino is a Fox Business Network senior correspondent.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next Itâs a popular scam, they send you a check claiming itâs for you to use as a mystery shopper. But at the end of the day you can end up losing hundreds of dollars. Thatâs what happened to one couple from Fishers. Joseph Krygowski says he and his wife were already concerned about pending surgeries but now they owe their bank hundreds of dollars on top of everything else. Krygowski says heâs been a Mystery Shopper before with other companies, so when a company called Market Force wanted to hire him to do a little âshoppingâ for them, he didnât think twice. He says the company sent him a check for nearly $3,000 and told him to deposit it into his own bank account. His job was to go to the Wal-Mart in Fishers and write a report on how the clerks handled issuing Money Grams. He was told to get three Money Grams for $800 each and send them to Market Force. They said he could keep the rest for himself. But the check turned out to be a fake, and now Joseph owes his bank all of the money that he sent to the scam artist. Krygowski says attempting to reach Dan Weil with Market Force has proven difficult, even after heâs sent them another fake check for nearly $4,000. âHeâs a low life, a real low life that doesnât care about anything but himself. Period. Thatâs ridiculous.â He says he is meeting with his bank representative on Tuesday and he hopes they can resolve the situation.Â  Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

By Andrew Bary Biography September 29, 2012 How do you get investors to sit up and take notice of a soon-to-be spun-off stock? If you're Kraft Foods, which will spin off its slow-growth North American grocery business to shareholders on Oct. 1, you pay a big dividend. The new Kraft Foods Group (ticker: KRFT) will offer a 4.5% yield, based on when-issued trading in the shares late last week. That's the highest yield among major food companiesâmost are in the 3% rangeâand is in line with the dividend rate on utilities and other traditional income sectors of the stock market. Thanks to its high dividend, new Kraft most likely will have one of the highest valuations in the food group, trading for more than 17 times projected 2013 profits, compared with 14 to 16 times earnings for the likes of Campbell Soup cpb -0.37748235680288855% Campbell Soup Co.

With its lofty price/earnings ratio, new Kraft doesn't look as appetizing as its rivals. Kraft's payout ratio will be much higher than its food peers, which could limit dividend increases in coming years. It may be better to buy shares of Kellogg or General Millsâboth yield about 3.3% and have a lower P/E and better dividend-growth prospects. Enlarge Image Close If its high valuation persists, Kraft could attract imitators in the food industry, as companies figure they can boost their share prices with an ample dividend. Consumer-staples producers tend to pay out about half their earnings in dividends, while new Kraft's payout ratio will be nearly 80%, based on projected 2013 profits. New Kraft's dividend looks safe, thanks to the stability of its well-known brands, which help give the stock its bond-like 4.5% yield at a time when 10-year Treasury notes yield under 2% and Kraft's own 10-year debt yields less than 3%. Kraft (KFT) is separating into new Kraft and the larger MondelÃ©z International mdlz 0.13333333333333333% Mondelez International Inc.

New Kraft's portfolio includes some familiar American products like Jell-O, Kool-Aid, Velveeta, Planters, Oscar Mayer, Kraft macaroni and cheese, and Kraft refrigerated cheeses. Until Tuesday, new Kraft will trade in a when-issued market with the ticker KRFTV, and MondelÃ©z as MDLZV. Old Kraft shares will stop trading after the split. MondelÃ©z will have a more modest dividend, around 2%. In an indication of the importance of dividends in a yield-parched environment, MondelÃ©z has a P/E ratio similar to new Kraft's, despite a stronger growth outlook. MondelÃ©z looks more appealing than new Kraft. Kraft announced the split a year ago, as a way to highlight its high-growth snacks business, following its controversial $20 billion purchase of Cadbury in 2010, a deal that angered Kraft's most prominent shareholder, Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway brka 0.06736068585425597% Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Buffett felt Kraft overpaid, and he criticized Kraft's tax-inefficient move to sell a pizza business to fund the Cadbury deal. Berkshire has steadily sold Kraft shares. It had 59 million as of June 30, versus 130 million at the end of 2009. Cadbury is an important part of MondelÃ©z, a made-up word that suggests the French word "monde," or world, overlapping "delÃ©z," which Kraft calls a "fanciful expression" of the word "delicious." Kraft holders will get one share of new Kraft for every three shares of old Kraft, and the old Kraft will be rechristened MondelÃ©z. In when-issued trading Friday, MondelÃ©z fetched about $26 a share and new Kraft, $45. Old Kraft traded Friday at around $41, equivalent to the value of one share of MondelÃ©z and one-third of a share of new Kraft. In investor presentations recently, managements of new Kraft and MondelÃ©z disappointed Wall Street by projecting a lower-than-expected 2013 profit, but the positive surprise was Kraft's intended annual dividend of $2 a share. Kraft shares initially dropped on the earnings guidance, but have since recouped those losses, mostly because investors are assigning a higher-than-expected value to new Kraft, based on its lofty dividend. New Kraft expects profit of $2.60 a share, and MondelÃ©z projects $1.50 to $1.55 for 2013. New Kraft and MondelÃ©z both fetch around 17 times 2013 estimates. MondelÃ©z is targeting 5% to 7% organic annual revenue growth and double-digit gains in profit (excluding the impact of foreign-exchange moves). New Kraft is aiming for more modest "mid to high" single-digit annual earnings gains. MondelÃ©z's ambition is to be viewed like higher-growth consumer companies, such as Coca-Cola ko -0.023952095808383235% Coca-Cola Co.

Kraft bulls like Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse like the MondelÃ©z story, arguing that next year's profits could be held back by a couple of special factors, including currency, and that MondelÃ©z's profits could rise sharply in 2014 to $1.80 a share. Joe Cornell of Spin-Off Research last week assigned a Buy rating to MondelÃ©z, with a $29.50 price target, about 12% above the when-issued share price. He has a Hold rating on New Kraft, with a target of $44.25. The Bottom Line With a 4.5% dividend yield, new Kraft's stock is more alluring for income investors than its bonds. But the better bet is MondelÃ©z, because of its growth potential. MondelÃ©z gets 44% of its sales from high-growth developing markets, a percentage comparable to both Coke's and NestlÃ©'s (NESN.Switzerland). MondelÃ©z is No. 1 globally in sales of cookies and crackers, chocolate, and candy. Current Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld will head MondelÃ©z. In a surprising admission, Kraft's management said earlier this month that it was overly bureaucratic, had high costs, produced little innovation, and had skimped on advertising, which is important to sustaining even well-known brands. The company's last big new product was Lunchables, launched in 1988. Kraft spent 2.9% of its revenue on ads last year, versus an industry average of 4.5% and well behind leader Kellogg's 8.6%. "We must do a better job supporting our brands," Kraft declared. KRAFT HIGHLIGHTED ITS weaknesses to emphasize the opportunity to boost its sales and operating margin, which stands at 17.1%. That's in the middle of the pack of North American food companies, but below General Mills, Heinz, and Campbell. Kraft may find it hard to raise margins while ramping up ad spending. Other food makers face challenges, too. General Mills missed the Greek-yogurt boom, and its key Yoplait brand is suffering. The cereal business is stagnant, weighing on both General Mills and Kellogg. Campbell faces one of the toughest jobsârevitalizing its core canned-soup business.

It's doubtful that any of her classmates will be able to recount a more dramatic experience than Kayla Eberle. The 10-year-old from Gloucester City had her quiet visit to a Salem County campground almost turn into a tragedy when in a freak accident her leg became impaled on the brake handle on the bicycle she was riding. On Sunday Kayla's mother, Amber Hoffman, said Kayla was "completely" recovered from the accident. She will start school going into the fifth grade on Tuesday. It's been a month now since the incident, but Hoffman says the memories are fresh and so is her admiration for all those who came to the aid of her daughter. "They're all amazing, they all came through and they comforted her the whole time," Hoffman said.Â  Kayla and her mom, dad, John Eberle, and sister, Vera Eberle, were spending part of their summer vacation together at the Four Season Campground in Pilesgrove TownshipÂ when on the evening of Aug. 3 Kayla was out riding her bike. "I turned and there was a bump. I fell and I tried to get up and the bike pushed me back down," Kayla recounted. "I looked down and the bike (brake handle) was in my thigh." American Legion Ambulance Association of Woodstown volunteer EMT Kaci Dwyer remembers the call vividly. At first the ambulance was dispatched for a 10-year-old who fell off her bike. Then the call was upgraded to a child with part of the bike impaled in her leg. Those first on the scene found Kayla near a tree. "She had grabbed my hand ... I told her 'You can squeeze it as hard as you want.' Her mom was on the other side supporting her,"Dwyer said. More rescue personnel, along with members of the Reliance Fire Co. arrived on the scene. So did New Jersey State Police Troopers James Snyder and Trooper Matt Stahlnecker from the Woodstown Station who joined others in comforting Kayla. The dilemma was how to free Kayla from the bike to get her to a hospital. "When we got there we found there was no way to disassemble (the bike) so we'd have to cut it," said Reliance Fire Chief Jeff Bowling Jr. An attempt use a hand device could have caused the impaled metal bike brake handle to do more harm to Kayla's leg, those there said, especially since it was close to an artery. Firefighters got out a hydraulic tool normally used cut brake or gas pedals that have trapped automobile accident victims. Reliance firefighter Rob Scardino carefully positioned the tool, made the cut within a half inch of Kayla's leg and freed her from the rest of the bike, Bowling said. Â "This tool came in handy for this one," Bowling said. "We would never have been able to make the cut (with a hand tool)." "She was awesome," Bowling said of how Kayla dealt with the ordeal. "But when the tools came out she was worried about her bike." It was then, Dwyer recalled, that Kayla asked: "So you guys are going to buy me a new bike now you are wrecking mine?" That comment actually brought laughter from first responders, helping to break some of the tension. "We'll see, sweetheart," Dwyer recalls telling Kayla. Kayla was taken to the Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children outside of Wilmington Delaware. There, surgeons carefully removed the part of the bike brake handle. Amazingly, her mother said, Kayla was back at the campground in about five hours after the accident. Her wound was bandaged, but didn't require stitches. A couple of days slater Reliance and American Legion personnel were back at the campground -- but not for a rescue. Dwyer had gone shopping for a bike to replace the one Kala lost. When the manager at the Pennsville Walmart heard Kayla's story, the store donated a new bike. It arrived at the campground on board the Reliance truck. Kayla was also presented with a get well card signed by the ambulance personnel, firefighters and state troopers who were on the scene as well as the Salem County 911 dispatchers who handled the emergency call. "Every emergency is very different and many incidents require first responders as a teamÂ toÂ play a wide variety of roles. It always feels good to be part of a positive outcome for a child," said state police Spokesman Capt. Stephen Jones. "We very seldom get the opportunity to follow up and spend time with prior patients and their families," Bowling said. "It is a great experience to be able to find out how they are doing and how their story ended. Days like this are a great reminder of why we entered the emergency services and continue to serve our communities everyday." "I would like to thank Woodstown Ambulance, Reliance Fire Co., Inspira Paramedics, New Jersey State Police Woodstown Barracks and the Salem County 911 center for another example of outstanding teamwork." Hoffman on Sunday again praised all of the fire, rescue and police personnel involved for all that they did for her daughter -- and her. "Going through such a scary time, to have that support round you is a real relief,"Â she said. As for Kayla, she had one word for her heroes -- "amazing."

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Music Now Cheaper Than Spotify By Adnan Farooqui on 09/05/2016 11:17 PST Spotify is the most widely used music streaming service across the globe. It has more than 100 million subscribers with 30 million of them paying for its premium service. Apple Music seeks to replace Spotify and take its position. One of the ways it can do that is by offering the service to users at a lower rate and thatâs preciously what Apple is now doing, however, there is a caveat. Apple has started selling 12-month Apple Music gift cards in the United States which cost $99. Those who are willing to pay $99 upfront can get a yearâs worth of Apple Music for this price. Thatâs the only caveat here. Divide this amount by 12 and you get $8.25 as the effective per month subscription rate. Spotify currently charges $9.99 and so does Apple Music for its monthly subscription. You need to buy the $99 gift card if you want the lower rate. The new Apple Music gift card is now available for purchase from the companyâs retail stores across the country as well as through retailers including Walmart, Best Buy, and PayPalâs eBay store. The company isnât selling the 12 month subscription online, through iTunes, iOS or the web. Spotify does sell gift cards for a 12 month subscription as well but they are priced at $120, the same amount you would pay if you subscribed to the service on the monthly $9.99 plan. Filed in Apple.

But lately,Â thereâs aÂ niche group of nomads who are taking small-scale living one step further â theyâre trading in their apartments and houses for vans. Simon Stiles is one of them. Heâs been living out of his 1992 Dodge B350 camper van for the past year.Â Heâs part of aÂ growing number of people joining the âvan lifeâ movement â where people ditch their âtraditionalâ homes and mortgagesÂ for the fluid, free lifestyle van dwelling offers.Â  Stiles, 26, purged most of his belongings and left his 400-square-foot Ottawa apartment to travel and work within aÂ 100-square-foot home-on-wheels â equipped with solar power, Wi-FiÂ antenna, stove, shower, bed and kitchen table doubling as a workspace. Stiles purchased the van for $4,000 and sunk $8,000 forÂ repairs and upgrades â including an external shower to fit his six-foot-plus, 240-pound frame. After the massive downsize and investment in minimal living, Stiles doesnât think heâll ever need much more. âI donât think Iâll ever be a person whoâll live in over 1,000 square feet. (Having more space) messes with you in a bad way,â he said. Simon Stiles is photographed with his 1992 Dodge B350 he calls home at Bate Island on the Ottawa River. (Darren Brown/Postmedia) Darren Brown / Postmedia For Stiles,Â the van life isnât about theÂ van at all â itâs about the lifestyle the van lets you lead. âItâs what youâre doing with your day, not where youâre sleeping at night,â he said.Â  Stiles rises and sleeps with the sunâs rhythms. He said heâs more in tune with nature and more productive when Netflix and Wi-FiÂ arenât as readily available.Â  âItâs like my day is twice as long,â he said. On a recent visit, Postmedia found Stiles at Bate Island while he was in town for a short while (he never stays anywhere too long). âI go where the work is,â said Stiles. He travels from city to city and is frequently contacted by followers on his YouTube channel, Finding Simon, for jobs and interesting projects as aÂ freelance photographer and videographer. Stiles has documented his lifestyle shift on YouTube since the beginning and now has more than 8,000Â subscribers.Â  His plan for the foreseeable future is to go out east this fall with just his motorcycle, then jet off to Southeast Asia when he decides itâs time to sell his van. Van life isnât a completely novel concept. Previous generations have had their own versions of it: Hippies in the â60s and â70s also lived, partied and travelled with free love and wind in their hair in the famous VW shagginâ wagons and caravans. The trend died down when Gen-Xers decided to joinÂ the rat race â get a job, a mortgage and have some kids. Â  Only in the past fewÂ years has the âvan lifeâ movement become more mainstream, with an influx of YouTubers and bloggers documenting their minimalist lifestyles online. For many van dwellers, the decision to downsize is a reaction to the struggles ofÂ balancing work, life, finances and travel goals in one fixed location. âThe only way I could do what I do is by living in a van,â said Stiles.Â  Stilesâ house-on-wheels allows him to work and achieve his travel goals. Heâll park in a new place, work, meet new people and do it all again in a new location. And in his mid-20s, he said heâs escaped the chains of student debt by living a cheaper lifestyle.Â  Stiles isnât alone in his choice to opt forÂ downsized, freelanced living â he estimatesÂ about 100 people in Ottawa are living and working in their vans. He even pointed to one couple who wrestled through an Ottawa winter living in their van, all while holding down government jobs.Â  Mat Dube and Danielle Chabassol hang out in their camper van. (Photo provided byÂ Exploring Alternatives) Former Ottawa-area residents Mat DubÃ©, 39, and Danielle Chabassol, 32, have been living out of their 5Ã19-foot van for the past two years. DubÃ© and Chabassol owned a four-bedroom house together in Hull, but after some extreme downsizing, the self-identified minimalist nomads ditched their house, travelled for two years and finally moved into their 2002 Ford E-150 in 2014. Though they got approved for a mortgage, all the while thinking the purchase was manageable,Â it turned out to be a big financial stress âÂ something the couple wanted to ditch to pursue their artistic and travel dreams.Â  They decided buying aÂ van would be the perfect way to have the comforts of home while travelling â something DubÃ© and Chabassol live for. The pairÂ have been documenting their journey on YouTube, like Stiles and many other van dwellers. Currently, the couple is living off their social media channel Exploring Alternatives, something made possible only through the van life. The couple has more than 100,000 subscribers and is trying to grow an online community of people living outside traditional housing norms. Since downsizing, DubÃ© and Chabassol said their expenses have dropped by nearly $3,000, and they spend on average between $1,100 to $1,500 every month â much more reasonable than the money they were sinking into a traditional house. Housing prices are out of control and a lot of people simply canât afford it, said DubÃ©.Â  The average cost of a âresidential-classâ property sold in the Ottawa area inÂ July was $398,608, accordingÂ to the Ottawa Real Estate Board. Thatâs up approximatelyÂ $100,000 in the span of aroundÂ nine years, according to numbers collected by the Canadian Real Estate Association.Â  Vans, tiny houses and trailers have become more viable alternatives for many in North America. But whatâs frustrating, said Chabassol, is that most of the alternatives to traditional housing are highly regulated.Â  âItâs fine if people want to have a house and a mortgage, I donât care, but itâs frustrating if you want an alternative, itâs illegal,â said Chabassol. âThatâs one thing we donât like about our lifestyle â weâre kind of relegated to campgrounds or public land, staying in friendsâ driveways or Walmart parking lots.â Cities across North America have bylaws which regulateÂ alternative living, such asÂ parking restrictions and bylaws limiting trailer or van dwelling on land at certain times of the year.Â  Bylaws in the City of Ottawa limit where and when you can park on the street, as well as laws which ban people from sleeping in cars. However, most van dwellers say city bylaws thatÂ could impact them are rarely enforced.Â  Â  Mat Dube and Danielle Chabassolâs van is parked onÂ Prince Edward Island. (Photo provided byÂ Exploring Alternatives) From the outside, van life might appear to beÂ a type of homelessness since it doesnâtÂ follow the traditional norm of living within four walls. But DubÃ© and Chabassol said you donât need a house to have a home, and in many ways they say the movement is an exploration ofÂ how society perceives homelessness more broadly. âThereâs an element of shame with being homeless and judgment towards homeless people and I feel like living in a van has really forced us to let go of that,â said Chabassol. âItâs forced us to be more aware of how serious it is, and how uncomfortable it would be to be homeless.â In North America after the 2008 financial crisis, many people who experienced foreclosure and layoffs were forced, not by choice, to live in their cars and in some cases, insideÂ vans. Some media in the U.S. identified vehicle dwellersÂ as the âhidden homeless.â For DubÃ© and Chabassol, homelessness is not as itâs traditionally defined â asÂ a person without a four-walled homeÂ â but rather an alternative space to call home. âI think the van life movement is helping to demystify what is acceptable and what is shameful and give ideas (to homeless people) about how to create a comfortable home and I feel like theyâreÂ not alone and itâs not embarrassing to live in your vehicle.â Some people who are homeless have no choice but to live in their vehicles. Knowing there isÂ a community of people who believeÂ living in a van or car is not shameful can help build confidence and reduce stigma,Â Chabassol argues. The couple, as part of their work with their project Exploring Alternatives, are travellingÂ across the continent to interview people living sustainably in alternative spaces to show what is possible with less. Theyâve even produced a book, The Exploring Alternatives Guide to Van Life. DubÃ© and Chabassol, veterans of the movement, donât sugarcoat the lifestyle and caution would-be van dwellers to get their feet wet before committing to pint-sized mobile living. At the end of the day, they said, living in a van is fun but alsoÂ extremely challenging â especially at the beginning. Social media is peppered withÂ fun images of people living the van life, but the pictures often donât expose the day-to-day realities and struggles that life presents.Â  âThe heat, the cold, the humidity, rain, bugs, finding water â everything was challenging,â said DubÃ©. âVan life is extreme, and itâs not for everyone.â Chabassol recalls the first (and only) winter the couple spent in their van. Chabassol said they would hang around in coffee shops until closing before running into the van and trying to get warm under the covers. âEverything is a little bit more intense when youâre in the van,â she said. âItâs really hard.â The tight quarters and challenging times means tensions can rise â though Chabassol admits, not for long.Â  âWe have micro-fights,â she said. âItâs like weâre mad and (then) itâs like, âCan you pass me the water jug?'â The couple knows the van life isnât for everybody. âThere are moments when youâre peeing into a funnel when youâre like, âThis isnât normal,'â she said.Â  î¡ Thousands show up for Latin American Festival and parade No foul play suspected in death of body found behind Mint Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

It is the one where you show up for class one morning---and discover you have forgotten to wear any clothes. Of course once you awaken, you realize the dream is absurd. Unless you are Tim Kosebud, my long ago fourth grade classmate. He arrived at St. Francis elementary one wintry day---and while taking off his long overcoat ---discovered he had somehow forgotten to don a pair of pants. Since St. Francis was a parochial catholic school, Kosebud was definitely not wearing the recommended uniform. A furtive call to his mother saved the day---as she soon arrived with his pair of salt-and-pepper corduroy pants. (A few years later, Tim got himself into trouble again when he tried to sneak beer into school---and it wasnât even good beer. Very flat. At least the nun who taught our class said so.) I remembered episodes like those a couple of weeks ago at the 80th anniversary commemoration of that school in Bend, Oregon. Given the honor of emceeing the event, I took some time to think back on old school days, classmates and teachers. Even old food. I remembered a baloney sandwich I had hidden behind a drainpipe during my 7th grade year. I had planned to devour it just after a big test---but forgot. When I checked last week the sandwich was gone---including the baloney. As for the test, it was an essay---and also baloney. The gathering last week brought together former teachers, former faculty, former staff and former students. They were all located through the website FormersOnly.com. There were even three people who had been in the original classes 80 years ago---an amazing occasion. But some people expected to be on hand failed to show up. Tim Kosebud was a no-show---perhaps still embarrassed over the pants incident. Nonetheless, his absence was unexcused. Another old classmate of mine---Danny Heckathorn---did arrive. But he was a bit late and suffering from jet lag. No wonder: He had flown in from Bellingham earlier in the day. I began my presentation by bragging a bit---announcing that I had just signed a three-year deal with Netflix. After the applause died down, I explained just what a great deal it was: The first three months are free, and then itâs just $9.95 a month after that. There had long been a rumor going around that Danny Heckathorn was a straight A student at St. Francis School. But most people did not believe the rumor, so Danny stopped spreading it. I too was not a great student. But perhaps that was because I was not cut out for academia---I wanted to be a dancer. My dream was to be the first-ever male belly dancer. But a brutally honest instructor finally gave me the bad news: I did not have the navel for it. No question about it though: St. Francis School gave many students an important foundation. Websterâs defines foundation as âa supporting undergarment.â So we will always think of the school as the corset of our education. The school opened in 1936---so I asked the assembled group to imagine what the world was like eighty years ago. Think of it. No You Tube. No Facebook. No Instagram, e-Bay, GPS, blogs, Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon, Wal-Mart, Prozac or Viagra. And no Google---nor Bing. Except for Crosby. There were no zombies on TV. There was no TV. A tweet was the sound a bird made. Even swifts. But there was no Swift named Taylor. 1936 was Kardashian-free---along with Justin Beiber, Adele and Larry the Cable Guy. But if there were a Larry the Cable Guy, the cable would have referred to telegrams, not TV. Real Housewives were real housewives. There were no iPhones, pods or pads---and drone was what certain priests did from the pulpit. Green was just a color, blackberry was a fruit---and phones made calls. Only calls. And they were hooked to a wall. People wrote letters; they did not text. LOL did not stand for anything. A trump was a card you played in bridge. The net was something only used by fishermen, acrobats---and people serving school lunches. And if you heard the words âHarry Potterâ you assumed it was referring to a hirsute guy with a kiln. Today, the old St. Francis School has been converted into a hotel---and a brewpub. So Tim Kosebud doesnât have to sneak beer in anymore. In fact, he is welcome there---as long as he remembers his trousers. pat@patcashman.com Pat can be seen on the sketch TV show âUp Late NWâ airing Saturdays following SNL on KING 5---and again Sunday at 11:35pm.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple Music is now cheaper than Spotify Jacob Siegal BGR NewsSeptember 5, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Just in time for the launch of the iPhone 7, Apple has introduced a new 12-monthÂ Apple Music subscription gift card for $99. This brings the monthly cost down to $8.25 â an 18% discount off the standard $9.99 monthly cost â making the service more affordable than its top rival Spotify. All in all, you'll end up saving about $20 annually by purchasing a gift card rather than subscribing through the app, so it's a no-brainer if you're committed to Apple Music. DON'T MISS:Â Leak: iPhone 7 will solve two of the three biggest problems with iPhones You've got a few options if you want to pick up the gift card.Â As 9to5Mac explains, the gift card is available in Apple retail stores, but not all stores have it in stock yet, so be sure to call before youÂ jump in your car. Secondly, Apple isn't selling the gift card online yet (or possibly at all), so you'll have to check other retailers if you want to order to card from the comfort of your home. Thankfully,Â you can purchase a code for the year-long subscription through PayPal Digital Gifts on eBay or from Walmart's online store. The timing of the gift card launch makes a great deal of sense. Not only is Apple preparing to unveil a new iPhone later this week, but the Music app itself is going to receive a significant makeover with the launch of iOS 10 this fall. If you though the war between Apple and Spotify was intense before, it's about to get worse.

By Patricio Robles 0 comments YouTube is facing a backlash after popular content creators claimed that the platform is failing to monetize their videos. The row focuses on YouTube's Advertiser-Friendly Content Guidelines, which users claim they were not told about and that they feel are ambiguous. AsÂ Gizmodo's Bryan Menegus explained, the Advertiser-Friendly Content Guidelines, whichÂ describe "content that is considered inappropriate for advertising," have been in place for some time. But a change to the way Google notifies content creators about videos that run afoul of them hasÂ led some to believe that Google is enforcing new rules they weren't informed about. Some took to YouTube to complain, and aÂ #YouTubeIsOverParty trending topic emerged on Twitter. Youtube: This isn't a policy change, its just a notification/appeal change. Me: So before you were just turning off ads and not emailing us? â Philip DeFranco (@PhillyD) September 1, 2016 While some popular YouTubers are screaming "censorship!", that's really not the case. Advertisers have a vested interest in ensuring that their ads aren't associated with content that isn't in alignment with their brands, and advertisers and YouTube have the right to determine which content is appropriate and desirable for ad-based monetization. Historically, many advertisers have failed to do a thorough job of policing where their ads are displayed. This is certainly due in some part to laziness, but also to the increasingly complex online advertising ecosystem. Programmatic in particular makes it possible for advertisers to buy audiences, but also makes it difficult to control where those audiences are being reached. Just how bad is the problem? In some cases, this has seemingly unintended consequences. Take, for example, MeetMe, which bills itself as "a leading social network for meeting new people in the US." MeetMe was sued by San Francisco's City Attorney Dennis Herrera in 2014 for failing to protect underaged users. At the time, Herrera stated that "MeetMe has become a tool of choice for sexual predators to target underage victims, and the companyâs irresponsible privacy policies and practices are to blame for it." He claimed that "dozens of children nationwide have already been victimized by predators who used MeetMe to coerce minors into meeting." The case was settled in 2015, but critics of the company, some of whom it should be noted are shorting the company's stock, claim that MeetMe is still home to questionable content and activity. One company criticÂ recently claimedÂ that "it took us only minutes to find Tier-1 brand ads attached to sexually explicit / drug-related content on MEETâs mobile app." It then helpfully posted screenshots showing ads from brands like Coca-Cola, AT&T, L.L. Bean and Target on pages these brands probably wouldn't expect to find them... A MeetMe investor relations presentationÂ refers to companies like Disney, McDonalds, Walmart, Hallmark, Kraft and P&G as "brand partners," although it's not clear that the company actually has a direct relationship with these brands. The company critic suggests that many of these brands are advertisers who purchase ads through third-party ad networks like MoPub, which is owned by Twitter. It goes without saying that no mainstream brand would consciously choose to display an ad alongside illegal or explicit content, but it can easily happen in today's online advertising ecosystem. Reach doesn't always deliver results As for YouTube, whileÂ it's not clear that the Google-owned property is "demonetizing" videos at a higher clip, the fact that itÂ isÂ apparentlyÂ enforcing its Advertiser-Friendly Content Guidelines to some degree hints that advertisers just might be wising up about content quality. And that's a good thing. Sure, content creators might be upset that it will be harder to make money from videos featuring inane rants, vulgar pranks and the like, but they're not entitled to advertising dollars, and there's plenty of evidence that advertisers benefit most from true premium content. A recent comScore studyÂ found thatÂ ads on premium sites delivered 67% higher average brand liftÂ andÂ the ability of premium content to deliver better resultsÂ has been observed for years. So while viral videos with questionable content might deliver eyeballs, advertisers don't necessarily benefit when they lower their standards to chase reach. And as more of them come to accept that, it's possible that content quality will come to be discussed as frequently as, say, viewability.

UK boost for Foschini sales Foschini shows strong sales on UK acquisition Â  With the South African economy forecast to grow at 0%, retailers are finding it hard to make profits, says Overberg Asset Management analyst Kirk Swart, who looks at local retail shares in this week's five shares to watch. Cape Town -Local retailers, who normally trade on lofted multiples, have been feeling the economic slowdown, interest rate increases and increasing inflation. To pass the inflation onto customers is becoming harder as retailers are forced to lower prices to retain market share. Clothing retailers are feeling the economic slowdown as customers are withholding buying any unneeded clothing items. Food retailers have fared a bit better with food being a necessity which cannot be postponed.Â  1. Mr Price [JSE:MRP] Mr. Price released a trading update for the 18 weeks ending August 2016. It reported a 2.4% drop in comparable retail sales. MRP Apparel saw sales down 3.6% and Milady's saw sales down 12.3%. Mr Price cites an unseasonably warm winter and the weak exchange rate as the reason for the poor numbers. Mr Price gives an indication of the state of the South African consumer. It cites âThere has been a fundamental shift in consumer spending in South Africa, with higher unemployment and low economic growth significantly dampening consumer confidence and spending.â This indicates that unless economic growth starts picking up, clothing retailers like Mr Price will continue to struggle. 2. Foschini Group [JSE:TFG] The Foschini Group is another South African retailer that is exposed to the stagnating economy. Although it reported a good set of results for the year ending March 2016, with headline earnings per share up 17.6%, the unseasonably warm winter would have had an impact on the Foschini group as well. After the poor Mr Price trading update, the Foschini Group share price de-rated. It fell from R160 to around R126, a drop of 25%. Investors are cautious that the Foschini Group will suffer a similar fate as Mr Price. Â  3. Woolworths [JSE:WHL] Woolworths is a South African and Australian retailer which has a broader product offering than Mr Price and Foschini. Woolworths are also in food sales. In their recent results they indicated that the local clothing business slowed down in the second half 2016. Woolworths highlights that it may see lower margins going forward as it needs to compete on price. The South African food division is experiencing single digit margins and are trying to be more price competitive as well. Woolworths Australia, which contributes around 41% of the group operating profit, had a tough time with the Country Road division. Country Road Womenâs Wear has undergone a number of changes. Woolworths will be rolling out its food division in Australia via David Jones. It is expecting that the David Jones food division will run at a loss of A$5m â A$10m in 2017 and 2018. 4. Shoprite [JSE:SHP] Shoprite reported a more than decent set of results for the year ending June 2016. Diluted headline earnings per share increased by 17%. A lot of the growth was achieved outside of South Africa. Shoprite cites that the general state of the South African economy is placing a damper on consumer spending. Where Woolworths are trying to compete on price in their food division, Shoprite is the leader in low pricing. As with all the retailers, the Shoprite share price de-rated after the Mr Price results. It came down from R206 to R182, a drop of 11.65%. 5. Massmart [JSE:MSM] Walmartâs South African subsidiary, Massmart reported its interim results for the 26 weeks ending 26 June 2016. Although overall revenue for the group was up 8.9% and headline earnings per share was up 19%, Massmart halved its interim dividend. Nine new stores were opened. Excluding the new stores, the growth in sales was 6.4% of which 5.8% was price inflation. The share price has fallen recently from R152 to R124. This is a drop of 18.42%.

Two Monessen men awaiting trial for their alleged role in the robbery and murder of a city drug dealer nearly four years ago said in court Thursday they may have alibis. Lawyers for Joshua Stepoli, 22, and Antoine Hairston, 23, told a Westmoreland County judge they want time to investigate whether their clients were somewhere else Dec. 3, 2012, when 36-year-old Chris âSnaxâ Fincik was gunned down in a botched robbery at his home. Defense attorney Ralph Karsh said Stepoli may seek to formally introduce an alibi defense but, during a brief hearing before Judge Christopher Feliciani, declined to reveal details of his client's whereabouts at the time of Fincik's shooting. Lawyer James Robinson said Hairston also has indicated there could be evidence to support an alibi. âThere are names I need to investigate, so I may have an alibi defense. But I'm not sure I do,â Robinson said. Prosecutors have said they believe Stepoli and Hairston were two of the three hooded men who stormed Fincik's home in an attempted robbery, then gunned him down in the heist. Stepoli and Hairston had been suspects in the shooting for years but were not arrested until last year, after the third man involved in the killing identified them as participants. Earl Pinkney, 22, last summer pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of third-degree murder and agreed to testify against Stepoli and Hairston. Pinkney is waiting to be sentenced for his role in the fatal shooting. Police said Stepoli and Hairston convinced Pinkney's then-girlfriend, Chalsee Hughes of Duquesne, to purchase ammunition for them at a nearby Wal-Mart. Hughes, 23, was charged with second-degree murder but was acquitted at trial of the homicide charge. She was convicted of attempted robbery. During her trial, she refused to identify Stepoli and Hairston as the men who appeared in a store security video with her when she bought the bullets that police said were used in Fincik's murder. Hughes is serving a 4 1â2- to 9-year sentence. Meanwhile, District Attorney John Peck said in court that he will introduce evidence that Stepoli and Hairston were part of a group of five who tried to kill another Monessen man hours after the Fincik shooting. Police said the group, which included Pinkney, hunted down and shot at 19-year-old Jaisen Irwin, whom they believed was spreading rumors about their involvement in Fincik's killing. Karsh and Robinson said they will seek to bar that evidence from being used at the murder trial. Robinson described the incident as âirrelevant.â Both suspects pleaded guilty in May 2014 to a charge of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault in connection with the shots fired at Irwin and were sentenced to up to five years in prison. They were paroled after serving about 17 months in jail. âDespite any plea, my client is not responsible for that assault,â Karsh said. Rich Cholodofsky is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile Â« Developing Ultrathin Flexible Circuit Boards will Support Apple's More Radical iPhone Form Factors | Main | Consumer Reports Organization Calls for Full Recall of Galaxy Note 7 Immediately Â» September 05, 2016 Samsung's Battery Woes now Creating a Contagion Effect on their Supply Chain Â  Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Korean Press Reports the Exploding Note 7 is a Severe Blow to Samsung that could help the iPhone 7." Today several more reports have surfaced in Korea today discussing the depth of the problem that is now in play. One report notes that "As Samsung Electronics has decided to recall 2.5 million units of the Galaxy Note 7 due to a flaw in its battery â its performance will have an adverse effect. Also, its distribution and sales will be somewhat affected by Hanjin Shipping's issue. This, in turn, will create the contagion effect to component companies, leading to a vicious circle in terms of price competitiveness and profit." Â  Yesterday industry sources told Business Korea that "Samsung Electronics is likely to see a 1.5 trillion won (US$1.34 billion) loss on account of the recalls. The figure is calculated based on 1 million won (US$895) per unit and subtracting Samsung Electronics' profits. Â  The biggest problem is sales suspension of the new handset. When a company has low sales, it makes more losses. A senior official from the industry said, 'The more smartphones a company produces, the lower fixed costs it will achieve. So, operating profits can rapidly reduce when production stops and there are no new sales due to the incident. The amount can even reach trillions of won.' Â  Marketing is another problem. The company has to delay or cancel new marketing campaigns which are scheduled this month. An official from the industry said, 'There are limits to increase production so the company can boost the production by 10 to 20 percent. However, it is impossible to double it. The company may have an extensive marketing plans after the release and it will make an additional loss when the plan doesn't go well as scheduled.' Â  This is why some market watchers say that the company will see a vicious cycle that new sales suspension and contracted marketing plans can lead to the decrease in operation profits and then to lower sales of new products. In particular, many expect that it is the structure that hit both semiconductor and display sectors at the same time. It means that the low sales of the Galaxy Note 7 will adversely effect on the performance of the semiconductor and display divisions of Samsung Electronics, reducing the total profits. Moreover, how to bear losses with component firms will have a considerable effect on the performance. Â  In this situation, some say that Hanjin Shipping's troubles can also have an adverse effect on sales of its home appliances products. Hanjin has handled about 10 percent of Samsung Electronics' shipments. U.S. retail businesses, such as Walmart and Target, are complaining as they are not being supplied with the products on time before the busy season at the end of the year. Â  Exploding Galaxy S7 Edge Reported Â  Whether it's consumer hysteria or the beginning of new chapter in Samsung's battery problems, UK's phoneArena reported on Saturday that beyond the Galaxy Note 7, an exploding Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone has been reported. Â  "A consumer who owns the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has reported that his unit burnt while he was charging it. This gentleman claims to have been sleeping at the time of the incident, and reportedly used the handset's original charging equipment." Â  However, the Galaxy S7 Edge has been out for six months without a single battery incident reported until now. PhoneArena also points out that it's a different battery so it's likely a rare incident. Whether it is or whether more incidents will begin to surface is something to keep an eye on. For now, it's just another headache and more bad PR for Samsung. Â  About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The 12-month gift cards work out at $8.25 per month, offering an 18 percent saving over the standard $9.99 monthly subscription rate for Apple's streaming service.

Currently paying $14.40 AUD a month family plan here in Australia because iTunes gift cards are always 20% off down here in Oz ;) Rating: 8 Votes tasset 18 weeks ago I would like to know too if this gift card can be used to fully pay or somewhat finance part if the family plan... Yes it can (or apps for that matter), they do not earmark the credit for music-only. To that end this is nothing more than a discounted iTunes gift card, just with a psychologically creative spin by the marketing team. I wait for other promos or holiday events to stock up on iTunes credit for 60-80 cents on the dollar. Rating: 4 Votes newyorkone 18 weeks ago I always get Apple gift cards around the Holidays. Best deals in past years were $100 for $75, and you can easily find $100 for $80. I re-load my iTunes account for the year, and Apple Music automatically deducts from there. So I'm essentially getting my family plan at 20-25% off. Rating: 4 Votes Brookzy 18 weeks ago iTunes Gift Cards can be used as Apple Music payment, so can these similarly be used for iTunes? Wondering if it's a way to get Â£119.88 worth of iTunes credit for Â£99!

Rating: 4 Votes superduperultra 18 weeks ago Join Apple Music to stream this or just about every song ever recorded... I wish, more like 70% of the music ever recorded with a bias towards the mainstream. Oh, also I hope you like tracks/albums randomly disappearing from your library due to legal rights expiring; no notification no nothing, just the pleasant surprise of finding out just when you want it. Just not worth the hassle right now, maybe in 10 years it'll be good (same goes for all streaming services). Rating: 3 Votes Tuci 18 weeks ago Streaming music. Great for commuters but a killer when there is airplane, roaming or PLOPS on your schedule. You can download you know. Rating: 3 Votes jayducharme 18 weeks ago Hmmm ... Apple is making Music more tempting.... I'm still not keen on the fact that I don't "own" any of the music. But at the lower price, it's a bit easier to swallow financially. Rating: 2 Votes BlueCreek 18 weeks ago Did not realise the UK pricing was converted exactly from dollars to pounds without conversion! Means the UK pricing works out at $13.38 per month. No surprise there really. Rating: 2 Votes OllyW 18 weeks ago Did not realise the UK pricing was converted exactly from dollars to pounds without conversion! Means the UK pricing works out at $13.38 per month. No surprise there really. $9.99 is Â£7.50 at today's exchange rate which is Â£9.00 including VAT, so it's Â£1 a month more expensive here. Spotify and Tidal costs exactly the same as Apple so I'm guessing it's the UK music industry which is setting the price.

(Mike Brantley/mbrantley@al.com)Mike BrantleyÂ  Monday, Sept. 5 is Labor Day, a time set aside to honor the contributions of the American worker. The day traces its roots to the industrial revolution and the growth of labor unions. Congress made Labor Day a holiday for Washington, D.C. in 1894, with states following suit. Today the day - which is considered the unofficial end of summer - is commemorated with parties and parades. The weather should be ideal for a holiday in which many spend a great deal of time outdoors. Highs in Alabama will be in the upper 80s with early-morning lows in the 70s. Here's a list of what's closed and what's open on Labor Day: Closed Post offices, no mail service Banks Federal offices State offices Schools Libraries Most municipal offices Federal, state and local courts Fed-Ex UPS ABC Stores - Except Store 69 in Guntersville, Stores 130 and 132 in Orange Beach and Store 137 in Gulf Shores Huntsville Public Transportation MAX Transit in Birmingham Mobile WAVE transportation The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Most banks and credit unions Labor Day 2016: Why do we celebrate the holiday?

According to the International Energy Agency data, the price of Brent crude oil fell to below $30 in January of this year, the lowest level since July 2009. It was over $110 in January 2014. As a consequence, prominent tech companies and online retailers have strengthened their leading market capitalization positions, leaving the energy giants behind. According to data from leading international auditing and advisory firm Price Water House Cooper (PwC), the market cap of the world's top oil companies of which the shares open to public decreased by 20 percent as of the first quarter of this year compared to March 31, 2014. The total market value of Exxon Mobil, PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Total, BP and Schlumberger, the seven oil companies standing among the world's top 100 firms, was $1.22 trillion as of March 31, 2016 decreased from $1.53 trillion at the same time in 2014. In the same period, oil prices, as the main cause of decline in the market cap of the energy companies, fell by 63 percent during the same period. The price of crude oil decreased to $39 from $107 in the same period. The fall of market cap of the British energy giant BP decreased by almost 40 percent. BP's market cap was around $94 billion at the end of the first quarter of this year, declined from $156 billion in 2014. Total, another major energy corporation, also experienced difficulties. The world's fifth most valuable oil company lost 27 percent of its market cap. Total's market value decreased from $154 billion to $112 billion. The French energy company sold all of its operations in Turkey in April of this year. Turkey's Demiroren Holding paid â¬325 million for this acquisition.Stressing the fall in oil prices, international credit agency Moody's decreased the credit ratings of Royal Dutch Shell, Total, and Chevron in April of this year. The price of crude oil has been relatively flat over the past six months but it still sits below $50 per barrel.Â  The rise of the tech companies The tech, e-trade, and retail companies, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, Tencent Holding, Amazon and Wal-Mart, advanced their market cap by 33 percent and strengthened their leading positions in the same period. The total market value of these seven companies increased to $2.57 trillion from $1.92 trillion in 2014. The market cap of Apple, indicated as the world's top valuable corporation according to the most of the market studies, was $604 billion at the end of the first quarter of this year. The leading tech company was followed by Alphabet-Google and Microsoft with $518 billion and $437 billion of market values, respectively. The market value of Facebook increased by 86 percent to $325 billion from $175 billion. The company's shares were offered to the public in May, 2012 for the first time. The social media giant made one of the most sensational corporate acquisitions of the recent years by purchasing WhatsApp, a messaging application used via smartphones, at a price of almost $19 billion in February 2014. The market value of Amazon, which provides worldwide retail services, advanced by 69 percent in the same period. The pioneer e-trade company, established in Seattle, U.S. in 1994, increased its market cap to $280 billion as of March, 2016.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. â âMy heart wants me to continueâ by Angela Campbell On Sun, Sep. 04, 2016 Tweet Photo Credit: Noel Lanier DARLINGTON, S.C. âÂ On September 2, Hendrick Motorsports announced that Dale Earnhardt Jr. would miss the remainder of the 2016 season. Earnhardt has been sidelined since the race at Kentucky due to concussion-like symptoms that his doctors have traced back to an accident that took place at Michigan International Speedway on June 12 during the FireKeepers Casino 400. His symptoms took several weeks to appear prompting Earnhardt to see a neurological specialist in mid-July. After missing seven races, including the Southern 500 at Darlington, the decision was made to sit out the remainder of this season. Sunday he stopped by Darlington Raceway to discuss this decision. He was accompanied by Micky Collins, the Medical Director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Medicine Concussion Program and team owner, Rick Hendrick. Earnhardt entered the media center wearing the glasses that have become familiar in the last few weeks and while he seemed a little nervous, there was also a sense of relief present in having made a decision that many feared was coming. He began by saying, âI feel like the recovery is going really good. Iâm starting to see improvements as we are going.Â It seems like this has lasted a really long time, but when you look at it on paper it has been a very short period and the gains that Iâve felt in that short period give me a lot of confidence that this is going in the right direction.Â And all the stuff and hard work we are doing is paying off.â Earnhardt also talked about being back at the track with this teammates, stating it was âcertainly fun to be here at the race track and to be able to see the team and be in this atmosphere that you get so used to being in week in and week out.Â Iâm happy to be here today and it certainly is a place where you get pretty good exposure and it drives your symptoms a little bit so Iâm getting some good exercise as we speak.â He went on to describe the healing process as interesting and said that he has âlearned a ton.â Some of the issues heâs encountered include vision problems, balance difficulties and anxiety. âI struggled with my eyes for a while and Iâm starting to see improvements there which I was thrilled to wake up one day and feel a difference and start to see improvement there.Â Riding in a car or walking to gain stability that Iâve talked about before is starting to improve, which was a major relief for me because that was probably the most difficult thing to deal with throughout the day because it was there 24 hours a day.Â My balance is miles better than it was when I first went to see Micky.Â  We do a lot of exercises every single day.â Earnhardt gave much of the credit for the gains heâs made in his recovery to his fiancÃ©e, Amy Reimann, who has provided encouragement and even participated in his daily exercises. âAmy has been there every step of the way pushing me to stay focused and to realize the progress we have made and to keep working hard.Â Itâs been a good experience and Iâm looking forward to getting well and definitely on the right track.â Collins explained that there are six types of concussions and discussed Earnhardtâs particular areas of concern. âWe have learned a tremendous amount about concussions over the last five or 10 years and we understand this injury could happen to anyone,â Collins said. âWhat happens with a concussion is the brain moves inside the skull and when the brain moves inside the skull we have learned a number of chemical changes that happen to the neurons or the cells in the brain and at the end of the day what occurs is there is an energy problem with the cells.Â We have actually learned now that there are six different clinical profiles or different types of concussions that we see. Earnhardt, Collins reiterated, âwas having problems with the vestibular system, with the ocular system and with some anxiety and mood issues that is very much associated with these problems. Collins further explained the treatment and prognosis, saying âWe have made progress with this injury to the point where we actually matched treatments to the different types of concussions that can occur and we have very specific treatments that can treat these different problems that Daleâs experiencing. In fact, over the last two or three weeks Iâm pleased to tell you that the fruits of that labor are now paying off.Â  Dale has been a model patient.Â I know this is clichÃ© sitting up here, but Dale has worked as hard as any patient that I treat currently or in the past.Â He has been very diligent about doing his therapies and we actually have very specific treatments that are targeting these problems that Dale has and we are seeing the benefits of that.â Collins added that he had two goals for Earnhardt. âWhen I first saw Dale, my goal was to see Dale become a human being again and I can tell you with confidence that is occurring in front of our eyes.Â He is feeling better.Â He can tolerate a lot more.Â He is having fewer and fewer symptoms and is doing very well. ToÂ me, that is the number one goal is to get Dale feeling as normal as a human being.Â The second goal is Dale becoming a race car driver again.Â Yes, we will be working on that as well.Â Iâm very confident that we are moving in the right direction in that respect.â In the beginning, Earnhardt did not expect the healing process to be this lengthy. âWhen we first went to see Micky I anticipated the experience to be similar to what I had in the past.Â  That we would work on getting better and it would happen in a relatively short period of time and I would drive a car before the end of the season.Â â As time passed, however, he was faced with something quite different. âIÂ think as we continued to go get evaluated,â he said, âwe realized that it is going to be a bit more of a process.â While heâs disappointed that he wonât be back in the racecar this season, Earnhardt also feels itâs the correct move and that having a definite plan has helped him to heal more quickly. âI think itâs the right decision considering how I feel personally and physically.Â I definitely donât belong in a race car today by any stretch of the imagination.Â You donât know how long this process is going to take and we want to be healthy and able to compete at some point, but also we donât want to take any risks and re-injury ourselves or put ourselves in a situation where we can basically erase all the hard work that we have done to get better.â âTo have a definite plan where everybody is on board with, that Rickâs comfortable with, that Iâm comfortable with, that Mickyâs comfortable with, has really made it a much easier process for me,â Earnhardt explained. âBut I get to go do all my sponsor requirements and appearances,â he continued. âI went to Wal-Mart for Mountain Dew this past week. So, Iâm well enough to continue to honor my commitments with my partners. Really, the only thing I canât do is just get in a car and race. I can drive down the highway. Now that my symptoms have improved I feel much more comfortable doing that. Getting back to normal is right there in the near future. Iâm getting better every day.â Rick Hendrick has assured Earnhardt that his car will be waiting for him when he is ready. âThe seat is his and I expect, weâve got a lot of time between now and Daytona.Â I saw him like two or three weeks ago and then I saw him last Monday and I saw him today, the improvements have been phenomenal and listening to the doctor we are excited about Dale Earnhardt Jr. being in the car at Daytona and weâve got right much time, excited about him racing beyond 2017.â Hendrick likened Earnhardt to âa member of the familyâ portraying a relationship that is as much personal as it is business and he even got in a little ribbing. âI care about him as a person probably as much or more, than as a race car driver. So, Iâve been concerned. But, Iâve been surprised how hard heâs worked. I shouldnât say thatâ he said quickly, laughing, âBut he sends meÂ videoÂ as proof.â On a more serious note, Hendrick described his organization as a tight knit family that is there for one another. âWeâre like a family there at Motorsports and all the drivers and crew chiefs, you see the team light up when he shows up. Itâs just like anytime you have a member of your family hurt or sick or going through something,â he said, âeverybody wants to rally to help him.Â I donât think there is any way youâd have gotten Jeff Gordon back in a race car other than helping the organization and helping Dale. And I think thatâs proof of that. We just feel good. Iâve seen the progress. The sponsors have been super. They all care about him. They care about him so much that they want him to be on the cautious side.â It obviously hasnât been an easy decision but itâs a smart one, and it should not be confused with apathy. Earnhardt wants it all and heâs not ready to settle for less. âBut my heart wants me to continue,â Earnhardt emphasized, âand wants me to continue to be working with the guys Iâve got. Iâm only 41. I think I have some good years left. Iâm as good as I have ever been inside the car. My ability to communicate and drive the car and get everything out of it, I feel very confident. I feel like Iâm still an asset to the team and to the company. Rick likes to say we have unfinished business. âI certainly feel the same way. We have races to win. We went through this process in 2012. It was very scary and difficult. Micky told me that I would one day be well and I would win races again, and he was right. We gotÂ well, andÂ I had some of the greatest years and racing experiences of my career shortly after that. And so, heâs telling me that this is possible again, and I believe it. And if we work hard enough and we really rehab these systems, anything is possible from here on out. So, Iâm very positive and feeling very good and am confident about the future.â The future may look uncertain but opportunity often arises from misfortune. Earnhardtâs 2016 season is over but the possibilities for next season are endless and thereâs unfinished business that needs his attention.

Sept. 4, 2016 1:08 p.m. Sept. 4, 2016, 1:08 p.m. Wage stagnation, which has helped drive voter discontent, may finally be ending Jim Puzzanghera Wage stagnation, which has helped drive voter discontent, may finally be ending Starbucks workers prepare coffee during the company's shareholder meeting in Seattle in March. (Ted S. Warren / Associated Press) Painfully slow wage growth has plagued the recovery, with many workers seeing few if any raises as they struggle to make ends meet. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurringÂ solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures,Â amplified byÂ laws providing significant minimum-wage hikes in California, New York and elsewhere, alsoÂ are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies including Wal-Mart,Â Starbucks, McDonaldâs and JPMorgan Chase increased what theyÂ pay their lowest-levelÂ employees. Now, after two years of strong job growth,Â job openings are near record levels. That's forced employers to increaseÂ pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4% for the 12 months ended Aug. 31.

Trusting the Social Security Administration? The US Social Security Administration does a poor job of computer security. Surprised? Michael Horowitz (Computerworld (US)) 05 September, 2016 13:57 - - - - print email Comments Back in September 2013, Brian Krebs wrote about Social Security fraud at the My Social SecurityÂ web portal,Â  The SSA and financial institutions say they are tracking a rise in cases wherein identity thieves register an account at the SSAâs portal using a retireeâs personal information and have that retireeâs benefits diverted to prepaid debit cards that the crooks control ... The trouble really began earlier this year, when the Treasury started requiring that almost all beneficiaries receive payments through direct deposit ... At the same time, the SSA added the ability to change direct deposit information via their my Social Security Web portal. Shortly thereafter, the agency began receiving complaints that identity thieves were using the portal to hijack the benefits of individuals who had not yet created an account at the site. Poor choices made by the Social Security Administration, regarding how they verify identities, left an opening for bad guys to buy personal information and use it to steal Social Security payments. Krebs suggested that the only defense was to create an account for yourself before bad guys did it for you. The home page of www.ssa.gov Almost three years later, nothing has changed.Â In early August Krebs noted that it is still relatively easy for thieves to create an account in the name of Americans who have not already created one for themselves. All one would need is the targetâs name, date of birth, Social Security number, residential address, and phone number. This personal data can be bought for roughly $3-$4 from a variety of cybercrime shops online. That SSA failed to change an insecure system was, of course, not news. The news Krebs was writing about last month, was their new insistence on two factor authentication. Now, the Social Security Administration would not let you login without a one-time security code that they texted you.Â  There are two problems with this. Needless to say, the people least likely to use text messages are senior citizens, the target audience for Social Security. Then too, text messages are not secure. This is old news.Â  The timing was interesting too. The SSA announced their new texting system the same month that the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST) said not to.Â  NIST released a draft proposal at the end of July (Digital Authentication Guideline 800-63B) warning federal agencies that texting for two factor authentication will no longer be a recommended practice.Â  The SSA mandate for texting security codes lasted all of two weeks. Of course, they didn't back off for security reasons.Â  The concept of using an extra code to supplement a password is, of course, a good one and Krebs sees a brutally obvious solution.Â  I would like to see the SSA make it mandatory to receive a one-time code via the U.S. Mail to finalize the creation of all new accounts,... itâs mystifying to me why it doesnât already do this by default. All this got me looking at the www.ssa.gov website where I discovered three issues, presented below from least to most important.Â  GREEN ADDRESS BAR There is an FAQ section of the site devoted to "How We Verify And Protect Your Identity" and one of the questions (below) got my attention because I haven't seen a green address bar in years.Â  From ssa.gov: What Does It Mean When I See a Green Address Bar On OS X, Safari, Chrome and Firefox all display a white address bar at ssa.gov. On iOS, Chrome uses white, Safari uses gray. On Android, both Firefox and Chrome display a white address bar. The Chrome browser on Chrome OS uses white. On Windows, Firefox, Chrome and Opera are white, white and white. The Edge browser uses gray, but when you hover the mouse over it, the address bar turns white. So, where does green come from? Internet Explorer. It's the only browser that changes the address bar to green, and it does so, when viewing a website with an EV (Extended Validation) certificate. Mind you, this is a good thing, and I wish more browsers would change the color of the address bar, as its a great way to distinguish domain validated certificates from the more trustworthy Extended Validation ones.Â  And, good for SSA for using an Extended Validation certificate. Many companies that should, such as Wells Fargo, Amazon and Walmart, do not. That said, the answer to the question is more wrong than it is right. A green address bar really means you should use a different web browser.Â  And, while an Extended Validation certificate provides better assurance that you are actually at the website you think you are at, it does not, in and of itself, make a website safe. For one thing, all encryption is not the same (more on that below) and the safety of a website has to include the data not being stolen from the back end, something the US government has failed at in the worst possible way. And, by claiming that green is good, they may well scare away non-technical people (their demographic) who see a white or gray address bar. Internet Explorer displaying ssa.gov without identifying the website Then too, in the limited testing I did with Internet Explorer, the address bar sometimes said "Identified by DigiCert" (above) instead of "Social Security Administration". I don't know why. ADOBE FLASH PLAYER To many techies, the Adobe Flash Player is the mother of all security flaws. Sure enough, ssa.gov uses Flash - and it's hidden. That is, nowhere do you see the normal gray puzzle piece that browsers blocking Flash display over sections of a web page devoted to Flash. I didn't realize that Flash was running under the covers until Safari on OS X asked about authorizing it. A Foresee survey at www.ssa.gov My best guess is that Flash is being employed by the Foresee survey shown above. I say this based on JavaScript files (here and here) that ssa.gov pulls in from answerscloud.comÂ and on Foresee developer documentation that says they provide their clients with a .swf (Flash) file and that Flash is used to send SessionReplay information to ForeSee. Although the survey message says you were randomly selected, that does not appear to be true. I was presented with the survey pretty much every time I tested ssa.gov on a new computer. AND NOW, THIS For years, SSL Labs, from Qualys, has been the gold standard in checking the many technical details that make a web site secure. So, imagine my surprise when ssa.gov got a perfect score on their SSL server test. ssa.gov has great security It wasn't long, however, before disappointment set in. The image at the top of this blog has a red arrow indicating the link to "SIGN IN/UP". Click on that, and then on "my Social Security" and you end up at https://secure.ssa.gov/RIL/SiView.do (see below). Logging in at secure.ssa.gov The important point here, is that we have moved from www.ssa.govÂ to secure.ssa.gov. Technically, "www" and "secure" are subdomains of the main domain name, ssa.gov. I mention this because each subdomain can have its own security profile. And, in the case of ssa.gov they do. In fact, faq.ssa.gov has a third security profile, different from the first two. Despite its same, secure.ssa.gov is not secure. It's not even close. Â  The secure section of ssa.gov is not secure As you can see in the SSL Labs report above, the supposedly secure section of ssa.gov scored a C, which is pretty bad. The report is very long and detailed, but the two orange stripes (enlarged below) are the worst issues. The biggest security failures at secure.ssa.gov The message "The server supports only older protocols, but not the current best TLS 1.2" refers to different versions of the underlying protocols providing the security. In the beginning, HTTPS web pages used the SSL protocol but all versions of SSL have since been disgraced. SSL has been replaced by TLS (web pages are still HTTPS) and there are three versions of TLS with 1.2 being the latest. Any website that cares about security supports TLS 1.2. Both www.ssa.gov and faq.ssa.gov support it. But, secure.ssa.gov does not, an oversight that Qualys considers so big that the grade is capped at C, no matter how secure everything else may be. The older versions of TLS are 1.1 and 1.0. I am not sure how secure version 1.1 is considered, but certainly version 1.0 is not considered secure. Amazingly, secure.ssa.gov only supports TLS 1.0, it does not even support version 1.1. Another company, High-Tech Bridge, also offers an SSL/TLS Server Test and they too, note this problem. Their warning states that "The support of TLSv1.1 is mandatory according to NIST guidelines." So, the Social Security Administration is violating NIST guidelines. I guess no one at NIST is ready to retire.Â  The other big mistake, has to with Forward Secrecy which I wrote about back in June 2013.Â It's a long topic, but an important one. Without Forward Secrecy, websites leave themselves open to being spied upon and there is no reason not to use it. The other section of the website, faq.ssa.gov, was rated B by SSL Labs. Here too, there is no support for Forward Secrecy but at least TLS 1.2 is supported. The other big security mistake in the "faq" subdomain is support for weak Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange parameters. Frankly, that's over my head.Â  If the Social Security Administration can do everything right for the "www" portion of their site, how do they fall down so badly on the other subdomains? This being a Defensive Computing blog, perhaps the best thing to do is to block all on-line access. SSA points out that "You can block electronic access to your information at any time, for any reason."Â Hopefully that will keep the Chinese out too. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Â  The secure section of ssa.gov is not secure As you can see in the SSL Labs report above, the supposedly secure section of ssa.gov scored a C, which is pretty bad. The report is very long and detailed, but the two orange stripes (enlarged below) are the worst issues. The biggest security failures at secure.ssa.gov The message "The server supports only older protocols, but not the current best TLS 1.2" refers to different versions of the underlying protocols providing the security. In the beginning, HTTPS web pages used the SSL protocol but all versions of SSL have since been disgraced. SSL has been replaced by TLS (web pages are still HTTPS) and there are three versions of TLS with 1.2 being the latest. Any website that cares about security supports TLS 1.2. Both www.ssa.gov and faq.ssa.gov support it. But, secure.ssa.gov does not, an oversight that Qualys considers so big that the grade is capped at C, no matter how secure everything else may be. The older versions of TLS are 1.1 and 1.0. I am not sure how secure version 1.1 is considered, but certainly version 1.0 is not considered secure. Amazingly, secure.ssa.gov only supports TLS 1.0, it does not even support version 1.1. Another company, High-Tech Bridge, also offers an SSL/TLS Server Test and they too, note this problem. Their warning states that "The support of TLSv1.1 is mandatory according to NIST guidelines." So, the Social Security Administration is violating NIST guidelines. I guess no one at NIST is ready to retire.Â  The other big mistake, has to do with Forward Secrecy which I wrote about back in June 2013.Â It's a long topic, but an important one. Without Forward Secrecy, websites leave themselves open to being spied upon and there is no reason not to use it. The other section of the website, faq.ssa.gov, was rated B by SSL Labs. Here too, there is no support for Forward Secrecy but at least TLS 1.2 is supported. The other big security mistake in the "faq" subdomain is support for weak Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange parameters. Frankly, that's over my head.Â  If the Social Security Administration can do everything right for the "www" portion of their site, how do they fall down so badly on the other subdomains? This being a Defensive Computing blog, perhaps the best defense is to block all on-line access. SSA points out that "You can block electronic access to your information at any time, for any reason."Â Hopefully that will keep the Chinese out too. Â  Â - - - - -Â  Update: September 25, 2016. The SSL/TLS flaws at secure.ssa.gov have been corrected. SeeÂ The Social Security website is now secure.

That mordant, binary sentiment could apply to the current state of organized labor. According to some observers, the once vaunted American labor movement is either already dead or is in the process of dying a hideous death. Granted, these pessimistic observers consist largely of sheltered academics, Chamber of Commerce officers, and Michigan Republicans. But other, more optimistic observers happily note that, with 14.8 million people belonging to unions (11-percent of the workforce), the U.S. labor movement is still a vital--if unfocussed and demoralized--force to be reckoned with. Do the math. If the National Rifle Association (NRA), with a membership of barely five million, can strike terror in the hearts of America's lawmakers, surely 14.8 million union workers have the ability to make some noise. Union people will tell you that there are two legislative moves required to level the playing field. The first is passage of the EFCA (Employee Free Choice Act), which would make "card check" the law of the land, effectively eliminating the bureaucratic morass and stalling tactics regularly used by management. While hypocritical businessmen pretend that, like the powdered wig set of the 18th century, they abhor Big Government, when it comes to workers being allowed to freely join a union, they beg the feds to intervene, beg them to step in and make joining a union as complicated a procedure as becoming a U.S. citizen. And this isn't an ideological or constitutional issue for these profit-takers; it's an economic one. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015), the average weekly wage for a union employee is $980, and the average weekly wage for a non-union worker is $776. Simple as that. The second thing is repeal of half the provisions in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act (including prohibition of secondary boycotts and sympathy strikes). This anti-labor law, passed over the veto of President Truman, defanged the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act), ushered in the toxic phenomenon of "right to work" states, and rendered organized labor more or less powerless by cutting its nuts off. Beginning in the late 1970s, in response to the implementation of UAW "emergency concessions," and continuing into the early 1980s, when President Reagan declared "open season" on organized labor by firing more than 11,000 PATCO workers (air traffic controllers), union activists have been engaged in a lively debate over how best to spend AFL-CIO funds. One thing the House of Labor has plenty of is money. While some people want to see the lion's share of AFL-CIO discretionary spending used for national organizing drives, others want to see it spent on stuff like advertising, community awareness, "education" and political donations. Not that the Democrats have done organized labor any favors lately, but I've always favored the political donation route. Consider: If reactionary, draconian laws were what crippled us, then progressive, labor-friendly laws must be what makes us whole. An officer with an International that must remain nameless, once suggested a crazy idea. Given that the AFL-CIO spent an estimated $50 million trying (and failing) to organize Walmart, and given that lobbyists and donors are the mother's milk of politics, and given that money has already poisoned the well, the AFL-CIO should consider bribery. They should identify 50 congressmen who could a make difference in the outcome of critical labor votes and then have a bag man discreetly deliver each of them $200,000 in cash. Don't call it a "bribe." Call it a "donation." Donations of $200,000 to 40 key House members and 10 key senators would amount to $10 million, which the AFL-CIO could easily afford. It's clean, it's quick, and it beats the hell out of wasting money on futile Wal-Mart campaigns. In return, unfair labor laws are repealed and the American worker is given a fighting chance. Let's not get all self-righteous. After all, isn't this how the military-industrial complex functions? Hasn't the Saudi royal family, going all the way back to FDR, donated millions of dollars to the U.S. to gain preferential treatment? As Tom Hagen said to Santino Corleone, "It's business, Sonny!"

Find A Full List Of Whatâs Open And Whatâs Closed BuzzWorthy 4 0 0 September 4, 2016 Labor Day 2016: Are Banks Open Today? Find A Full List Of Whatâs Open And Whatâs Closed Nathan Francis Labor Day 2016 has arrived, and with the unofficial end of summer comes plenty of questions about whatâs open and whatâs closed and plenty of confusion for people looking to make a trip to the bank or a quick run to the supermarket. The final holiday before summer comes to an end, Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics, parades, and some last-minute shopping before the kids head back to school. But it is also a federal holiday, meaning that some important destinations like the post office will be closed while most stores are open, sometimes on limited hours. The result can be a somewhat confusing day for those looking to run errands. Whatâs Closed On Labor Day 2016? As mentioned above, Labor Day is a federal holiday, so all government offices are closed. This includes post offices, social security offices, and most Department of Motor Vehicle offices. Anyone looking to mail a package will actually be out of options entirely, as FedEx and UPS are both joining the United States Postal Service in closing down in honor of the holiday. To honor the contributions of Americaâs labor movement, the pinnacle of American capitalism will be shutting down as well â the New York Stock Exchange. There will be no trading on Labor Day, and the Federal Reserve will also be closing its branches, IBT reported. Nearly all major banks will also be closed on Labor Day, noted GoBankingRates.com. Some regional banks may offer limited hours and banks located inside supermarkets might be open as well, the report added, so itâs best to check with your individual bank to see if they might be open. There could be one more option for customers of more tech-savvy banks, the report noted. âFinancial institutions generally follow the Federal Reserve schedule, and since Labor Day is a holiday observed by the central bank, you should expect most branch locations to be closed. The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq composite and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association will also be closed on Labor Day, allowing employees to enjoy the day with family and friends. Of course, in todayâs tech-savvy world, youâre never more than a few clicks away from your accounts, so if you need to access your funds, simply use your bankâs website, mobile app or ATM.â Schools will also be closed on Labor Day, though some colleges will be holding classes. Whatâs Open Labor Day 2016? As one of the final chances to grab shoppers before the summer comes to an end, Labor Day is an important holiday for offering sales. Because of this, nearly all large retail outlets will be open on Monday, HolidayShoppingHours.com noted. This includes Walmart, Kmart, Target, Home Depot, Loweâs, Trader Joeâs, Bass Pro Shops, Cabelaâs, PetSmart, Kohlâs, Bed Bath & Beyond, Staples, Office Max, Office Depot, and Best Buy.

Labor Day weekend fuel prices lowest since 2004 https://t.co/x4OsEOag3C via @therealautoblog #automotivenews â Gogel Auto Sales (@gogelauto) September 4, 2016 This could also be a boon for travelers, as gas prices are at their lowest point on Labor Day in more than a decade. Public transportation will be open, but as IBT noted there are some changes in major urban metros. âPublic transit is where things get hairy. On Monday, New York City subways and buses will run on their Sunday schedules. But in Brooklyn, there will be changes on the 2, 3, and 4 lines near Eastern Parkway due to the JâOuvert parade from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. EDT. In Washington, D.C., trains will run on a Sunday schedule between 7 a.m. and midnight. However, construction will alter the red, orange, blue and silver lines as detailed here.â For those looking to find out what else is open and closed on Labor Day 2016, especially for smaller stores or local outlets, itâs best to call ahead.

By Matthew Franck St. Louis Post-Dispatch The recreation complex at Lanier's Campground in Holly Ridge, N.C. HOLLY RIDGE, N.C. â¢ We pulled up to a picnic table on Skeeters Drive, emptied our minivan â known affectionately and accurately in our family as âBig Stinkyâ â and took stock of our camping gear. Out came the 10-man tent â preposterously large for just me and my two sons. Then, the camp cots, the sleeping bags, flashlights, inflatable kayak, clothes and food â so much food. Finally, the objects of our little experiment: a free-standing air conditioner and a waist-high refrigerator. +5Â  Just a fraction of the gear used to set up an air conditioned tent at Lanier's Campground in Holly Ridge, N.C.Â  By Matthew Franck St. Louis Post-Dispatch Standing in the humid swelter of eastern North Carolina, I immediately doubted the questions that plagued as I made the 1,000-mile road trip to get here. Can you climate control a tent to any reasonable degree in the peak of coastal swamp summer? Can a vacationing family in that lowly tent co-exist in an RV park filled mostly with resident retirees? Is it really possible for three people to take a five-day trip to the beach for little more than $500, including gas, food, entertainment and something resembling lodging? And most importantly, can all that be done while strengthening, rather than destroying, the bonds between a man and his sons, age 17 and 10? The answer to all that is yes, yes, yes and surprisingly yes. Or perhaps I should qualify that, because it really depends on your tolerance level for travel discomfort and your relationship with camping, RVing and some strange combination of the two. Those accustomed to the pampering of concierge-class beachfront resorts may want to stop reading, or else continue on for the sheer pleasure of sneering at my squalid itinerary. Nor is there much by way of useful travel advice here for those who camp only off-the-grid, with ultralight provisions packed neatly in a backpack no larger than a newborn. Actually, I can relate to both groups. Iâve done high-adventure backpacking with my oldest son, including an 80-mile, nine-day trek in New Mexico with just one shower. So I know how to rough it. And while Iâm cheap, I can splurge on travel. Our familyâs most typical vacation involves a beachfront condo, with pools, jacuzzis and tennis courts. But this was another kind of trip, a spontaneous one that we hadnât saved for. I had time off, but my wife didnât. Nor did my daughters â one who was at a summer term at college, and the other with a friend in Florida. So we had all but called off prior plans to attend a family reunion near Jacksonville, N.C., a half-hour from the Atlantic coast. But the beach kept calling me, and my two sons were itching to get out of town. We knew oceanside hotels were out of our budget. So, too, were condos rented online. Even if we could find a last-minute deal, it would certainly be for a full week â time we didnât have. So why not camp? Itâs was just the guys, after all. But if youâve ever tried to sleep in a humid, mid-summer tent, you know how miserable all this sounds. Then I thought of my air conditioner. Creature comforts I bought my AC last year to cool a shed that I use as a work area. Itâs the standalone kind, the size of a dehumidifier, thatâs capable of cooling several hundred square feet. It vents hot air out of a flexible plastic duct, one that can easily be sent out of a zippered tent door. This isnât a hair-brained concept. Or if it is, at least itâs not my hair-brained concept. There are actually websites like that that cover all this. So we packed the unit into the a minivan. With only three passengers, that left all kinds of room for creature comforts, including the fridge â because why not? Our destination was the beaches of Topsail Island, N.C., or as close to the beach as we could reserve last-minute. We would attend the family reunion on the last day. I picked an RV park, rather than a state park, because I needed access to electricity, lots of it. I also opted for the kind of park with a pool, shower houses and laundry â three essentials for battling the sand, saltwater and sogginess of the beach. We found all that at Lanierâs Campground, 1161 Spot Lane, Holly Ridge, N.C., on the Intercoastal Waterway about a mile from the beach. I paid the lean price of $100 for three nights combined. We saved even more by stopping by a friendâs house in Hickory, N.C., on the way for a free night of lodging at their lakeside home â with water skiing thrown in. Just before reaching our campground, we dropped by a Walmart, loading up on all the empty calories that a motherless trio of boys could desire. So we were high spirits when we unpacked âBig Stinkyâ at Lanierâs on a Thursday afternoon. We formed a small mountain of gear on the sandy seagrass of our 15-by-30-foot plot, complete with picnic table, water spigot and power pole. Setup took about 15 minutes, with an additional 45 minutes arguing over tent pole configuration and the distribution of labor. We were all proud of the fabric cabin we had erected. There was plenty of room for our cots (the bulky kind, almost as nice as a bed), a kitchen area with card table, a fully stocked fridge, and lots of electronics like a two-screen portable DVD player. +5Â  A refrigerator and air conditioner raise the comfort level at a tent set up at Lanier's Campground in Holly Ridge, N.C. Photos by Matthew Franck â¢ mfranck@post-dispatch.com Within 30 minutes or so, the AC was doing a decent job of battling the heat. It wasnât winning, of course. Tents lack virtually all insulation, so you canât expect chilly comfort under a blazing sun. But even so, the cool circulating air tames the misery. And at night it was downright wonderful, with the unit actually shutting down a few times because it reached the target temperature. We felt spoiled. But spoiled is a relative term at Lanierâs Campground, a place that really isnât a campground at all. Ours was the only tent we could see among the dozens of plots on the compound that day. We later came across one small tent across camp occupied by a particularly amorous couple, lovebirds too distracted by each other to know or care that they didnât have so much as a box fan to keep them cool. A new ecosystem Lanierâs is better described as a mobile home park, especially on the weekdays. The trailers and RVs that fill most of its lots have not been on the road for months or even years. Their wheels are covered with gardening lattice. Most have decks and three-season rooms attached, in some cases larger than the trailers themselves. Setting up camp there is like visiting a new cultural ecosystem. Several Confederate flags hung in our corner of camp, along Skeeters Drive. Even so, it was a fairly racially diverse group. Throughout the day and into the evening, golf carts circled the complex, with teen and preteen drivers living out the one summer perk of being dropped off for weeks with the grandparents. Together, these gangs of grandchildren formed a kind of summer camp, one swallowed by a retirement community, with all its camp counselors and rules spit out. Then came the weekend, and with it a whole new dynamic. By Friday afternoon, convoys of roadworthy RVs and popup trailers pulled in, filling most every vacant pad. Along with them came fellow tent campers, seeking a few days at the beach. Soon our van-sized tent was hemmed by a canyon of big rigs. We were like the last two-bedroom ranch house in a neighborhood torn down for McMansions. One beast parked immediately behind us had a flat-screen TV attached to its exterior side. The owner roasted hot dogs over a fire pit while âLaw and Orderâ episodes played on satellite. I hope I donât sound like Iâm dissing the whole scene. In truth, the three of us found life at the RV park to be a kick, and often a refreshing one. We soaked up every last one of its many features. The huge concrete pool dwarfed any found at a hotel or condo complex. The shower house was clean and private. The laundry room was essential. And the air-conditioned clubhouse, with an arcade, Wi-Fi and a makeshift diner was a vital hangout. I lavished the boys in quarters and watched them dump them into the claw machine or the pool table, marveling at how well the two were getting along. +5Â  The recreation complex at Lanier's Campground in Holly Ridge, N.C. By Matthew Franck St. Louis Post-Dispatch Later, I would drive by RV complexes nearby â some directly by the beach â and see none of extra amenities. Setting up a tent at those more primitive places would be more comfort than I was willing to sacrifice. Which really gets to the heart all travel decisions. Each of us must decide what we are willing to give up as we chase adventure or natural beauty or leisure. Even on vacation, we do not entirely escape our budgets or our fixation with status and appearances. But when weâve finally settled into our lodging and hit the beach, none of that matters. The ocean does not care where you roomed the last night. It offers the same waves and sunsets to residents of beachfront mansions and tent dwellers alike. And so you dig your feet in the sand and soak it all in, satisfied that it was worth the cost and effort â and in some cases the deprivations. You watch your two sons crash into wave after wave, seeing the seven years of age that divide them temporarily disappear in the sheer joy of each othersâ company. And you store away as vividly as you can memories without price tags. Travel e-newsletter from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Love to travel? Get travel tips and ideas sent weekly to your inbox.

Transcript by Official Release On Sun, Sep. 04, 2016 Tweet Photo Credit: Noel Lanier NASCAR SPRINT CUP SERIES BOJANGLESâ SOUTHERN 500 DARLINGTON RACEWAY TEAM CHEVY DRIVER PRESS CONF. TRANSCRIPT SEPTEMBER 4, 2016 DALE EARNHARDT, JR, DRIVER OF THE NO. 88 CHEVROLET SS, RICK HENDRICK, TEAM OWNER, HENDRICK MOTORSPORTS, AND DR. MICKY COLLINS, MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH MEDICAL CENTER SPORTS MEDICINE CONCUSSION PROGRAM, met with members of the media at Darlington Raceway to discuss Daleâs health, the decision to keep him out of the race car for the remainder of the season and many other topics.Â  Full Transcript: CAN YOU PROVIDE US AN UPDATE ON HOW YOU ARE FEELING AND HOW YOUR RECOVERY IS GOING? DALE EARNHARDT, JR.: âI feel like the recovery is going really good. Iâm starting to see improvements as we are going.Â  It seems like this has lasted a really long time, but when you look at it on paper it has been a very short period and the gains that Iâve felt in that short period give me a lot of confidence that this is going in the right direction.Â  And all the stuff and hard work we are doing is paying off.Â  It certainly fun to be here at the race track and to be able to see the team and be in this atmosphere that you get so used to being in week-in and week-out.Â  Iâm happy to be here today and it certainly is a place where you get pretty good exposure and it drives your symptoms a little bit so Iâm getting some good exercise as we speak.Â  It has been a real interesting experience and Iâve learned a ton.Â  I have a lot of respect for Micky (Collins) and his group and the direction that they are giving me is really working.Â  I struggled with my eyes for a while and Iâm starting to see improvements there which I was thrilled to wake up one day and feel a difference and start to see improvement there.Â  Riding in a car or walking to gain stability that Iâve talked about before is starting to improve, which was a major relief for me because that was probably the most difficult thing to deal with throughout the day because it was there 24 hours a day.Â  My balance is miles better than it was when I first went to see Micky.Â  We do a lot of exercises every single day.Â  Amy (Reimann, FiancÃ©) has been there every step of the way pushing me to stay focused and to realize the progress we have made and to keep working hard.Â  Itâs been a good experience and Iâm looking forward to getting well and definitely on the right track.â COULD YOU DESCRIBE DALEâS INJURY AND MEDICALLY SPEAKING HOW IS HE DOING? MICKY COLLINS: âWe have learned a tremendous amount about concussions over the last five or ten years and we understand this injury could happen to anyone. What happens with a concussion is the brain moves inside the skull and when the brain moves inside the skull we have learned a number of chemical changes that happen to the neurons or the cells in the brain and at the end of the day what occurs is there is an energy problem with the cells.Â  We have actually learned now that there are six different clinical profiles or different types of concussions that we see.Â  They can be cognitive issues or thinking problems.Â  They can be problems with something called the vestibular system in the brain, which allows Dale to interpret movement and motion and stabilizes his vision when he moves his head and interpret complex visual information.Â  The third type of concussion is ocular or your eye movements, actually moving your eyes in tandem, bringing your eyes together diverging your vision.Â  The fourth type of concussion is migraine.Â  The fifth type is neck and the sixth subtype can be anxiety and mood related problems.Â  When I first saw Dale a month and a half ago I can tell you he was pretty sick.Â  He was having problems with the vestibular system, with the ocular system and with some anxiety and mood issues that is very much associated with these problems.Â  We have made progress with this injury to the point where we actually matched treatments to the different types of concussions that can occur and we have very specific treatments that can treat these different problems that Daleâs experiencing. In fact, over the last two or three weeks Iâm pleased to tell you that the fruits of that labor are now paying off.Â  Dale has been a model patient.Â  I know this is clichÃ© sitting up here, but Dale has worked as hard as any patient that I treat currently or in the past.Â  He has been very diligent about doing his therapies and we actually have very specific treatments that are targeting these problems that Dale has and we are seeing the benefits of that.Â  When I first saw Dale, my goal was to see Dale become a human being again and I can tell you with confidence that is occurring in front of our eyes.Â  He is feeling better.Â  He can tolerate a lot more.Â  He is having fewer and fewer symptoms and is doing very well.Â  To me that is the number one goal is to get Dale feeling as normal as a human being.Â  The second goal is Dale becoming a race car driver again.Â  Yes, we will be working on that as well.Â  Iâm very confident that we are moving in the right direction in that respect.â Â  FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS IT SEEMED LIKE IT HAD BEEN A TWO WEEK, TWO WEEK, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GUYS ANNOUNCE YOU WILL BE OUT FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON.Â  DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THAT THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON MIGHT BE DOUBTFUL?Â  HOW DISAPPOINTING IS IT TO FIND OUT YOUR SEASON IS OVER? DALE EARNHARDT, Jr.: âWhen we first went to see Micky I anticipated the experience to be similar to what I had in the past.Â  That we would work on getting better and it would happen in a relatively short period of time and I would drive a car before the end of the season.Â  I think as we continued to go get evaluated we realized that it is going to be a bit more of a process and Micky can speak on the reason why we decided to make this decision to not race anymore, but I think itâs the right decision considering how I feel personally and physically.Â  I definitely donât belong in a race car today by any stretch of the imagination.Â  You donât know how long this process is going to take and we want to be healthy and able to compete at some point, but also we donât want to take any risks and re-injury ourselves or put ourselves in a situation where we can basically erase all the hard work that we have done to get better.Â  Mickey can talk more about the decision that we made since the last evaluation.â INAUDIBLE: DALE EARNHARDT, JR.: âNo, I mean Iâm going through the process so I know how I feel and how I need to feel and how Iâm supposed to feel so Iâm not shocked.Â  Iâm not hearing things from Micky that I donât already know about myself.Â  Iâm very disappointed.Â  I miss my guys, I miss the garage, I miss all of you folks (the media).Â  Itâs so much fun to see so many familiar faces.Â  That part is the disappointing part because I am just used to being here and this is sort of our circle, our family.Â  Itâs been weird not being at the track.Â  Again, I would love to be competing with my guys.Â  We are obviously out of the Chase and all that stuff, but Iâm not really concerned about that I just enjoyed what I was doing, enjoyed my job and have a great group of guys that believe in me as a driver.Â  Itâs a difficult decision. MICKY COLLINS: âI last saw Dale on August 24th.Â  Though he is improving it is very clear that his test result and our findings, the things we look at are not back to normal.Â  We have very specific data that we look at in terms of these different systems that I referred to earlier. Dale is a competitor.Â  He wants to be back in a race car like no other.Â  The stress that he puts on himself for that is very apparent when I sit down and talk to Dale, he wants to race.Â  I felt that myself and Dr. Petty, who is also treating Dale, the neurosurgeon and our treatment team at the University of Pittsburgh we have a pretty robust team.Â  We sat down and I feel very strongly the right decision was made to take Dale out of racing, so we can focus on getting him better and reduce the stress that is associated with that.Â  Stress and concussion donât get along well and we see stress can really exacerbate and worsen things.Â  I donât think its coincidence that since we made that decision we are starting to see a lot of progress here that Iâm excited about.â Â  CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN DIFFERENT FROM WHAT DALE HAS EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST? MICKY COLLINS: âYes, I treated Dale in 2012.Â  I can tell you some of the exam findings and findings that we found with this injury were different, they were more extensive.Â  Different types of injuries that we see and now you understand better perhaps why that is there are different types of concussions.Â  We see different symptom profiles.Â  The injury at Michigan kind of broke the seal on this injury and when we saw him he was having a lot of problems, but clearly we are seeing Dale improve at this point in time and we are excited about his progress.â Â  WHEN THE TIME COMES WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE TO CLEAR DALE OR CLEAR A DRIVER TO PUT THEM BACK IN A RACE CAR?Â  MICKY COLLINS: âYou make a good point.Â  Itâs a razors edge concentration focus.Â  I want to make sure everyone understands the systems that are injured for Dale or the systems that make Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Dale Earnhardt, Jr.Â  his ability to sustain focus and stabilize his vision when he moves his head and interpret complex visual information.Â  Though Dale is feeling as a normal human being to get him to that level of being a race car driver is exactly to your point it is a different set of skills than any of us in this room have.Â  Iâm very confident that we will be able to do that.Â  Right now it doesnât really, I donât have specific criteria because that is a waysâ¦ we have time.Â  But, yes, I can tell you we are going to need to stress the systems enough to see if they produce any problems and actually rehab those systems enough to where he is not going to run into problems with this injury.Â  I feel confident that we are heading in that direction.â Â  WILL WE SEE YOU AROUND THE RACE TRACK?Â  DO YOU HAVE OTHER THINGS YOU WILL BE DOING OR ARE YOU 100 PERCENT ON THE RECOVERY?Â  WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT 2017 OR MAKE DECISIONS ON THAT? DALE EARNHARDT, Jr.: âWell, I think any race car driver would tell you if they are not in the car itâs really weird to be at the race track.Â  I feel, even though I love to see my guys and I know they are happy to see me today, I feel like a bit of a distraction and taking them off of their focus to get their car in tech and all that good stuff.Â  I wonât be able to not stay away from the race track.Â  I think that I have a vested interest in how well the team does the future of the team and its success and I want to be a part of that.Â  I want to be a witness to what they are doing and what we are trying to learn as a company we are trying to always get better so I want to be a witness to that.Â  It is just very strange.Â  Doug Duchardt (General Manager of Hendrick Motorsports) prodded me to come to the Tuesday debriefs and it just feels really weird because Iâm the only guy in there that really didnât go to the race track or drive a car, but it does help me to at least stay on the same page and up to speed with what the company is doing and what we are trying to learn.Â  I understand the importance of that.Â  Micky has said that I can basically do everything that I want to do and go everywhere that I want to go. The more I do the more I stress those systems.Â  Iâm trying, the worst thing I can do really is sit on the couch.Â  I tell Micky I feel awesome when Iâm at home, but any time I leave the house, I lose about 20 percent if Iâm rating myself on a scale from 1 to 100.Â  He says do that more, push yourself and you will see those symptoms start to fade in those environments that are upsetting you.Â  So, I think coming to the race track would be a great thing for me and itâs just an odd feeling wondering what to do with yourself when you are there.Â  I love watching racing so I was a fan before I was a driver, so I will figure out a way to enjoy it until I can get back in that seat.â RICK HENDRICK: âWe were talking before he had to get out of the car about extensions.Â  I want him to race with me as long as he can and he wants to be there.Â  The seat is his and I expect, weâve got a lot of time between now and Daytona.Â  I saw him like two or three weeks ago and then I saw him last Monday and I saw him today, the improvements have been phenomenal and listening to the doctor we are excited about Dale Earnhardt, Jr. being in the car at Daytona and weâve got right much time.Â  Excited about him racing beyond 2017.â Â  THE COMMON BELIEF IS THAT MULTIPLE CONCUSSIONS COMPOUND PROBLEMS. YET IT APPEARS FROM WHAT DALE IS SAYING, THAT YOU CAN MAKE HIS BRAIN LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO INJURY IN A SIMILAR CRASH TO MICHIGAN. IS THAT TRUE? WILL YOU BE ABLE, WITH CONFIDENCE, TO TELL HIM THAT HE ISNâT PUTTING HIS HEALTH AT RISK IF HE GETS BACK IN THE RACE CAR? MICKY COLLINS: âThatâs a great question. The point I want to make is thatâs why weâre doing what weâre doing right now; is to make sure we get Daleâs systems rehabbed to the point where not only does he feel normal, but hopefully to the point where we donât see less force causes to come back. Weâve advanced things to the point where we really do know how to rehab these systems well. And there are a lot of treatments that Dale is going through. Heâs going through vision therapy, heâs going through exercise therapy; thereâs a lot of different therapies weâre doing to build those systems. And, hopefully we can get to a point where we see that he can withstand the normal forces of a race car driver. If he had a significant force, that can cause an injury as it would anyone. But thatâs what weâre trying to get to is that level.â Â  HOW HAS ALL THIS IMPACTED THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? HAVE YOU AND AMY HAD TO TALK ABOUT THIS? HAVE YOU HAD TO DELAY SOME PLANS? DALE EARNHARDT JR.: âNo, nothing has really changed. Weâre very fortunate that our plans are going to work out just fine. Aside from just not being at the track and doing what Iâm used to doing, the first four or five weeks were really difficult. I was very ill and it was hard to enjoy even the simplest activities. But, in the past couple of weeks, Iâve really gotten to where I feel a lot more comfortable about going out and doing and being out an about and being observed. I go to Target or somewhere and I have symptoms and I might stumble across the aisle or something, or need a little more sidewalk than a normal guy. But, Iâve got to put myself through those situations for that to sort of correct itself. Really, like Micky said, the anxiety and the nervousness of the whole process drives all that and makes it much more than it really is. And thatâs why I feel awesome at home because thereâs no anxieties or issues at home. You sit on your couch and almost convince yourself youâre 100 percent. And then youâll walk outside and realize youâre not. Or, you go somewhere and youâll have a symptom and realize that youâve still got a ways to go. âAmyâs been great. Sheâs been there every single day pushing me. Without her, this would be nearly impossible to go through. So, thatâs been awesome to have her with me every day, and available to help me. And she doesnât complain and sheâs right there with me doing all the exercises. She even does the exercises that Iâm doing just to be healthy herself. But, yeah; weâve got some great things that me and her are going to do this off-season that Iâm excited about. The last several weeks have been trying to remove some of the stress and going week to week to evaluation to evaluation was very difficult. To have a definite plan where everybody is on board with, that Rickâs comfortable with, that Iâm comfortable with, that Mickyâs comfortable with has really made it a much easier process for me. âBut I get to go do all my sponsor requirements and appearances. I went to Wal-Mart for Mountain Dew this past week. So, Iâm well enough to continue to honor my commitments with my partners. Really, the only thing I canât do is just get in a car and race. I can drive down the highway. Now that my symptoms have improved I feel much more comfortable doing that. Getting back to normal is right there in the near future. Iâm getting better every day.â Â  NASCAR HAS TESTING POLICIES AND RULES. WILL THE DECISION TO BE OUT OF THE CAR FREE YOU UP TO MAYBE DO SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL, TESTING-WISE, LATER IN THE YEAR THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO OTHERWISE? HOW WOULD THE DOCTOR FEEL ABOUT THAT AND HOW WOULD RICK SUPPORT THAT? DALE EARNHARDT JR.: âI really donât understand what you mean.â WILL YOU BE ABLE TO TEST A CUP CAR AS OPPOSED TO A LATE MODEL AT HICKORY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? DALE EARNHARDT, JR.: âOh, just to see how I do?â YES. DALE EARNHARDT, JR.: âYeah, once weâre cleared, I definitely donât want to go into Daytona cold turkey. I would certainly want to get to a race track. What we did in 2012 was we took a short track car to Gresham and ran for a day with no data system on the car or anything like that. And Iâve talked with NASCAR, and they are completely comfortable with allowing us to go somewhere for a day. Like Micky says, weâve got to get in that environment and test those systems before we get the final sign-off. So, that would certainly be something that I would insist on happening before we went to Daytona for SpeedWeeks.â Â  RICK, YOU CONSIDER DALE AS ONE OF YOUR OWN. HOW ARE YOU HANDLING THIS FROM A PERSONAL ASPECT? RICK HENDRICK: âWell, he is like a member of the family. And, I care about him as a person probably as much or more, than as a race car driver. So, Iâve been concerned. But, Iâve been surprised how hard heâs worked. I shouldnât say that. But he sends me video as proof. But, weâre like a family there at Motorsports and all the drivers and crew chiefs; and you see the team light up with he shows up. Itâs just like anytime you have a member of your family hurt or sick or going through something, everybody wants to rally to help him.Â  I donât think there is any way youâd have gotten Jeff Gordon back in a race car other than helping the organization and helping Dale. And I think thatâs proof of that. We just feel good. Iâve seen the progress. The sponsors have been super. They all care about him. They care about him so much that they want him to be on the cautious side. Weâre not going to make the Chase. We couldnât come back even if he wanted to get back in the car, and I admire that part of him being truthful. You guys (media) know Dale as well as anybody. If you ask him a question, heâs going to give you exactly how he feels and the truth. And, weâre excited about the progress. We are excited about him getting back in the car. I think heâs been unbelievable to share and keep us up to speed and explain what heâs going through. We didnât know. The education of educating us has been great. So, I can see the light now. And I see how taking the pressure off of him, the pressure off the team, the pressure off the sponsors; letâs just have a plan and letâs go with the plan and get him well. Have a chance to test him and come back next year and have him for the long haul.â Â  FOR DR. COLLINS, WITH THE CUMULATIVE AFFECTS OF CONCUSSIONS AND WITH DALEâS HISTORY, HOW LIKELY IS HE TO GET ANOTHER CONCUSSION ONCE HE COMES BACK?Â  FOR DALE, SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING FANS AND MEDIA HAVE SUGGESTED THAT YOU RETIRE. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM? MICKY COLLINS: âIâm very confident in the way weâre approaching this case. Everything that Dale presents makes sense to me. The findings make sense. The improvements make sense. The therapies are taking hold. He wasnât feeling well when we saw him. I could easily see why that was. And seeing his response to treatments has been very positive. So, I am positive that weâre going to get Dale back to being a race car driver and Iâm excited about that prospect. But, again, the stress; thatâs why weâre doing what weâre doing. The only time you run into problems with concussions is when itâs not managed appropriately. And thatâs what weâre doing with this one. Weâre taking the time that we need. Weâre doing the treatments that are needed. And thatâs because we want to make that goal of Dale being able to sustain the normal biomechanical forces that would not produce a return of difficulties. And I think weâre headed in that direction.â DALE EARNHARDT JR.: âYeah, I think that I have the passion and the desire to drive. I enjoy it. I have an amazing team and a great owner. Iâm in such a great position and am enjoying being a part of the sport. My heart is there to continue. And if my doctor says that Iâm physically able to continue, then thatâs an easier decision for me to make. Itâs not something that I think about. Weâre trying to focus on just getting well and getting normal. So, I intentionally really put all those thoughts and concerns and consideration on the back burner until I can really just say that I feel normal. Getting normal and just having a good quality of life going forward for the next many, many years is the first goal. And so, I havenât really put a lot of thought into the future until I get well. âBut my heart wants me to continue and wants me to continue to be working with the guys Iâve got. Iâm only 41. I think I have some good years left. Iâm as good as I have ever been inside the car. My ability to communicated and drive the car and get everything out of it, I feel very confident. I feel like Iâm still an asset to the team and to the company. Rick likes to say we have unfinished business. I certainly feel the same way. We have races to win. We went through this process in 2012. It was very scary and difficult. Micky told me that I would one day be well and I would win races again, and he was right. We got well; and I had some of the greatest years and racing experiences of my career shortly after that. And so, heâs telling me that this is possible again, and I believe it. And if we work hard enough and we really rehab these systems, anything is possible from here on out. So, Iâm very positive and feeling very good and am confident about the future.â Â  Â  Connect with Team Chevy on social media.Â  Like us on Facebook at facebook.com/TeamChevy, follow us on Twitter @TeamChevy, and add +TeamChevy into your Google+ circles.

Buy discounted gift cards Buying gift cards at a discount can save you cash on every Target purchase. For example, CardpoolÂ recently listedÂ available Target gift cards that wereÂ discounted up to 6 percent. Raise recently listed Target git cards for 1.8 percent off. If you arenât particularly mathy, weâll break that down: In essence, it means you are getting up to an extra 6 percent off anything you buy at Target when you use the card. Itâs a no-brainer! Â© Damian Dovarganes/AP Photo Â  2. Sign up for the REDcard Nod your head vigorously the next time the cashier asks you if youâd like to sign up for a Target card. The retail giant offers two TargetÂ REDcardsÂ â a debit card and a store credit card. Saying yes to either of these boasts three major benefits. 5 percent off every purchase Free shipping on every purchase at Target.com 30 extra days on returns Of course, itâs important to note that every time you open a new credit card account, you risk hurting your credit score slightly. And that is something you need to weigh before signing up for the REDcard, especially if you plan to take out a mortgage or another loan and need your credit score to be in tip-top shape. But also remember that the drop in your credit scoreÂ is only temporary, and it may be worth the small ding to your credit if you shop at Target often. Weâre talking 5 percent off every purchase here, people! Â© Robert F. Bukaty/AP Photo Â  3. Shop clearance first If you are going to buy something, why not get it at its cheapest price? Hunting around the store for items marked at clearance rates is a fun challenge for some. For others, itâs a headache. But donât worry. You wonât have to sacrifice savings if you fall into the latter camp. Savvy buyers can find all of Targetâs clearance items atÂ one page on the website. You also will find other special offers here. Â© Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Â  4. Use the Target Cartwheel app correctly Just about every bargain shopper now realizes that signing up for Targetâs Carwheel app can save them money every week. However, not everyone knows how to fully exploit this savings tool. For starters, you donât even need a smartphone to redeem Cartwheel offers. Simply go to the website to browse and assign offers to a unique barcode that you can print out and bring into the store for savings. Sign up for the free Money Talks Newsletter Target also notes that you can even take Cartwheel offers and âpile them on top of other coupons, sales and your debit or credit REDcard savings.â Use the app often for even greater savings. Shoppers are initially allowed 10 offers per transaction, but those who use Cartwheel regularly can unlock âbadges,â which translate to extra offers. Be sure to check Cartwheel offers frequently. New offersÂ come out on Sundays, but many limited-time, high-value offers pop up randomly throughout the week. Â© Jeff Chiu/AP Photo Â  5. Bring a reusable bag Did you know that every time you shop at Target and carry items out in a reusable bag, youÂ save 5 centsÂ off your purchase? Even better, Target saysÂ it givesÂ customers âa 5-cent discount for each reusable bag they use.â Use 10Â bags each week âÂ a conservative estimate if youâre buying groceries and other items for a family of four âÂ and youâve saved 50Â cents. Although that may not sound like much, it adds up to $26 over the course of a year.Â And youâre helping to protect the environment. Talk about a win-win! Â© Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Â  6. Sign up at the Target registry If you have a big upcoming event in your life, sign up at the Target gift registry and you can earn additional savings on the items you need. Sign up in the baby registry and eight weeks prior to your event date, youâll get a 15 percent discount for you, friends and family to complete your registry. Those who use the wedding registry get their discounts after the event date â 15 percent off the items remaining on the registry, plus coupons for family and friends. Finally, the college registry offers a coupon for 15 percent off when you shop for remaining registry gifts online. It kicks in two weeks before the event date. Â© Joe Raedle/Getty Images Â  7. Use a cash-back website to shop If you plan to shop from home by visitingÂ Target.com, make sure toÂ stop at your favoriteÂ cash-back website before making anyÂ purchases. For example, log on to the popular cash-back site EbatesÂ and youâll earn an additional 2 percent cash back on your Target purchases. Do you have other tips for saving at Target?

Banks, Post Offices And Trains Observe Federal Holiday By Julia Glum @superjulia On 09/04/16 AT 8:32 AM Close Monday is Labor Day, an AmericanÂ observance held every September to recognize the achievements of workers. Started in 1882 and codified by Congress in 1894, Labor Day is now seen as the unofficial end of summer. It's also a cause for celebration, because it often means a three-day weekend. If you're off this weekend, you may be wondering where you can go and what you can do. Here's what's open and closedÂ Monday: Labor Day is a federal holiday, which means the government closes most of its nonessential offices. All social security offices are closed, as are most states' departments of motor vehicle (DMVs).Â  Post offices will be closed, and mail won't be delivered Monday. FedEx Express, Ground, Home Delivery and SmartPost are all closed Monday, too. UPS observes Labor Day, as well. Related Stories Get Out Of Town For Labor Day US Gas Prices At The Pump Lowest In More Than A Decade The Federal Reserve and its branches will be closedÂ Monday. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will be closed, as will most locations of major bank chains like Bank of America, TD Bank and Chase Bank. Schools' schedules will vary, but most will be closed on Labor Day. Hospitals and emergency rooms will generally be open, but individual clinics may be closed and specialized staff may be off. For stores, Labor Day is a great opportunity for sales and promotions. Kmart, Target, CVSÂ and Walmart are all open, according to holidayshoppinghours.com. Â RestaurantsÂ will be open Monday, as well, including KFC and Wendy's. Public transit is where things get hairy. On Monday, New York City subways and buses will run on their Sunday schedules. But in Brooklyn, there will be changes on the 2, 3, and 4 lines near Eastern Parkway due to the J'Ouvert parade from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. EDT. In Washington, D.C., trains will run on a Sunday schedule between 7 a.m. and midnight. However, construction will alter the red, orange, blue and silver lines as detailed here.

The government recently allowed 100 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail for food products produced and processed in India. Food Processing Industries Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal is leading a team of officials to London for the purpose, an official said. The UK is home to several big players which India can tap, including Tesco, Marks & Spencer (M&S) and Salisbury. The government has permitted 100 per cent foreign direct investment in trading of food products, including through e-commerce, to provide a boost to the countryâs food processing sector. Food Processing Secretary A K Srivastava had said Walmart, the worldâs largest retailer, is keen to retail processed food in India. The food processing sector received FDI worth $1.04 billion during April 2014 to March 2015. The industry was valued at $39.71 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11 per cent to $65.4 billion by 2018. Some of the major investments received in the last two years include Linde Groupâs investment of $200 million in the seafood segment in Andhra Pradesh, and the US-based Mondelez Internationalâs new manufacturing plant in the state.

The buildings house homeless women and children, a dream that Green has had for many years. âEveryone deserves a place to call home,â Green said. Posted: Nov. 10, 2010 0 Comments SHARE By Cathy Reeder Correspondent Posted: Nov. 10, 2010 0 STUART ? MISS Butterfly Gardens on Tuesday opened the first homeless housing facility in Martin County, a 20-unit apartment complex to house 34 women and up to 70 children. The facility will accept residents from Martin, St. Lucie or Indian River counties, thanks to funds from state and federal sources. It is a partner in the Treasure Coast Homeless Services Council. The MISS. concept is to give mothers and their children a community of support, said MISS Executive Director Schonna Green. "This has taken blood, sweat, tears, and everybody's help," she said. MISS stands for Mothers and Infants Striving for Success, and the ground rules at Butterfly Gardens allow each woman to stay up to two years as long as she works, goes to school to improve job skills, helps run the facility and attends mandatory trainings. Residents do not pay rent at the facility, which opened Oct. 1. Instead, they pay a $300 monthly "program fee." Lynnette Simmons, who moved into her two-bedroom unit with toddler Genesis on Oct. 1, said the rules are an easy price to pay for the chance to get on her feet and build a good life for her daughter. "We have a nice place to live, and it is family-centered. The mothers all have each other, and the children have each other to play with," she said. "It's our own little community. "So there is a curfew and mandatory meetings and things you have to do. Once you reach a certain age, once you have a child, you don't want to party all the time, and you don't want to just hang around. You want to build a good life for your child. "Here they help you do that. They help you be self-sufficient. If you don't have a degree, they show you how to get it so you can afford to live on your own and take care of your family on your own." John Lex and Joe Rivera are truck drivers from the Walmart distribution center in Fort Pierce. With six other drivers, they assembled the donated beds and planted the landscaping and hung the curtains ? "whatever they asked us to do," Lex said. There were also three special volunteers who belong just to the children at Butterfly Gardens ? Angelika Watkins, 58, Ernestine Clark, 74, and Kay Moore, 52. "We are the grandmothers, and we take care of the children every Monday, Wednesday and Friday when they come home after school," Watkins said. On-site child-care staff and other mothers take care of the children the other two days. "We give them snacks and play with them, and listen to their day. We put their report cards up on the board and discuss their schoolwork and do activities with them." The grandmothers were proud to report that every child in Butterfly Gardens made As on the report cards that came home this week. "That's what happens when you give a child a place to sleep and a sense of belonging," MISS board President Sylvia Taylor said. To Donate Call: (772) 781-4063 Visit: MISS Butterfly Gardens, 4434 S.E.

Plans are currently being made for its official kickoff.Â Â âBut just because itâs campaign time, it doesnât mean that we havenât been busy with otherÂ programs,â he stated. The CAUWâs most recentÂ initiative, Jeans for Teens, has wrapped up again. It was the 13th year for the program, and itâs possible with help from Kurtz Bros. The initiative helps area teenagers receive some new school clothes. Board member Brenda Terry emphasized that Jeans for Teens has concluded for this year and will not resume until next fall. âHowever,Â the United Way does need donations to enable this important and self-esteem building program to continue,â she stated. âYou can still make a donation to help this special once-a-year event.â People are being requested to please make checks payable to the Clearfield Area United Way, 18 N. Second St., P.O. Box 1430, Clearfield, PA 16830 with âJeans for Teensâ written in the memo line. According to Terry, the United Way worked with area agencies, churches and department stores to make Jeans for Teens possible and to identify young adolescents who would benefit from it. âTeens have to wear presentable clothing to school on a daily basis, and some of their parents just canât afford it,â she stated. âFeeling accepted, getting along with peers and having a positive self-esteem are all essential to kids, and at this middle and high school age, how you look and dress can mean so much.â Through a special partnership, CAUW had enough money again this year for each child to be given $100 for new school clothes. âWe appreciate JCPenney and Wal-Mart for giving extra goodies to enable the total purchase to be even more,â stated Terry. More specifically, she thanked store representatives Rhonda Hamilton of JCPenney and Josh Kunkle of Wal-Mart. CAUW helps 24 member agencies throughout Clearfield County, such as libraries, scouts, day cares, senior programs, Red Cross classes, the YMCA, etc. President Debbie Bowser added, âWe ask that you be as generous as possible when giving to United Way. With funding cutbacks affecting many member agencies, we need to fill those gaps.â The CAUW kickoff luncheon will be held in mid-October and more information will released at a later date.

With distributors placed strategically around the world NutriExport is able to effectively export nutraceuticals, supplements, functional foods and beverages and other kinds of health and wellness products.

Sep 4th 2016, 9:00 AM 29,577 Views 7 Comments Share4 Tweet Email3 ITâS A DAY of rest, and you may be in the mood for a quiet corner and a comfy chair. Weâve hand-picked the weekâs best reads for you to savour. 1. The roots of Islamophobia in France Source: Shutterstock/M-SUR Nick Riemer, a political activist, writes about his thoughts on the roots of Islamophobia in France, and how he believes the French state âhas excluded and exploited Muslims for decadesâ. (Jacobin, approx 20 mins reading time) Children have watched as their parents are handcuffed or dragged from their beds by heavily armed police. In the first three months of the state of emergency enacted after last yearâs Bataclan attack, 274 people were placed under house arrest, the vast majority of them Muslims. Racial profiling is rampant. 2. Was she framed? Kelli Petersâ car was searched outside the school her daughter went to, and drugs â enough to send her to jail â were found inside. But she insists she was framed. (LA Times, approx 64 mins reading time) The next morning, Shaver sat in the police chiefâs conference room surrounded by department brass and detectives, walking them through a case that had quickly seized the interest of the command staff.It seemed a much stranger scenario than a suburban mom with a pot-and-pill habit. He had asked Kelli Peters: If the drugs arenât yours, how did they get in your car? âI have an enemy,â she said. Â 3. The woman who discovered Indiaâs first HIV casesÂ  Source: Shutterstock/Jarun Ontakrai Microbiology student Sellappan Nirmala was tasked to screen people for HIV in 1985. It was pretty much âunthinkableâ in the country â but her work meant she became a pioneer in her field. (BBC, approx 10 mins reading time) Over three months, she gathered more than 80 samples. She had no gloves, no safety equipment. And the sex workers had no idea what they were being tested for.Â âI didnât tell them that I was looking for Aids,â she said. âThey were all illiterate and even if I had told them, they wouldnât have understood what Aids was. They thought I was taking samples for venereal diseases.â 4. A man with a head transplant planÂ  Will it eventually be possible to transplant a personâs head onto a new body? Thatâs what these audacious scientists believe â and thereâs a young man counting on them. (The Atlantic, approx 38 mins reading time) More troubling are the rash, unfounded claims he makes about the likelihood of the surgery succeeding, and his habit of promoting his work largely through the mediaâa practice that most scientists consider unseemly, if not unethical. His critics describe him, on blogs and tech websites, as a âcorruptâ and âdelusionalâ liar âwith a knife and a mad glitter in his eye.â He âglibly glides past major problems,â they say, with his âHuman Centipedeâlevel medical horrorshow.â His plan is insane, âlike James Bond villain insane,â and will amount to âan elaborate act of slow torture and murder.â 5. How to trace a gun Source: Shutterstock/Christopher Slesarchik These police officers have one of the toughest jobs in the force. Why is it so tough? Well, they have to trace guns, but they canât use computers. Good thing that theyâre âgeniusesââ¦ (GQ, approx 34 mins reading time) Anytime a cop in any jurisdiction in America wants to connect a gun to its owner, the request for help ends up here, at the National Tracing Center, in a low, flat, boring building that belies its past as an IRS facility, just off state highway 9 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in the eastern panhandle of the state, a town of some 17,000 people, a Walmart, a JCPenney, and various dollar stores sucking the life out of a quaint redbrick downtown. On any given day, agents here are running about 1,500 traces; they do about 370,000 a year. 6.Â Try my hijabÂ  Nazma Khan wears a hijab, and she knows it makes other people treat her differently. But she also wants to show people why she really wears it. (Narratively, approx 19 mins reading time) Khan first began wearing the hijab at age eleven. She was eager to be covered and to look as âfeminineâ as her mother, aunts and other women around her. âWhen I don the hijab, I am not judged for my exterior beauty, but rather my character and intellect,â says Khan. âThis is true liberation. Thus, to me this is feminine.â â¦AND A CLASSIC FROM THE ARCHIVESâ¦ Source: Shutterstock/Justin Dennis This story has to be read to be believed â and itâs not an easy read. Itâs the story of a porn star, a drug lord, and a brutal mass murder. (Longform, approx 60 mins reading time) Since the late Sixties, Holmes had traded on his natural endowment. His penis, when erect, according to legend, measured between eleven and fifteen inches in length. Recently, however, Holmesâs biggest commodity had been trouble. He was freebasing one hit of coke every ten or fifteen minutes, swallowing forty to fifty Valium a day to cut the edge. The drugs affected his penis; he couldnât get it up, he couldnât work in porn. Now he was a drug delivery boy for the Wonderland Gang.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds David Bruce: What to do with your old smartphone Sunday SepÂ 4,Â 2016Â atÂ 2:00Â AM SepÂ 4,Â 2016Â atÂ 5:43Â AM It's time for a new smartphone, and you're not sure what to do with your old phone that has served you well for years. You're not alone. Phone technology hasn't evolved all that much in the last few years, according to Consumer Reports, and there are several different ways you can earn some spending money ÂÂ or a discount on your new smartphone. Not all cellphones will earn you money. You probably won't get a dime for that Nokia flip phone you have been using since 2003. But if your old phone has a high-definition display at least four inches wide, 32 gigabytes of storage or more, and support for 4G LTE networks, there is likely someone who would buy your phone, Consumer Reports said in a recent article. Here are a couple of ways to earn money for your old smartphone: Trade it. One option is to exchange your current phone for a new one with your wireless carrier. Verizon, Sprint and AT & T often run specials, where they offer money for your old phoneÂ Â provided you sign a new contract with them. They might even pay off the balance of your current contract. It's important to read the fine print when considering these options, Consumer Reports warned. Carriers often require you to submit an itemized bill from your current carrier to prove your account is in good standing. You also will likely have to prove the phone you are exchanging is the one you are currently using. Sell it. There seem to be a growing number of places that are willing to buy your old smartphone without making you take on a new contract. In some cases, you don't even have to deal with another human. EcoATM has automated kiosks across the country, including two at the Millcreek Mall and another at Wal-Mart, 2711 Elm St. It scans the device and pays you, in cash, what it thinks the device is worth based on model, condition and its value on the resale market. You must present a valid ID to be scanned when selling a device to ecoATM. Keep it. If you don't receive a good offer for your old phone, hold onto it as a backup or emergency phone. Having a spare can save you money by allowing you to avoid buying phone insurance or extended warranties. If you decide to sell or trade in your old smartphone, make sure you clear all of your personal information. Check your old phone's instructions on how to perform a "factory data reset."Â  About Us Sections News Sports Entertainment Erie Living Opinion Classifieds Cars Jobs Real Estate Weekly Ads Contact Us Staff Directory Frequently Asked Questions Website Questions Place a Classified Ad Customer Service Advertise with us Subscribe Subscription Options Membership Program Subscribe to TV Times Your Account Problems with My Delivery Renew My Subscription Vacation Stop Pay My Bill Change My Address Account Summary Propel Marketing Â© Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Joe Schiavoni of Boardman continues to get basic facts about the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow and other e-schools wrong. Schiavoni writes that ECOT has the worst graduation rate in the nation. Thatâs not true. In fact, ECOT graduates more students than many public school in the nation, and there are dozens of public schools in Ohio that have a lower graduation rate than ECOT. In Sen. Schiavoniâs nearby city of Youngstown, the public schools have a chronic absentee rate of over 30 percent, one school has a 54 percent rate. Unfortunately, Schiavoni works to protect these failing schools even as they cost taxpayers over $7,000 a year more per pupil. If all the students in Youngstown schools went to an e-school, the taxpayers would save over $20 million a year. The numbers for how much Cincinnati taxpayers would save would be even larger. Thatâs why Cincinnati Public Schools spend over $350,000 in advertising every year â because if parents knew there was a better option for their children theyâd take it. Sen. Schiavoni should stop attacking school choice in Ohio. Rick Teeters, Columbus The writer is superintendent of Columbus-based ECOT. Renounce Clintons over unfair treatment of US organized labor I am writing this letter to the media for all of us. Who am I? Really no one of any worldly standards; I am a Christian first, an American second, and a union supporter third. Letâs deal with the issues facing our families regarding the reduction of income for them. The Democratic national party has created an environment of dependence for minorities and low-income white families. They control your votes and your path out of poverty by bringing immigrants to take your jobs and lower your wages. I worked 42 years for the same company. I stood with my union brothers and sisters on the picket lines with our jobs in jeopardy, but we did not worry about the color of our skin. We were union. I saw the union and the management treat us disrespectfully. We blue-collar workers stuck together. Minorities still have a harder time getting their abilities noticed because of the prejudice of others. I am asking my union brothers and sisters to renounce Hillary Clinton for president. She will outsource our jobs in America; President Bill Clinton did with NAFTA. The DNC is slowly pulling away from supporting unions. Robert L. Kirkland, Leetonia Workers in the region, Donât let Trump fool you There is no excuse for supporting a racist, sexist like Donald Trump, but he will get the support of a lot of people who during the debates said that he wasnât fit to be president, and most of them came from his own party. We have a huge problem with the trade deficit, and on this issue Trump is all over the place. We have to get China to raise the value of its currency against the dollar. Currency manipulation is a big issue for America. One reason why nothing is being done to put pressure on China to do so is that a lot of American companies who sold out their workers and moved to China are not interested in seeing it raise the value of its currency. General Electric is producing a lot of goods in China and sending their garbage back to the U.S. They donât want to see their profits lowered by raising of the Chinese yuan. Wal-Mart has also set up shop in China, and it is just like GE. The good signs shown by Trump are that he is against cuts to Social Security and Medicare, but who knows if he would flip-flop on these issues because this anti-middle-class Congress wants to gut both programs. American workers feel that the system is rigged against them and some would turn to Trump for guidance. Beware! Before Trump, the Republican-run house and Senate put the screws to American workers with tax cuts for the rich and their war against labor unions and raising the minimum wage. Do American workers think that Trump will go up against the Republicans who helped him get the nomination? That will never happen. So, the answer to the trade problem is not only do workers have to vote no on Trump but they have to get these corporate loving Republicans out of office. Bud McKelvey, Hermitage, Pa. Anti-frackers bring smoke and mirrors to ballot yet again Can it be? Oh no, not again, is the public once again going to face another round by the anti-frackers and their smoke and mirror rhetoric? Have you not faced enough humiliation? I guess not because here you come again with the same old song and dance that fracking will bring the apocalypse for us all. We need to have the vision to see into the future, to see the benefits that fracking will bring to the Valley. New jobs, new business and a new beginning will arise out of the shadows of the mills of yesteryear. But that will only happen if we have the vision to see it. Tell the doomsday preachers itâs time for a new beginning in Youngstown. Jim Eidel, Beaver Twp. Words of praise for Vindicator coverage from longtime reader I have been reading The (Youngstown) Vindicator since I was a young teenager and began to have an interest in the news. I am now 72 years old. Thank you for servicing our area. You are our only newspaper, and one would think that your staff would become complacent and just sit back and have a âwhateverâ attitude. But I have found that you cover the news extremely well in an unbiased manner. We are fortunate to have a publication such as yours. For a small town, we have a first-rate newspaper just as good as any of the âbig cityâ tabloids. Thank you for serving us for such a long time. The editor and staff are to be highly commended.

Art Design Infographics Photography Video/Film Content Marketing CONTACT This Fake Store Is Selling Something Surprising By Tracy Tonnu September 2, 2016 Leave a comment When it comes to buying lingerie, Fruit of the Loom is not usually the brand most women think of, but the company is looking to change that. âWelcome toÂ FrÃ¼t,â the companyâs latest campaign by agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, includes a popup lingerie store, called FrÃ¼t, that wasÂ opened to entice consumers to view their product in a different light. The popup store was designed to look like a chic lingerie boutique, but when customers entered to take a browse, they were surprised with the fact that the store was actually selling the panties in a bag that you can pickup at your local Target or WalMart. The videos of the campaign show shoppers perusing through the shop, completely unaware that the product they were looking at was actually the familiar product that they had grown up with. A false wall in the back of the store sporting the FrÃ¼t logo spins to reveal the Fruit of the Loom logo, surprising the shopper browsing through the floral printed underwear. Although the experience itself may be awkward for the shoppers, the brand completes its objective effectively: Enlighten consumers on the fact that quality underwear doesnât have to come at such a high price.

The leader of Surrey's Creep Catchers, Ryan Laforge, vows to continue on. (CBC) Related Stories Creep Catcher's hunt for online predators sparks police warning 'I'm not a pedophile': Man caught by Calgary 'creep catcher' speaks out 'Creep Catcher' teen risks becoming the accused, lawyer warns Surrey RCMPÂ areÂ describing efforts by citizen-led groups toÂ 'out' online childÂ sexual predators as getting in the way of legitimate police work. "The RCMP does not condone this activity, nor do we recommend the activity. We believe it only increasesÂ the risk to the public," said Insp. Tyler Svendson to CBC News, adding that he does not believe any successful charge has come due to efforts from groups like Creep Catcher. Creep Catcher's hunt for online predators sparks police warning Calgary man in 'creep catcher' video says his reputation unfairly tarnished Creep Catcher'sÂ members pose as underage girls online with the aim of trapping men who are trying to hook-up with the girlsÂ for sex. After sharing some messages, they arrange to meet, often in public locations like parking lots. Video recordings of the ensuing confrontations, along with the prior text messages, are then posted online in order to shame the men. "They're not professionals, they don't understand the case law and often it's very hard to obtain the evidence," said Svendson. "With the RCMP we have a very high success rate in all of our investigations because we have highly trained online covert investigators." 'You know he's a creep' Still despite several warnings from police, Ryan Laforge, who is the president of Creep Catcher's Surrey chapter, saidÂ nothing police say will deter the group. "Never," he said.Â "We're not trying necessarily have everyone arrested. It would be great, but I would rather have their faces out there for good. "So everyone knows when they see them in the Walmart, when they see them at the bus, when they see them at the swimming pool, wherever you are with your kids at the park, you see that face, you know he's a creep." Laforge saidÂ his groupÂ has had overwhelming support online. Insp. Svendson saidÂ often the group just ends up duplicating work police are already doing, which can slow down RCMP investigations.

(Meredith Cummings) Print Email Meredith Cummings By Meredith Cummings AL.com Follow on Twitter on September 05, 2016 at 9:00 AM, updated September 06, 2016 at 8:52 AM comments When dad turned 75 and went back to college, it didn't surprise me. His work ethic is Andy Griffith solid. Labor Day is to celebrate the working man. My parents are the standard by which I measure the value of work. That's why when my dad turned 75 this summer and decided to go back to college, it didn't surprise me at all. His work ethic is Andy Griffith solid. He went back to college surrounded by teens that could be his grandkids. I like to imagine what they thought about the cool old dude. He went in early to class, stayed late and worked hard. Very, very hard. For a while he didn't even have a computer at home so that he could practice the programs he was learning. He just memorized the textbook then tried to put that knowledge into practice in class. That's like learning to type by reading about it, with no actual way to try it. There is something noble about a generation whose work ethic is so blatantly in your face. There is something to be said for packing a coffee mug instead of a lunch box every day and heading out the door to school. My dad wants to work as long as the Lord allows him to do so. In this political season, I keep hearing a lot about how America needs to be great again. And while I do at times get mad at a country that doesn't always value its elders, my dad was able to go back to school at 75 years old to try to keep working. Tell me America isn't great. Recently K-12 students returned to school en masse, complete with the accompanying social media selfies (by them) and "First Day of Grade X!" photos (by their parents). Dad wouldn't let me take a photo despite the outlandish things I tried. "Dad!" I said, motioning toward his front door in Springville, Alabama. "You stand here with this tiny backpack and turn and smile at the camera casually when you walk out the door. Hold your coffee mug, because that's just funny." Crickets chirping. Then dad let out a nervous laugh. Virgil Cummings made it through the recession at a time when I had my doubts. As a journalist, I've seen my fair share of gray get pushed out of jobs to retire early. Unfortunately those are also the people with sacred institutional knowledge. So three years ago when my dad got laid off from his job I didn't really see it coming, since he had survived one of the worst economic downturns in our country's history. Losing his job was problematic for the usual financial reasons, but also because my dad lives to work and works to live. He has battled rheumatoid arthritis since 1996 and a doctor told him work would keep him alive. Meredith Cummings and her father in 2011Meredith CummingsÂ  Dad is a enigma. He can speak classical Latin, if anyone actually did speak classical Latin. (With a name like Virgil I feel that he was probably destined for this.) He can write a sonnet like Shakespeare, which is probably why he and mom have been married for 52 years. Yet he also enjoys pickled pigs feet and boiled peanuts, as any good Southern man would. Despite all of his artistic creativity and love for the humanities, he is a structural steel draftsman. When people ask me what that is, I usually explain that it has something to do with blueprints and math, yet he always patiently explained to his math-challenged daughter that he checks drawings to make sure buildings don't fall down. As a kid I thought that was pretty cool. Especially when he worked on Disneyworld. My dad wants, needs and loves his job. I've never seen anyone love to get up at 4:30 a.m., pack a lunch and zip off to work like he does. So when faced with the prospect - but certainly not above - a job cleaning floors at the local Wal-Mart he pushed back, nose to the grindstone. He went back to college to learn computer programs to continue to do the work he's been doing since before there were computers, just to stay employed. I was skeptical, then in awe. Then fiercely proud. Labor Day is to celebrate the working man. But what happens in America when that man can no longer work, despite his intense desire to? I'm on pins and needles to find out.

She previously worked for the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones as an editor and a reporter. Follow @nishagopalanhk Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Sep 5, 2016 2:01 AM EDT (Updated Oct 25, 2016 12:33 AM EDT ) YUM! BRANDS INC +0.77 At Closing, Jan 6th 64.42 USD MCDONALD'S CORP +1.06 At Closing, Jan 6th 120.76 USD KFC's partnership with an Alibaba affiliate puts pressure on the Golden ArchesÂ in China more than ever. By allying with a backerÂ of the country's top food delivery website, KFC owner Yum Brands has taken a step toward solving the dilemma of slowing growth in its biggest market outside the U.S.Â It's a deal that McDonald's, which is also in the throes of selling its China business, will do well to match. Yum and McDonald's are among a clutch of Western brands that have realized they need a Chinese partner to stay on top of shifting consumer tastes in the nation. The price of not getting that strategy right has meant retreat in recent years for brands from Tesco and B&Q to Best Buy. For McDonald's and Yum, both of which have been hurt by food-safety scandals in China, the challenge is not only to improve their reputation but also to stay on top of a moveÂ toward healthier foods, capitalize on consumption growth in smaller cities where they have littleÂ presence, and most importantly, joinÂ the Chinese rush to perform ever more daily tasksÂ online. Yum's share of the market for fast food from major chains has dropped from close to 40 percent in 2012 to 30.2 percent last year, while McDonald's has slid from a high of 16.5 percent in 2013 to 13.8 percent, according to data from Euromonitor International. McDonald's has about 2,200 outlets in the country. Yum has 7,200 outlets in China, including Pizza Hut restaurants. Not So Good Yum and McDonald's have seen their share of the Chinese market for fast food from major chains decline Source: Euromonitor Selling a piece of the China business toÂ private-equity firm Primavera Capital and Alibaba's Ant Financial will move Yum up the path of online relevance faster than its U.S. competitor.Â Ant is the owner of China's top payments platform and holds a stake in food-delivery website Eleme, key piecesÂ of the jigsaw needed to help Yum appeal to customers who want to order and pay for food through their mobile phones. McDonald's restaurants in China 2,200 In Primavera, Yum also getsÂ one of the country's top dealmakers: Founder Fred Hu is theÂ former Goldman Sachs chairman in charge of Greater China and will serve as chairman of Yum China, which will be spun off from the parent into a separate company next month. Admittedly, Primavera and Ant will buyÂ only a small minority stake in Yum China -- less than 6 percent initially. Still, that emphasizes the difficulty for McDonald's, which is seeking a buyer for the whole business. Unlike Yum,Â McDonald's has no plans for a listing of its China operations. In common with its rival, though, the companyÂ has realized that local partners and franchising are the way forward. Most McDonald's restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea are directly owned by the company. The chain aims eventually to have 95 percent of restaurants in Asia under local ownership, it said in March. The conundrum for McDonald's is that handing over the reins to local partners may risk its brand, already dented by a 2014 food-safety scare. The company has imposed stringent deal conditions such as a three-year ban on senior management changes, Bloomberg reported in MayÂ -- though this has had the effect of deterring bidders. McDonald's has attracted only a few Chinese suitorsÂ and none has the online heft that Ant brings. The interested parties (their private equity partners aside) aren't known for either online consumer expertise or retail exposure. The roster so far includes bad-loan manager China Cinda Asset Management and dairy producer Beijing Sanyuan Foods.Â Sanyuan's largest shareholder is state-owned Beijing Capital Agribusiness Group, which runs some McDonald's restaurants in Beijing.Â Chinese state conglomerate Citic Group, which has only a modest retail presence, is also in the running.Â  There's littleÂ danger McDonald's would ever have to retreat from China. The chain has been chalking up gains in same-store sales this year, after several quarters of declines.Â It remains China's second-most-popular fast-food brand, according to Euromonitor. Still, both McDonald's and YumÂ face a mounting threat as Chinese-style fast food from brands such as Dicos, (whose fried chicken retails for a third less than KFC) and CNHLS gain market share. China Revival McDonald's revenue from its high-growth markets including China is picking up this year Source: Bloomberg Footnote: McDonald's high-growth markets include China, Russia and South Korea. The search for a partner is key. McDonald's needs one that's nimble enough to adapt not just to changing tastesÂ but to the rise in online shopping, especially through mobile devices. Now that Alibaba is spoken for, the list of potential Internet partners is short.Â A do-it-yourself e-commerce operation in China hardly looks viable. That's a lessonÂ Wal-Mart took to heart in June when it decided to sell its Yihaodian online grocer to JD.com, China's second-largest Internet retailer after Alibaba. Yihaodian's growth had withered after Wal-Mart bought the site in 2012. Final bids for McDonald's China business are due next week, and a new-economy partnerÂ could yet emerge. The next best option would be a group with retail expertise and a nationwide reach. Anything less, and McDonald's may start looking like leftover pickings. There's not much less appetizing than fast food that's been allowed to go cold. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Rainbow Seniors Executive Director Ed Cedarbaum introduces the candidates for the state Senate and state Representative offices at the Berkshire Athenaeum in Pittsfield on Saturday. Republican State Senate candidate Chris Canning introduces herself. The event was hosted by the Rainbow Seniors organization at the Berkshire Athenaeum in Pittsfield. Candidates for the state Senate and state Representative offices gather to introduce themselves and meet members of the LGBTQ and senior communities. Posted Tuesday, September 6, 2016 4:42 am By Derek Gentile dgentile@berkshireeagle.com @DerekGentile on Twitter Photo Gallery | State Rep. and Senate candidates meet with Rainbow Seniors PITTSFIELD â The seven local candidates for contested public office in Berkshire County tried to carve out their own respective positions on the progressive platform in a candidates' forum at the Berkshire Athenaeum on Saturday afternoon. A total of 52 people attended the event in the library's auditorium. The event was co-sponsored by the Rainbow Seniors of Berkshire County and the Age-Friendly Berkshire Task Force. The event was open to the public, although it was populated, for the most part, by older residents, most of whom were from Pittsfield. Rainbow Seniors organizer Edward Sederbaum, who co-moderated the event with Age Friendly organizer Bobbi Orsi, explained that he and Orsi wanted to get some sense of where all the candidates stood on senior issues and issues concerning to the LGBTQ community. All seven candidates attended the event. This included state Senate candidates Andrea Harrington, Adam Hinds and Rinaldo del Gallo, all Democrats, and Republican candidate Christine Canning. In addition, the three candidates for the state representative race attended, including incumbent Rep. Tricia Farley-Bouvier and fellow Democrat Michael Bloomberg and Independent candidate Chris Connell. For Democrats Harrington, Hinds, Del Gallo, Farley-Bouvier and Bloomberg, the Democratic primary is Sept. 8. The winners there will meet Canning and Connell in the general election Nov. 8. Not every candidate answered every question. But all seven candidates, in different ways, indicated their support for LGBTQ causes. Canning, the lone candidate representing the GOP on the panel, described herself as a "progressive Republican" when it came to most issues, including those directly affecting the LGBTQ community, adding that she was "tired of labels" and that the needs of the LGBTQ community were as valid as any. "The first thing you learn as a legislator is to listen," said Farley-Bouvier, who admitted that before she was elected, she did not know many members of the LGBTQ community. She suggested that medical professionals in particular needed training in dealing with that strata of individuals. Hinds said he believed the LGBTQ community is statistically more vulnerable as it ages than other senior citizens, in part because they tend not to have children as caregivers. Harrington said she would like to see more education about LGBTQ issues in school, particularly younger children. Bloomberg suggested that improved health care for seniors and the LGBTQ community was a "basic right." Regarding spiraling drug costs, all seven hopefuls were in favor of some way to cap costs. Connell suggested improved transparency in how drug companies set prices would be a way to keep the costs reasonable. "It's very simple," said Del Gallo. "Single-payer health care system. That's it. Single-payer system." It was a sentiment to which Bloomberg agreed. Farley-Bouvier said she believes the way drug companies set costs "is a crime, and should be treated as a crime." Harrington suggested that "taking Big Money out of politics" would solve this and many other issues. In a more general discussion, six of the seven candidates were not wild about the new planned Super Walmart at the Stanley Business Park. Connell, who is also a member of the Pittsfield City Council, said he had not made up his mind yet. A survey he took of the seven businesses that would potentially surround the Walmart saw six owners in favor of the store, he said. "This is not what will bring people to Pittsfield," said Bloomberg. Del Gallo took it a step further. "I think it would be the end of the Stanley Business Park," he said. Contact Derek Gentile at 413-496-6251.

A couple of readers have asked about the status of two developing stores in the area â Kroger at Buckwalter Place and The Fresh Market at the intersection of U.S. 278 and Burnt Church Road â and I have some answers. There are walls up at Bluffton Fresh Market site, but what else is new? First, letâs tackle Kroger, since itâs supposed to be the mac-daddy Kroger of Beaufort county. The store planned for Buckwalter Place is a whooping 113,000-square-foot Marketplace, which is a regular Kroger that also includes home goods, decor, bed and bath items, a kitchen and small appliances section, a home office department, toys and even a âbaby world.â You know a place is huge when it has an entire world in it. When I visited Buckwalter Place on Wednesday morning, I noticed the land has been cleared in that area, but not much else is going on. Developers promised to break ground earlier this year, and theyâve obviously delivered, but letâs be honest, the real date we want to know is when this place is going to open. I called up Southeastern Development Associates on Wednesday and havenât heard any word. Iâve noticed during my time as a retail reporter that once a project has or appears to extend past its original completion date, itâs harder to get answers, i.e. Pineland Station, Okatie Crossing. Across from the cleared lot sits Publix in the same shopping center, and I got to thinking: Who in their right mind would ever build a grocery store right next to another grocery store? Would Publix shutter after the opening of mac-daddy Kroger? Would consumers rip their hair out in the middle of the parking lot over the stress of deciding which grocery store to walk into? Was Dennis the Menace running this development? Itâs almost like watching an old Western showdown played out in slow motion â because hey, these things take time â as the grocers face each other head on. Iâm not an expert (yet). Iâm just a consumer, like you. So I decided to call someone up who might have some answers. Marianne Bickle, a retail professor from the University of South Carolina, said that two grocery stores right next to each other encourages competition, and that itâs actually a good thing. âIt wonât hurt Publix, and it wonât hurt Kroger. It will actually help the consumers,â she said. Not the answer I was expecting. She said the competition between the two retailers would make them think smarter and encourage people to shop more. If anything, she said retailers want stores similar to each other in the same vicinity, and these stores donât want to be the only retailer in their category around. Bickle also said people would competitively shop, meaning go to Publix for one thing and Kroger for another. âWhen youâre talking about groceries, (consumers) will definitely cross the road for that,â she said. Thereâs no telling whether direct competition like this will also throw some competitive prices the customerâs way, according to Bickle, but I think if you keep an eye out, we buyers might end up winning this shootout with some major sale prices. However, donât expect either Kroger or Publix to give away their products. âBoth are two big powerhouses; they are not going out of business,â Bickle said. So, sure, itâs a new concept and weird to see â the Publix that sits across from Walmart in Hardeeville is the only other similar situation Iâve noticed in the area. But think about it: When is the last time you questioned why a McDonaldâs bordered a Burger King? The answer is, you probably havenât. Instead, you were thinking about a juicy Whopper or Mickey Dâs french fries. Or better yet, how you could have both. With similar retailers next to one another, we can have our cake and eat it, too. Now, onto The Fresh Market.
