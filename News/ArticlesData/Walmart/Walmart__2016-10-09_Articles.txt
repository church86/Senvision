Erin Peters, 35, said she felt humiliated when she was handcuffed and questioned when she was stopped Friday at an Idaho Walmart after being mistaken for 18-year-old Whitley Evenson. Evenson, of Independence, Missouri, is charged with killing her six-week-old baby, Derek Walker, in September 2015, The Coeur d'Alene Press newspaper reported. 'I felt humiliated in front of Walmart, crying,' Peters said after being questioned for 45 minutes.  Breast cancer patient, Erin Peters (left), 35, said she was mistaken for Missouri teenager, Whitley Evenson (right), 18, who was wanted for the death of her infant daughter Peters said members of the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force believed she was the Missouri fugitive because her hair is very short.  She said she shaved her hair because of cancer treatments.  Task force members went through her purse, her phone and her Facebook account, 'ransacking everything', she said.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Game-changing immunotherapy drug DOUBLES head and neck... Police who spent 10 years looking for a fugitive finally... Share this article Share 'The way they went about this was so wrong,' Peters added.  FBI spokesman Richard Collodi said he regrets that Peters was inconvenienced but the task force had to be sure.  He said suspects often come up with creative excuses to avoid arrest. Peters (left) said members of the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force believed she was Evenson (pictured right in 2015) because her hair is very short. Peters said she shaved her hair because of cancer treatments Evenson was booked into Kootenai County jail until she can be extradited back to Jackson County, Missouri, where she is charged with second-degree murder. Prosecutors accused Evenson of suffocating her infant, Derek Walker (pictured)  'I'm confident she was treated professionally,' Collodi said. The task force had information Evenson would be at that Walmart, Collodi said, Evenson was arrested later on Friday at the store.  She was out on bond when she failed to appear for a court hearing in July.  Evenson was booked into Kootenai County jail until she can be extradited back to Jackson County, Missouri, where she is charged with second-degree murder. Jackson County prosecutors accused Evenson of killing her son by putting her hand over the child’s mouth until he suffocated. Police said Evenson and her boyfriend, Leo Walker, had broken up five days before the child's death and he had moved out, according to KMBC.  Walker and the baby's grandmother believe that Evenson killed the baby as revenge for the breakup. The couple also has a one-year-old daughter, who Evenson's brother has been raising.  Read more: Teen murder suspect captured at Walmart; breast cancer patient mistaken for fugitive - Coeur d'Alene Press: Local News Teen mom charged with smothering baby appears in court Share or comment on this article e-mail 8 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Three people charged in connection with Walmart theft Gazette Staff 7:11 p.m. EDT October 10, 2016 File photo (Photo: Journal & Courier) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE CHILLICOTHE - Three people were charged after a reported theft from Walmart Sunday morning. Cassandra L. Hacker, 26, of Chillicothe, was charged with theft, criminal trespassing, and possession of drug abuse instruments. Jennifer J. McDaniel, 34, of Waverly, was charged with theft and possession of drug abuse instruments. David D. Maynard Jr., 41, of Waverly, was charged with receiving stolen property. Chillicothe Police were called to Walmart at 8:05 a.m. Sunday after store loss prevention officials saw a woman concealing items in the store, according to police reports. The woman was later identified as Hacker, and was detained just outside the store. Officers found suspected clothing items inside a purse Hacker was carrying. As the officer was speaking with Hacker, store officials said another woman who was with Hacker, identified as McDaniel, was concealing items and attempting to cash a check that was not hers, reports show. McDaniel said the check belonged to her grandfather. A man approached the group and said he was waiting on the women after driving them to the store. The man was identified as Maynard, who said he didn’t know the women were allegedly stealing from Walmart, but later told police he returned a set of sheets one of the woman allegedly brought out to the car and received a gift card worth nearly $60 for them, according to reports. Officers searched his vehicle and found two purses where officers found a total of 27 hypodermic needles, two spoons, five blank checks and a prescription bottle with another man’s name on them. Hacker said the man gave checks and pills to her, reports indicated. Further charges are pending, but all three are expected to be arraigned in Chillicothe Municipal Court Tuesday.

The unidentified woman was buying groceries with her husband and a relative on Sunday at the store in Payson when she went into labor. A woman was shopping with her husband in a Payson, Utah Walmart when she unexpectedly gave birth Payson Fire Department spokesman Terry Reilly says it was not the woman's first pregnancy and things 'progressed pretty rapidly.' 'The baby was delivered right there in the checkout line,' Reilly told The Daily Herald.  Employees and other customers had to help deliver the bundle, which eagerly came out into the world in the store before emergency crews arrived. In 2000's 'Where the Heart Is' Natalie Portman gives birth to a baby in a Tennessee Walmart, much like the unidentified woman in Utah who welcomed her bundle of joy in the checkout aisle RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Amazon, Walmart and Target pull offensive 'Tranny Granny'... Is Walmart building self-driving shopping carts? Patent... Share this article Share Customers called 911, but the impatient baby was in the Walmart aisle before EMS, according to KSL. Apparently everyone stayed very 'calm,' according to Reilly.  The mother and baby were taken to Mountain View Hospital in Payson, about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Both are reportedly doing fine. In the movie (based on the novel) Where the Heart Is, 17-year-old and seven-months pregnant Novalee Nation (played by Natalie Portman) stops into a Walmart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma with her boyfriend, who abandons her in the store with little money. Novalee secretly lives in the behemoth store and eventually has her baby, Americus, in aisle five of the Walmart, becoming a local celebrity.      Read more: New moms give birth on I-80 and in Payson Wal-Mart checkout line | KSL.com Healthy baby delivered in Payson Walmart checkout line | Payson News | heraldextra.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 19 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

U.S. stock indexes posted solid price gains Monday, but volume fell far off Friday's already lackluster pace. The Nasdaq rose 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each gained 0.5%. The small cap S&P 600 led with a 1% gain. Volume in the stock market today ran about 20% lower on the NYSE and about 15% lower on the Nasdaq. On the Nasdaq, volume fell for the third session in a row. Blue chips were mostly up. In the 30-stock Dow, Apple (AAPL) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) led the pack with 2% gains each. The day's worst performer in the Dow was Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), which fell 1% in soft trade. Wal-Mart has fallen in six consecutive sessions. On Friday, RBC Capital lowered the price target on Wal-Mart from 76 to 75 with an underperform rating. IBD's TAKE: If the individual investor wants to win in investing, a stock with a tailwind is important. Three things help the investor identify a tailwind. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, energy-related stocks grabbed six of the top 10 spots. The beaten-down solar stocks did well. The solar group climbed about 3%. Solar stocks do better when the price of oil is high, making the green energy sources more competitive with oil. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose about 2% Monday, bringing it above $51 a barrel. Solar companies also could benefit if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election. Clinton is promising subsidies for solar that could cost anywhere from $27 billion to $62 billion, according to analysts. With last year's federal deficit coming in at $440 billion and fiscal 2016's estimated at $588 billion, it isn't clear where the money for the wealth transfer to solar would come from. But the stock market is unlikely to care, just as long as it comes. The solar stock group has room to run, if it is fired up. The group declined about 70% from its September 2014 high. None of the solar stocks is highly rated. Big gainers Monday included low-priced August 2015 initial public offering Sunrun (RUN), up 7% in strong volume and SolarCity (SCTY), up 6% in soft trade. Oil and natural gas explorers and producers offer higher-rated stocks than the solar camp. Of the five oil stocks in the explorer and producer group with a Composite Rating of 90 or better, two rose 2% or more. Callon Petroleum (CPE) popped about 3%; and Parsley Energy (PE), 2.5%. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is rated in the top 10 percentile among all the stocks in IBD's database.

The discount retailer, which operates about 4,500 U.S. stores, outlined its plans to Wall Street analysts for continuing to improve its results in the coming years. Last quarter, Walmart’s U.S. comparable sales rose 1.6% (handily beating rival Target, rising for the eighth straight quarter. But it facing aggressive competitors online and offline, and Walmart has been aggressive about cutting prices to fend them off. Yet Walmart’s $14 billion a year e-commerce business is barely one-sixth the size of Amazon.com’s, adding to the pressure on Walmart. (Last month, Walmart closed on its $3 billion buyout of fast online retailer Jet.com to beef up its e-commerce.)

Nellis Blvd. in Las Vegas on Thursday, Sept. 22, 2016. Chase Stevens/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @csstevensphoto By ALEXANDER S. COREY LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL On a recent Friday, a woman took count of the stream of people funneling into a church food bank. She waved on those she recognized, checking them into a spreadsheet on her laptop, and requested an ID from those she didn’t. In recent months, there had been a lot of new faces. The woman taking count, Margaret Whipple, is secretary of Nellis Baptist Church, which sits directly across from a vacant Wal-Mart in the northeast part of the valley. The brand’s January departure from this neighborhood near Nellis Air Force Base surprised brokers and residents alike and left the area with few nearby grocery options. The local closure was part of a larger plan that shuttered 154 stores nationally and 115 in Latin America. The company said in a January statement that the closures followed a review of its properties that considered factors including “financial performance” and “strategic alignment with long-term plans.” Whipple said attendance at her food ministry has almost doubled since Wal-Mart closed. “We give them what we can, but it’s not always enough,” Whipple said. According to Three Square Food bank data, over the six months preceding October 2016, Nellis Baptist Church increased its food distribution to more than 112,000 pounds, an increase of approximately 43 percent, compared with the same period last year. The location of the former Wal-Mart falls within the 89115 ZIP code, which is among the most food-insecure places in the valley, according to a 2015 map by Three Square Food Bank. A map from the Department of Agriculture also puts the area in a “food desert.” The department considers urban areas with high population concentrations that are more than 1 mile from a grocery store to be lacking in access. In rural areas, the distance is 10 miles. In 2015, a Food 4 Less closed just three miles south of the Wal-Mart. Kit Graski, director with ROI Commercial Real Estate, which represents the landlord, said no one has moved in, but his team is in talks with a grocer. On a recent Friday afternoon, the parking lot of the Wal-Mart was empty except for a security patrol car parked on the store’s front curb. The faint outline of the company logo was visible against the brown stone wall outside. Broker Douglas Albright of Albright Callister & Associates, which represents Wal-Mart, said the building was for sale but that nothing was under contract yet. Skylar and Alejandra, a young couple that live in the neighborhood, said they have frequented the food bank more often since Wal-Mart’s closure. The couple, who asked to be identified by their first names, said the food bank was helpful but didn’t have a lot of vegetables or meat. Skylar said they take the bus to grocery options farther down Nellis Boulevard, but bringing a lot of groceries back can be difficult, even if they bring a backpack to carry them. Standing on the street across from the vacant Wal-Mart, Skylar said he was hopeful that another grocer would move into the property. “It would make things a lot easier,” Skylar said. Jerad, 27, who lives in apartments directly across from the Wal-Mart and who also declined to give his last name, said he frequented the store up to three times a month before it closed. To get baby formula and groceries, Jerad said he now takes the bus or comes to the food bank “to see what kind of help I can get.” ‘FORGOTTEN CORNER’ The food “desert” also has caught the attention of nearby elementary school principals. Anthony Nuñez, principal of Manch elementary school, a block east of the Wal-Mart, said his school has about 100 students that qualify as homeless and sends about 100 bags of food home with students every week. The Wal-Mart was significant for the community, Nuñez said, because it was within walking distance in a neighborhood where many lack personal transportation. Louis Markouzis, principal of Lowman Elementary School, just south of Manch, said that it has become a struggle for residents to get basic living essentials. “Our families now have to go miles and miles away to do that,” said Markouzis. Markouzis said the neighborhood stands in contrast to other parts of the valley, where many take for granted having access to nearby grocery stores. “It’s almost like the forgotten corner of the city,” said Markouzis. At both schools, 100 percent of students qualify for free breakfast and lunch. Dan Williams, chief operating officer of Three Square Food Bank, said there are several factors that contribute to the area’s food-insecure designation. “No grocery stores,” he said. “That is the main factor. When you look at impoverished neighborhoods, you don’t see a lot of retail chains entering those markets.” That void translates into a lack of access to a wide variety of foods, which results in people leaning more on convenience stores, according to Williams. Convenience stores end up patching up some of that food insecurity because they accept EBT or food stamps, said Williams. Many resident in low-income neighborhoods lack reliable access to transportation or can’t carry as many groceries on the bus, he also said. To combat food-insecurity issues in the area, Three Square works with Nellis Baptist Church to distribute food there. “(There are) a lot of barriers that food-insecure people are up against,” said Williams.

Pictures including selfies are now a part of daily life along with professional appearance and personal pride. But many times beauty services are either priced out of reach or just don’t fit into a budget. But Seva offers services such as brow shaping and tinting, eyelash extensions and makeup at an affordable price. Compared to a cup of a brand-named coffee, the services are comparable price and last much longer. Seva recently held its grand opening for its Las Vegas location in Walmart in Centennial Hills. The line was long as women waited for the spa to open and chairs filled up almost immediately. Owner-operator Douglas Grant invested in the national franchise because of its business model. “It takes small related services that are generally very expensive and making them affordable so everyone can look their best.” He wanted his business inside Walmart, “which offers foot traffic. We can offer beauty services to the shoppers of Walmart at prices they can afford.” His background is sales and television production before changing his career with his new business. Kari Comrov, chief of staff for Seva, attended the grand opening and told Informer.com “Las Vegas is just an amazing market for women to be able to afford services at great prices. Our mantra is ‘Beauty to the People’ so we are excited to bring beauty to people in Southern Nevada.” With its new innovation as a fast-casual spa, Comrov explained, “Google ‘fast casual spa’ and Seva is the only entry that comes up. That is really important to us. We felt there was a void in the industry and we filled that void.” Cleanliness, customer service and quality are essential to Seva and the spa only employs licensed estheticians that meet all state and local licensing requirements. “I am very excited to be here. I want my eyes to pop and I can now afford it,” said Felicity Sykes, a new customer getting eyelash extensions for a performance during the Renaissance Festival. Services offered by Seva include brow shaping (treading and waxing); brow tinting, lash extensions, facials and makeup. For a limited time at Seva Centennial Hills location, specials include $5 brow shaping and $10 brow tinting with the purchase of brow shaping with no appointment necessary. Locations include Seva Henderson (Inside Walmart), 540 Marks Street, Henderson and Seva Centennial Hills (Inside Walmart), 8060 West Tropical Parkway. For more information, call 702-558-6356 for Henderson and 702-839-0888 for Centennial Hills.

Published Oct 10th, 2016 12:08 pm aric.mitchell@gmail.com / @tbarkansas The Fort Smith distillery for France-based Pernod Ricard has assumed bottling of the company’s popular Malibu Rum label, Gov. Asa Hutchinson and executives from Pernod Ricard USA and Wal-Mart Stores announced Monday (Oct. 10). While no new jobs are part of the deal, which has Wal-Mart buying the rum as part of the retailer’s broader effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., company officials said the investment in the plant and new line will add production hours for existing workings and could boost seasonal employment. Speaking from the Fort Smith facility’s production floor, Gov. Hutchinson congratulated both in-state companies, noting it “represents the type of creative collaboration that will further boost the economy.” Cindi Marsiglio, vice president of U.S. Manufacturing for Bentonville-based Wal-Mart Stores, commended Pernod Ricard for its “significant capital investment” in moving operations for the label to be sold to Wal-Mart as part of the retailer’s $250 billion initiative for supporting American jobs. “Wal-Mart’s commitment to buy an additional $250 billion in products supporting American jobs is having a tangible impact on communities across America. In the four years since we launched our initiative, we’ve seen factories opened, jobs created and American products added to our shelves in store and online,” Marsiglio said. Marsiglio told Talk Business & Politics after the event that Wal-Mart’s effort, which began in 2013, is on pace with expectations. “I am thrilled with the progress. We are on track to meet our receipt goals,” adding, “the way I track it is by what we’re buying, and we’re estimating that job creation is on track as well. So I know what we’re buying, which is right on our path to the 10th year. We’re almost four years in, and we’re seeing good progress across the right categories, including adult beverage.” Wal-Mart hopes to create 1 million jobs nationwide by 2023 as part of the effort, and Marsiglio is confident this will be a positive impact for Arkansas as well. Cindi Marsiglio, vice president of U.S. Manufacturing for Bentonville-based Wal-Mart Stores, talks to Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Monday after announcing Wal-Mart would buy Malibu Rum made at Pernod-Ricard’s Fort Smith facility. “I have been in factories around Arkansas since we’ve begun this initiative, and I’ve seen areas for growth and opportunity – job by job, factory by factory. Here today (with the Malibu Rum relocation) we have 6,000 shift hours, which translates into more shift hours (for existing employees) and seasonal into full-time employment. Now it will depend on how the product performs, but I think customers are going to respond really well, and the more we can tell them that the products they’re buying are coming from the U.S., the better,” Marsiglio said. One big way job creation will happen, she added, is through related suppliers. “We have found our direct suppliers are part of the story,” Marsiglio explained. “I hear all the time from suppliers that as you go up their supply chain — the glass bottling, the packaging — that they are able to source up their supply chains more regionally and locally. So I think that million-job number you hear us talk about, those are the types of jobs included in the impact.” In the Pernod Ricard announcement, she said, many of those ancillary jobs are “going to be near this plant.” An example of this cited by Melissa Hanesworth, managing director for Pernod Ricard’s Fort Smith plant, is International Paper, which makes the Malibu Rum packaging that was prominently on display at Monday’s event. Hanesworth confirmed with Talk Business & Politics what Marsiglio said – the immediate jobs impact for Pernod Ricard will be 6,000 man-hours “incremental” for existing employees. “I see that as the initial, and it will continue to grow, which does mean new jobs,” Hanesworth said, adding that the company invested “tens of thousands of dollars” in equipment to produce the initial run of 150,000 Malibu Rum cases per year, and its an investment that will help to support about “five to 10 suppliers.” Any new manufacturing jobs will be welcome in the Fort Smith metro area. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates metro manufacturing employment at 17,900 in August, unchanged compared to July and better than the 17,700 in August 2015. However, sector employment is down 6.7% from just five years ago when August 2011 employment was 19,200, and is well off peak employment of 31,000 set in August 1999. The Pernod Ricard/Hiram Walker facility in Fort Smith produces 5 million cases of spirits annually with other labels including Kahlua Liqueur, Seagram’s Gin, and the recently introduced Smithworks Vodka.

The unidentified woman was buying groceries with her husband and a relative on Sunday at the store in Payson when she went into labor. A woman was shopping with her husband in a Payson, Utah Walmart when she unexpectedly gave birth Payson Fire Department spokesman Terry Reilly says it was not the woman's first pregnancy and things 'progressed pretty rapidly.' 'The baby was delivered right there in the checkout line,' Reilly told The Daily Herald.  Employees and other customers had to help deliver the bundle, which eagerly came out into the world in the store before emergency crews arrived. In 2000's 'Where the Heart Is' Natalie Portman gives birth to a baby in a Tennessee Walmart, much like the unidentified woman in Utah who welcomed her bundle of joy in the checkout aisle RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Amazon, Walmart and Target pull offensive 'Tranny Granny'... Is Walmart building self-driving shopping carts? Patent... Share this article Share Customers called 911, but the impatient baby was in the Walmart aisle before EMS, according to KSL. Apparently everyone stayed very 'calm,' according to Reilly.  The mother and baby were taken to Mountain View Hospital in Payson, about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Both are reportedly doing fine. In the movie (based on the novel) Where the Heart Is, 17-year-old and seven-months pregnant Novalee Nation (played by Natalie Portman) stops into a Walmart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma with her boyfriend, who abandons her in the store with little money. Novalee secretly lives in the behemoth store and eventually has her baby, Americus, in aisle five of the Walmart, becoming a local celebrity.      Read more: New moms give birth on I-80 and in Payson Wal-Mart checkout line | KSL.com Healthy baby delivered in Payson Walmart checkout line | Payson News | heraldextra.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 19 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Competition and a new strategy take their toll on WMT Oct 9, 2016, 9:00 am EST  |  By Simply Safe Dividends, Simply Safe Dividends     View All   I came across a statistic last week that sounded unbelievable until I thought more about my own behavior In 2015, 205 million U.S. consumers shopped online. The growth of e-commerce is nothing new, and the number of online shoppers will continue to rise. I wasn’t surprised by this fact. Instead, a recent survey caught my attention. It found that more than half of U.S. online shoppers start their product searches on Amazon. com, Inc. (AMZN). Amazing! Amazon is increasingly the most convenient and cost effective shopping option for consumers. Approximately 55% of those surveyed check out Amazon first when looking for a product, representing an increase from 44% a year earlier. As Amazon’s scale, breadth of inventory, and distribution network grows, it seems likely that the company will continue squeezing out other e-commerce players. Indeed, the survey noted that search engines (e.g. Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)) saw their share of new online product searches decline from 34% a year earlier to 28% today. Retailers were even worse as a starting point for online shopping, dropping from 21% to 16%. The threat posed by Amazon to big-box retailers such as Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT) and Target Corporation (TGT)  is nothing new. However, the impact Amazon is having should not be ignored. Just last week Walmart issued disappointing guidance for next fiscal year that called for earnings per share to remain approximately flat compared to consensus expectations for 4.4% growth. 7 High-Dividend Stocks to Buy ASAP The company also moderated its plans for new store openings. As seen below, new supercenter openings are expected to be almost cut in half from this fiscal year (60) to next (35). In other words, Walmart’s growth will increasingly depend on same-store sales and the company’s e-commerce activities. Additionally, fewer store openings reduces the company’s capital expenditures, driving free cash flow higher. With over 90% of Americans already living within 10 miles of a Walmart store, these actions should hardly come as a surprise. Walmart’s playbook for the next decade is certainly very different from the last. The company clearly realizes the importance of e-commerce and knows it is years behind Amazon. I view Wal-Mart’s recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, a fast-growing e-commerce business, as a sign of desperation to step-up its own digital capabilities. Despite pouring billions into its loss-making web business, Walmart’s online sales growth has slowed considerably over the last two years (Amazon continues reporting double-digit growth despite doing more online business than anyone else): Source: Bloomberg Acquisitions often have many unintended consequences, and the relatively small scope of Jet.com hardly makes it look like Walmart’s knight in shining armor. Jet.com’s revenue projection for 2020 is still a fraction of Amazon’s and eBay’s current sales. Nonetheless, Walmart will continue to invest heavily in e-commerce, and this is ultimately the right move if it wants to keep its business relevant for the rest of the 21st century. However, it says a lot about Amazon’s edge when the largest brick-and-mortar business in the world is finding itself so challenged to build momentum in e-commerce. Of course, as I previously discussed, Walmart is also challenged by rising labor and health care costs. With new store growth screeching to a halt, e-commerce activities looking like they will continue losing money for years, the brick-and-mortar retail environment as competitive as ever, and labor force costs rising, Walmart sure has its work cut out for it to sustainably grow earnings over the next five years. Until Wal-Mart shows clearer signs that it can (profitably) become a viable number two player to Amazon in the e-commerce world, it’s hard for me to get excited about the business. Other brick-and-mortar stores are also racing against the company, and it’s crucial for Walmart to assert itself as a legitimate online player if it doesn’t want to bleed away its 250+ million customers over the next decade. What does this mean for the company’s dividend?

Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon has pledged to make the bricks-and-mortar retailer look "more like an e-commerce company." But to beat Amazon, the mass merchant will need to do more. As more Wal-Mart shoppers sign up for Amazon's subscription Prime service, Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen outlined the steps the world's largest retailer needs to take to protect its market share. While accelerating its online sales growth is a key part of this plan, Wal-Mart also needs to tap into its key advantages over Amazon to effectively compete, Chen said. That includes leveraging its massive footprint to deliver services that can't be replicated online (think health care); leaning on its "excellence" in food supply chain and compliance; and reaffirming its reputation as the low-price leader. "Wal-Mart needs to change and accelerate innovation in pricing, assortment access, and experience; otherwise, we believe the company will continue to lose market share to Amazon," Chen told investors. At its annual investor day last week, Wal-Mart executives told analysts that the company would slow the rate of store openings, and instead shift the company's spending toward the web and remodels. While new store growth represented nearly half of the retailer's $13.1 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2014, it will account for less than 20 percent of its $11 billion spend next year. "We have to change how we work," McMillon said. Wal-Mart has been criticized for its sluggish online sales growth, which has slipped as Amazon repeatedly generates double-digit gains. Though trends at Wal-Mart improved in the fiscal second quarter, the pace of Prime sign-ups is likewise accelerating, Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates. Chen noted the "growing overlap" between the two retailers' customers, saying the average percentage of monthly purchases at Wal-Mart coming from Prime households has doubled over the last four years. Still, Chen is confident that through investments in speedier checkout and services like grocery pickup, Wal-Mart can continue growing its comparable-store sales by 1 to 2 percent over the next few years. "A better shopping experience should aid traffic," Chen said. Meanwhile, analysts expect that the retailer's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com will reignite its online sales growth. Wal-Mart shares dipped after Thursday's investor meeting, when it tempered its earnings forecast for fiscal 2018 and 2019. They were down nearly 1 percent in late morning trading Monday.

Raiders Of The Lost Walmart Find MP3 Player That Users Hated Back In 2012 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Raiders Of The Lost Walmart Find MP3 Player That Users Hated Back In 2012 October 10, 2016 10:43 am EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup dialup isn't dead raiders of the lost walmart call catcher trio mp3 player kmart walmart The Raiders of the Lost Walmart are a brave band of explorers who comb the nation’s big box stores for comically outdated, yet still overpriced, merchandise. This is mostly electronics, since they don’t age very well, and today we have two not-so-fine selections from Walmart and from Kmart. Sean writes that he enjoys combing the clearance section at Walmart to look for comically overpriced items, but had never seen anything wacky enough to submit until last week. He spotted this device on the clearance shelf at his local Walmart. The thing is, this device is still useful for some people: the state of rural broadband is such that there are still a lot of people using dialup. It’s not a relic of the ’90s, like people in more densely populated areas think it is. The note on the package that the device is compatible with phone service via cable is interesting, too, since the current heavy marketing of “triple play” packages means that if someone has phone service from their cable provider, they have broadband. Still, they might need to use some kind of legacy dialup system. This photo that Michael took at Kmart wouldn’t have been too unusual four or five years ago, but a 5-year-old device at full price looks rather odd now. Amazon still has it available for $27.99, but with a string of one-star reviews declaring it to be “absolute garbage” and “dollar store junk.” Good luck unloading it, Kmart. Meanwhile, it isn’t often that you get the chance to buy one of PCWorld’s best tech products of 2006. Yes, it’s the Vonage V-Phone, yet another product that not everyone liked when it was new, let alone now that its age is in the double digits. You can get it for ten bucks from Amazon. As far as we can tell, this device will still work, as long as you have a Vonage account and a computer running Windows 2000 or XP. “There are compatibility issues with the V-Phone and the Microsoft Windows Vista OS,” a support document notes, but you could just not buy a decade-old device for almost the original list price instead.

All Walmart employees will start being allowed to wear black and khaki denim pants to work in July. Workers that take on physically-challenging jobs are being given even more leeway and can wear bluejeans and T-Shirts as part of the new uniform dress code, reports The Consumerist. The changes to the Walmart uniform dress code come after it made changes to it late last year. These changes included adding vests and requiring employees to wear collared shirts. The new dress code wasn’t well received by employees. The Walmart uniform dress code change isn’t the only alteration the retailer is making. It also plans to increase temperatures in its stores following complaints from employees that they are too cold, The Consumerist notes. Another change coming to Walmart will remove its greatest hits CD. Employees were tired of listening to Celine Dion and Justin Bieber on repeat. Instead, the company will now use its own radio, which it promises will have a more diverse selection of music, reports The Guardian.

Bearish bets on China’s second-largest e-commerce company rose to record levels after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said in a regulatory filing that it raised its stake to 10.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent. The increased investment came after a 34 per cent rally in JD.com’s US-traded stock in the past four months narrowed its 2016 decline to 16 per cent. Wal-Mart is boosting support as JD.com’s 2016 adjusted net loss is forecast to widen 10 per cent to 947 million yuan ($142 million) as intensifying competition with market leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. forces the company to increase spending. Expenses are rising as JD.com expands its delivery network to serve smaller towns and increases product offerings. Economic growth that is decelerating to the slowest pace since 1990 adds to the challenge. “An expectation that a partnership with an American company will bring an improvement to JD.com right away may be overly optimistic,” Gil Luria, an analyst who covers technology and e-commerce companies at Wedbush Securities Inc., said by phone. “Investors need to see a competitive matchup versus Alibaba, which is a hard task now that the economic growth is slowing.” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon has said that the company needs to succeed in China, where it estimates 25 per cent of global retail growth will come from in the next five years. The closer collaboration can help JD.com increase delivery speeds to rural areas. “We believe this strategic alliance will help us grow e-commerce even faster in China,” said Dan Toporek, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. Josh Gartner, a JD.com spokesman in Beijing, declined to comment on the stock performance or the partnership with Wal-Mart. A significant share of JD.com’s business is generated from selling products it holds in its own inventory. This has helped speed deliveries, guarantee products’ authenticity and thus gain market share. It also has driven up costs. Operating losses are projected to widen to 1 billion yuan at the end of this year from 864 billion yuan in the first quarter, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The number of shares borrowed to sell JD.com short rose to 62.4 million last week, the most since the company’s 2014 initial public offering. “It’s more Wal-Mart’s attempt to increase their exposure to the Chinese retail sector than JD.com’s attempt to beat the main competitor,” Michelle Ma, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said by phone from Hong Kong. “Alibaba has a stronger overall online platform, in terms of user traffic, engagement, the brand name and the breadth of the product offering.” Jialong Shi, an analyst at Nomura who rates the stock a buy, said the collaboration with Wal-Mart should help the company gain an advantage in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, such as home appliances, soft drinks and processed foods. “For consumers online, you have a great partner to be able to do online to offline shopping with,” said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares, which runs an exchange-traded fund investing in Chinese internet companies. “A partnership with a widely-known brand for Chinese consumers will have a big additive effect.” More from Retail GCC e-commerce on a high-growth path Trump win spurs physical gold buying in Europe Trump win triggers gold buying Consumers keep finding gold prices a burden Breakfast cereals are still a cool factor Consumers keep finding gold prices a burden Shoppers keep placing orders with US portals Get the robot to pick up what you need tags from this storyChina follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsRetail tagsChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In RetailGCC e-commerce on a high-growth path Business Gallery People panic after Modi scrap Rs 500, 1000 notes Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Trump win spurs physical gold buying in Europe 02GCC e-commerce on a high-growth path 03Etisalat to offer iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus in UAE Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 Retail Gold Rate Sponsored by Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces Affordable housing under review in Dubai Emiratis in US warned of rising harrasment New Rs500, Rs2,000 notes not in UAE Crown Prince posts video of Dubai Canal Mirdif residents decry chiller charges Should UAE expats brace for weak dollar?

While JD.com has been broadening its offerings, it still generates more than half its revenue from electronics and home appliances. A sharp slowdown in smartphone and PC sales puts the company at a disadvantage to Alibaba, which has a broader product line and a stronger customer base, according to Henry Guo, an analyst at M Science LLC. “For JD.com, there is a lot of work ahead to increase its market share in the e-commerce industry,” Guo, who has covered U.S.-listed Chinese stocks for a decade, said by phone. “The cooperation with Wal-Mart is unlikely to bring a quick and easy result.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds How Walmart plans to transform how we shop for food Sunday Oct 9, 2016 at 2:00 AM Oct 9, 2016 at 2:39 PM Sarah HalzackThe Washington Post FRANKLIN, Tennessee — On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries.  But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America's largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Wal-Mart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school — and hardest to replicate — asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. The service has not yet made its debut in Erie or Crawford counties. "We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery," Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told investors last year. "The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner." And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. Wal-Mart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. "I physically have no room in the cart," said Brummel, 33. "It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over." Wal-Mart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Wal-Mart. "They've historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat," said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon.  Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. Shopping teams At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Wal-Mart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they're selecting for customers. There's a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is "the trust fall," the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it's because "I like to select fresh products for myself," according to research by Morgan Stanley. Thousands of items In Wal-Mart's version of pickup, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store's grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It's a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer's front door and have it stay fresh?  "That is the opportunity. They're redeploying an asset they already have," said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it's extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. "The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves," said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. "I have two little ones in the back," said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. "To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour."

PHOYO BY CARLA NOAH STUTSMAN A fire inside the Azle Walmart has the store closed as restoration crews clean up the mess. The call came in at 2:20 a.m. Sunday morning, Oct. 9, and the Azle Fire Department arrived on scene at 2:30 a.m. With help from surrounding fire departments, the fire was tapped out by 2:46 a.m., however, firefighters remained on scene until 5:05 a.m. A Walmart spokesman confirmed the store will remain closed until it is cleaned up and made safe for customers and associates, which company officials hope will be early in the day Monday, Oct. 10. Although the spokesman did not yet know the cause of the fire, he said initial reports were that it may have occurred in the sporting goods department of the store. All customers and associates were evacuated from the store without incident, and no injuries were reported. More information will be available in the Oct. 12 issue of the Azle News.

(Sarah Halzack/The Washington Post) Published October 09. 2016 10:17AM  By Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post Franklin, Tenn. — On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries. But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America’s largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Wal-Mart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school — and hardest to replicate — asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. “We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery,” Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, told investors last year. “The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner.” And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. Wal-Mart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. “I physically have no room in the cart,” said Brummel, 33. “It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a baby sitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over.” Wal-Mart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Wal-Mart. “They’ve historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat,” said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Wal-Mart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. “We teach them how to tell the firmness — this one actually feels really good,” Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable’s brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they’re selecting for customers. There’s a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is “the trust fall,” the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it’s because “I like to select fresh products for myself,” according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn’t quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. In Wal-Mart’s version of pickup, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store’s grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It’s a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer’s front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Wal-Mart doesn’t have to reinvent its supply chain — it is already getting these goods to its stores. “That is the opportunity. They’re redeploying an asset they already have,” said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it’s extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. “The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves,” said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, “being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible.” At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. “I have two little ones in the back,” said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. “To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour.” The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Wal-Mart customer, and that they are often people who weren’t buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Wal-Mart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Wal-Mart store. “That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers,” said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. “Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked — I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I’m on my way,” Mishev said.             Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed. Comment threads are monitored for 48 hours after publication and then closed.

View Profile Image: SNL/NBC Print Who knew SNL would be the show to give America a real look at its immigrants? Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media There were many standout sketches on Saturday Night Live this week, but just one struck viewers as particularly game-changing: "Diego Calls His Mom." The digital short "Diego Calls His Mom," starring the impossible-to-dislike host Lin-Manuel Miranda, was based on a simple concept: Diego, a Latino immigrant, calls his mom from his new home in North Dakota. He tells her about the local culture, like the marshmallow salad, mac 'n' cheese and "big mounds of yellow and orange food" he's eating. He tells his mother about his new friend/crush Preston, who introduces him to American football and takes him to see "el Walmart, el 7/11, el cornfield, y el otro Walmart, el otro 7/11." More: Lin-Manuel Miranda's episode of SNL was a poetic love letter to theater kids Before you start thinking the sketch is just about a man's not-so-platonic crush on his BFF Preston or that it's all about making fun of the Midwest, know that the sketch is more than that — much more. Aside from a few well-chosen and well-placed English words, the sketch "Diego Calls His Mom" was performed entirely in Spanish, without subtitles. At the risk of alienating American viewers who don't speak Spanish (and aren't used to being left out of the loop on American television), Saturday Night Live aired a completely Spanish-speaking sketch. This isn't quite the first time SNL has done this. In 2009, Rosario Dawson appeared in a sketch called "La Policia Mexicana," which was performed in elementary Spanish, and in 1990, Jimmy Smits featured a bit of Spanish in his monologue and appeared in "NBC News' Spanish Pronunciation," a skit making fun of how Americans overpronounce Spanish words. "Diego Calls His Mom" might not be the first sketch on SNL performed in Spanish, but it just might be the first in which the Spanish language itself wasn't the joke. More: Sorry, haters, Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump on SNL was damn near perfect "Diego Calls His Mom" isn't important just because of its use of a foreign language — though that is significant — it's also important because it stood out as one of the most heartfelt and honest sketches of the night. Many viewers at home found that the sketch touched on the immigrant experience perfectly, and they tweeted as much throughout the weekend. "Diego Calls His Mom" - brilliant-funny-touching @Lin_Manuel phone booth sketch on @nbcsnl #SNLinManuel— Michiko Kakutani (@michikokakutani) October 9, 2016 My favorite sketch from last night's #SNL. It had me in tears. Thank you so much for this, @Lin_Manuel. https://t.co/pNLwkJIpZk— Natalia Sylvester (@NataliaSylv) October 9, 2016 Ok but I'm obsessed with @Lin_Manuel and his "Diego Calls His Mom" skit literally how my family described the US to family in Mexico lol— Yanely Lara (@yanelylara) October 9, 2016 The sketch also managed to be effective politically without directly mentioning Donald Trump. "Diego Calls His Mom," written by new writer Julio Torres, counters Trump's narrative that immigrants are criminals and rapists. It subtly takes a jab at racism against immigrants without calling out anyone, ensuring a mostly drama-free sketch. "These immigrants are coming to steal our jobs, but not like you, though — you're different," Preston's white father tells Diego at one point in the sketch. It's a funny moment that, coupled with the rest of the piece, reminded viewers just how ridiculous that narrative is. More: Proof the new SNL writers will make the show smarter and, well, funny again For Trump supporters, "Diego Calls His Mom" is just as sci-fi as #StrangerThings. #SNL— Ryan McGee (@TVMcGee) October 9, 2016 The best sketch on #snl. To every hispanic inmigrant living in the US. They're humans too, not rapists. #fucktrump https://t.co/3lGUitmbHq— Daniel (@thedan41) October 10, 2016 It's a little sad to think that we, as a nation, needed an SNL skit to help humanize immigrants to viewers, but maybe some of us did, and I'm glad Saturday Night Live was able to rise to the challenge.

According to a release from the marshal's office, the 18-year-old Evenson was captured without incident in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Post Falls, Idaho, near the Idaho-Washington border. The U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force, which involved Independence Police detectives and eventually marshals' deputies in four states, had been tracking her for two months. She was to remain in custody pending extradition proceedings. As of Monday afternoon Evenson was still on the inmate list on the county sheriff's office website in Idaho. According to the Coeur d'Alene/Post Falls Press, an armed man with Evenson also was taken into custody. In addition, earlier that day deputies had mistakenly detained a 35-year-old breast cancer patient whose recently shaved head gave her an appearance similar to the description of the short-haired Everson. Erin Peters says she was stopped at an Idaho Walmart and questioned for 45 minutes, the Associated Press reported. FBI spokesman Richard Collodi says he regrets that Peters was inconvenienced but the task force had to be sure. Evenson was 17 when she was charged with second-degree murder 13 months ago, after she allegedly covered the mouth of 6-week-old Derek Evenson with her hand because she had been agitated with his crying. Evenson had been a fugitive since she failed appear for a July 15 pre-trial conference. At that point the court issued an arrest warrant and revoked her bond. According to court documents, the Independence woman initially told police she had awakened one day September 2015 a few hours after feeding and changing Derek's diaper at her West Short Avenue residence, only to find him still and not breathing. Later, police received an audio recording from a man who believed Evenson was lying and got her to admit her true actions. She then admitted to police that she placed her hand over his mouth, though she knew it was wrong, and told police she thought Derek was sleeping. Prosecutors had requested bond of $100,000, and Evenson posted in April after pleading not guilty in November. Evenson then failed to appear at the Eastern Jackson County Courthouse for her pre-trial conference, leading A bond forfeiture conference has been scheduled for Dec. 19.

The circumstances surrounding the mistake are tragic — Erin Peters is undergoing treatment for breast cancer, and shaved her head when her hair began to fall out from the treatment. She went to her local Walmart to shop, sporting her shaved head sans wig or hat, and ended up in handcuffs. She was questioned by police for approximately 45 minutes before they were satisfied she was not the woman they were looking for. Police stated the fugitive from justice has a shaved head, and therefore they believed Ms. Peters was the person they were looking for. [Image by David McNew/Getty Images] Ms. Peters said she was humiliated and embarrassed by the situation, and had no idea what was happening to her. Who police were really seeking was 18-year-old Whitley Evenson, of Independence, Mo., who is charged with the murder of her six-week-old daughter last year and has been a fugitive for two months, according to Fox News. Members of the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force mistook Peters for the woman solely for the reason of having a shaved head, Peters said, and the police officers told her “you don’t have to lie anymore” when she pleaded with them to look into the facts of her identity, according to the NY Daily News. Peters said she told them repeatedly that her head was shaved because she was undergoing treatment for cancer, and even gave them permission to call her physician and obtain her medical records, but she says police continued to insist she was lying. Meanwhile, a crowd at Walmart had gathered to see the spectacle of her arrest. [Image by Adam Berry/Getty Images] Peters, who is a preschool teacher, was diagnosed with breast cancer in January and had surgery to remove both breasts in August. She says that she has not received any type of apology for the horror she went through. Peters said she was obtaining an attorney, but that her main objective was not to sue, but instead perhaps cause a better way to identify possible suspects. “I’m not looking for a major lawsuit. I just want them to admit that they were wrong and to apologize.” Peters said it was humiliating and odd to be mistaken for the fugitive, as she is seventeen years older than the fugitive, has different colored eyes, and does not have a prominent mole on her face like the fugitive they were seeking. Besides not receiving an apology, the task force continues to defend what happened. FBI Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Richard Collodi said that he believes the officers acted professionally and that suspects often lie and make up stories to get out of trouble, so that’s why officers likely did not believe Ms. Peters about her health condition. The taskforce had received a tip that the fugitive had shaved her head and was at the Walmart in question, and when they saw Peters, they immediately arrested her. She said they “ransacked” all of her personal belongings, including her purse, and going through messages on her cell phone. “I felt humiliated in front of Walmart, crying… the way they went about this was so wrong.” Although she received no apology, Agent Collodi said he understood that it was likely uncomfortable and embarrassing for Ms. Peters, but that police had to be sure before they let her go. The fugitive in question was also at the Walmart along with a man who had numerous weapons on him, and they both were taken into custody without incident.

Economic headwinds could batter big banks, and in case you didn't know, Bank of America stock is a bet on big banks By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 7, 2016, 10:06 am EST     Popular Posts: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Enters ‘Survivor Mode’ CVS Health Corp (CVS) Stock Is a Black-and-Blue Buy Now Recent Posts: ESPN Strangles Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock AGAIN Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Kohl’s Corporation (KSS) Stock Is Shopped Back to Life View All Posts Shares in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) have been on a tear lately. Since hitting their low for the year of $11.11 in February, Bank of America stock is up by one-third. Investors got another chance to buy it at $12.18 in June, but since then, BAC has been on a steady rise, and opened for trading on Oct. 7 at over $16. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Our Serge Berger likes what he sees, and now has BAC stock on his buying radar. But buying right this second could be a trap. The price-to-earnings multiple on the stock is up to 14, higher than peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) or Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). BofA reports earnings in 10 days, and analysts are hoping for 35 cents p[er share, on revenue of $20.76 billion. That sounds good, but would fall short of last quarter’s 37 cents per share, or the 36 cents per share achieved in the same quarter a year ago — when BAC shares were lower than they are now. Though Bank of America stock’s valuation looks a little better this morning — but only because of a disappointing jobs report that put a damper on interest-rate hike hopes. There also is a global economic storm coming, a financial hurricane that will batter global business, and hurt the bank’s results. Who says so? Bank of America says so. Merrill Lynch’s Warning We are reaching “peak everything.” Those were the words of Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America has owned now for nearly a decade. Bullish trends that have boosted globalization and liquidity look set to reverse, Hartnett’s team wrote yesterday. Politicians are increasingly anti-immigrant and anti-trade. There is a backlash against inequality. The global investment map is being withdrawn. Bonds are out, commodities and equities are back in. That means the value of assets banks like Bank of America hold on their books is due to fall. It means things like oil and gold are going to look like better investments. Market sectors that have underperformed in the past year are due to outperform. Does any of that sound good for Bank of America stock holders? A Political Call It should be emphasized, in a political year, that this is something of a political call, and one that is backward-looking. The Brexit vote, and that government’s decision to pursue an exit from the European Union regardless of the economic consequences, has unnerved markets. The rise of ultra-nationalists across Europe, Asia and the U.S. has bankers battening down the hatches like Floridians before Hurricane Matthew. Political trends can reverse, in response to economic action, but for now other analysts are heeding Bank of America’s warning and downgrading its stock. Vetr has downgraded BAC stock, and Zacks just says “sell.” I am personally more sanguine about the economic outlook than most, because I’m more hopeful about the political outlook. Trends may already be reversing, at least if 538.com is to be believed. That doesn’t mean I’m going to jump on BAC shares this morning. When investors or analysts panic, I like to wait it out before going for bargains. But the price-to-book of Bank of America stock remains 0.7 — dirt-cheap by historical standards, and rising interest rates (eventually) do mean money will get a price. In a few months, BofA might look very interesting. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial journalist who dabbles in fiction, his latest being The Reluctant Detective Travels in Time.

The Provo Daily Herald reports (http://bit.ly/2d2X0Cq ) that the woman was buying groceries Sunday at the store in Payson when she went into labor. Payson Fire Department spokesman Terry Reilly says it was not the woman's first pregnancy and things "progressed pretty rapidly." Employees and other customers had to help deliver the baby in the store before emergency crews arrived. The mother and baby were taken to a hospital in Payson, about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Both are healthy.

But it was up over 20% for the year in August — this was my point back then. I felt Easterbrook had just done the easy things, like making breakfast all day, and that gains from there would be harder. McDonald’s stock is down 3% during 2016. Once investors realized that McDonald’s problems were structural, not superficial, they walked away from the shares. That is happening to WMT stock, and for the same reason. The problems at WMT go deep, and they won’t be fixed quickly. Management recognizes this, but that doesn’t make it comforting if you have money that wants a return now. Structural Problems for WMT Walmart’s suburban-style SuperCenter store format has reached market saturation in the U.S. At its investor meeting on Oct. 6, CEO Doug McMillon said the company would slow domestic store openings, and crack down on incidental expenses like travel, focusing instead on store operations. 7 Huge Swing Trades to Make for the Fourth Quarter WMT also has a demographic problem. The average shopper is 51, and about half earn under $50,000 per year. This is five years older, with $13,000 less in income, than the average at long-time rival Target. Walmart shoppers are also less likely to be black or Hispanic than shoppers at rival stores, another troubling demographic sign. Analyst Ken Goldberg wrote recently that Walmart stock has been flashing technical “sell” signals for a month and speculators are heading for the exits. He wonders whether this is a WMT problem or a general economic malaise setting in. It’s a Walmart problem. With sales approaching $500 billion per year, WMT is a huge ship to turn around. It is still being haunted by a foreign bribery case resulting from its entry into Mexico, and recently rejected a settlement of that case.  Walmart is a company haunted by its past. Walmart Stock Has Strengths WMT is becoming huge in the grocery space. This gives it an advantage over Target, but that company is no longer its target. And it has taken Walmart many years of concentrated effort, preceding McMillon’s tenure as CEO, to achieve this goal. Now McMillon thinks WMT should be taking on Amazon. This is why it recently bought Jet.com for $3 billion in cash, plus $300 million in stock incentives. As Jet executives take control over Walmart’s e-commerce operations, results may improve. The problem is that, right now, WMT’s online operations don’t even beat Target, let alone Amazon. Delivery is slower, and less accurate, than from its smaller rival. Walmart, in other words, has a long way to go to catch up as an e-retailer, and low prices alone won’t make up the gap. It has deep structural, operational issues that must be addressed, at scale, before it can begin to fulfill its promises. Bottom Line McMillon warned two years ago that his turnaround would take time and he has been right. He has taken on Walmart’s reputation for poor pay, and those initiatives have proven enough of a success that he could brag about it in a commercial. But giving checkers a small raise is a bit like making breakfast all day. It can provide a short-term boost to WMT stock’s earnings, allowing the people who work at the company to shop there. But it does not solve the underlying structural problems — demographic, operational or cultural — that still bedevil the company nearly three years into McMillon’s tenure. As with Easterbrook’s McDonald’s, you’re going to want to avoid Walmart stock until you see real progress on these structural issues.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah New moms give birth on I-80 and in Payson Wal-Mart checkout line By Pat ReavyDeseret News@DNewsCrimeTeam Published: Oct. 10, 2016 12:05 p.m. Updated: Oct. 10, 2016 6:04 p.m. + Leave a comment TOOELE — A pair of women gave birth a little earlier than they were expecting over the weekend — one while standing in a checkout line at Wal-Mart and another on the side of the I-80 freeway. Just after 5 a.m. Monday, a couple from Wendover started driving toward Salt Lake City after the wife began having contractions. "They had had labor pains so, they decided they were going to start heading to the hospital," said Tooele County Sheriff's Sgt. Marshall Evans. But about 16 miles over the Utah-Nevada border, the baby decided she couldn't wait any longer. The father pulled over and the mother gave birth to a baby girl, Evans said. When emergency dispatchers got the call from the couple, it wasn't to report that the woman was in labor but rather that the baby had already been born, he said. When emergency crews arrived, Evans said mother and baby, who were in good condition, were transported the rest of the way to the hospital. That incident came less than 24 hours after a woman at Wal-Mart in Payson went into labor while standing in the checkout line, said Payson Assistant Fire Chief Terry Reilly. The woman's husband and another relative were with her at the time. "She had flagged down one of my managers and said she needed help," said store manager Dustin Haight. But the situation escalated quickly. "She was clearly having trouble with the baby, so he brought her over her to register 11 with her stuff, and my customer service manager went to get her a wheelchair," Haight said. But by the time that manager returned, "which was probably about 30 seconds," Haight said, "she was in the process of having the baby." Reilly said 911 dispatchers were told that the woman was in labor. But before the call was over, the baby was already born. "It was very fast," Reilly said. Staffers at Wal-Mart and customers assisted with the birth. When paramedics arrived, Reilly said it was a "calm" situation. Both mom and baby were doing well, he said. After the child was born, Haight said the mother of three wanted to bring home the groceries. "She was down on the ground in a lot of distress, but she insisted on paying for her merchandise," he said, adding that while no one wanted to argue with her, the store may invite her back to receive some free diapers and other supplies. "It's probably something in 20 years of doing this that I'll never forget," Reilly said. The two incidents come on the heels of an episode last week on I-15 when a woman headed to the hospital became stuck in a massive traffic backup caused by a tanker rollover and freeway closure. A South Jordan fire paramedic crew was able to get to the woman quick enough to put her into the back of an ambulance where she gave birth.

The Springdale Police Department said officers responded to a gunshots call Sunday night at a Wal-Mart supercenter on Elm Springs Road. Daniel Luna, 25, was shot and taken to a hospital in Fayetteville, and his condition was not immediately available, police said.

Courtesy of Matthew LaRoche Allagash Falls By Emmet Meara, Special to the News Posted Oct. 10, 2016, at 12:07 p.m. Walter Mastropietro is the luckiest SOB alive. Or maybe the unluckiest man alive. You decide. He was the 61-year old man from Westfield, New Jersey, who got sucked into and over the Allagash Falls in a Wal-Mart kayak and lived to talk about it. I call him Walter because Mastropietro is too hard to spell. “I am thankful to the Lord,” he said this week, still recuperating from a host of injuries suffered from smashing into rocks — with his face. One thing he did right: He wore a helmet. Otherwise Walter would not be talking to anyone. Story continues below advertisement. Like me, Walter is a flatwater kayaker, taking only reluctantly to fast and churning water. I was with the Upsidedown Canoe Club years ago, when we almost went over those same 40-foot falls in a heavy rainstorm. Walter has a place in Moncton, New Brunswick, and naturally heard about the charm of paddling the Allagash, one of the nation’s most famous rivers. He read a story on a planned festival in a kayaking magazine, and on Aug. 23 he rejected the torturous multi-day trip to the falls that many paddlers take and decided to drive to the ranger’s cabin at Michaud Farm, then make the short two-hour paddle to the falls. It was 8:40 a.m. when he left, alone. He made it too fast. “I missed the sign. I knew I was getting close, then I was in fast water and I heard the roar. I still didn’t think it was the falls, and then I got sucked in,” he said. “It happened too quickly. I wasn’t paying attention.” It was about 10:30 a.m. His sit-inside kayak slammed into a rock and both he and the kayak went under several feet of water. “It happened all so fast, before I knew it. Then I was trapped in 25 to 30 feet of water. I had to breathe, but I knew better, trapped underwater. I held it and finally broke the surface,” he said. It wasn’t over yet. “I went through three or four rapids, down again. Up again,” he said. Finally Allagash Falls spit him out, battered, bloody and broken. At the hospital, doctors told him he had three breaks in his cheek bone, a torn ligament in his one finger and a broken ankle. He bruised and battered all over, but he was alive. “My left eye was swollen shut. I looked like Frankenstein,” he said. “I tried to get off the river on the left, but the current was too strong. The right side seemed calmer. I sat on a big rock for 20 minutes, getting my breathing back. I took off for shore, touching the bottom. It was about 25 feet to the shore.” He took stock of the situation, bleeding from his nose and cheek, spitting blood. “I was scared and alone.” The “lucky” part came four or five hours later when a canoe party made the portage around the falls and found him. The party included an EMT and an experienced first responder. “They came from heaven, “Walter said. One of them even had a satellite phone. There is no cell service on the river. The canoe party carried Walter back across the portage to meet ranger Trevor O’Leary. He was taken back to Michaud Farm and then two hours to Northern Maine Medical Center in Fort Kent. Doctors there patched him up and opted to transfer him south. His injuries were not deemed serious enough for an airlift, so it was back in the ambulance for a six hour drive to Maine Medical Center in Portland. He was so beat up that he was in rehabilitation for five weeks. It wasn’t over yet. When he left the hospital, he didn’t have a dime. His wallet and credit cards were still in his truck at Michaud Farms. Somehow he got a replacement credit card but had no identification. He had to use his hospital discharge papers as ID to charge a bus ride back to Caribou. He couldn’t even buy groceries at the supermarket — again because of no identification. He borrowed $10 at a breakfast spot to pay someone to take him back to his car, back at Michaud Farms. Looking back, he said, “I thought that was the end of it all. It was divine intervention. That helmet and PFD saved my life.” He recovered his Wal-Mart kayak, battered but still usable. He will continue flatwater paddling from now on. But no rapids, no falls. Me, too.

(PFE) Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) ESPN Takes Center Stage Ahead of Walt Disney Co (DIS) Earnings View All Posts U.S. stock futures were mixed over the weekend, as Wall Street continued to digest the September employment report. Nonfarm payrolls added 156,000, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 5% — nowhere near strong enough to support hawkish Federal Reserve interest-rate commentary, but not weak enough to inspire economic concern. It was a fine line to walk, and stocks appear to be walking that line once again this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have risen 0.13%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.03% and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.12%. Friday’s options activity offered up a return to the norm in terms of overall volume, but puts were clearly in control on the session. Specifically, 13.8 million calls were dwarfed by the 14.2 million puts that changed hands on Friday. Negativity was largely absent from the CBOE, however, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio pulled back to 0.68 from Thursday’s two-week, while the 10-day moving average ticked higher once again to 0.65. Heading up Friday’s pre-weekend speculative trading, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) options were popular following a smattering of bullish reports, including a “buy” reiteration and more positive iPhone news from a chips supplier. Meanwhile, Netflix, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings said entering the Chinese market “doesn’t look good,” and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to garner $1 billion in ad revenue in 2017. Apple Inc. (AAPL) AAPL stock managed to ditch most of the malaise that spread throughout Wall Street on Friday. 7 Huge Swing Trades to Make for the Fourth Quarter The stock was bolstered by a “buy” reiteration and a $185 price target from Drexel Hamilton, which called the recent quarter Apple’s best yet. Additionally, German chips maker and iPhone 7 parts supplier Dialog Semiconductor reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, adding fuel to the fire for iPhone 7 demand sentiment. Speaking of sentiment, options traders remain strongly biased toward AAPL calls. On Friday, the stock saw more than 802,000 contracts change hands, with calls snapping up 62% of the day’s take. The $115 strike is the level to watch this week for AAPL call traders, as it is home to peak OI in the weekly October 14 series totaling 11,035 contracts. Overall, the weekly October 14 put/call OI ratio rests at 0.56 for AAPL, indicating that calls nearly double puts in this highly speculative series. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) NFLX stock has some of the air taken out of its sails on Friday after CEO Reed Hastings said the prospect of Netflix entering the Chinese market didn’t look good. Netflix had been riding high on speculation that Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) would make a buyout offer for NFLX. An offer has yet to materialize. Returning to China, Hastings had this to say: “Disney, who is very good in China, had their movie service shut down. Apple, who is very good in China, had their movie service closed down. It doesn’t look good.” In addition to NFLX slipping about a quarter of a point on Friday, options traders also backed away from calls. Volume came in north of 305,000 contracts on Friday, well above the norm for NFLX, while calls only managed to eke out 58% of the day’s take — down sharply from recent highs due to DIS takeover speculation. In fact, recent call activity has driven Netflix’s October put/call open interest ratio below its three-month average north of 1.00 to a perch at 0.9 as of Friday. This week, options traders have their sights set on the $110 strike, where more than 4,500 call contracts are open in the weekly October 14 series. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) When you think about Amazon.com, you typically think about online sales or streaming movies and TV shows from Prime. What you don’t think about is AMZN’s thriving ad business. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 But that ad business is expected to top $1 billion in 2017, according to market research firm eMarketer — a figure that analysts at RBC Capital Markets called “a good number.” AMZN has been on quite a tear this year, and it has reinvigorated bullish options activity in the shares. On Friday, Amazon saw more than 242,000 contracts cross the tape, with calls accounting for 56% of the day’s take. That said, there is still room for improvement in the sentiment department, as AMZN’s October put/call OI ratio arrives at 0.93, with calls and puts in near parity among short-term speculators. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Politics 'We're called redneck, ignorant, racist. That's not true': Trump supporters explain why they voted for him Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed Homeless shouldn't face job discrimination just because they lack an address Homeless Los Angeles Times Alena, 45, homeless after being laid off from her job as an administrative assistant, above the 101 freeway in downtown Los Angeles on December 23, 2015. Alena, 45, homeless after being laid off from her job as an administrative assistant, above the 101 freeway in downtown Los Angeles on December 23, 2015. (Los Angeles Times) Sarah Golabek-Goldman Jeff Johnson served in the military for six years and then moved to Washington, D.C., where he found work in the construction industry. After suffering serious injuries in a robbery, however, he lost his job and became homeless. Johnson applied for many entry-level positions without success, and he now suspects why: There was a telltale black mark on his paperwork. “If employers saw the address of a [homeless] shelter, they would say I am on drugs or have a mental illness,” he said. “A lot of people look down at people like myself. So I gave up hope.” Johnson’s plight is not unusual, as countless homeless people across the nation find themselves shut out of the workforce when potential employers spot their address — or the lack of one. At least there’s a simple solution: Employers could just stop asking for this information in the early stages of the application process.   A 2014 survey showed 70.4% of homeless respondents felt that they had been discriminated against by private businesses based on housing status. As part of a recent study, I reviewed the online application forms for 40 of the nation’s largest low-wage employers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Starbucks Corp. and Target Corp. Each requires applicants to provide an address, and prevents them from proceeding to the next step without registering one. I also conducted dozens of detailed interviews with homeless individuals and, in collaboration with Trisha Matthieu of Feeding America, surveyed 2,339 people living in poverty across the country. While the homeless face many challenges, respondents frequently referred to discrimination based on homeless status as a significant hardship. One homeless job applicant in New Haven commented, “Everyone uses the shelter address but the moment [employers] see that . . . there is a red flag .... No ... there is a black flag on your resume.” Other surveys have reported similar results. Veterans in one study identified the requirement of a permanent address and employers’ distrust of people residing in temporary shelters as a considerable barrier to attaining self-sufficiency. The National Coalition for the Homeless reported in 2014 that 70.4% of homeless respondents felt that they had been discriminated against by private businesses based on housing status. And these are more than mere suspicions. “Once employers find out that a job applicant lives in a homeless shelter, so many have told me that they can’t hire them,” said Glynn Coleman, an employment specialist at the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles. “Several employers refuse to engage with our residents if they don’t have an address or reside on skid row.” Employers of course deserve to know where their workers live, if only to find them in an emergency or conduct background checks. But there’s no good reason for them to require an address on initial applications. Employers rarely send applicants paperwork or contact them with an urgent matter before they hire them. Besides, employers almost always contact applicants through email. Nor do employers need an address to make sure applicants could feasibly arrive at work on time. Applicants who apply for jobs from which they can be fired at will know that they must be prompt, regardless of where they reside. Even without an address, employers can contact former managers to assess the applicant’s reliability and stability. Employers might also believe that homelessness is a proxy for a host of negative qualities, like addiction to banned substances. But research consistently indicates that the leading causes of homelessness include lack of affordable housing and domestic violence (hardly reasons to rule out an applicant).  And employers can specify on applications, as many already do, that employment is contingent upon passing a drug test or background check. It’s now a progressive goal to help criminal offenders re-enter society through so-called Ban the Box policies. (That’s a reference to the box applicants are asked to check if they have been convicted of a crime.) Employers, the theory goes, should let applicants demonstrate their qualifications before asking about their records. Shouldn’t homeless applicants likewise have a chance to prove themselves before revealing their lack of address? Ban the Address would encourage homeless individuals to search for work without the threat of automatic disqualification. Employers might now be ignoring the best candidates. People who have lost their homes are often conscientious and reliable employees, and even the chronically homeless can excel at work with appropriate support and training. By hiring homeless individuals, employers can also show that they are part of the solution to a pressing social problem. When Target and Wal-Mart eliminated inquiries about criminal record history from initial job applications, other businesses followed suit. A similar push to Ban the Address would give homeless job applicants like Jeff Johnson hope of obtaining employment and getting off the streets — an outcome that businesses should support by making an eminently simple change. Sarah Golabek-Goldman is a recent JD-MBA graduate of Yale Law School and the Yale School of Management. She will publish an article on this subject, “Ban the Address Combating Employment Discrimination Against the Homeless,” in the spring edition of the Yale Law Journal.  Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Watch: Interview with combatants outside of Mosul Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske interviews ISIS fighter and speaks with Iraqi military on the east side of Mosul.

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year – still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. World finance leaders seek to address anti-trade backlash WASHINGTON (AP) – World finance leaders say they must do more to deal with a growing anti-trade backlash, which they fear could worsen already sluggish global growth prospects. How to deal with the attacks on globalization, featured in the Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential campaign and in the vote in Britain to leave the European Union, is a top agenda item at the fall meetings of the 189-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters Thursday that IMF officials “see growth as too low for too long and benefiting too few.” Stocks end mixed after clawing back from broad losses NEW YORK (AP) – Stocks recovered from a broad decline to end mixed on Thursday, a day ahead of a key jobs report. The market fell from the start, then drifted between gains and losses for much of the afternoon. Yields on Treasury bonds rose again, and the price of oil climbed past $50 a barrel for the first time since June. By the end of trading, seven of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor’s 500 index rose, led by suppliers of basic materials. Health care companies and phone companies led the decliners. US claims for jobless aid drop to lowest since mid-April WASHINGTON (AP) – The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week felt to the lowest level since mid-April, another sign that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid slid by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000. The less volatile four-week average dropped 2,500 to 253,500, lowest since December 1973. Overall, 2.06 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, down more than 7 percent from a year ago. Average US 30-year mortgage rate unchanged at 3.42 percent WASHINGTON (AP) – Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn’t move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 percent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The popular 15-year fixed-rate mortgage stayed at 2.72 percent. US farmers make foray into quinoa as demand for grain grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) – A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters’ growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totaled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa’s nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn’t show on an agricultural census. Federal government: Mylan has been overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) – Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug’s maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government’s complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties. UN agreement reached on aircraft climate-change emissions WASHINGTON (AP) – The United Nations’ aviation arm overwhelmingly ratified an agreement Thursday to control global warming emissions from international airline flights, the first climate-change pact to set worldwide limits on a single industry. The agreement, adopted overwhelmingly by the 191-nation International Civil Aviation Organization at a meeting in Montreal, sets airlines’ carbon emissions in the year 2020 as the upper limit of what carriers are allowed to discharge. Airlines that exceed that limit in future years, as most are expected to do, will have to offset their emissions growth by buying credits from other industries and projects that limit greenhouse gas emissions. Norway to spend record $28 billion oil money to boost growth HELSINKI (AP) – Norway says it plans to spend $28 billion of its oil fund – the largest in the world – to further stimulate the economy next year in the Scandinavian country that has shown signs of a gradual economic recovery. The Finance Ministry says in its budget proposals that the record amount is equivalent to 0.4 percent of the country’s GDP. It will be 20 billion kroner more than this year, amounting to 3 percent of the value of the sovereign wealth fund. The ministry said Thursday the market value of the fund, known as the Government Pension Fund Global, is expected to peak at 7,671 billion kroner at the end of 2017 – up from an estimated 7,420 billion kroner at the end of this year. Theranos closing labs, laying off 340 following sanctions PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) – Embattled blood testing company Theranos says it will shut down its clinical labs and wellness centers and lay off more than 40 percent of its full-time employees. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes says the shutdowns will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania.

   Main Contact us hitechchronicle.com Navigation Business Culture Technology Science Sport Worldwide Medicine National Technology Chromecast Ultra is still value for money despite the twofold price increase Oct 09 2016 After weeks of rumors and leaks about its specs and appearance, Google's new Chromecast Ultra has finally gotten its reveal, and right on the date suggested. Google Home is set to arrive in stores in November and is now up for pre-orders at $129 via the Google Store, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. At a press event today, Google introduced a higher-end Chromecast video streaming device, adding 4K and HDR support to the offering. A Wi-Fi router will pretty much do the job decently, but keep in mind that Chromecast Ultra boasts 4K video streaming, a much heavier stream than Full HD. The new Chromecast Ultra generation of devices will be able to stream 4k content - which is the latest available resolution on the market - from media services such as Netflix, Vudu, and Youtube. That makes it a really important device in the bigger picture of Google's aspirations. The new Chromecast is 1.8 times faster than the 1080P model, it includes better WiFi connectivity and there is an ethernet port in the power adapter if you need a wired connection to stream your 4K content. Interestingly, Google Chromecast Ultra is nearly twice as fast at streaming content compared to the company's first generation Chromecast. Unlike Google, however, the company's newest devices only support the HDR10 format, and the same goes for Nvidia's Shield TV, Microsoft new Xbox One S, Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4 Pro and the recent PS4 firmware update. The leading name in this segment of 4K-capable products is Google's very own Chromecast. Google has announced that Google Play Movies will stream 4K content from November. Users can still mirror content to their TV from their Android smartphone or from their laptop's Chrome browser. This new device allows premium media streaming if you're willing to pay a little extra. Every since the Chromecast was released, it's been hailed as a good device because of its pricing and its features. Chance are that if you use a 4K tv, then your internet connection would also be top-speed. Instead of casting a Spotify playlist from the app on your iPhone (which drains your phone's battery) you can instead say "OK Google, play Beyoncé on my Chromecast", and let Google's Assistant do the rest.

(Photo: Getty Images) A sample of opinions from readers about the presidential election: The simplest way to have a debate where each candidate gets a fair and equal chance to answer a question and make their point is to only have one microphone functioning at a time. The moderator asks one person a question and then only that person has a working microphone for two minutes then it stops working. Same for the next person. This stops the childish and aggravating interruptions of the other debater and listeners get to hear an understandable answer. This also gives equal time to each person and lets the moderator do their job without being a referee. Tom Tallon Wyandotte The time has come for Donald Trump to resign his candidacy for President of the United States. The latest example, caught in a 2005 excerpt from “Access Hollywood,” which he describes as “locker room banter,” clearly demonstrates his lack of respect for women and the institution of marriage. With Trump at the helm, our country’s stature as leader of the free world would suffer irreparable harm. The leadership of the Republican Party has to take quick and decisive action to stave off the total destruction of the GOP. David Levy Farmington Hills It boggles my mind how some of the folks in Creston, Iowa, seem to be blaming Washington/Obama/Democrats for the fading away of their downtown businesses. Really? They haven’t figured out that it’s the Walmart Supercenter on the southwest edge of Creston that caused it? This has happened in hundreds of small towns across our country, and somehow, Democrats are to blame. Perhaps if Creston area residents had fought to keep Walmart out, their downtown might still be thriving. How can they possibly believe that “businessman” Donald Trump will be their savior? Larry A. Peplin Grosse Pointe Park A recent Free Press editorial goes on about Trump not paying taxes. The Democratic candidate is yelling about him not “paying his fair share.” How do you anti-Trumpers define “Paying my fair share?” I think it is most adequately defined by the United States code. When have you heard of someone paying more taxes than their returns require? Is there a checkbox to pay more? Why don’t you editorialize about the Clinton Foundation? Dave Yezback Northville Much talk and debate between presidential contenders Trump and Clinton regarding the cost of higher education and resultant debt. The discussion caused me to break into a cold sweat. I’m a grandpa of three, ages 12, 10, and 8. If they all attend the University of Michigan and graduate in four years, and assuming cost increases of 5% per year, all three will incur almost $500,000 of higher education debt. That’s a half a million dollars, folks! While the grandkids and their parents will incur most of this debt this will certainly cause my wife and I (and similarly situated baby boomers) to reevaluate not only our current life style but our retirement plans as well.

Seems like we’re easy to stereotype.” In exchange for Oliver’s insights, I agree to be e-introduced to her friend, Daniel Justus, who would show me another side of things. “Not everyone in Buchanan is going to hell,” she says. “Some people are making something of their lives.” I quickly forget about our deal as Oliver tells me about her travails. But that evening, an email arrives from Daniel. He calls himself “the boy who escaped”. It piques my interest. What, I wonder, was Daniel escaping from? The drive to Daniel’s family home takes me across rugged mountains, through mist-shrouded valleys and past churches. Lots of churches. I counted about one a mile. A few hundred yards from Daniel’s valley, there is a Church of Jesus Christ with a large billboard you cannot miss. “When life gives you more than you can stand, just kneel,” it says. Daniel clearly wasn’t paying attention. Since childhood he has been kicking against the fate that everybody around him--barring his mother, Karen--seemed to have preordained. When Daniel was in eighth grade (aged 14), he argued in front of the school board for his right to be taught extracurricular courses that would let him apply to college. The school principal had repeatedly turned him down. He won. “Nobody could understand why I would want to do that,” he says. “I convinced them it was my right.” Then he insisted on learning Spanish, even though there was just one qualified teacher in the county. They set up interactive television classes so he could learn remotely. He is now a Spanish interpreter for the state of Virginia. Then he wanted to learn Chinese. Today he speaks and writes fluent Mandarin. Last summer, he spent three months working for a Chinese law firm in Shanghai, dealing in intellectual property rights. Last weekend, he graduated with distinction from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Next stop is a postgraduate degree at an Ivy League university or Oxford. “I’m still thinking about where to apply,” he says. Most of Daniel’s peers from high school found jobs at the hulking local Walmart, telemarketing from home or as welders on construction sites. One or two found work in the coalfields, or what is left of them. Others have fallen prey to the heroin epidemic. Many of the girls, including Oliver, got pregnant in their teens. “I knew one girl who got pregnant at 14,” says Daniel, now 22. Like most others I saw in Buchanan, he has good teeth, though he has purged all trace of his Appalachian accent. To put it mildly, he has defied the odds. Daniel was also the first person I met in Buchanan County who had not voted for Trump. In November, he will vote for Clinton--though without much enthusiasm. “Trump is just another drug,” Daniel says. “People round here are addicted to escapism.” The first thing that strikes you about Daniel’s home is its serenity. From the covered porch with its lazy ceiling fans, you gaze up verdant slopes to wooded hilltops. In the garden, there is a weeping willow and cherry trees. As dusk falls, the air comes alive with the sound of tree frogs and cicadas. You can hear the occasional braying of the family donkey, Jackson. The second thing that strikes you is the garish cliff-face carving of the Confederate flag on the other side of their narrow valley. It overlooks the large, floodlit football field of Hurley High School, whose principal Daniel outfoxed when he was a student. The Hurley Rebels team colour is the old Confederate flag. “Heritage not hate,” is what the flag’s apologists say it represents. To Daniel the slave state flag evokes something more visceral--a culture that prizes sport to the exclusion of all else. It is not just the school. In place of petrol prices, the signs outside the local gas stations proclaim, “Good luck Rebels!” When the team win, it makes the front page of The Mountaineer, the county’s main newspaper, next to stories about suicides, local beauty pageants and elk poaching. “Faith, Family, Football,” says a banner in the school’s main hallway. “We bleed red and blue,” says another. The sign outside the girls’ bathroom reads, “Lady Rebels”. The only other school banner I could see said: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” The school has no science laboratory. Its library consists of two half-empty rows of shelves. A few months ago, Hurley High tipped most of its library’s contents into a nearby dumpster. “I found Oliver Twist in there,” says Joshua, Daniel’s middle brother. The family salvaged a bookshelf’s worth of discarded titles. Daniel is not just an exception in Buchanan County. I am tempted to think of him as the canary in the coal mine--except this one managed to fly to its freedom. His mother Karen, a chain-smoking force of nature, puts his success down to being strangely different. “When he was 18 months old he knew his alphabet backwards,” she says. “He still doesn’t have a clue how to change the engine oil.” When Daniel’s father, Danny Justus, a coal salesman and Baptist preacher, and his two younger brothers went deer hunting, Daniel would tag along with a book. While the others stalked deer with their rifles and crossbows, Daniel would sit under a tree reading. He refused to eat the venison. The book that influenced him most was Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage. It tells the life of a clubfoot boy who could never fit in. Karen knew this about her son and nurtured it. When Daniel felt down and ostracised, she would egg him on. “I told him, ‘Buchanan isn’t even a piece of the jigsaw--it’s barely a speck on a piece of the jigsaw in that large world out there,’” she says. “None of this will matter if you escape.” When the Rebels won a game, the principal would broadcast it triumphantly over the public address system. If Daniel won a spelling bee contest, or a debate competition--as he did on every occasion — it would pass unmentioned. Karen would head down to the principal’s office and demand that his feat be broadcast. Anyone who meets Karen, a robust woman with a mischievous glint in her eyes, would think twice about taking her on. “Think about that,” Karen says, waving a smouldering Marlboro Light: The teachers didn’t care if you could spell or argue. They think too much ‘learnin’ is bad for you. That’s the teachers! Can you imagine what everyone else thinks? Her words reminded me of Trump’s praise for the kids who don’t turn out like Daniel. “I love the poorly educated,” he said. The other trait that separated Daniel from others was his dislike of coal. In Buchanan County, that is tantamount to atheism. Many in his family had fallen victim to the hazards of working underground--the dreaded black lung disease, the sleep apnea, split tendons, slipped discs and orthopaedic ailments that come from a half-bent myopic existence in the dust-ridden bowels of Appalachia. Others, including relatives of Daniel, have fallen prey to the prescription drug culture that supposedly exists to ease their pain. One close relative, whom Karen asked me not to name, was caught distributing pills. Tamara Neo, the attorney who co-chairs Trump’s regional campaign, put him away for 10 years. “Neo was ruthless with poorer addicts who couldn’t afford lawyers,” says Karen. “There was no forgiveness.” The closest Daniel came to a fight at school was when he argued the benefits of renewable energy. A football jock wanted to punch him. Parents demanded that a sympathetic teacher be disciplined for making a case against coal. What angers Daniel is that his people are clinging to a way of life that has crippled them--often literally. “It’s as if they have Stockholm syndrome [where a prisoner falls in love with his captor],” he says. Dana Oliver, Daniel’s school friend who introduced us, puts it another way. In the absence of coal, half the county now subsists on federal handouts--Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security disability payments and other “entitlements”. Alone in the Republican field, Trump vowed to protect them. Whatever else you can say about the New York property magnate, he knows his market. Call it big-government conservatism for white people. Says Oliver: Coal is not coming back--it costs too much to open a flooded mine. In their heart of hearts, most people know that. Trump just gives them a little bit of hope. But there is another way of looking at Trump’s wild popularity in the region. Before the start of each shift, a preacher calls for God’s blessing on the miners. In this part of the world, the church is almost as ubiquitous underground as it is above. In the wake of the mine closures have come bad habits. People sell food stamps for opioid pills, says Oliver. Church attendance has fallen. God is missing in action. “If you think about it, what Donald Trump wants to do is bring God back into their lives,” she says. “That’s the way a lot of people see it.” Tamara Neo, Trump’s main cheerleader for the region, certainly sees it that way. Every morning she puts her three children into her Range Rover for the 45-minute drive to a private Christian school across the state border in West Virginia. There is too much godlessness in today’s public schools, she believes. As we drive, Tamara tests her children on the Bible. “John 1, verses 16-18,” she barks into her iPhone’s Siri app. The verses appear on screen. “Now say the verse, Axella,” she says to her daughter, who’s in fifth grade. Axella stumbles over it then yawns. “Again,” says Tamara, until she gets it right. She moves on to Io, her eldest: “Exodus 20, Verse 12,” she says. “Go Io.” Next comes Flux. Then she makes them recite Lincoln’s Gettysburg address--all 278 words of it. She does not stop until they get it right. With children called Io, Axella and Flux, Tamara betrays her western origins. People in Virginia are conservative with names. Tamara and her husband Flux, also a lawyer, moved here from Colorado 10 years ago because they loved the beauty of the Great Smokies. She ran as commonwealth attorney for Buchanan County--an elected position as chief prosecutor for the area. She lost her re-election in 2010 but not before putting scores of people away for prescription drug-dealing. “In a close-knit community like this, a prosecutor quickly prosecutes herself out of a job,” says Tamara. “You know too many people.” Almost never in her four years on the job did she come across cocaine or even meth. “The epidemic is in prescription pills,” she says. “People will do anything to get hold of them.” Like many of Trump’s evangelical supporters, Tamara does not mind the thrice-married candidate’s lurid tabloid past. After all, Ronald Reagan had been divorced. “Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future,” she says. What most appeals to her about Trump is that he talks without a trace of political correctness. He calls things the way he sees them. Gaffes that would have felled a lesser man--calling illegal Hispanic immigrants “murderers” and “rapists”, for example, or obsessing over supposed slights about the size of his penis--have left Trump unscathed. “He just keeps walking through one fire after another and coming out the other side untouched,” says Tamara. “I take this as a sign.” In spite of having Mexican ethnicity on his father’s side, Tamara’s husband Flux, with whom she shares a private legal practice, is if anything even more Trumpian than his wife. He was raised by foster families in Tucson, Arizona, before “emancipating” himself in his teens. He dropped his Hispanic name for an invented one, Flux Neo, to symbolise a new beginning. Flux also found God. He still bears traces of his tough street childhood, which seems to come straight out of television drama Breaking Bad. His tongue is pierced and a tattoo in Sanskrit encircles his neck. It translates: “There is no higher religion than truth.” On his wall hangs a framed tableau of a dead tarantula and a dead scorpion. It reminds him of his past. Nobody supports building Trump’s wall with Mexico more than Flux does. “I’ve seen the Mexican drugs cartels close up,” he says. “I know what they can do.” A few weeks ago, Tamara introduced Trump at a rally in Radford, Virginia. Flux took a video of it. The whole family was there. It was the performance of her life and the largest crowd she had ever addressed. In court she would occasionally suffer from stage fright. But on this occasion she felt no trace of nervousness. Shortly before Tamara went on, Trump had put her at ease. He was so humble and gentle, she says. No cussing or cursing. He asked about her home town. Then she walked up to the microphone. Her short speech focused on Trump’s promise to “make America great again”. Tamara said: For all those trolls and haters out there, let me be clear. I am no longer OK with charming, smooth politicians speaking kindly to me as they destroy my children’s future. I don’t need someone to never use a foul word. I don’t need my president to have polished, perfect teeth: I want action! I don’t need a president to have perfect hair, I need him to have balls! Tamara had done what she was asked to do. She made the crowd roar. Then the big man came on. A few days later, Trump broke the barriers with his massive victory in Buchanan and surrounding counties. Tamara believes he will do it again in November: For the first time in my life, I believe we can get America back again. I have been waiting a long time for Trump to come along. Joshua Justus has a better idea than most of America’s past. Now almost 80, Daniel’s grandfather became a miner when he was just 15. Harry S Truman was still president. Joshua could barely read or write. He earned 70 cents an hour. He can vividly recall childhood scenes of the Depression, when people queued for hours for a slice of bacon. I sit on his porch in the fading light listening to him reminisce. Something about this toothless old miner, dressed in 1950s trousers and braces, sucking intermittently on his oxygen mask, reminds me of Daniel’s mother Karen--Joshua’s daughter. Perhaps it is his outspokenness. Joshua says he hated working in the mines. “I wouldn’t wish that on a dog,” he says. I ask him what he thinks of his grandson, flying off to Shanghai again in a couple of weeks for further work experience, this time taking his father, who has never set foot outside of the US. Could he imagine one of his own would one day speak Chinese? The grandfather chortles. “Book learning is no good if you don’t have common sense,” he says. After a pause, he adds: “Daniel has plenty of both.” The only smart way to go nowadays is to get educated and get out, he adds. What he cannot understand is why “people round here” cling to the mines: When a crook like Trump comes along, promising this and promising that, they are ready to believe anything. Some people round here aren’t so smart.” Trump is a “disrespectful and very ill-mannered” man, he adds. He doesn’t have a good word to say about anybody. Daniel, on the other hand...  Our conversation turns to Daniel’s latest bugbear--stopping Buchanan from wasting its meagre budget on a new Bible studies class. The curriculum was approved by the Southern Baptist Convention, which embraces creationism. The young scholar wrote a letter to The Voice, the regional paper, which goes to the heart of the area’s future. Between the lines, it also tells us about the boy who escaped--and how, in spite of everything, he wants to return home to help it through its collapsing morale. Daniel wrote: I was fortunate enough to have been raised by parents who taught me to be a critical and independent thinker. Not all students in Buchanan County are quite so fortunate. Rather than challenged and encouraged, our children are stymied and restrained--their eyes blinded and their feet bound by a lack of curricular diversity and an overabundance of empty justifications for their plight. The world outside south-west Virginia demanded “fungible soft skills” and “critical thinking”, he wrote. It was unlikely a Bible studies class would do that. It was a bold letter--perhaps a little arrogant but sharply relevant. Beneath Daniel’s words there was a reply from Earl Cole, the paper’s proprietor, and one of the region’s leading opinion formers. He is also a Trump supporter and a friend of Tamara Neo: It is not a good thing, totally, to be trained to be a critical thinker. As for the Bible, it is the Holy Book. There is no better manual for preparing for life in the real world. But it was the proprietor’s closing paragraph that made me catch my breath. I had to reread it to feel its edge: Mr Justus does not say whether he is a believer or not. But in reading his letter, I can see that he has a lot to learn. J.

LIRR spokesman Aaron Donovan said it was possible but “highly unlikely” that speed restrictions would remain in place through the derailment site Tuesday morning if crews could not fully complete the repairs overnight.

About 3 p.m. Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office announced that the LIRR would restore full service in time for the evening commute, following a “nonstop” recovery effort since the derailment. 0:16 VideoLIRR derailment track repairs underway “The full restoration of service for Monday’s evening rush hour was made possible by the continuous efforts of the MTA and LIRR crews,” Cuomo said. “I thank all of the employees who worked around the clock to restore train service so commuters can get where they need to go as easily and as efficiently as possible.” advertisement | advertise on newsday Despite the repairs, the evening commute was far from normal because of a switch problem in Mineola — later resolved — that caused extensive delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, Federal Railroad Administration officials remained on the scene Monday investigating what caused the accident, which occurred about 9:10 p.m. Saturday about a half-mile east of the New Hyde Park station. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said a one-car work train performing scheduled maintenance on the north track improperly moved onto the southbound track just as a 12-car, Huntington-bound passenger train approached. The two trains sideswiped each other, causing extensive damage to the passenger train’s first three cars, which all derailed. Using a large crane, workers put the cars back on the tracks, and towed them away Monday morning. From there, dozens of LIRR workers used shovels, sledgehammers, power tools and construction equipment to put hundreds of feet of damaged track back together. NassauPhotos: LIRR train derails in New Hyde Park Much of their efforts focused on “an intricate and cumbersome 25-foot segment” of damaged track near a switch. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who was briefed by FRA officials, said Sunday that the accident appears to have been caused by LIRR workers errantly leaving a track switch in the wrong position. An FRA spokesman declined to provide an update on the investigation Monday. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff By Monday morning, the LIRR had cleared one of the two tracks, allowing for limited service through the derailment site during the morning rush. There were several reported delays and cancellations, but ridership was light because of the Columbus Day holiday. Bob Sixsmith, 73, of Garden City, who lives near the accident site, took a train from the Merillon Avenue station into Penn Station and back Monday and gave the railroad an “A+” grade for its service. But Sixsmith criticized the agency for not providing enough reliable information to customers. He said he asked a woman at the information desk at Penn Station Monday afternoon if both tracks were back in service and was told, “I don’t know the answer to that because they don’t tell us.” “The communication from corporate is terrible,” Sixsmith said. “But they did a wonderful job today getting everything going.” 1:35 NassauCuomo promises to learn from train derailment The LIRR Commuter Council also expressed its gratitude Monday to railroad workers “who worked tirelessly” to restore service. However, its chairman Mark Epstein, said the numerous collisions involving LIRR trains in recent years “trouble the Council and our fellow riders.” There have been at least four incidents involving LIRR trains hitting each other since 2008. advertisement | advertise on newsday “Ensuring safety is the top priority of the Rail Road, and we urge the LIRR to do all that is possible to further the investigation of this incident and make its results available,” Epstein said in a statement.

Police say recently a new scam is cropping up around Albertville, and it's leaving its victims with empty promises and out money. "We're starting to see a lot of this, where people are getting checks in the mail saying if you go spend this, go on a shopping spree at Walmart for a period of time, you'll receive this amount of money," Albertville Police Chief Doug Pollard says "People are actually coming to the banks trying to cash these checks, and they're no good." Pollard says this is happening frequently all over the city. Police say scammers are sending out a proposal of a check with a promise of a shopping spree included if the recipient sends back some money first. Once all is said and done though, that promised check is never good. "This is the time of year where scams, fraudulent checks, all that starts playing a part, and people are falling for it," Pollard says. That money lost is nearly impossible to trace. Usually, that money won't get back in the victim's hands. "Just be aware. If you see something like that in the mail, just tear it up and throw it in the garbage," Pollard says.  Albertville Police turn these types of cases over to the FBI to investigate. Bottom line, if it's too good to be true, it probably is.

Meanwhile, the Hempstead Town board is demanding that the town’s Industrial Development Agency revisit its decision to grant those tax breaks. Most Popular Cops: Eastbound Sunrise reopens after crash Nassau sought OK of contract for Singh’s wife Council approves covenants for Garvies Point Mangano arrest could affect upcoming elections 5K run-walk aims to fight prostate cancer However, the IDA’s executive director, Fred Parola, said it’s too late and the deal cannot legally be changed. State Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) and Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages (D-Elmont) held a press conference in front of the Valley Stream Central High School with a handful of residents standing behind them holding signs like “No taxation without representation” and “Reform IDAs now.” The lawmakers said the tax breaks for the mall - including a $14 million PILOT, or payment in lieu of taxes - have resulted in tax increases for residents who live in Valley Stream school districts 30, 24 and 13. They said the average annual increases will be between $322 and $758. “You only need to be in elementary school to understand that taxation without representation is un-American,” Kaminsky said. Santa Monica, California-based Macerich, the Valley Stream mall’s owner, was granted a sales-tax exemption of $6 million, a mortgage-recording tax exemption, and an agreement for a payment in lieu of taxes on its planned $79 million renovation to the approximately 1.7 million-square-foot mall in December 2014 by Hempstead Town’s Industrial Development Agency. advertisement | advertise on newsday Under the agency’s rules, the mall qualified as a tourist destination because it brings at least 51 percent of its business from outside the county. Parola said the IDA posted the necessary notices and contacted public officials in Valley Stream to notify them of two meetings held in the village before the decision was final, but no one showed up. “Nobody was interested,” Parola said. “So maybe they should be looking in the mirror when they point the finger.” Macerich can voluntarily opt to give some money back - as Parola said he’s seen some developers do on smaller projects - but they cannot be compelled to do so. Representatives from Macerich could not be reached for comment. Tweets by @Newsday Kaminsky and Solages started a petition calling for Hempstead Town board officials to pressure the town’s Industrial Development Agency to reverse its decision. The town board had already taken action. “They have demanded that the case be re-opened,” town spokesman Mike Deery said. Members of the agency are appointed by the town board, and if the IDA refuses to reconsider, Kaminsky and Solages said the town board should demand its members resign. Although the IDA granted the tax breaks nearly two years ago, Deery said the tax roll was only approved by the Board of Assessors and the increases are only coming to light now. The three school districts affected posted letters on their websites warning their residents of the change to their tax bills. District 24’s Board of Education wrote that the increase will be reflected in the October tax bill and invited residents to a board meeting to discuss the issue at the William L. Buck School on Oct. 19. Get the Newsday Now newsletter!

JCPenney Isn’t Exactly Hiring Greeters, But Everyone Gets On The Sales Floor Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share JCPenney Isn’t Exactly Hiring Greeters, But Everyone Gets On The Sales Floor Image courtesy of Mike Mozart October 10, 2016 6:54 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup key selling activities JCPenney power hours sales If you’re shopping at JCPenney at midday and notice that there are more employees than usual swarming the sales floor and being friendly, don’t worry: the store has probably not been taken over by pod people. Instead, it’s a new initiative that the chain is trying, called “Power Hours,” which is neither a lunch promotion nor a church service. This new daily ritual was initially reported by the New York Post as JCPenney adopting greeters at the door like Walmart or Home Depot, but it isn’t exactly like that. Employees told the Post that even people who work in the warehouse have been asked to head out to the sales floor from noon to 2 P.M. every day, and that the overwhelming helpfulness means that there aren’t enough employees at cash registers when one of those thoroughly greeted customers wants to buy something. We checked with JCPHQ to find out whether this is an actual thing, and it is. A company representative told Consumerist that the program is a test in stores in the Northeast, and they’ll roll it out nationwide if it’s successful. “During power hours, which take place daily from noon to 2 p.m., associates focus solely on customer service and key selling activities,” the company explained in a statement. “Every store associate, from management to operations, participates in the program each day, ensuring a consistently outstanding shopping experience during peak hours.” That sounds like an interesting idea: they just need to make sure there’s someone handling the cash register.

Comments By Clint Boulton Follow CIO | Oct 10, 2016 7:31 AM PT RELATED TOPICS IT Management IT Industry IT Careers Target Comments Target’s promotion of Jason Goldberger as its first chief digital officer (CDO) in May signaled that it was prioritizing ecommerce, mobile payments and other aspects of its online business. Four months later Goldberger is out, highlighting the challenges brick-and-mortar companies face as they make the difficult transition to digital. "To provide clear accountability and speed up decision making, we will be transitioning Jason's responsibilities to two current leadership team members,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said. He split Goldberger’s responsibilities between CIO Mike McNamara, who took ownership of website and digital strategy and Chief Merchandizing Officer Mike Tritton, who assumed pricing and promotion duties. Target made Jason Goldberger its first chief digital officer in May. Four months later his responsibilities have been divvied up between the CIO and the chief merchandizing officer. Phrases like "clear accountability and "speed up decision making" suggest friction in the C-suite was hindering Target’s ability to execute, hardly an anomaly as retailers struggle to grow their digital footprint in an ecommerce world dominated by Amazon.com. Like Wal-Mart and other brick-and-mortar retailers, Target is working feverishly to grow its online revenues, which account for 5 percent of total sales. The pitfalls of brick-and-mortars going digital Target and its brick-and-mortar peers recognize that they must become more agile to deal with disruptive market dynamics, but they face an uphill battle that is as much organizational as it is operational. [ Related: CIOs must step into the digital leadership void ] Gartner analyst Alan Duncan says that brick-and-mortar businesses are structured and hierarchical, which renders them brittle. A single change in process or personnel can disturb the delicate balance. Duncan says that many traditional companies, burdened by supply chain process models built for the previous era, focus on remaking their processes and IT systems in digital fashion but rarely do the necessary work to remake the corporate culture – the kind that promotes cross-functional collaboration -- around digital. Consequently, few traditional businesses are capable of navigating the tensions that occur among executives who feel their turf is encroached upon. "There is an appetite to be disruptive but if it rocks the boat for the current team dynamics then it's going to be too uncomfortable," says Duncan. Target CIO Mike McNamara. The big target on the CDO’s back Goldberger’s position may have been compromised from the outset because McNamara is not a traditional retail CIO; he is digitally savvy. Prior to joining Target, McNamara worked as CIO of U.K. grocery chain Tesco, where he led helped build a digital wallet and magazine application, among other digital initiatives. Other signals, including Cornell’s own admission that he and McNamara worked closely together, suggested McNamara’s clout was growing at Target. [ Related: CIOs mean business ] In a March interview with CIO.com, McNamara said that he was focused on overhauling the supply chain to ship products directly from fulfillment centers, distribution centers and local stores to accommodate preferences for online and mobile ordering. And in a corporate blog post published in late August, McNamara cited as part of his duties enhancing Target.com for guests, as well as offline-online experiences such as order pickup and digital marketing. McNamara’s broad swath of responsibilities may have left little room for a digital chief. Forrester Research analyst Nigel Fenwick says that Target may have realized it introduced friction where the IT and dot-com business were competing for resources. “A lot of retailers realize they have to embed digital channels into store operations and vice versa so it's seamless,” Fenwick says. “It will be interesting to see what they do over the next 12 months, in terms of their approach to digital as a transition." A CDO with a big remit   Edmunds.com in May named Philip Potloff as its first CDO. As Target and other old-line companies try to weave digital capabilities throughout the fabric of their businesses they would do well to study the process and operational models of digital-to-the-core businesses. Such companies, which include Google, Facebook and Uber have embedded algorithms and analytics into their operating models, tend to pull together to achieve a common goal, Duncan says. "They build in the capability to adapt quickly and responsively and they experiment and learn fast," Duncan says. “If something doesn't work they move on. That's a completely different dynamic from brick and mortar organizations that are trying to overlay digital services onto a traditional business model. It's a big disruption and a massive cultural shift." Another example of an innovative digital-to-the-core business is automotive information publisher Edmunds.com, which in May named Philip Potloff as its first CDO. Potloff, who spent the last seven years at Edmunds.com in CIO and COO roles, says the move is an acknowledgement that the company has more work to do in digital. Potloff is building chatbots, digital marketing software and other technologies intended to help the company better engage with consumers. Although Edmunds.com also has a CIO and CTO, it doesn’t appear to suffer from the same executive integration issues as Target and others. That’s because CIO Stephen Felisan and CTO Paddy Hannon report to Potloff, which he says helps make the C-Suite dynamic more comfortable. Having more “Cs” in the suite might make some leaders leery, but Potloff welcomes the help. He says having a CIO who is focused on infrastructure and the data sets that power Edmunds.com and a CTO who is focused on customer-facing software and big data is crucial.

(FACEBOOK) POST FALLS, Idaho — A 35-year-old breast cancer patient says she felt humiliated when she was handcuffed and questioned after being mistaken for a Missouri teen wanted in her infant daughter’s death. The Coeur d’Alene Press newspaper reports that Erin Peters says she was stopped Friday at an Idaho Walmart and questioned for 45 minutes after being mistaken for 18-year-old Whitley Evenson, of Independence, Mo.. Evenson, who was later taken into custody, is charged with murdering her 6-week-old baby last year. Kootenai County jail booking photo of Whitley Evenson, Oct. 7, 2016 Peters says members of the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force believed she was the Missouri fugitive because her hair is very short. She says she shaved her hair because of cancer treatments. Peters underwent a double mastectomy in August, said she stopped at the Walmart after completing a radiation treatment. She said she was shopping in the girls department when a local law enforcement officer working with the FBI and the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force grabbed her by both arms and told her she was under arrest. FBI spokesman Richard Collodi says he regrets that Peters was inconvenienced but the task force had to be sure.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Manhattan Beach, California-based Beyond Meat sells plant-based burger patties, heat-and-eat meals and non-GMO soy and pea protein frozen foods at grocery chains such as Whole Foods Market Inc <WFM.O>, Publix, Albertsons Cos Inc's <ABS.N> Safeway. Other investors in the company include Bill Gates, the Humane Society of the United States, General Mills Inc's <GIS.N> venture capital arm 301 Inc and venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. A group of 40 investors managing $1.25 trillion in assets launched a campaign in September asking 16 companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, Unilever <ULVR.L> and Whole Foods to respond to the risks of industrial farming. Wal-Mart is Tyson's biggest customer, accounting for almost 17 percent of sales for the year ending Oct. 3, 2015. The campaign followed an Oxford University study which said $1.5 trillion in healthcare and climate change-related costs could be saved by 2050 if people reduced their reliance on meat.

Most Popular LI educators nearly half of NY’s 100 top-paid Cops: Man held after firing weapon near bar Cops look at Chase Bank, Staples break-ins LI billionaire helped steer Trump to victory Cops: 1 dead in LIE tractor trailer crash However, the IDA’s executive director, Fred Parola, said it’s too late and the deal cannot legally be changed. State Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) and Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages (D-Elmont) held a press conference in front of the Valley Stream Central High School with a handful of residents standing behind them holding signs like “No taxation without representation” and “Reform IDAs now.” The lawmakers said the tax breaks for the mall - including a $14 million PILOT, or payment in lieu of taxes - have resulted in tax increases for residents who live in Valley Stream school districts 30, 24 and 13. They said the average annual increases will be between $322 and $758. “You only need to be in elementary school to understand that taxation without representation is un-American,” Kaminsky said. Santa Monica, California-based Macerich, the Valley Stream mall’s owner, was granted a sales-tax exemption of $6 million, a mortgage-recording tax exemption, and an agreement for a payment in lieu of taxes on its planned $79 million renovation to the approximately 1.7 million-square-foot mall in December 2014 by Hempstead Town’s Industrial Development Agency. advertisement | advertise on newsday Under the agency’s rules, the mall qualified as a tourist destination because it brings at least 51 percent of its business from outside the county. Parola said the IDA posted the necessary notices and contacted public officials in Valley Stream to notify them of two meetings held in the village before the decision was final, but no one showed up. “Nobody was interested,” Parola said. “So maybe they should be looking in the mirror when they point the finger.” Macerich can voluntarily opt to give some money back - as Parola said he’s seen some developers do on smaller projects - but they cannot be compelled to do so. Representatives from Macerich could not be reached for comment. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Kaminsky and Solages started a petition calling for Hempstead Town board officials to pressure the town’s Industrial Development Agency to reverse its decision. The town board had already taken action. “They have demanded that the case be re-opened,” town spokesman Mike Deery said. Members of the agency are appointed by the town board, and if the IDA refuses to reconsider, Kaminsky and Solages said the town board should demand its members resign. Although the IDA granted the tax breaks nearly two years ago, Deery said the tax roll was only approved by the Board of Assessors and the increases are only coming to light now. The three school districts affected posted letters on their websites warning their residents of the change to their tax bills. District 24’s Board of Education wrote that the increase will be reflected in the October tax bill and invited residents to a board meeting to discuss the issue at the William L. Buck School on Oct. 19.

Mayor Julia Nelson said that “it’s like the city is split down the middle as to who has power, so unless we have a drastic restoration, we need to have that curfew for one more night.” “Hopefully, this is the last night we will need it,” Nelson said. She noted that areas around the hospital, toward Sparrow and Kennedy and The Manning Times on East Boyce Street and toward IGA and Piggly Wiggly have power. “It’s like the city is cut in half, with power from Mill Street going east, and then no power from Mill Street going west,” Nelson said.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Get Ready for the Q3 Earnings Recession Posted on October 10, 2016 by Brad Hoppmann Are you waiting for third-quarter earnings to come in and lift stocks to new highs? Well, then you’re probably going to be very disappointed. Earnings season begins this week, with aluminum firm Alcoa’s (AA) Tuesday release. But don’t look for this season to be robust across the board. In fact, what investors will most likely get is yet another quarter of earnings declines. That’s the prognosis from research firm FactSet. It recently announced that S&P 500 companies are expected to post their sixth-straight quarter of declining earnings. The company did say that sales metrics are expected to break their six-quarter streak of declines. But according to MarketWatch, that may be too optimistic. Several companies like Ford (F), Honeywell (HON), PPG Industries (PPG) and Wal-Mart (WMT) have already warned of slowdowns. And another wave of warnings is likely coming our way. So, how bad will this quarter be, and what will it mean for the markets as the earnings come rolling in during October? According to its research, FactSet has pegged S&P 500 companies to report an overall decline in per-share earnings of 2.3%. That metric would be down from expectations of a 0.2% increase at the end of June. If this decline is indeed what takes place, then it would mark the first time quarterly earnings would have declined for six-consecutive quarters. Of course, reality can always differ from estimates. And though FactSet is a great organization when it comes to sound data, the fact is that companies can and often do surprise frequently. Even FactSet admits as much, including its senior earnings analyst John Butters. In the aforementioned MarketWatch story, Butters said: "Over the past four years, on average, actual earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded estimated earnings by 4.3%… During this same time frame, 68% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual EPS above the mean EPS estimates on average." If this general inclination toward better-than-expected earnings holds again this quarter, the FactSet estimated decline could turn into an increase in earnings of 0.9%, according to Butters. Now, while earnings for Q3 are important, what’s also going to be important to watch here is the expectations for Q4 earnings when companies report this season. Here we could be in for a negative surprise. The current cocktail of unknowns facing the market right now — presidential election uncertainty, Brexit negotiations, central bank policies and a serious concern over global economic growth — could keep many companies on hold in terms of growth-inducing investment. The MarketWatch piece pointed this out as well, saying: Many boards reportedly put decisions on hold until after the election, leaving just a month and a half of the fourth quarter to take actions to spur growth. Unfortunately, things don’t look too much better in terms of earnings heading into 2017. *** That’s the conclusion of a growing number of market analysts, including RBC Capital Markets’ Jonathan Golub. In a note to clients, Golub wrote that 2017 expectations are overstated … and that many of his peers have become far too optimistic about the prospect for S&P 500 earnings growth. According to a Yahoo! Finance article referring to Golub: In particular, he warns about forecasts for the energy and banking sectors, which have been crushed by low oil prices and depressed interest rates, respectively. "Consensus estimates are for 15% EPS growth in 2017," Golub observes. "This number would be 11% excluding Energy and Banks." Golub went on to say that if we see normal downward revisions to estimates, we could see consensus estimates for 2017 EPS growth drop from 15% to about 6%. So, the likelihood of earnings …  Coming in weak in Q3  Pressured by uncertainty in Q4, and  Revised downward in 2017 … Doesn’t really give us much reason to celebrate. It does, however, make one thing imperative. When selecting companies to own here, we must do so with the utmost regard for metrics such as strong free cash flow, strong industry leadership and an outstanding product or service that’s in a growth space. *** What’s your take on Q3 earnings and the likelihood of an earnings recession? Do you think things are worse than they appear, or are you optimistic about corporate bottom lines? I want to know what you think, so let me know by leaving me a comment on our website or by sending me an e-mail. *** The Dow opened 100 points higher on this post-presidential-debate Monday. Oil led the way after Vladimir Putin said Russia would support an OPEC oil-production freeze or even cut "to preserve stability in the global energy market." The Industrials gained 0.5%, while energy via the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gained 1.5%. • Big gains in oil: Brent crude hit a one-year high, while West Texas Intermediate surged 3.1% to $51.35 a barrel — its highest level since July 2015. • Louis Vuitton’s new line of perfumes appears to be paying off for LVMH (LVMUY). The parent of Christian Dior, Moet champagne, Hennessy cognac, and dozens more luxury brands reported a strong Q3. LVMH said organic sales (on a constant-currency basis) shot up 6.5% in the past quarter, while perfume and cosmetics sales grew 10%. The results beat expectations, and shares gained 3.5% in Monday trade. • With four reports of overheated Galaxy Note 7 replacement phones, Samsung has reportedly stopped making the phone. The news sent Apple (AAPL) to its 2016 high of $116.06 (+1.7%). • The winner of last night’s presidential debate was Ken Bone. His question on the candidates’ energy policies was thought-provoking. But was his outfit that had America tweeting. GQ magazine helped lighten the mood by assembling this Ken Bone Halloween costume kit. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “Get Ready for the Q3 Earnings Recession” Phil says: October 10, 2016 at 8:24 pm The winner of last night’s debate was the American female, who now understands that men routinely discuss and anticipate sexual assault when talking to other men, and these men think there is nothing wrong with that, and indeed women expect it. Reply Dean says: October 16, 2016 at 12:18 am I served in the US military for 25 years and retired one and a half years ago. What men are you talking about because I have not met them? Reply SH says: October 10, 2016 at 8:41 pm Corporate America figured out a long time ago how to manage earnings numbers. Expense items such as Merchandising and Advertising can always be pulled back to eek out a meet or exceed by a cent or two. Throw lowered expectations into the pot and things would have to be pretty bad not to make their numbers. I speak from experience. Reply Ronnie Silva says: October 10, 2016 at 11:42 pm That was a lot of informative NOTHING!! Could be Bad, maybe not that bad, Maybe an upside surprise, but could also be worse!! WHAT?? I guess I’m all IN//OUT with that lack of clarity. Might as well just Flip a Coin! …In reality, I’m 50% in CASH & 50% invested. So. I Guess I Match your Call! Why worry about earnings when there is this Big “Train Wreck” I’ve heard from you guys, the past 3 years, Coming our way!! Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Manhattan Beach, California-based Beyond Meat sells plant-based burger patties, heat-and-eat meals and non-GMO soy and pea protein frozen foods at grocery chains such as Whole Foods Market Inc, Publix, Albertsons Cos Inc's Safeway. Other investors in the company include Bill Gates, the Humane Society of the United States, General Mills Inc's venture capital arm 301 Inc and venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. A group of 40 investors managing $1.25 trillion in assets launched a campaign in September asking 16 companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Unilever and Whole Foods to respond to the risks of industrial farming. Wal-Mart is Tyson's biggest customer, accounting for almost 17 percent of sales for the year ending Oct. 3, 2015. The campaign followed an Oxford University study which said $1.5 trillion in healthcare and climate change-related costs could be saved by 2050 if people reduced their reliance on meat.

LIRR spokesman Aaron Donovan said it was possible but “highly unlikely” that speed restrictions would remain in place through the derailment site Tuesday morning if crews could not fully complete the repairs overnight.

About 3 p.m. Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office announced that the LIRR would restore full service in time for the evening commute, following a “nonstop” recovery effort since the derailment. 0:16 VideoLIRR derailment track repairs underway “The full restoration of service for Monday’s evening rush hour was made possible by the continuous efforts of the MTA and LIRR crews,” Cuomo said. “I thank all of the employees who worked around the clock to restore train service so commuters can get where they need to go as easily and as efficiently as possible.” advertisement | advertise on newsday Despite the repairs, the evening commute was far from normal because of a switch problem in Mineola — later resolved — that caused extensive delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, Federal Railroad Administration officials remained on the scene Monday investigating what caused the accident, which occurred about 9:10 p.m. Saturday about a half-mile east of the New Hyde Park station. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said a one-car work train performing scheduled maintenance on the north track improperly moved onto the southbound track just as a 12-car, Huntington-bound passenger train approached. The two trains sideswiped each other, causing extensive damage to the passenger train’s first three cars, which all derailed. Using a large crane, workers put the cars back on the tracks, and towed them away Monday morning. From there, dozens of LIRR workers used shovels, sledgehammers, power tools and construction equipment to put hundreds of feet of damaged track back together. NassauPhotos: LIRR train derails in New Hyde Park Much of their efforts focused on “an intricate and cumbersome 25-foot segment” of damaged track near a switch. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who was briefed by FRA officials, said Sunday that the accident appears to have been caused by LIRR workers errantly leaving a track switch in the wrong position. An FRA spokesman declined to provide an update on the investigation Monday. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff By Monday morning, the LIRR had cleared one of the two tracks, allowing for limited service through the derailment site during the morning rush. There were several reported delays and cancellations, but ridership was light because of the Columbus Day holiday. Bob Sixsmith, 73, of Garden City, who lives near the accident site, took a train from the Merillon Avenue station into Penn Station and back Monday and gave the railroad an “A+” grade for its service. But Sixsmith criticized the agency for not providing enough reliable information to customers. He said he asked a woman at the information desk at Penn Station Monday afternoon if both tracks were back in service and was told, “I don’t know the answer to that because they don’t tell us.” “The communication from corporate is terrible,” Sixsmith said. “But they did a wonderful job today getting everything going.” 1:35 NassauCuomo promises to learn from train derailment The LIRR Commuter Council also expressed its gratitude Monday to railroad workers “who worked tirelessly” to restore service. However, its chairman Mark Epstein, said the numerous collisions involving LIRR trains in recent years “trouble the Council and our fellow riders.” There have been at least four incidents involving LIRR trains hitting each other since 2008. advertisement | advertise on newsday “Ensuring safety is the top priority of the Rail Road, and we urge the LIRR to do all that is possible to further the investigation of this incident and make its results available,” Epstein said in a statement.

By Mike Troy — October 10, 2016 The retail industry has never seen anything like Amazon. It is a search engine that rivals Google in terms of locating products, a platform for user-generated content with reviews, a third-party marketplace provider, a media powerhouse producing award-winning original programming and a leading provider of cloud computing services.  The company's unconventional business model and unique value proposition for shoppers has earned Amazon a level of trust and loyalty not seen in the retail industry. Amazon, and by extension founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, consistently ranks at or near the top of various measures of trust, reputation and brand value. It was the top-ranked company in the 2016 Harris Poll Reputation Quotient survey of more than 23,000 U.S. respondents, marking the eighth consecutive year it has been in the top 10. Amazon now ranks third on Fortune's listing of the World's Most Admired Companies, behind only Apple and Google. "Amazon overtook Walmart three or four years ago to become the most valuable retail brand on the planet in a shift that is reflective of the changing mindset of the consumer," says David Roth, co-CEO of The Store, WPP's retail practice. "Amazon has been very clever about removing friction from the shopper's process of being interested in buying something to actually completing the transaction." That cleverness shows up in the company's steadily climbing sales numbers, stock price and brand value, a metric Millward Brown seeks to quantify in the BrandZ report. Last year, Amazon's brand value surged 59%, roughly double that of Alibaba, the next closest retail company. Amazon advanced seven spots this year to rank seventh on the full list of the most valuable brands at $99 billion, while Walmart declined six spots to rank 32nd with a brand value of $27.3 billion. The brand value, respect and trust accolades being heaped on the company stem largely from the pursuit of one of Bezos' foundational principles: to be customer-obsessed as opposed to competitor-focused. It is an important distinction and key to understanding Amazon's actions and experiments. For example, the Dash button seemed like an oddity when first introduced, but now more than 150 brands participate in the program. Offering free unlimited two-day delivery as a benefit of Prime was a pretty sweet deal, but then Amazon began offering same-day or one-hour Prime Now delivery. Now the Amazon Echo device and virtual assistant Alexa make ordering products even easier.

The tactic has been successfully deployed in Michigan and Indiana where major retailers have driven down property values and tax revenue. Michigan taxpayers had to refund about $100 million to retailers while Indiana reduced their taxes by more than $120 million. Yet cities and counties still need the revenue to pay for roads and other municipal services. The worry is that local governments will have to cut programs, as they have in Michigan, or raise residential property taxes like Indiana to make up the shortfall, officials say. “If a company is allowed to avoid paying their fair share of property taxes, it will shift the burden onto other taxpayers, particularly our homeowners,” City Manager Sheryl Sculley said. City officials are monitoring the Lowe’s lawsuit here. “The City of San Antonio is greatly concerned about this, and our taxpayers should be too.” Lowe’s, The Home Depot Inc., Kohl’s Department Stores, Target and Wal-Mart are trying to persuade judges in Texas and elsewhere that their stores should be appraised as as so-called dark stores — which are vacant buildings instead of fully functioning businesses. Appraisers generally value a property at its “highest and best use,” meaning at whatever function makes the most money from the property in its current condition. However, retailers argue that their stores should be assessed as if the building were vacant and the property carried onerous deed restrictions — thus lowering its marketability and value to potential buyers. Lowe’s has taken the lead on “dark store” lawsuits, according to appraisers. The home improvement retailer currently has three lawsuits against the Bexar County Appraisal District contesting the values of its 11 stores in the San Antonio area for the past three years, Bexar County chief deputy appraiser Mary Kieki said. Lowe’s also has a pending lawsuit in Harris County concerning its five stores around Houston, court records show. Lowe’s declined to comment for this story. “People make all kinds of assertions in litigation hoping to lower their value, but we’ve never specifically faced this kind of an argument,” Kieki said. The North Carolina-based chain’s 11 area stores, all measuring roughly 136,000 square feet, were appraised at about $81 per square foot for tax year 2016, Kieki said. If Lowe’s gets its way, that value could drop about 58 percent to $34 a square foot. And, because Article 8 of the Texas Constitution states that taxation shall be “equal and uniform,” other retailers would likely follow suit, she said. “Others won’t even have to assert this theory,” Kieki said. “They can simply say ‘make me like Lowe’s.’” On top of lost revenue from lowered property values, Bexar County would also have to reimburse Lowe’s for legal fees if the retail giant prevails in court, which could strain the county’s finances, Bexar County Tax Assessor-Collector Albert Uresti said. “In any system where one group is not paying their fair share of taxes, it’s going to be shifted to the remaining groups that are having to pay taxes,” Uresti said. “The idea behind taxation is to make sure it’s fair and equitable.” Click here for the full story at ExpressNews.com. jfechter@express-news.net Twitter: @JFreports The Latest Indoor events banned from Alamo church Two TX Baptist churches under fire for open LGBT policies Elliott scores twice late, Cowboys top Steelers 35-30 San Antonio cook-off raises thousands for hospitality students Gregg Popovich uncensored on Donald Trump, election 2016 Mayor Ivy Taylor announces re-election bid Officials: 150 border agents being sent to South Texas Police search for suspects, information on a shooting Sunday...

She has covered everything from red carpet events to the discovery of toxic PCBs on school windows. She lives on Long Island, N.Y.... View Profile Image: Christopher Futcher/Getty Images Print Why I finally stopped lying to my daughter about seeing a therapist Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media Three Thursdays ago, I lied to my 5-year-old daughter about seeing a therapist for the last time. She was getting ready for bed, pulling her zebra-print nightgown over her head, when she asked why Daddy would be reading her a story that night — a hiccup in our usual routine. “I have to go to the store,” I answered. I rested my gaze on a point on the wall somewhere above her head. It makes no difference that she's a kindergartner who believes her legs will one day morph into fins when the Great Mermaid Goddess up in the sky deems her worthy of discovering her true calling in life. When you lie to your child, you feel their little eyes burning truth rays through your skin. "But it’s night out, Mom," she said. "What do you need to get? Can I come? Why can’t you go tomorrow?” All valid questions — all questions I couldn’t answer because I wasn’t, of course, headed to Walmart to stock up on cans of tuna. I was going to see my therapist, just as I had been doing (on and off) since age 21 to prevent my head from commanding my body to lose weight just for the sport of it. As World Mental Health Day loomed in the distance, serving as the critical reminder we need to approach mental health issues without shame, I began to wonder whether I wasn't doing my daughter a huge disservice not owning my problems completely by being completely honest with her. That night though, I muttered something senseless to my daughter and rushed out the door, feeling a weight grow heavy in my stomach. I knew it was only a matter of time before she would no longer accept my lies, but having children doesn’t automatically mean you become comfortable enough with your own truth to share it. I developed an eating disorder when I was 12. At the time, my parents were deciding if they liked each other enough to stick it out, and I was beginning to equate power with toying with my body and subtracting calories from my daily diet. Losing weight was easy for me, and judging by the many TV commercials for Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers and Suzanne Somers workout videos, I quickly learned this wasn't the case for everyone. I had zero control over anything in my life with the exception of molding my own pubescent body into whatever shape and form I chose. Since this was in the ‘90s, an era when Kate Moss and heroin chic were the stars of my imaginary mood board, their sinewy bodies, absent of most signs of womanly sexual development, were my ultimate goal. Fast-forward 20 years. My daughter is just seven years younger than I was when I got hip to the “tricks” that those who suffer from EDs have committed to memory. Eat cereal in a cup, never a bowl. Drink lots of water every hour to fill up your stomach. Peppermint helps control your appetite. Before flushing food down the toilet, be sure to smear some of it on a plate so your parents will think you’ve eaten. There’s a bottomless magician’s hat of tricks. They take up space in your head where great works of literature, political facts and all of your observations about nature and humankind should reside. And it sickens me to think my kindergartner, who lives for gymnastics, soccer and the color purple, could one day be robbed of both the joy and of the sadness that real life offers because of a preoccupation with body image. Living within the shell of an eating disorder is like starring in your own version of Memento. It can take years to learn how to begin living outside your head again, and it's so easy to forget. It’s a lesson you repeatedly have to learn each morning when you wake up. I’ve remained the same healthy weight for 15 years now, but for me, therapy is a non-negotiable part of life. It’s one of the tools I need to explore those parts of my head that continue to think starving is success. Starving is my personal survival technique when confronting my own mortality and the enormity of a universe I don’t understand. Therapy is a lifeline to the rational world. Most important, now that I’m a mom with two little ones, it’s added insurance that I won’t pass my eating disorder on to my daughter — or son. Between the last Thursday I lied to my daughter and the first Thursday I showed her that piece of myself I prefer to squirrel away, I thought a lot about what it means to hide your mental illness from your kids. I imagined her growing up and feeling anxious, depressed or empowered when she skipped meals, and then feeling alone and like there was no outlet to which she could turn. I could change that with just a few honest words. I could begin to show her that treating your mental wounds and preventing new ones is like going to the doctor when you’re sick; it’s like taking a daily Frozen multivitamin. “Are you going to the store again?” she asked after dinner the following Thursday. “No,” I said and looked straight into her dark blue eyes. “I’m going to therapy.” “Physical therapy?” (Thanks, Doc McStuffins). I explained how therapy was a place where you could talk to someone about things that make you sad, angry and even so happy you don't have words for them. “You can just call it therapy." Her eyes widened. “Oh. Is it fun? It sounds fun.” I want to tell her that, actually, it's the worst — the absolute worst. It can make you question your intentions and the motivations of those around you. There are nights when it leaves me kicking and screaming in my head and wanting so badly to hold colored veils over the people I thought I knew and the person I assumed I was. I want to explain how unfair but liberating it is to realize those veils have suddenly vanished and can never return. But she's 5, and for now, I simply say, "Yes. It can be fun to learn about yourself." This is how we start talking about ourselves to our kids and teaching them to accept themselves. It doesn’t require lengthy, meaningful confessions and platitudes about life while sitting around the kitchen table over cups of chamomile tea. It just takes self-acceptance and honesty on a Thursday evening. Little by little, I’ll teach my daughter everything about my eating disorder in the hopes that she will one day do everything in her power to choose a different path.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 10, 2016 at 11:40AM Image source: The Motley Fool. Warren Buffett is the world's most successful investor, but just because he takes a long-term approach to managing Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-B)(NYSE:BRK-A) $130 billion investment portfolio doesn't mean that he doesn't sell stocks. The Oracle of Omaha will exit stakes in companies when he thinks the long-term prospects have weakened. Three Motley Fool contributing writers think that's exactly what could happen with the stocks below. Nobody likes share dilution Daniel Miller: If you've glanced over the list of companies Warren Buffett owns, there aren't too many duds. And while I don't consider this next stock a dud by any means, I think there are reasons Buffett might continue to unload shares of Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) -- he most recently sold 7.7 million shares, reducing his stake by 25%. Suncor Energy focuses on crude oil production, refining, and upgrading operations as well as marketing petroleum products, which makes the recent low oil price environment challenging for the company. One of the bullish arguments in favor of Suncor is that it's well-suited for the current environment given the strength of its balance sheet. But the problem is that the company also recently diluted its existing shareholders by issuing new stock in order to finance its expansion. Buffett would be excused for not being pleased. SU Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. A great company at a high price Tim Green: Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly $650 million worth of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock. The retailer is, in many ways, a quintessential Buffett stock. Its business model allows it to charge prices that traditional retailers can't match, giving Costco a cost advantage. And its membership is extremely sticky, with a low churn rate ensuring that those membership fees keep coming in year after year. There's little doubt that Costco is a great company, but the stock has soared over the past few years to the point where Berkshire's capital may be better off elsewhere. Costco trades for nearly 30 times earnings, twice as high as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), a valuation that requires substantial growth in order to be justified. Buffett is generally not one to sell a stock simply because it gets expensive, so Costco will probably remain in Berkshire's portfolio for the long haul. But investors considering buying shares of Costco simply because Buffett owns the stock need to be aware of the high price they would be paying. Bigger isn't always better Todd Campbell: By reducing his position significantly last quarter, Buffett continued to signal to investors that he's souring on Wal-Mart and since little has changed at Wal-Mart in the past three months, I think there's a good chance he unloads the rest of his stake. Last fall, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold 4 million shares of Wal-Mart. He doubled down last quarter, cutting Berkshire's exposure by an additional 15 million shares. Berkshire Hathaway still entered the third quarter owning more than 40 million shares of the retail giant, but there's evidence that Buffett is worried about the impact of discounting and competition from Amazon.com on Wal-Mart's bottom-line. In the past year, Buffett has continuously praised Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' business acumen, and in May, Buffett suggested to CNBC that Wal-Mart playing hard-ball with suppliers suggests it's under pressure that could lead to a price war, which would further weigh on Wal-Mart's performance. Given Buffett's admiration for Bezos and his substantial sales of Wal-Mart shares, I don't think it's a stretch to think Buffett's stake in Wal-Mart is going to continue to shrink.

Governor Asa Hutchinson joined executives for the two companies in the Pernod Ricard/Hiram Walker plant in Fort Smith at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, as the Fort Smith-based distiller announced a capital investment that will allow Malibu Rum to be bottled at their facility, according to a press release. Pernod Ricard will not be making the liquor at their plant, just bottling it. Previously Malibu Rum was bottled in Mexico. Company officials said they expect locally bottled Malibu Rum will be on store shelves by November. The Malibu production will require an additional 6,000 hours at the plant over the next year, said Melissa Hanesworth, managing director for Pernod Ricard’s Fort Smith plant. The company expects this increase will boost the seasonal workers to full time, and will also require additional workers at the facility. However, Hanesworth said the expanded production will also create additional local jobs because the facility will require supplies, goods and services. This Pernod Ricard expansion came as part of a collaborative effort between the company and Walmart, which has committed to buying an additional $250 billion in Made in America products. Other products produced or bottled at the Fort Smith plant include Kahlua Liqueur, Seagram’s Gin and Smithworks Vodka.       Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Adventure Arkansas Check the latest 5NEWS adventure.

Doc: 10 takeaways from Bengals-Cowboys The Morning Line Paul Daugherty , pdaugherty@enquirer.com 12:16 p.m. EDT October 10, 2016 197 Shares Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton walks off the field after Sunday's loss to the Dallas Cowboys.  (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar) Cleaning up the blood from the weekend, from Hartford to Arlington, isn’t pretty or fun. Especially when your correspondent remains in Mansfield, TX, which is a suburb of Arlington, which is a suburb of both Dallas and Fort Worth, which are faceless burgs covered in freeways and strip malls. Here’s a tip, kids: Don’t eat press box hot dogs with chili unless you want to risk spending a long night studying the porcelain lady. If you know what I mean, and I think you do. Three a.m. was a helluva metaphor for the weekend. I can’t help feeling The Men turned some sort of corner Sunday, into the darkness and out of the light. I won’t say that definitively because this is the NFL and my crystal ball is in the shop. But the Cowboys exposed ‘em, in a way for the world to see. Thar said, this remains a talented group with a core of players who have been very successful. But a 2-4 start seems likely which projects at best to a wild card game on the road. CINCINNATI.COM Doc: Bengals' loss in Dallas could be problematic Without further ado: TEN THINGS. We are seeing a chink in the personnel dept’s armor. We’ve praised Duke Tobin & Co. for several years, and rightly so. Few teams have been as smart. This year, the operation hasn’t been quite as smooth. Not one guy who replaced a free agent has been as good as the player that left. Not at wideout, not at safety, not at right tackle. That’s why, as much you abhor the playoff futility, it’s worth remembering how remarkable it is to make the postseason 5 years in a row. Change is the only constant in the NFL. Shrewd drafting and smart, second-tier free agent signings kept the Bengals in the hunt for those years. It’s hard to be right every time. And when you’re wrong, you pay the price. I still have no idea who the Bengals want to be on offense. They started the game trying to run. They couldn’t get the ball to AJ Green, who didn’t have one thrown his way until 10 minutes remained in the first half. Lots of this owes to the poor play of the O-line, especially the right side. No one either inside or outside of PBS believed those guys would play this poorly. The line wasn’t seen as a big strength, but not a weakness, either. Yesterday, it got shoved around like a raft in a hurricane. We can question K. Zampese. But without a decent line, no game plan looks pretty. I was amazed in the first half at the push Dallas got on both sides of the ball, on every play. This wasn’t Alabama-Vandy. The Bengals Front 7 includes a couple Pro Bowlers, a rising star at LB. Plus on the back end, three first-rounders in the secondary. Zeke Elliott hasn’t seen that much space since Ohio State played, oh, Purdue. D. Prescott was as advertised. It helped he had six months to throw the ball. But he made exactly zero rookie mistakes and finished with a QBR of 117.9. How do you end up having M. Johnson covering a wide receiver 15 yds. downfield? The Bengals likely will play a lot better at New England. Pride will be in play. The wonder is, how much will it matter? Smarrogant Bill has the definitive video now. Don’t think he’ll use it to the fullest? I thought Dalton did OK, FWIW. He did well on busted plays. His feet saved him. He was sacked four times, could have been eight.  Why stats can be meaningless. The Bengals had 0 turnovers, were 2-for-2 in the red zone, a respectable 5-for-12 on 3rd down and one fewer penalty than the Cowboys. And were never in the game. CINCINNATI.COM Analysis: Why Cowboys beat Bengals TRIP REPORT. I lived in Dallas in the mid-80s, working as a general assignment guy at the Dallas Times Herald, RIP. I thought it was an OK place to live, even though it had nothing in common with anywhere I’d ever lived. Lots of open space. From my backyard in the little burb of Lancaster, I could see Ft. Worth, maybe 30 miles to the northwest. Now, the open space is thick w/subdivisions, every house with its own stockade-fenced backyard, and strip malls. Kinda looks like Houston, and that ain’t good. It’s not a pretty part of the country to begin with, but when you let it sprawl, it’s really kinda depressing. One good spot, a few miles from where I stayed: The Elmer W. Oliver Nature Preserve: A few hundred acres of what used to be a farm, smack in the middle of faceless suburban nowhere. Gorgeous to the point of being surreal. Thick stands of trees, pristine prairie, creek ambling by, fishing pond. What the area looked like pre-Big Lots. If you happen to be visiting D-FW – you will, won’t you? – TML sez ckout Elmer Oliver. I’d never been to AT&T Stadium. Last time The Men played here in a real game, the ‘Boys still played at Texas Stadium. It’s typically Texas massive, seats 90.000 with the video board so huge, those in the far reaches of the place (i.e. me in the press box) tend to watch the TV screen more than the field. My parking pass admitted me to the Wal-Mart lot across the street. First time I’ve ever parked at a Wal-Mart for a sporting event, in 37 years. It was really convenient. After the game, I picked up a quart of milk, some golf balls and a socket wrench. NOW FOR THE OTHER BAD STUFF. . . I spent Saturday afternoon in my car, mostly, meaning I listened to UC-UConn on the radio. A thing about Dan Hoard: He plays it right down the middle, generally. Aside from the bursts of TD-scoring passion, Dan doesn’t go overboard for the home team, one way or the other. On Saturday, the disdain in his voice was palpable. Are the Bearcats in trouble? Yes, they are. No confidence, little leadership, drifting, listless. Four days after TT ripped the home fans for criticizing his players, all those fans got was more ammo. Plenty of time to make things better, or at least less than awful. But for now, his 4th year looks to be his worst. TT starts 18-8 mostly with B. Jones’ holdovers. He’s 10-9 since. Five years is optimum for judging a coach (one complete recruiting cycle) but four years is almost as telling. Four years into the Tubs Era, UC is backsliding. The momentum from the Dantonio-Kelly-Jones years is gone. I’m guessing if he had a few good pairs of comfortable Nikes, Kerry Coombs would walk from Columbus for this job. CINCINNATI.COM UC: 5 takeaways from 20-9 loss to UConn AROUND THE LEAGUE: AND THEN CAME BRADY. From SI.com: If anyone thought, for whatever reason, that the Patriots would need a few weeks to get rolling upon Brady’s return, that notion went out the window in a hurry. Brady looked no worse for the wear, and the Browns’ overmatched defense hardly had the horses to make his Sunday a struggle. NO FUN. Antonio Brown was forced to change his cleats on Sunday after the NFL threatened to disqualify him from the game, according to CBS sideline reporter Evan Washburn. Brown wore black and yellow cleats honoring Muhammad Ali but changed to a solid black pair during the first quarter. Brown was not fined for wearing a black and yellow pair in honor of Arnold Palmer last week. Yet the black and yellow Ali cleats were deemed unacceptable.  Ravens lose twice.With Washington leading 13-10 midway through the third quarter, Baltimore LB C.J. Mosley stepped in front of a Kirk Cousins pass and made an interception at the Washington 13-yard line. Mosley rumbled to the 1 and tried to stretch out the ball over the goal line … and promptly fumbled the ball into the end zone, where it went out of bounds. Touchback. Washington took the ball at the 20, drove for a field goal, and there was no more scoring. Washington won, 16-10. (SI.com) Then the Ravens scored the apparent go-ahead TD with 33 seconds to play, only to have B. Perriman’s catch in the end zone overturned on replay. Stillers roll. There’s no way the Steelers, without the explosive production of suspended wideout Martavis Bryant, could be a complete playoff team unless the prolific Roethlisberger found another gem of a receiver to complement Antonio Brown. He’s found one. Talk about the right combination—Roethlisberger and the angular second-year man from Auburn combined six times for 139 yards and two touchdowns Sunday in the win over the Jets. (SI.com) Sorry, Mobsters. I’m a bit under the weather. Under? I’m subterranean. Hot dogs suck. TUNE O’ THE DAY. . . Heard this first thing in the rental car Saturday. Has that Texas swing feel to it. An homage to Southern rock. Gather ‘round chillun. . .

By Ryan Lenora Brown On 10/10/16 at 6:58 AM 10/21/16 In the Magazine Workers hunch over sewing machines in the Shining Century textile factory in Maseru, Lesotho, on March 2, 2004. The rapid growth of factories like Shining Century has made the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho a poster child for a trade law aimed at encouraging economic development in Africa by dropping tariffs on many products exported to America. Ben Curtis/AP World At the end of each month, Rorisang Kamoli divides up her paycheck, the roughly $100 she earns from inspecting blue jeans in a factory in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. Part of it goes to her husband and infant son; another part pays for her brothers to go to school; the rest buys food for her father and grandparents. Kamoli, 27, is the only one of them with a job, and she owes her position to an unexpected source: an American trade deal.   Close Sixteen years ago, President Bill Clinton signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a deal that allowed about three dozen African countries to sell a variety of goods—from clothing to cars—duty-free to the United States. In Lesotho, a small, mountainous nation encircled by South Africa, the result was a sudden boom in textile production. The industry quickly became the largest in the country’s private sector, producing garments worth $300 million or more every year for American brands like Old Navy and Wal-Mart. That, for the Clinton administration, was mission accomplished. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week The trade deal also sparked a second, unintended shift: It helped women. According to the Lesotho Textile Exporters Association, a national trade group, about five people depend on each individual worker’s salary—and about 86 percent of the textile workers in the country are female. “Women are the ones responsible for their families now,” Kamoli says. For the first time in this traditionally male-dominated society, women started controlling family budgets. But these gains might be short-lived. Because of an attempted coup in 2014—and the messy political aftermath—Lesotho could soon be shut out of the American trade deal as early as next year. The agreement “was meant to be...a way to get more reciprocal trade going between the U.S. and these African countries,” says Cyril Prinsloo, a researcher in the economic diplomacy program at the South African Institute of International Affairs, a Johannesburg-based think tank. But there were conditions: Countries had to maintain “continual progress” toward good governance and human rights standards or risk being cut from the program. A production line of textile workers in a clothing factory in Maseru, Lesotho, on August 18, 2006. Lesotho's clothing industry is the biggest employer in the southern African nation of 2 million people. Pieter Bauermeister/Bloomberg/Getty Joshua Setipa, Lesotho’s minister of trade and industry, estimates that if the country’s textile industry disappears, 300,000 people in a population of 2 million will lose much of their income. That number includes 40,000 garment workers and people who provide services such as food and transportation to the factory employees. A recent drought has made another 680,000 people dependent on food aid, so an implosion of the garment industry could lead to a catastrophe. “A million people hungry looking for a job is a recipe for disaster,” Setipa says. “No country can survive that. You put that many people on the street, you’re going to have a social revolution. You’re going to have a political revolution.” Lesotho’s political crisis began in June 2014, when then–Prime Minister Tom Thabane suspended the country’s parliament to avoid a no-confidence vote. Two months later, a section of the army stormed police stations in Maseru and surrounded a central government building, killing one police officer. Thabane fled to South Africa. Since then, rounds of mediation and a snap election in February 2015 have eased the crisis. But the U.S. government agency that oversees the AGOA said in a 2016 report that it was concerned no one had been held accountable for the August 2014 clashes. The U.S. agency argues that violent power struggles within the army could be “destabilizing” to the country at large.   Last year, the U.S. Congress voted to renew the trade deal until 2025, but most experts say this is likely to be the agreement’s final decade. Michael Froman, the current U.S. trade representative, has repeatedly said that African countries should begin thinking about how to conduct trade in other ways. Aside from the general economic destruction, many in Lesotho worry the deal’s end will also cause women to lose the professional and social gains they have enjoyed in recent years. “I feel powerful because I am the one who makes the money,” says Palesa Lefoka, 23. “I feel that my husband respects me more because of that.” Garment workers were the first in the country to fight for—and win—paid maternity leave, says trade unionist Solong Senohe, a policy that later spread to other industries. Women in garment factories have also had an easier time fighting sexual harassment and other workplace disputes because of international auditors and the comparatively high standards demanded by Western brands, says Mamohale Matsoso, Lesotho’s labor commissioner, whose office is responsible for overseeing labor laws and standards. Kamoli, the blue jeans inspector, says there have been many difficult moments in the factory. The days are long, the supervisors are gruff, and every month her paycheck seems to disappear before she can buy everything she needs. “It’s bad sometimes,” she says. “But the most important thing is that we don’t lose...these jobs.” ­ Ryan Lenora Brown was a fellow with the Wits China-Africa Project in Lesotho.   Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Related Stories Tech & Science No One Wants Your Old Clothes Textile waste is piling up at catastrophic levels thanks...

TakePart.com•October 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What Trump’s Triumph Means for WildlifeMore From Kim Kardashian’s $1-a-minute-earning Kimoji to the cartoon avatars made popular by Bitmoji, there has been a surge of successful apps that offer smartphone users additional emojis. Now a group of zero-food-waste activists are jumping on the shareable-image bandwagon in the hopes of boosting awareness of the “ugly” fruit and veggie movement. To that end, Hungry Harvest, a Baltimore-based company that collects and redistributes misshapen produce to consumers and charities, has launched a petition asking Apple, Google, and Unicode to create and implement ugly produce emojis. Pefectly shaped and sized apples, strawberries, or tomatoes come standard on our smartphone keyboards. Why don’t we have gnarled, bumpy fruits and veggies “that have more personality, better express our feelings, AND help bring awareness to some of the biggest issues of our time?” asks the petition. RELATED: Throwing $165 Billion in the Trash: John Oliver Puts Food Waste on Blast “The concept is trying to bring awareness of the food waste issue to a younger audience, and in a fun way,” Ritesh Gupta, the director of impact at Hungry Harvest, told TakePart. The company, which snagged a $100,000 investment on an episode of Shark Tank in January, has two main values: Food should not go to waste, and people should never go hungry. “The food waste movement, ugly produce, and all of that has definitely been talked about a lot. But sometimes it can feel like we are talking to the same people constantly,” Gupta said. Because of the scope of the food waste problem, this is not the first initiative to direct attention to the stock of eerily “perfect” fruits and vegetables in grocery stores nationwide. Over the past year, the Ugly Fruit and Veg Campaign has petitioned stores such as Walmart and Whole Foods to stock misshapen produce. A major part of why there is so much produce waste is because of “cosmetic standards from large grocers that dictate exactly how fruits and veggies should look,” Ugly Fruit and Veg Campaign founder Jordan Figueiredo said in Hungry Harvest’s petition. About one-third of all food produced—about 1.7 billion tons—is lost or wasted along the food chain, according to a 2014 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Hungry Harvest’s petition cites annual data from a report released last spring by ReFED that found roughly 20 billion pounds of produce goes to waste every year. At the same time, 50 million Americans are food insecure. Figueiredo’s effort seems to be changing the mind of Walmart, but there is still more to be done to normalize ugly produce in the minds of the American public. Gupta said supporting emojis that confront what are now standard preconceptions of how fruit and vegetables should look opens the dialogue about food waste in a “very nonaggressive way.” With a goal of not wasting food, Hungry Harvest is also not wasting time. The company has taken the proactive step of creating a free “Ugly Produce!” app that’s downloadable from iTunes. The emojis allow zero-food-waste activists such as Hungry Harvest and Ugly Fruit and Veg to engage with the “same audience in different ways” while also tackling the challenge of bringing in other audiences who may be younger and “might want to talk about the issue, but not in such a serious context,” Gupta said. The emojis—such as a slice of watermelon with a smiley face—were designed to convey the same emotions people normally see and are already expressing on their mobile devices. “It had to be cute. It had to be relatable, and that’s why we are so cognizant of using items and emotions that people are already thinking about. I’ve never heard someone think about a watermelon and cry. Watermelons are universally loved,” Gupta said with a laugh. RELATED: Reducing Food Waste Could Curb Climate Change The petition has been signed by about 400 supporters, and Hungry Harvest hasn’t heard from Apple, Google, or Unicode. But the feedback Gupta has received from users about the emojis has been positive, with some commenting that the “ugly” name of the app is contrary to how the digital stickers actually look. “We’re trained to be prejudiced against buying an apple that has a few bruises, and most of us would rarely, if ever, pick up a vegetable that is deformed. It is time to change behavior and preconceived notions that perfect means edible,” Gupta said.

That’s because they know all the cool tricks, like how to fix a product that you might have otherwise tossed in the trash or how to incorporate regular household items into your beauty routine. Check out these 10 beauty hacks that will help you get the most out of your makeup, skin and hair-care products — and spend a little less in the process. mady70 / Shutterstock.com 1. Baking Soda Scrub What you will need: Baking soda How much it costs: About $1 at the grocery store or pharmacy If you live in an area with harsh winters, you might notice that your skin starts flaking in spots as early as fall. The colder weather, combined with dryness from heaters, can contribute to dead surface skin. Print and TV makeup artist Alison Raffaele Tatem suggests giving skin a gentle scrub to reveal the new skin underneath — with baking soda. “Turn any cleanser into a micro-exfoliating scrub by adding one to two teaspoons of baking soda,” she said. “Be sure to rinse well and moisturize afterwards, as this treatment can be slightly drying.” Blend the baking soda with a dollop of your cleanser in your hand, massage on to damp skin and rinse. Your skin will feel baby-soft, and the flakes will be gone. Happy Stock Photo / Shutterstock.com 2. Tinfoil Mask What you will need: Aluminum foil How much it costs: About $4 at Walmart Sometimes your skin is in need of a refreshing face mask, but you don’t have one on hand or can’t score a free sample. New York-based makeup artist and brow master Ramy Gafni is the creator of Ramy Beauty Therapy and author of “How to Fake Real Beauty.” He suggests using frozen tin foil as a firming face mask. “Cut out eye and nose holes from a sheet of aluminum foil,” he said. “Place the sheet in the freezer and, once it’s frozen, press it on to your face for 10 minutes or so. The cold foil will tighten pores, reduce puffiness and leave you with a tightened complexion. It’s also a great hangover helper.” This mask might startle your family, but the results can be startling, too — in the best way possible. photopixel / Shutterstock.com 3. Perfect Match Foundation What you will need: A travel bottle and your regular face moisturizer How much it costs: About $1 for the travel bottle at your local drugstore No matter how carefully you examine foundation shades in the store, you’ve likely ended up with a color that wasn’t quite right. If the shade is just slightly off, don’t toss the bottle — try this beauty tip instead. Emmy Award-winning makeup artist and beauty expert Kevin James Bennett said, “Foundations that are too light, too dark or even the wrong undertone (too pink or too yellow) can still be useful and will look fine as a tinted moisturizer. Using a moisturizer with SPF will create a great tinted sunscreen.” He suggests using a travel bottle to mix one part foundation with two to four parts moisturizer and shaking well before each use. The moisturizer will make the coverage of the foundation a lot more sheer and forgiving. Hence, you’ll get more out of your mistaken purchase rather than letting the money go to waste. goodluz / Shutterstock.com 4. Concealer From Foundation What you will need: A small dish from home How much it costs: $0 It’s the night before a big day, and you realize that you’re fresh out of concealer. Don’t panic — your foundation might just do the trick. Raffaele-Tatem suggests putting a few drops of your liquid foundation in a small, clean dish and leaving it out overnight. “Some of the silicone and water will evaporate, leaving you with a thicker, higher-coverage consistency,” she said. “This doesn’t work with all formulas, but in a pinch it’s worth a shot.” Apply your makeshift concealer just as you normally would by using a concealer brush or tapping it on gently with a fingertip. iStock.com / ipag 5. Dewey Skin What you will need: A facial mist, like Mario Badescu Rosewater Facial Spray How much it costs: About $7 at Ulta Most of us have had the experience of carefully applying makeup only to find that, upon final inspection, it looks dry and cakey — especially in cooler weather. Gina Way, a veteran beauty writer and editor — and all-around skincare obsessive whose work is often featured online and in magazines like Marie Claire and Redbook — suggests trying a face mist makeup hack that works for her. See: Accessories Under $5 That Every Wardrobe Needs “As a finishing touch — to make my skin look fresh and totally un-makeup-y — after I’ve applied makeup, I rinse my hands with ice-cold water,” she said. “Then I towel-dry them (so they’re slightly damp). Then, I spritz a face mist, like Caudalie Beauty Elixir ($49), on one palm, clap my hands together and place them lightly over my face and neck. This adds the tiniest bit of moisture and radiance.” Try hydrating your face first thing in the morning and prior to exercising. iStock.com / bikeriderlondon 6. Lackluster Lash Treatment What you will need: A loose setting powder, like e.l.f. Studio High Definition Powder How much it costs: $5.99 at Walgreens If you’re looking to give your lashes a lift, try this beauty tip from celebrity and fashion makeup artist Quinn Murphy: “If you want to add volume and thickness to your lashes, take a spoolie eyebrow brush and dip it in loose setting powder,” he said. “Then brush the powder through your lashes. Follow with mascara, and you will notice fuller, more dramatic lashes.” The loose powder provides a base for the mascara to cling to and can make lashes look far more voluminous. Syda Productions / Shutterstock.com 7. Softer Blush What you will need: Your coffee or spice grinder, translucent face powder like e.l.f. Studio High Definition Powder and a small travel jar How much it costs: $5.99 for the powder and about 50 cents for the jar. Both are available at Walgreens You loved the color of that powder blush in the store, but when you try it on in the light of your bathroom, you realize the shade is far too vibrant. Thankfully, Bennett has a fix for this — and it’s fun. Start by removing the cake from the compact, placing it in your coffee or spice grinder and grinding it to a fine powder. To dilute the intensity, Bennett said, “Add some translucent loose powder to the grinder, whirl it for a few seconds to mix well. This trick will cut down the amount of pigment (color) in the blush but retain the original shade. Place the finished powder in one of your small travel jars.” puhhha / Shutterstock.com 8.  Red Lip Fix What you will need: Raw cane sugar and honey How much it costs: About $3.50 for the sugar at the grocery store and $8 for the honey on Amazon Sometimes you’re in the mood for a vibrant red lip, but if your lips aren’t in the best condition, red can look a bit ragged. Murphy offers the following makeup hack: “If you want to wear a red lip but have very chapped lips, put raw cane sugar into a pea-sized amount of honey. Massage into the lips in small circular motions and then wipe off. Apply a lip balm, and when your lips are moisturized, apply your red lipstick.” The sugar, combined with honey, will help exfoliate and soften the lips, so they are perfectly prepped for the red lipstick. Try this trick any time your lips are dry. Mila Supinskaya Glashchenko / Shutterstock.com 9. DIY Dry Shampoo What you will need: Baby powder or loose face powder. How much it costs: About $1.50 for baby powder and $5.99 for loose face powder If your hair is looking limp but you don’t have time for a proper shampoo, baby power or loose face powder can substitute for a dry shampoo. “Sprinkle the powder on to your scalp in sections and brush through your hair,” said Gafni. “The powder absorbs excess oil and adds volume.” When attempting this hack, apply the powder sparingly at first, so you don’t overdo it and leave your roots looking dusty. This trick is especially effective for oily scalps. Halfpoint / Shutterstock.com 10. Static Relief What you will need: Dryer sheets How much it costs: About $2.50 at the grocery store Hair can develop static, especially in dry, cold weather. To prevent your hair from standing on end, Raffaele-Tatem suggests rubbing a dryer sheet on the head to eliminate static cling. The anti-static ingredients in the sheet help to tame the hair. They also help control static when rubbed directly on clothes. “Works every time,” she said.

October 10, 2016 1:39 AM   Subscribe USA edition. Wanted 12 volt electric blanket with a built in step-down and rectifier circuit from 120VAC to 12VDC. My elderly mother just broke her left hip and is in rough shape. I wanna get her a 12V electric blanket to help warm her that can plug into a standard USA 120VAC socket.. She needs it. I looked at some at Walmart, but they don't mention the electrical details at all (which I understand), but I want to get her one with a step down transformer and a rectifier that brings things down to a paltry 12VDC vs. 120VAC. Bonus points if it's machine washable as well. She has "accidents" some times. Any suggestions, people of the hive mind? Any help is MUCH appreciated. This is my one and only mother we're talking about so I'm quite protective. posted by InsertNiftyNameHere to Shopping (12 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite   Walmart has quite a few listings for low voltage electric blanket and most of them say they are machine washable. I don't know that they're as low as 12VDC; the listings I saw just said "less than 25 volts DC". (Searching for 12VDC only shows me blankets designed to plug into a car's cigarette lighter.) posted by belladonna at 5:25 AM on October 10 (I'm sorry about your mom.) posted by belladonna at 5:25 AM on October 10 You could get a 12V blanket made for car use then get a 120v to 12v transformer converter and use it like that. posted by fixedgear at 6:51 AM on October 10 Walmart has quite a few listings for low voltage electric blanket and most of them say they are machine washable. posted by belladonna at 7:25 AM on October 10 Thank you for that info. I really appreciate it. I guess they must have more items available online than they do in the stores. I really wish they'd spec out the true voltage, but I know that would be over the heads of most people. And I wanted to say that I ran into the same exact problem when specifying a 12VDC blanket. It's all auto related, unfortunately. Thank you for your help and suggestions. As I said I really appreciate it. The poor woman just turned 90 years old and she has dementia, so things are getting really rough. It's getting really rough for both of us, Thanks again! Rick posted by InsertNiftyNameHere at 6:58 AM on October 10 You could get a 12V blanket made for car use then get a 120v to 12v transformer converter and use it like that. posted by fixedgear at 8:51 AM on October 10 I did think about that because the 12 volt charge coming off the PSU would be ideal, and I could rig up a cigarette lighter socket very easily. I just can't seem to get the blanket manufacturers to nail down exactly what voltage their blankets run on, although blankets designed for autos would be a no brainer. It's a shame this is so mysterious when it doesn't need to be.. posted by InsertNiftyNameHere at 7:11 AM on October 10 This manual (pdf) for the Soft Heat Luxury Micro-Fleece Low-Voltage Electric Heated Queen Size Blanket says "Our warming products use between 14 and 18 volts depending upon the model." posted by belladonna at 8:11 AM on October 10 14 to 18 volts is not a significantly greater shock hazard than 12 volts, if that's relevant to your decision making. If you're going to get a car-compatible blanket and run it off your own transformer, make sure the transformer is grunty enough. Electric blankets are not as hungry as most heating appliances, but they are still heating appliances and at low voltages that will mean lots of amps to get the required wattage. I would expect a car-compatible blanket to specify how many amps it draws, but if it doesn't, it should at least specify its wattage and you can calculate its current draw in amps by dividing the wattage in watts by 12 volts. You'd want a power supply capable of continuous operation at maybe 30% over that amperage. posted by flabdablet at 9:26 AM on October 10 A down or high quality synthetic down lap blanket is very effective. And shawls used to be popular for good reason, they're toasty. Lots of trashminas (acrylic pashmina - washable) to be found. A hot water bottle is really effective and safe. Fleece sweater and fleece lap blanket are cozy. I live in Maine, staying warm is an art form. posted by theora55 at 10:28 AM on October 10 I don't know electric blankets specifically, but wouldn't you need the same wattage either way if the heating element is resistive? Ie, wouldn't a lower-voltage blanket just draw more amps to deliver the same heat output? If your worry is about a short through somebody's body due to liquid exposure, I think this could still be dangerous in terms of electrocution -- look at the (momentary) arc you can get when you hook up jumper cables for instance. That's about 12v, but some huge value in amps. Not saying a 12V electric blanket would arc like that -- car batteries have very high current to enable cranking the engine -- but lower voltage + higher amperage is not inherently "safer" than higher voltage + lower amperage. That said, I'm not sure what the actual risk of electrocution from an electric blanket is. I suspect if even the 120v version had a notable chance of hurting people under ordinary conditions, we would have heard more about it by now. posted by Alterscape at 11:28 AM on October 10 lower voltage + higher amperage is not inherently "safer" than higher voltage + lower amperage. Yes it absolutely is, because the amount of amperage drawn by any fixed resistive load is directly proportional to the applied voltage across the load and inversely proportional to the resistance of that load, and the human body is, to a reasonably good first approximation, a fixed resistive load. Dry skin presents as quite a high resistance. Skin wet with an electrolyte such as urine, not so much. Electric blankets powered directly from mains voltage rely heavily on the quality of the insulation around their heater wires. I would not even think about using one with an incontinent patient. The worst-case shock that a low-voltage electric blanket could possibly deliver would not be much worse than what you get from sticking your tongue onto the exposed terminals of one of those rectangular 9 volt smoke-alarm batteries. Even so, I'd be putting the electric blanket under the waterproof sheet, not over it. posted by flabdablet at 6:46 AM on October 12 [1 favorite] Just to be clear: yes, heat output is directly proportional to wattage, and a lower-voltage electric resistance heater of any given wattage will itself be designed to draw more current than a higher-voltage heater of the same wattage. The lower-voltage unit will do this by employing a heating element with less resistance. However, for evaluating shock risk, the amount of current drawn by the heating element doesn't matter at all. What matters is the current flowing through the body, and because the body's own resistance is (to a good first approximation) fixed, that current will be directly proportional to the applied voltage. The highest voltage that a faulty and urine-soaked electric blanket could possibly apply across any two contact points on the sleeper's body is its full supply voltage - up to 18V for the low-voltage blanket, or up to 240V (in the UK or Australia) for the mains-powered one. I know which I'd rather have applied to my own body, and it isn't mains voltage. posted by flabdablet at 6:54 AM on October 12 [1 favorite] Hey OP, flabdablet seems completely right and I was idiotically wrong.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     ToysRUs Price Match Gets Revamped Ahead Of Holiday Shopping Season Posted: Oct 10 2016, 3:12am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Holiday Gift Guide   This story may contain affiliate links.   The ToysRUs price match policy gets an upgrade before the crucial holiday shopping season. Toy retailer ToysRUs has extended its price match policy, making it easier for customers to get a price adjustment on purchased made at ToysRUs. The ToysRUs and BabiesRUs stores will price match local retail competitors and 20 major online competitors in all product categories when requested by a customer. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock Price match is very useful when you want to buy a toy or item right away at a ToysRUs retail location. You just whip out your smartphone and check if Amazon, Walmart or any other listed competitor (full list below) offers a better price.  You then just show the better price on the competitor's website or app on your smartphone at the customer service station. The online prices must be verifiable via competitor website. ToysRUs is also honoring competitors' digital and print coupons. The shipping charges will also no longer be calculated as part of the price match policy and store customer service desks will process requests on the spot, eliminating the need to make an additional phone call after the in-store purchase. "As the authority on toys and baby products, we believe shoppers should be able to buy from us with the confidence they are receiving the best available price possible," said Dave Brandon, Chairman and CEO, Toys"R"Us, Inc.

JoAnna Lou | October 10, 2016 Living in New York, I see a lot of homeless people on the streets with their pets. These animals play an important role in the lives of these marginalized men and women, providing a nonjudgemental relationship in a lonely world. You can imagine how devastating it would be to lose that bond. But that's exactly what happened to a man in Huntsville, Texas, who was fortunate to meet a woman willing to go the extra mile to help. Patrick had fallen on hard times, but was lucky to have his pup Franklin by his side. They didn't have a lot of anything, but Patrick would always make sure Franklin got food first when meals were in short supply. However things took a turn of the worse when Patrick was caught trespassing and landed in jail for two days. During that time, Franklin was brought to the local animal shelter. When Patrick was released, he found out it would cost $120 to get Franklin back. In desperation, Patrick sat in a nearby Walmart parking lot with a cardboard sign that said "Dog in Pound Need Help." Fortunately Wilma Price was out running errands and spotted Patrick and his sign. It left an impression. "I've seen every sign in the world except that one," said Wilma. "I've seen 'I need a beer,' "lost my job," 'need help," I could go on forever, but never this sign." Wilma wasn't in the best financial situation herself, in fact she only had eight dollars to her name, but she was determined to do something. First Wilma called the shelter to verify Patrick's story, which was true. The $120 included the impoundment fee, as well as a rabies shot, heartworm test, and flea prevention. Wilma didn't have the funds, but called a friend to sponsor the money. When Wilma went to the shelter with Patrick, he was incredibly thankful and overwhelmed by Wilma's generosity. Patrick and Franklin were overjoyed to be reunited. Patrick's eyes teared up and Franklin was wiggling with joy. Patrick tried to give Wilma the small amount of money he had collected before, but she refused. "We’ve all been in a bad situation in our life," explains Wilma. "So always remember to pay it forward. You never know who that person might be that you help, but I know for a fact that Patrick loves his dog. I wouldn’t accept his money because maybe he can have some dinner tonight. His dog eats before he does. Wow, that sounds like me too." Anyone who'd like to support Patrick should visit Mr. K's Pet Shelter's web site and address donations to “Patrick and Franklin.” Wilma is planning to further help Patrick by driving him to Dallas in hopes of finding more resources to help him rebuild his life.

Just don’t expect much of a plot A Star is born: Sasha Lane in American Honey. Photograph: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock John Patterson Monday 10 October 2016 03.59 EDT Last modified on Monday 10 October 2016 12.14 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Andrea Arnold shocked at lack of women directors Read more With American Honey, Andrea Arnold, a Briton, has made the richest, sublimest US movie of the year: a docu-fairytale that’s also a musical of sorts, an odyssey-like road trip through the other America, with a working-class teenager’s bildungsroman at its ever-beating heart. Plot-wise, there’s not much to tell: 18-year-old Star (newcomer Sasha Lane), stuck in Oklahoman poverty, looking after her siblings and harassed by her abusive step-dad, sees a charismatic bunch of kids turn into a Rihanna-led song-and-dance flashmob at Walmart and falls for their rat-tailed leader Jake (Shia Le Boeuf). He drops a talisman: a golden iPhone! She picks it up and follows him, donning red slippers and leaving home for ever. The Wizard Of Oz, the Pied Piper and The Red Shoes all conjured in a flurry of images; will Star, like Dorothy, step into her own tornado to discover a new realm of colour and beauty? Or, like the girl in The Red Shoes, will she simply dance herself to death? Facebook Twitter Pinterest American Honey: first trailer for Andrea Arnold's Cannes winner teases rebel spirit Read more Don’t sweat the answer, just hang on for the ride and enjoy the scenery. The troupe of kids are magazine-subscription sellers, criss-crossing the country in a minivan under the piratical leadership of crew-boss Krystal (Riley Keough, ruling every scene she’s in), who speeds ahead in her Mustang seeking new markets and new marks. The kids hype themselves up for this by singing along to rap and country anthems (all chosen by the amateur cast) as the miles roll under them. They love, encourage and guard one another in ways that suggest a lost tribe, a children’s crusade, a pirate ship or a 21st-century remake of Wild Boys Of The Road. American Honey never becomes any of the many movies it calls to mind, for instance, Another Day In Paradise or Spring Breakers (though it has certainly internalised certain lessons of the latter masterpiece). On a solid British chassis of Loach-y social realism and neorealist strategies, Arnold has built a wild, gritty and tough, yet utterly joyous and optimistic, incantatory siren song of a movie, visually intoxicating and musically transformative. Andrea Arnold, above all, has shed her British reserve in a way few British film-makers have ever done while making their first US movie (the distasteful idea of “becoming American” always stymies them). This one really earns its titular “American”: it’s an Arnold movie to its back teeth, but it truly accesses the vibrant swagger and energy of such ur-American film-makers as Wild Bill Wellman and Raoul Walsh. American Honey, like their work, and like no other movie this year, is almost ridiculously full of life.

The Wall Street Journal gathered executives in agribusiness, consumer products, and government to explore challenges and opportunities in the industry last week. A loud voice in the labeling acceptance world, Campbell Soup Company says the company supports labeling because consumers want transparency. Meanwhile, Panera Bread’s founders say they are “not taking a unilateral position on GMOs,” but added Panera supports GMO labeling because that is what their customers want. However, executives of Wal-Mart took a different angle. A Wal-Mart spokesperson says “the debate never should have been about labeling, but rather about whether GMOs are safe or not, and relying on science as the guide.” Wal-Mart officials say food producers and retailers may have to educate consumers to close the gap between perceived and actual risk, but added the company will “always offer what the customer wants.” Source: NAFB News Service Previous articleClosing Comments Next articleGiving Consumers What They Want, Misinformation Hoosier Ag Today Daily Podcast Posted Morning and Mid-day News Crop Insurance Claims in 2016 Gary Truitt - Nov 9, 2016 Crop Insurance Claims in 2016 While there was no widespread crop loss in the Eastern Corn Belt this year, that does not mean there will...

News Entertainment Love & Sex Style Mind & Body Share < br />this article: The best memes from the second presidential debate that made us not want to run screaming Lane Moore @hellolanemoore | 10.9.16 | 9:26 pm Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Getty Images Is it just me or has every presidential debate this year been like watching a slow-moving car crash into hell (especially the VP debate, come on). These memes from the second presidential debate are definitely the only thing that kept us from losing our minds Sunday night, and also Monday morning, and probably the week ahead. As always with the internets, neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump was left out of the meme-ing, since there were just so many meme-able things happening. And we were all still so freaked out by the previous debates (and the future debate) that creating memes was one of the only ways to get through what basically seemed like yet another awkward round of two bickering acquaintances in the produce aisle at Walmart. Well, that and possibly drinking if you’re someone who has alcohol that’s like incredibly strong because these debates are beyond surreal and intense. I mostly just stick to snack foods and seltzer. Here are some the best memes of the night that helped us make it through what seemed like endless days of yelling. Where’s the lie though?

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon It’s a testament to the radical changes happening in shopping malls that one of downtown Toronto’s chicest cocktail lounges opened in mid-September inside a Nordstrom department store. Habitant, the visually striking four-sided bar that sits in the heart of the men’s department on Nordstrom’s second floor, serves up Negronis and snacks to those who want to escape the Eaton Centre’s din on a busy day or need some liquid inspiration to open up their wallets. The bar is only one of a dizzying array of services Nordstrom has incorporated into its format to inject some zing into the 115-year-old department store chain. In addition to another café and a full-service restaurant to round out its food offerings, the company’s fourth Canadian store features a 24-hour concierge service for late-night fashion emergencies; a “men’s clubhouse” lounge and changing area with flatscreen TVs tuned to sports; an extra-spacious “girlfriend” fitting room to accommodate groups of women who shop together; and a children’s shoe department that hosts monthly shoe tying classes. The service-heavy philosophy, coupled with a dose of theatre, is a fitting example of how stores and the malls they inhabit across North America are adapting during an unprecedented period of change for the industry. Gone are the days when you could build ubiquitous, commodity-based retail spaces with ugly front doors “Gone are the days when you could build ubiquitous, commodity-based retail spaces with ugly front doors,” Finley McEwen, senior vice-president of development at Canadian mall developer Cadillac Fairview Corp. Ltd., told an industry audience last month at the International Council of Shopping Centres convention in Toronto. “The customer has way better things to do than fight through traffic to get to spaces like that.” The future of shopping malls, a prevailing theme at this year’s conference, hinges on service-heavy “experiential” retail stores, restaurants, and services, experts say. Mall developers and retailers are all keenly aware how much the Internet is influencing and potentially eroding the classic bricks-and-mortar business model. Both have to contend with a growing cohort of consumers who might still like stores, but visit them less frequently in favour of shopping from the comforts of the couch. Canadian retail sales will grow 1.7 per cent this year to $522.6 billion, a rate vastly outpaced by an expected 15-per-cent increase in e-commerce sales, according to estimates by market research firm eMarketer. Online sales account for only 6.5 per cent of retail sales in Canada, though Forrester Research projects that will rise to 10 per cent by 2019. In the meantime, retail leasing in Canada is expected to become “increasingly polarized” as retailers focus on trying to secure urban locations and space in higher-end malls, “while lingering vacancy can be expected in second and third-tier malls,” according to the 2016 Canadian Market Outlook from commercial real estate firm CBRE. These trends are happening elsewhere as well. In the U.S., Kohl’s Corp., J.C. Penney Co., Sears Holding Corp. and Kmart have collectively closed hundreds of stores in recent years, and this year Macy’s Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Office Depot Inc. have announced hundreds more closures to come. Retailers and mall developers in Canada, still smarting from the void Target Corp. left behind, have been anxious about bankruptcies, traffic declines and store closures among veteran retail chains such as Reitmans Ltd. and Le Chateau Inc. Still, CBRE reported sales at Canadian shopping centres in June were $29.4 billion, a 3.9-per-cent increase from the $28.3 billion reported for June 2015. A key reason for the increase, experts say, is the increasing number of food options at neighbourhood shopping centres, from luxe food halls such as Pusateri inside Saks Fifth Avenue stores to sit-down restaurants like Beaumont Kitchen in west Toronto’s Sherway Gardens mall. Eataly, an Italian fresh food phenomenon with emporiums in the U.S., Dubai and Japan, among others, announced it will open its first Canadian location in Toronto’s Manulife Centre in 2019. “There has to be something innovative that is happening in the shopping centre industry to attract the customers away from their screens and into the malls,” Debbie Kalisky, associate in retail development at Montreal-based retail design firm GH&A, said at the ICSC conference. “It’s about offering them something unique and innovative, a place where they can socialize and have experiences with people in the same community, which is something that you can’t do when you are shopping online.” Food and beverage is a “core component” of the reinvention of the mall, she said. “The shopping centre is now a place to wine and dine, and it’s a place where we never had full-service restaurants before and where we now have full-service restaurants.” Food and entertainment now account for 22.1 per cent of the space leased in U.S. malls, compared with 19.2 per cent in 2012, according to recent data from CoStar Group Inc. and cited in the Wall Street Journal. “It’s really a paradigm shift from what was a commodity-based retail world to a more experiential one,” Kalisky said. Retailers whose categories are vulnerable to commodification by the Internet — such as footwear and books — have also made big efforts in recent years to engage their customers. For example, Indigo Books & Music Inc. has been opening up American Girl doll boutiques in its stores across Canada that host doll dress-up events and storytelling parties. “What we find with millennials is they are not as connected to things as we are — they are connected to experiences,” said Fab Stanghieri, senior vice-president of real estate and construction at Cineplex Digital Media. “Even when we design spaces for people to interact in groups, there has to be seating for six, eight, 10 people to share the experience.” Developers look to innovative theatre chains for cues as to what might work well in retail, because theatres continue to perform well in North America and remain key mall tenants despite decades of encroachment on their traditional turf by at-home viewing technologies. Cineplex has made the movie-going experience increasingly entertaining over the past five years by incorporating interactive trivia games, seats that shake in tandem with the on-screen action, 3-D and licensed VIP theatres where patrons can order restaurant food and alcohol to their plush, reclining seats. “It’s all about competing with your couch,” Stanghieri said. “We compete with being able to watch Netflix at home. Our biggest year attendance-wise, ever, was last year, so movies aren’t dead.” Cineplex’s latest venture is Rec Room, an entertainment complex that debuted its first location in mid-September at the South Edmonton Common mall. Half of the 60,000-square-foot venue consists of dining and live entertainment; the other half is filled with attractions and games, including axe throwing, a racecar simulator, luxury bowling, ping pong, pool tables and air hockey. There are also performance spaces for live music and programmed entertainment, and app-based gamification allows guests to play interactive digital games with others at the complex. There has to be something innovative that is happening in the shopping centre industry to attract the customers away from their screens Cineplex aims to open 10 to 15 Rec Room locations across Canada over the next few years. “As developers and as property managers, we need to look at our business as a whole and think about how we make it more compelling for people to come in,” said Sheila Jennings, general manager at Cadillac Fairview’s Toronto Eaton Centre. “If we can’t speak passionately to (our customers), then we don’t deserve to win. And we are in this to win.” There are signs, despite disruption and turmoil in the world of traditional retail, that all the initiatives aimed at attracting people to the mall could be working, even among the youngest crop of consumers who embrace online shopping with gusto. A recent survey by Chicago-based wealth management firm William Blair & Co. LLC found that more teens said they were visiting malls in 2016 than they did in 2015, the first rise in teen mall visits since 2013. The survey said 41 per cent of respondents had visited malls more often in 2016, while only 37 percent report visiting malls less frequently. All the changes at the mall are positive for consumers, said Cadillac Fairview’s McEwen. “[Three decades ago], the majority of the time was spent developing shopping centres that were not very nice places,” he said. Now, “the customer is far better off buying that shirt online and getting it delivered to their door than going through that type of experience. So we have to deliver a pleasant, inspirational experience and make sure they have got a reason to come to the shopping centre.” hshaw@nationalpost.com Twitter.com/HollieKShaw Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Seems like we’re easy to stereotype.” In exchange for Oliver’s insights, I agree to be e-introduced to her friend, Daniel Justus, who would show me another side of things. “Not everyone in Buchanan is going to hell,” she says. “Some people are making something of their lives.” I quickly forget about our deal as Oliver tells me about her travails. But that evening, an email arrives from Daniel. He calls himself “the boy who escaped”. It piques my interest. What, I wonder, was Daniel escaping from? The drive to Daniel’s family home takes me across rugged mountains, through mist-shrouded valleys and past churches. Lots of churches. I counted about one a mile. A few hundred yards from Daniel’s valley, there is a Church of Jesus Christ with a large billboard you cannot miss. “When life gives you more than you can stand, just kneel,” it says. Daniel clearly wasn’t paying attention. Since childhood he has been kicking against the fate that everybody around him--barring his mother, Karen--seemed to have preordained. When Daniel was in eighth grade (aged 14), he argued in front of the school board for his right to be taught extracurricular courses that would let him apply to college. The school principal had repeatedly turned him down. He won. “Nobody could understand why I would want to do that,” he says. “I convinced them it was my right.” Then he insisted on learning Spanish, even though there was just one qualified teacher in the county. They set up interactive television classes so he could learn remotely. He is now a Spanish interpreter for the state of Virginia. Then he wanted to learn Chinese. Today he speaks and writes fluent Mandarin. Last summer, he spent three months working for a Chinese law firm in Shanghai, dealing in intellectual property rights. Last weekend, he graduated with distinction from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Next stop is a postgraduate degree at an Ivy League university or Oxford. “I’m still thinking about where to apply,” he says. Most of Daniel’s peers from high school found jobs at the hulking local Walmart, telemarketing from home or as welders on construction sites. One or two found work in the coalfields, or what is left of them. Others have fallen prey to the heroin epidemic. Many of the girls, including Oliver, got pregnant in their teens. “I knew one girl who got pregnant at 14,” says Daniel, now 22. Like most others I saw in Buchanan, he has good teeth, though he has purged all trace of his Appalachian accent. To put it mildly, he has defied the odds. Daniel was also the first person I met in Buchanan County who had not voted for Trump. In November, he will vote for Clinton--though without much enthusiasm. “Trump is just another drug,” Daniel says. “People round here are addicted to escapism.” The first thing that strikes you about Daniel’s home is its serenity. From the covered porch with its lazy ceiling fans, you gaze up verdant slopes to wooded hilltops. In the garden, there is a weeping willow and cherry trees. As dusk falls, the air comes alive with the sound of tree frogs and cicadas. You can hear the occasional braying of the family donkey, Jackson. The second thing that strikes you is the garish cliff-face carving of the Confederate flag on the other side of their narrow valley. It overlooks the large, floodlit football field of Hurley High School, whose principal Daniel outfoxed when he was a student. The Hurley Rebels team colour is the old Confederate flag. “Heritage not hate,” is what the flag’s apologists say it represents. To Daniel the slave state flag evokes something more visceral--a culture that prizes sport to the exclusion of all else. It is not just the school. In place of petrol prices, the signs outside the local gas stations proclaim, “Good luck Rebels!” When the team win, it makes the front page of The Mountaineer, the county’s main newspaper, next to stories about suicides, local beauty pageants and elk poaching. “Faith, Family, Football,” says a banner in the school’s main hallway. “We bleed red and blue,” says another. The sign outside the girls’ bathroom reads, “Lady Rebels”. The only other school banner I could see said: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” The school has no science laboratory. Its library consists of two half-empty rows of shelves. A few months ago, Hurley High tipped most of its library’s contents into a nearby dumpster. “I found Oliver Twist in there,” says Joshua, Daniel’s middle brother. The family salvaged a bookshelf’s worth of discarded titles. Daniel is not just an exception in Buchanan County. I am tempted to think of him as the canary in the coal mine--except this one managed to fly to its freedom. His mother Karen, a chain-smoking force of nature, puts his success down to being strangely different. “When he was 18 months old he knew his alphabet backwards,” she says. “He still doesn’t have a clue how to change the engine oil.” When Daniel’s father, Danny Justus, a coal salesman and Baptist preacher, and his two younger brothers went deer hunting, Daniel would tag along with a book. While the others stalked deer with their rifles and crossbows, Daniel would sit under a tree reading. He refused to eat the venison. The book that influenced him most was Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage. It tells the life of a clubfoot boy who could never fit in. Karen knew this about her son and nurtured it. When Daniel felt down and ostracised, she would egg him on. “I told him, ‘Buchanan isn’t even a piece of the jigsaw--it’s barely a speck on a piece of the jigsaw in that large world out there,’” she says. “None of this will matter if you escape.” When the Rebels won a game, the principal would broadcast it triumphantly over the public address system. If Daniel won a spelling bee contest, or a debate competition--as he did on every occasion — it would pass unmentioned. Karen would head down to the principal’s office and demand that his feat be broadcast. Anyone who meets Karen, a robust woman with a mischievous glint in her eyes, would think twice about taking her on. “Think about that,” Karen says, waving a smouldering Marlboro Light: The teachers didn’t care if you could spell or argue. They think too much ‘learnin’ is bad for you. That’s the teachers! Can you imagine what everyone else thinks? Her words reminded me of Trump’s praise for the kids who don’t turn out like Daniel. “I love the poorly educated,” he said. The other trait that separated Daniel from others was his dislike of coal. In Buchanan County, that is tantamount to atheism. Many in his family had fallen victim to the hazards of working underground--the dreaded black lung disease, the sleep apnea, split tendons, slipped discs and orthopaedic ailments that come from a half-bent myopic existence in the dust-ridden bowels of Appalachia. Others, including relatives of Daniel, have fallen prey to the prescription drug culture that supposedly exists to ease their pain. One close relative, whom Karen asked me not to name, was caught distributing pills. Tamara Neo, the attorney who co-chairs Trump’s regional campaign, put him away for 10 years. “Neo was ruthless with poorer addicts who couldn’t afford lawyers,” says Karen. “There was no forgiveness.” The closest Daniel came to a fight at school was when he argued the benefits of renewable energy. A football jock wanted to punch him. Parents demanded that a sympathetic teacher be disciplined for making a case against coal. What angers Daniel is that his people are clinging to a way of life that has crippled them--often literally. “It’s as if they have Stockholm syndrome [where a prisoner falls in love with his captor],” he says. Dana Oliver, Daniel’s school friend who introduced us, puts it another way. In the absence of coal, half the county now subsists on federal handouts--Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security disability payments and other “entitlements”. Alone in the Republican field, Trump vowed to protect them. Whatever else you can say about the New York property magnate, he knows his market. Call it big-government conservatism for white people. Says Oliver: Coal is not coming back--it costs too much to open a flooded mine. In their heart of hearts, most people know that. Trump just gives them a little bit of hope. But there is another way of looking at Trump’s wild popularity in the region. Before the start of each shift, a preacher calls for God’s blessing on the miners. In this part of the world, the church is almost as ubiquitous underground as it is above. In the wake of the mine closures have come bad habits. People sell food stamps for opioid pills, says Oliver. Church attendance has fallen. God is missing in action. “If you think about it, what Donald Trump wants to do is bring God back into their lives,” she says. “That’s the way a lot of people see it.” Tamara Neo, Trump’s main cheerleader for the region, certainly sees it that way. Every morning she puts her three children into her Range Rover for the 45-minute drive to a private Christian school across the state border in West Virginia. There is too much godlessness in today’s public schools, she believes. As we drive, Tamara tests her children on the Bible. “John 1, verses 16-18,” she barks into her iPhone’s Siri app. The verses appear on screen. “Now say the verse, Axella,” she says to her daughter, who’s in fifth grade. Axella stumbles over it then yawns. “Again,” says Tamara, until she gets it right. She moves on to Io, her eldest: “Exodus 20, Verse 12,” she says. “Go Io.” Next comes Flux. Then she makes them recite Lincoln’s Gettysburg address--all 278 words of it. She does not stop until they get it right. With children called Io, Axella and Flux, Tamara betrays her western origins. People in Virginia are conservative with names. Tamara and her husband Flux, also a lawyer, moved here from Colorado 10 years ago because they loved the beauty of the Great Smokies. She ran as commonwealth attorney for Buchanan County--an elected position as chief prosecutor for the area. She lost her re-election in 2010 but not before putting scores of people away for prescription drug-dealing. “In a close-knit community like this, a prosecutor quickly prosecutes herself out of a job,” says Tamara. “You know too many people.” Almost never in her four years on the job did she come across cocaine or even meth. “The epidemic is in prescription pills,” she says. “People will do anything to get hold of them.” Like many of Trump’s evangelical supporters, Tamara does not mind the thrice-married candidate’s lurid tabloid past. After all, Ronald Reagan had been divorced. “Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future,” she says. What most appeals to her about Trump is that he talks without a trace of political correctness. He calls things the way he sees them. Gaffes that would have felled a lesser man--calling illegal Hispanic immigrants “murderers” and “rapists”, for example, or obsessing over supposed slights about the size of his penis--have left Trump unscathed. “He just keeps walking through one fire after another and coming out the other side untouched,” says Tamara. “I take this as a sign.” In spite of having Mexican ethnicity on his father’s side, Tamara’s husband Flux, with whom she shares a private legal practice, is if anything even more Trumpian than his wife. He was raised by foster families in Tucson, Arizona, before “emancipating” himself in his teens. He dropped his Hispanic name for an invented one, Flux Neo, to symbolise a new beginning. Flux also found God. He still bears traces of his tough street childhood, which seems to come straight out of television drama Breaking Bad. His tongue is pierced and a tattoo in Sanskrit encircles his neck. It translates: “There is no higher religion than truth.” On his wall hangs a framed tableau of a dead tarantula and a dead scorpion. It reminds him of his past. Nobody supports building Trump’s wall with Mexico more than Flux does. “I’ve seen the Mexican drugs cartels close up,” he says. “I know what they can do.” A few weeks ago, Tamara introduced Trump at a rally in Radford, Virginia. Flux took a video of it. The whole family was there. It was the performance of her life and the largest crowd she had ever addressed. In court she would occasionally suffer from stage fright. But on this occasion she felt no trace of nervousness. Shortly before Tamara went on, Trump had put her at ease. He was so humble and gentle, she says. No cussing or cursing. He asked about her home town. Then she walked up to the microphone. Her short speech focused on Trump’s promise to “make America great again”. Tamara said: For all those trolls and haters out there, let me be clear. I am no longer OK with charming, smooth politicians speaking kindly to me as they destroy my children’s future. I don’t need someone to never use a foul word. I don’t need my president to have polished, perfect teeth: I want action! I don’t need a president to have perfect hair, I need him to have balls! Tamara had done what she was asked to do. She made the crowd roar. Then the big man came on. A few days later, Trump broke the barriers with his massive victory in Buchanan and surrounding counties. Tamara believes he will do it again in November: For the first time in my life, I believe we can get America back again. I have been waiting a long time for Trump to come along. Joshua Justus has a better idea than most of America’s past. Now almost 80, Daniel’s grandfather became a miner when he was just 15. Harry S Truman was still president. Joshua could barely read or write. He earned 70 cents an hour. He can vividly recall childhood scenes of the Depression, when people queued for hours for a slice of bacon. I sit on his porch in the fading light listening to him reminisce. Something about this toothless old miner, dressed in 1950s trousers and braces, sucking intermittently on his oxygen mask, reminds me of Daniel’s mother Karen--Joshua’s daughter. Perhaps it is his outspokenness. Joshua says he hated working in the mines. “I wouldn’t wish that on a dog,” he says. I ask him what he thinks of his grandson, flying off to Shanghai again in a couple of weeks for further work experience, this time taking his father, who has never set foot outside of the US. Could he imagine one of his own would one day speak Chinese? The grandfather chortles. “Book learning is no good if you don’t have common sense,” he says. After a pause, he adds: “Daniel has plenty of both.” The only smart way to go nowadays is to get educated and get out, he adds. What he cannot understand is why “people round here” cling to the mines: When a crook like Trump comes along, promising this and promising that, they are ready to believe anything. Some people round here aren’t so smart.” Trump is a “disrespectful and very ill-mannered” man, he adds. He doesn’t have a good word to say about anybody. Daniel, on the other hand...  Our conversation turns to Daniel’s latest bugbear--stopping Buchanan from wasting its meagre budget on a new Bible studies class. The curriculum was approved by the Southern Baptist Convention, which embraces creationism. The young scholar wrote a letter to The Voice, the regional paper, which goes to the heart of the area’s future. Between the lines, it also tells us about the boy who escaped--and how, in spite of everything, he wants to return home to help it through its collapsing morale. Daniel wrote: I was fortunate enough to have been raised by parents who taught me to be a critical and independent thinker. Not all students in Buchanan County are quite so fortunate. Rather than challenged and encouraged, our children are stymied and restrained--their eyes blinded and their feet bound by a lack of curricular diversity and an overabundance of empty justifications for their plight. The world outside south-west Virginia demanded “fungible soft skills” and “critical thinking”, he wrote. It was unlikely a Bible studies class would do that. It was a bold letter--perhaps a little arrogant but sharply relevant. Beneath Daniel’s words there was a reply from Earl Cole, the paper’s proprietor, and one of the region’s leading opinion formers. He is also a Trump supporter and a friend of Tamara Neo: It is not a good thing, totally, to be trained to be a critical thinker. As for the Bible, it is the Holy Book. There is no better manual for preparing for life in the real world. But it was the proprietor’s closing paragraph that made me catch my breath. I had to reread it to feel its edge: Mr Justus does not say whether he is a believer or not. But in reading his letter, I can see that he has a lot to learn. J.

It happened before 7 p.m Saturday in the parking lot of the store located at 3465 York Commons Boulevard.

No one is allowed in the county until the evacuation is lifted. Caitlin Turner 1 of 6 i By Caitlin Turner cturner@islandpacket.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Cars lined up for what appeared to be miles on U.S. 278 near the Beaufort and Jasper County line on Sunday morning as drivers attempted to re-enter after evacuating for Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina Highway Patrol troopers at the scene said only those with a re-entry pass would be able to pass the barricade just past the Walmart. Those passes, they said, are mainly for emergency personnel and utility workers. One trooper said she did not know when the roadway would be open for all drivers. Officers from the SC Law Enforcement Division were also at the scene. A Bluffton Police Department release this morning said no decision had been made on when residents would be allowed back in. The department also said the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew would be in place tonight. Capt. Bob Bromage of the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office said the county would have a meeting today at noon to announce new re-entry information. That was little comfort to those on the highway Sunday morning. "I went to get a cup of coffee from Bluffton and now they won't let me back through," Dave Angelino, a Bluffton resident, said as he stood outside his parked car. Angelino said he has a son with special needs and that even then he was unable to pass through the barricade. The road was also blocked Saturday evening. Troopers on Saturday received a “few calls,” but rumors of miles-long backups in the area were “blown out of proportion,” said S.C. Highway Patrol Lance Cpl. Gary Miller. The call to shut down the major thoroughfare came from local emergency management officials who decided conditions were not safe enough for travel. “Collectively we (the Sheriff, myself, the power utilities, in consultation with SC Emergency Management Department and the Governor’s Office) made the decision that this was the best course of action. Currently there are 92,000 customers without power in Beaufort County. There is no functioning hospital. There are no functioning traffic control devices,” Lt. Colonel Neil Baxley sent in a text message to local officials.

(Eric Risberg/Associated Press) By Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Published: October 9, 2016, 6:00 AM A   A Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, Calif. headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. A ‘Journey’ Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said.

Thomas Suddes writes that Clinton's in-depth knowledge of the nation's security challenges and grasp of economic realities compared to Donald Trump's narrow skill set make her the clear choice for president. (Andrew Harnik, Associated Press) Print Email Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com By Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 09, 2016 at 5:30 AM, updated October 09, 2016 at 8:55 AM comments There's not much Trump doesn't know about real-estate speculation and sweet tax breaks. This election isn't to decide whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would be the lesser evil. Nor is it a contest to judge whether Trump or Clinton is the more likable. Trump's words have proven him despicable. And even on a good day, Clinton's controlling personality appears brittle. The real question is which is prepared to lead the United States. Our country's changing ethnically, racially, religiously. A voter can fear that, lament that, or welcome that. But one thing she or he can't do, no matter who becomes president, is reverse it. Clinton understands that. Trump clearly doesn't. Then there's free trade. Trump has said, correctly, that for many Ohioans, free trade is a plus for Wall Street, a minus for Main Street. Cheap Walmart prices don't offset stagnant wages. But Trump, like King Canute, thinks he can order back the tide. Free trade isn't going away, however; too many big shots want it. Meanwhile, it's worth recalling that, as PolitiFact reported, "Trump is right that Clinton once supported NAFTA and [the Trans-Pacific Partnership]." That's why Clinton must stop word-parsing and triangulation. As president, she must ensure that free trade is fair trade. That's all working Ohioans want – fairness. With that, they can succeed. Another fact of life is the rise of China, Russia's machinations and the quicksand that is the Middle East. Clinton's experience as a U.S. senator and secretary of state qualify her to address those realities. There's not much Trump doesn't know about real-estate speculation and sweet tax breaks. But what Trump doesn't know about foreign policy would fill a big public library. Those factors demonstrate why this election must pivot on qualifications. Clinton's qualified. Trump's not. And if Clinton's candidacy is a referendum on Barack Obama's stewardship, she's earned Ohioans' votes. When Obama became president in 2009, Ohio's unemployment rate was 8.9 percent; in August, it was 4.7 percent. The day Obama was inaugurated, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 7,949.09; on Wednesday, it closed at 18,281.03. Freddie Mac reports that for the week that ended Thursday, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages it surveyed averaged 3.42 percent; the annual average in 2008, the year before Obama was sworn in, was 6.03 percent. And in constant dollars, 2008's average pump price for regular unleaded gas was $3.61 a gallon; it was $2.45 last year, the Energy Information Administration reports. You don't have to like Hillary Clinton or for that matter to loathe Donald Trump to consider Clinton the better presidential prospect. She is. Demonstrably.

We stopped at the car wash on Main across from Walmart, and as I leaned out to pay for the car wash, my wallet must have fell out of my pocket. Here we were hundreds of miles from home and no wallet. The next morning Tom from the Elks Lodge called and said he found the wallet in the parking lot. All the money was gone, but everything else was there. He in turn mailed it to me. I am thankful that my wallet was found and that it got back to me. Our memories of Cortez will always remind us of the good people in the world. Thanks again. Ted Nowell Seal Beach, Calif.

Yard Sales Want to know where the yard/garage sales are this week? (read more) By Kara Zoeller, Citizens' Voice columnist / Published: October 9, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     I know we’re just getting into the full swing of fall, but Christmas isn’t far behind! If you already have your money saved for the holidays and are ready to check off the items on your gift lists, that’s great! If you haven’t even started putting money aside, no worries ... here are a few ways to quickly bulk up your Christmas budget. Although you may feel it’s a little late to start a savings account for your holiday shopping, luckily, there are still 11 weeks until Christmas. If you could manage to put just $50 away each of those weeks, you’ll end up with more than $500 for your shopping. That’s a good chunk of change, especially when you purchase gifts on sale. Now I’m not suggesting that you wait until the last week to shop ... this would be more of a working fund that you would pull money from as you find deals on the gifts you need. Another great way to rack up some Christmas cash is with Swagbucks. Swagbucks is a site where you earn points (called SB) for things you’re probably doing online already like searching, watching videos, discovering deals, and taking surveys. Then, you take those points (one SB is worth one penny) and exchange them for gift cards to places like Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, Target, or even for PayPal cash. Unlike a lot of other rewards sites, you can cash out at any time, and they have gift cards for as little as 300 SB (The $3 Amazon gift card — every little bit helps). I can’t even tell you how many Amazon gift cards I’ve gotten using this program. I’m sure a stack of those would come in handy this holiday season, and right now, you can even get a 400 SB bonus! You can find out more about that at SavingByDesign.com/SBbonus. One way to stay within your budget or grab some gifts while you’re still working on your holiday savings is to take advantage of layaway programs. This is a great way to get the big ticket items on your holiday gift list. When you find a deal at a store with layaway, you can take advantage of paying for it over time. Local stores offering layaway include Walmart, Kmart, Sears, Toys R Us, Burlington Coat Factory, and more. Sometimes you’ll also find special financing options available online. For example, last year I got my kids Kindles with a special 6-month interest free financing promotion that Amazon was offering. As you can see, even if you’re a little behind, there’s still plenty of time to save for the holidays using one (or all) of these methods. Happy saving!

How to describe Pence There are three words to describe Mike Pence: Self righteous liar. Great job! I would like to take the time to thank the city of Ocean Springs employees who come around every Friday morning like clockwork in the big city truck picking up debris and household trash. They do a wonderful job and even take time to rake up anything that was missed. Thank you so much for your hard work. Y’all know Cruisers, I am happy you visit my hometown on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. By the enjoyment in y’all’s faces, y’all know how to vacation. Thanks for letting me be a part. Watching your beautiful antiques puts a sparkle in my eyes. Wildflowers Regarding the section of I-10 in Jackson County that had the median stripped of its trees, I wish MDOT would spread native wildflower seeds in this section. No phones Driving has become a nightmare during the daytime. Driving to Wal-Mart, I had to use my horn five times to warn other drivers who were crossing over into my traffic lane without their knowledge because they were occupied with their cellphones. They were looking at their phones and drifting over into my lane. Had I not sounded my horn, they would have hit me. Cellphone use while driving is in epidemic proportions. Stop looking at your phone while driving. Missed it I must have missed your Sound Off about Trump constantly interrupting Clinton during their debate. Oh, there wasn’t one, was there? President’s pick You are right that the president can’t take away your guns, and it takes the Supreme Court to end a constitutional amendment. But who do you think appoints the Supreme Court justices? You bet, it’s the president, and if Hillary gets in, all the justices will be liberal. Praying for you To all in Melbourne, Florida, from your sister city of Melbourne, Australia: You and all your entire coastline are in our prayers. We’ll be back We have been staying in your lovely town and went to the parade for us Cruisers. Hancock tourism was great on giving us all our information on Cruisin’ sites and what to do and where to go. It was our first time. We will be back and tell all our Cruisin’ friends.

Kohl’s rolls out its own mobile payments platform, Kohl’s Pay Posted Oct 5, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Volvo cars will start talking to each other by the end of 2016 Larger retailers are beginning to offer their own alternatives to emerging mobile payment systems, like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Today the latest to launch its own, independent mobile payment platform is department store chain Kohl’s, which has now integrated “Kohl’s Pay,” along with its loyalty and rewards programs, into the company’s mobile app. As of this morning, Kohl’s Pay is available nationwide, the company says. The retailer had previously announced the arrival of Kohl’s Pay as an expansion to its existing mobile wallet capabilities, which had allowed consumers to save their payment information and collect promotions and rewards. Kohl’s mobile payments launch follows other recent moves from Walmart and CVS, which also now have their own mobile payment solutions bundled in their smartphone applications. However, Kohl’s initiative is different in that it doesn’t allow consumers to add their own payment cards — instead, the solution is entirely focused on Kohl’s Charge, its private label card. That will make it less appealing for shoppers who are simply looking for an easier and quicker way to check out at the register, while also tapping into offers and rewards, like Kohl’s Cash and Yes2You Rewards. kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-simplicity_screen_2x-image kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-savings_screen_2x-image kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-transaction_screen_2x-image  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit That being said, the retailer has more than 25 million active cardholders across the U.S., so there is a sizable market that may be interested in using Kohl’s Pay at the point-of-sale. And these are Kohl’s most active and loyal customers — 60 percent of its in-store sales are done through its store cards, the retailer has said. What makes the solution better than traditional methods (e.g. cash, credit cards) is that it allows shoppers to automatically redeem the rewards they’ve collected in the app’s mobile wallet, at the same time as they check out — that is, it all takes place within one transaction. Plus, because transaction histories are stored in the app, returns and exchanges become easier, as consumers won’t have to dig up their paper receipts. One area where Kohl’s did mimic other retailers is in how the mobile payment service works. Unlike with Apple Pay or Android Pay, Kohl’s Pay does not support NFC (tap to pay) transactions. Instead, consumers launch the app, choose Kohl’s Pay from the menu, then scan the QR code that appears on the customer display at point-of-sale. This code is scanned once to both pay for the transaction and apply the savings. Then you tap to approve and complete the transaction. The app, which has been downloaded 14 million times, also lets shoppers save Kohl’s gift cards in their mobile wallet, browse products, scan items in store, receive sale alerts, check out in the store then get the item shipped for free and more. What’s interesting about the launch of Kohl’s Pay is that Kohl’s was also an earlier adopter of Apple Pay, having been the first retailer to add its private label card and rewards program to Apple’s payment service. But with Apple Pay and other solutions, retailers don’t have such easy access to shopping data as when they use their own platform. With Kohl’s Pay, the company will be able to gain more insight about its sales and promotions, among other things. Kohl’s Pay is available in the retailer’s mobile app, found here. The app is available on both iOS and Android. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Kohl’s Founded 1988 Overview Kohl’s Corporation (Kohl’s) operate family-oriented department stores that sell apparel, footwear and accessories for women, men and children; soft home products, such as sheets and pillows, and housewares.

Today, highly complex projects straddle multiple specialized disciplines and involve many different individuals and teams. We inevitably miss key steps in addressing difficult challenges, due to limited memory, faltering attention, poor communication, unforseen events, or other factors. In effect, while we know a lot more today, we often don't apply our knowledge effectively. Therefore, we are constantly faced with avoidable errors in fields such as surgery, disaster management, software design, intelligence failures, and finance – indeed, in any area of human endeavor that requires the quick application of enormous knowledge to challenging problems with uncertain outcomes. Checklists provide an effective method for avoiding error. They trigger the right action by the right person at the right time. Effective checklists activate the specialized knowledge most applicable at a particular point in time, and optimize communication between different sets of specialists. In this way, checklists help avoid one of the principal challenges of modern organizations: the ‘silent disengagement' that results when specialists only keep their narrow tasks in mind instead of focusing on broader team or organizational outcomes. In advocating for the checklist, Gawande is not minimizing the importance of human discretion. On the contrary: in conditions of uncertainty – when a surgeon is operating on a patient, or a building is being constructed, or a venture capitalist is picking an entrepreneur to back - human judgment is vital. The goal of the checklist is not to eliminate discretion but to help ensure the optimal mix of procedure and discretion. Gawande notes that good checklists help balance competing principles: freedom and discipline, craft and protocol, specialized ability and group collaboration.  Some industries excel at using checklists to execute highly complex projects. For example, in the construction industry, a construction schedule contains a detailed, daily list of all the tasks that need to be executed including any dependencies. A second checklist, called a ‘submittal schedule', specifies communication tasks. This list ensures that different specialists speak to each other at critical stages and factor in any unforeseen events that have arisen. Specialists from 16 different fields, each dealing with some aspect of architecture, engineering or building, come together to build these two lists, which have an excellent record in achieving construction objectives. In a riveting account, Gawande discusses his experience helping the World Health Organization develop a surgery checklist that has led to drastic improvements in high and low-income countries. A wide range of metrics improved after the implementation of painstakingly devised checklists, including decreases in infections, deaths, and major surgical complications.  Gawande has much to say about decision making in the modern organization. A key theme is that in conditions of extreme uncertainty, there tends to be information overload and an overwhelming number of decisions need to be made. In such conditions, a centralized command-and-control approach is ineffective. Organizations should therefore decentralize power, empowering agents and employees on the front lines to make decisions and generate solutions. For example, Gawande shows how FEMA's failures in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina stemmed from an overly centralized system in which key tasks, from the delivery of water and food to the requisition of buses, were not executed due to decision making bottlenecks. By contrast, Walmart was able to successfully respond to the crisis through its nimble, decentralized decision-making structure. Senior Walmart executives issued limited instructions, focusing instead on establishing goals, evaluating progress, and instituting checks to ensure constant communications across the team and with applicable agencies. This simple approach led to early and significant successes in the provision of water and emergency supplies, the setting up of mobile pharmacies, and the opening of temporary clinics. Through his own experiences and other insightful case studies, Gawande identifies the core principles of an effective checklist. A good checklist is precise, to the point, and easy to use. Instead of spelling out everything that needs to get done – an impossible and counterproductive objective – a checklist contains reminders of the most important steps. Ideally, it will consist of somewhere between 5 and 9 items, live on a single page, and pertain to a discrete topic. Checklists cannot simply be copied and pasted from one situation to another. An effective checklist codifies empirically derived knowledge, while accounting for the distinct circumstances of the immediate use case and unforeseen events. If the wisdom of using the checklist seems obvious, Gawande makes clear that it is far less prevalent than we might imagine. Historically, as a culture we have venerated the lone genius, the master of the domain, who designs, plans, and oversees all aspects of a great project from start to finish. But this is an increasingly impossible model to implement today. Few individuals, no matter how talented or experienced, can master all the intricacies involved in executing a life-saving surgery or constructing a skyscraper. Devising effective checklists requires recognition that the collective wisdom of specialized teams closest to the problem, communicating closely and responding dynamically to fast-changing events, is superior to dictates from a centralized authority. It requires iterative work by many people dispersed across multiple disciplines to identify the most significant task and communication checks across hundreds or thousands of individual actions. Gawande's book is a powerful wakeup call for the modern organization to systematically use the checklist in addressing complex problems.  Ahmed Humayun is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C.  Posted by Ahmed Humayun at 12:30 AM | Permalink Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus

Tennessee Her suspected kidnapper, West Wild Hogs, is in custody, the TBI said. Hogs, described as a truck driver who feels "very comfortable on highways" led authorities on a five-state manhunt after allegedly abducting Lewis from her Lakeland, Florida, home over the weekend. Police were looking for the suspect, who legally changed his name to West Wild Hogs, since Saturday morning. His family told investigators that he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder, said Donna Wood, spokeswoman for the Polk County (Florida) Sheriff's Office. Hogs was spotted driving a silver Nissan Versa in Nashville, Tennessee, around 2:30 a.m. Monday, said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. Hogs has no criminal history, according to authorities. Judd did tell reporters, however, that Hogs had previously lived with the Lewis family, when Rebecca was an infant, but he pulled a gun on the family "so the mama ran him off." Sheriff blames Tennessee It was far from the only bizarre piece of information provided at a news conference Monday, held before officers had located Hogs. Judd suggested they might have caught Hogs in Tennessee if state authorities had issued an Amber Alert earlier. Late Sunday night, a ranger encountered Hogs and the girl at Cove Lake State Park in Caryville, Tennessee, about 20 miles south of the Kentucky border, Judd said. Hogs told the ranger he was waiting on Rebecca's mother, the ranger told him the park was closed and Hogs left, the sheriff said. Only later did the ranger see a bulletin and realize that he'd spoken to Hogs, Judd said. Tennessee declined to issue an Amber Alert, Judd said, because there was no evidence the girl was in Tennessee. "Here's a news flash, Tennessee: He was there," the sheriff said. Feds: Use best judgment The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation did not have an immediate response to Judd's claims. TBI spokesman Josh DeVine told CNN the bureau there were "some potential developments in the case that (took) precedence." According to the Justice Department's federal guidelines, Amber Alerts should be issued when authorities have a "reasonable belief" a child younger than 18 has been abducted and is in danger of bodily harm or death. To issue activations without "significant information" indicating an abduction has occurred would be problematic, the Justice Department says, but "at the same time, each case must be appraised on its own merits and a judgment call made quickly. Law enforcement must understand that a 'best judgment' approach, based on the evidence, is appropriate and necessary." Cross-country trek The ordeal began last week, a few days before the kidnapping, Judd said. Hogs was at his home in Seale, Alabama, on October 3 when he told his wife he had a surprise for her. They got in the car and headed north to Interstate 75, which they drove all the way to Kentucky, Judd said. From there, they went to West Virginia, then Virginia, then Maryland, where they rested at a welcome center. They then took Interstate 95 South to Charlotte, North Carolina, and drove west to Tennessee, where they took Interstate 75 into South Georgia. It was Thursday by then, and his wife decided to abandon the trip, Judd said. She got out of the car and called relatives to take her back to Seale. On Friday, Hogs showed up at the Polk City, Florida, home of his grandmother, who he hasn't seen in a year. He spent the night, and when his grandmother was getting ready to go to work in Clermont, he asked about Rebecca's family, as well as for the addresses of Walmart stores in the area, Judd said. Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Rebecca's 16-year-old sister went to check on her and couldn't find her. Judd said he didn't know exactly how Hogs abducted Rebecca -- namely, whether he took her from the yard or home -- but he apparently kidnapped her before 9:30 a.m. and took her to a McDonald's where they spent about 30 minutes eating breakfast. Pink dress, leggings Hogs and Rebecca weren't seen again until 6:30 p.m. Saturday when they turned up at a BP gas station off Interstate 75 in Forsyth, Georgia, where Hogs bought drinks, the sheriff said. Rebecca was wearing a pink dress and leggings at the time, and Hogs wore blue jeans and a light T-shirt, he said. They were then seen in Caryville, Tennessee, late Sunday and in Nashville a few hours later. As of early Monday, five states -- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee -- had issued Amber Alerts, according to the sheriff's office. 35.149534 -90.048980 Related stories Transcripts Reveal Mother Watched As 10-Year-Old Daughter Was Raped, Killed Dramatic Video Shows People Restraining Driver Trying to Flee Fatal Dallas Hit & Run Ken Bone: Audience Member Becomes Real Winner of Second Debate Filed in: National/World News Topics: Crime Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Heeeeere’s Johnny!

The changes underway at some of the discount chain’s 1,368 stores nationwide come as the Earth City-based grocer is poised to change ownership and as its discount chain rivals Wal-Mart and Ruler Foods are adding stores and services in the St. Louis region, vying for market share. Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Supervalu, which owns Save-A-Lot, is exploring spinning off Save-A-Lot as a stand-alone company or a sale of the chain amid increased competition and declines in prices for eggs, pork, beef and other foods.

Several employers think so, resulting in a growing list of stores closed on Thanksgiving and the Friday after, which has become a dreaded nightmare for anyone who works retail.  >>See the gallery above for an ongoing list of shops that will be closed Thanksgiving. Those stores that will re-open for Black Friday are noted with anticipated hours. "In speaking to over 30 retailers, the general consensus seems to be so their 'employees and customers can enjoy Thanksgiving with their friends and families,' " BlackFriday.com reports. The site has taken to compiling a mega-list of all the shops that are closing Nov. 24, including notes for ones that that will re-open early for Black Friday. (Story continues below.) "Because of the massive profit potential, the biggest stores like Walmart, Target, Kohl's, Macy's and Sears will open their doors on Thanksgiving," the site states.  For those who can't bear the idea of missing out on sales, it's worth noting that most of the storefronts closed on Thanksgiving will still be taking orders online and offering e-discounts.  RELATED: Thanksgiving traditions people can't live without Adobe  reported that last year online shoppers would spend a record $4.45 billion on Black Friday and Thanksgiving Day. And that figure did not include Cyber Monday sales. Over all, it marked a 25 percent increase year-over-year for Thanksgiving Day and a 24-percent increase for Black Friday. "The five best selling electronic products on Black Friday were Samsung 4K TVs, Apple iPad Air 2, Microsoft Xbox One, Apple iPad Mini and Sony PS4," the report showed. "The five most popular toys were Lego Dimensions, Shopkin dolls, Lego Star Wars, Barbie Dream House and Lego Friends."

Other days, I would have to go hustle on my own,” he says. Charles Bertram cbertram@herald-leader.com Justin Adekoya, a preseason All-OVC offensive tackle at Eastern Kentucky University, moved with his family at age 9 from Chicago to Ringgold, Ga. “I didn’t like it because it was a big culture shock for me,” he says. Charles Bertram cbertram@herald-leader.com Justin Adekoya began his Eastern Kentucky football career as a defensive lineman but moved to offensive tackle as a redshirt sophomore in 2014. Charles Bertram cbertram@herald-leader.com At age 9, Justin Adekoya moved with his family from Chicago to Ringgold, Ga. “I went from Latinos, blacks, Asians — Chinese, Cambodians — everybody, very diverse to high percentage identifying as white only,” he says.

Charles Bertram cbertram@herald-leader.com 1 of 5 i By Mark Story mstory@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RICHMOND Justin Adekoya carries 308 pounds on the agile, 6-foot-5 frame of a former defensive end. The combination of size and athleticism helped make the Eastern Kentucky University football standout a preseason All-OVC offensive tackle. Yet it is a drive to better himself created during a childhood in which he did not always have food to eat that is most responsible for Adekoya’s unlikely story of success. Adekoya grew up, the youngest of three brothers, on the north side of Chicago. His parents were divorced. Money was scarce. “Some days, I went without eating,” Adekoya says. “Other days, I would have to go hustle on my own.” For a 7-year-old boy on the streets of Chicago, “hustling” came to mean showing up outside convenience stores and offering to pump gas for strangers. Adekoya did it hoping people would tip an enterprising child for his efforts. Those tips, $2, $3, could be the difference between eating or not. With whatever money he earned, Adekoya would go to McDonald’s and order a double cheeseburger for 99 cents. Yet he would never buy french fries. Says Adekoya: “I would think, ‘You know, a bag of (potato) chips are 50 cents at the corner store, so I’ll just buy me a double-cheeseburger (at McDonald’s) for a dollar, and that’s $1.50 instead of having to pay another dollar to get fries.’” In Chicago, Adekoya and his family lived on the 13th floor of a building some 15 minutes from Wrigley Field. At nights, he would sometimes stare out the window, entranced, by the glow from the ballpark lights. On the Fourth of July, he could see the Chicago Cubs’ fireworks. “It kind of looked like it outlined the globe,” he says. Other times, the sights and sounds of Adekoya’s childhood were less inspiring. “You would hear gun shots all the time,” he says. “There was a lot of gang violence. You’d see gangs just walk in flocks to different places. Each block was sectioned off by a different gang — Vice Lords, GDNs (Gangster Disciple Nation), Bloods, Crips, all that stuff.” Eventually, the street gangs penetrated Adekoya’s family. “My two older brothers, both of them were gang-affiliated,” Adekoya said. “That brought a lot of tension to our family. ... It brought a lot of unwanted activities, friends would come over that my mother really wasn’t fond of.” To remove her boys from a dangerous environment, Dwan Adekoya came up with a radical plan: She would move her family somewhere that, figuratively, was as far from Chicago as one could get. * * * Ringgold, Ga., is a village of some 3,679 residents located just south of Chattanooga, Tenn. Dwan Adekoya had no prior tie to the area. “She had a friend she knew that was from Georgia,” Justin Adekoya says. “The friend said, ‘Hey, move your kids here. There’s a better school system. … Small town. It’s a lot slower here, lot less trouble to get into.’” For a 9-year-old who had known nothing but Chicago, Ringgold may as well have been a different planet. Adekoya’s mom is white. His late father, Ayodele, was Nigerian. Being multiracial, Adekoya felt alienated in a town where some 89.16 percent (2010 U.S. Census) of the residents were white. “The names that I got called, racial slurs and stuff like that, in elementary school by kids (were) pretty bizarre for me,” Adekoya says. “That was something I hadn’t experienced in Chicago.” &nbsp; Internally, Adekoya already felt an anger over having been uprooted from the life he knew. Being insulted in this new town based on the way he looked lit his fuse. “When these kids would say something, we’d fight,” he says. “Usually, that would end up with someone getting hurt and, typically, it wasn’t me. I got in trouble a lot. I was in the (school) office a lot. People would try to help me, but I would always push them away.” Dwan Adekoya was working the overnight shift at Wal-Mart. “She wasn’t making much money, and with the money she did make, she had to pay the bills and do all these different things,” Justin Adekoya says. “Sometimes, there wasn’t food in the house.” When these kids would say something, we’d fight. Usually, that would end up with someone getting hurt and, typically, it wasn’t me. I got in trouble a lot. I was in the (school) office a lot. People would try to help me, but I would always push them away. Justin Adekoya At the Mt. Pisgah Baptist Church, there was lots of food. There would be pizza on Friday night after youth group meetings and often potluck dinners after other services. “I started going to church because, every time I went, I was being fed,” Adekoya says. “I was like, ‘This is great.’” They weren’t sure at the church what to make of the big kid who started showing up for youth group. “Justin was a little rambunctious,” says Miles Teems, a Ringgold businessman, who was then serving as interim youth minister at Mt. Pisgah. Nevertheless, Teems and his wife, Donna, took an interest in Adekoya. When he tried to push them away, they refused to be pushed. In the seventh grade, Adekoya went out for the middle school basketball team. He was thrilled when he made it, then crushed when he realized he had no way to get to practices. Teems found time in his days to drive him. “He was showing up to my games. His wife Donna was showing up to games, taking pictures, giving me (pictures),” Adekoya says. “As a kid, I didn’t have any pictures. They were taking me out to eat after (games). They just showed this unconditional love I had never seen before. That was a turning point in my life. I was like, ‘I want to be able to care for someone the way they do for me.’” * * * By the time Adekoya reached Heritage High School, the angry kid who had spent so much time in the principal’s office was no more. “I heard some of the stories (about Adekoya getting in trouble), but that was not the kid I taught,” says Mike Carter, a former Heritage teacher. “Justin’s a little loud, and because he’s big, people sometimes misjudge who he is. Once you got to know him, he was as respectful a kid as I ever taught. I’d tell other kids, ‘Justin Adekoya shows respect to his elders and respect to his peers, and that’s how people ought to treat people.’” As high school passed, Adekoya desperately wanted the chance at a better life he believed would only be possible with a college education. He knew his family lacked the money to send him to school. He did not feel right about asking Miles and Donna Teems nor Deena and Corey Lamb — another Ringgold couple who treat him like a son — for financial help. His hope was an athletics scholarship. Basketball had always been his sport. Yet as his junior year approached, he realized he was not getting the recruiting interest in hoops that suggested a scholarship was certain. Says Adekoya: “I was thinking to myself, ‘I’ve got to get a scholarship. I might as well go out for the football team.’” So Adekoya put on the pads, became a defensive end. Soon after, then-Heritage football coach Tim James asked former Georgia Bulldog Eric Coney for help coaching the defensive line — and its new end. “I just saw a big kid out there running around,” Coney says of Adekoya. “I tried to teach him technique and the discipline it takes to play football right.” &nbsp; John Revere, then an Eastern Kentucky football assistant, was on a recruiting swing through north Georgia when a coach from a rival high school asked if he’d heard about “the big kid over at Heritage.’” “I said, ‘No, but I can go take a look,’” Revere recalls. When he viewed game video, Revere liked how Adekoya moved. Yet, it was when Revere first visited Heritage and saw Adekoya that “I realized, in person, how big he was. I started to get pretty excited,” the ex-EKU assistant said. The college scholarship Adekoya coveted had become a reality. After starting out in Richmond on defense, Adekoya switched to offensive tackle in 2014. Last year, he became Eastern’s starting left tackle, a position he holds this season for the Colonels (2-3) and new head man Mark Elder. It’s not impossible Adekoya will get a shot in the NFL. Yet whenever football ends, the social work major envisions a life spent helping children who grow up like he did. “I love working with the youth, that population that is at risk,” Adekoya says. “That’s who I was. I had troubles in my childhood, and I understand what a lot of these guys have (gone) through. … I want to help people overcome obstacles in their life like I did.” The hunger Justin Adekoya knew as a child drives him still.

Many oil producers outside OPEC have expressed a willingness to cooperate on output caps, said Saudi Arabia’s Energy and Industry Minister Khalid Al-Falih at an energy congress in Istanbul, according to Bloomberg. He added that he was “optimistic” there’ll be a deal that could lift prices as high as US$60 by year-end. "Russia is ready to join the joint measures to cap production and is calling for other oil exporters to join," Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Istanbul, according to Reuters. Oil prices rallied, with Brent touching US$53.73 a barrel, the highest level in a year, in London. "Putin coming out to say Russia will be part of the initiative has added another layer of credence to the speculation there will be a coordinated cut," John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told Reuters. "At some point, the market will call them on it and say 'show us the cuts’,” Kilduff noted. “And at that point, the Saudis might be willing to underwrite the cuts on their own because they really want these high prices. To me, US$55 Brent is without doubt the next target," he said. Wall Street and energy stocks followed suit. In 2.07pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent. In 1.52pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent. The Dow advanced as gains in shares of Apple as well as those of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, recently up 2.1 percent, 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Procter & Gamble, recently down 1.2 percent and1 percent respectively. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a gain of 0.7 percent, bolstered by advances in energy stocks. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index increased 0.8 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index rose 1.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index added 1.3 percent. “Russia’s comments on supporting an OPEC deal are creating positive sentiment,” Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier in Geneva, told Bloomberg. A perception that Democratic US Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton won the second debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, securing her chances to win, helped underpin the mood on financial markets. Investors are gearing up for a fresh round of US quarterly earnings, with Alcoa set to report on Tuesday. Meanwhile, shares of Twitter sank further, down 13.3 percent as of 2.24pm in New York, amid reports that it has failed to attract any potential bidders.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Oil boosts stocks as Russia backs cap Margreet Dietz Tuesday October 11, 2016 Share Saudi Arabia oil minister Khalid Al-Falih Play NBR radio on Equities on both sides of the Atlantic rose with the price of oil after Russia signalled it will join an agreement to curb output. Many oil producers outside OPEC expressed a willingness to co-operate on output caps, Saudi Arabia's Energy and Industry Minister Khalid Al-Falih told an energy congress in Istanbul. He added that he was "optimistic" there would be a deal that could lift prices to as high as $US60 by year-end. "Russia is ready to join the joint measures to cap production and is calling for other oil exporters to join," Russian President Vladimir Putin says, according to Reuters. Oil prices rallied, with Brent touching $US53.73 a barrel, the highest level in a year, in London. "Mr Putin coming out to say Russia will be part of the initiative has added another layer of credence to the speculation there will be a co-ordinated cut," John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told Reuters. "At some point, the market will call them on it and say 'show us the cuts'. And at that point, the Saudis might be willing to underwrite the cuts on their own because they really want these high prices. To me, $US55 Brent is without doubt the next target." Dow rises 88 points Wall Street and energy stocks followed suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 88.55 points, or 0.5%, to 18329.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.7% to 5328.67 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 0.5% to 2163.66. The Dow advanced as Apple, Exxon Mobil and Chevron shares gained, up 2.1%, 2.0% and 1.7% respectively, outweighed slides in Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble shares, down 1.2% and 1% respectively. A perception that Democratic US Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the second debate against Republican candidate Donald Trump, securing her chances of a win, helped underpin the mood on financial markets. Investors are gearing up for a fresh round of US quarterly earnings, with Alcoa set to report on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Twitter shares sank 14% amid reports that it has failed to attract any potential bidders. In corporate activity, shares of Mylan rose 8.2% after the pharmaceuticals firm agreed to pay $US465 million to settle allegations that it overcharged the government for its EpiPen products. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished with a gain of 0.7%, bolstered by advances in energy stocks. The UK's FTSE 100 Index increased 0.8%, France's CAC 40 Index rose 1.1%, while Germany's DAX Index added 1.3%. "Russia's comments on supporting an OPEC deal are creating positive sentiment," Geneva-based Lombard Odier chief economist Samy Chaar told Bloomberg.

Tennessee (Left: Wild West Hogs | Right: Rebecca Lewis) Her suspected kidnapper, West Wild Hogs, is in custody, the TBI said. Hogs, described as a truck driver who feels "very comfortable on highways" led authorities on a five-state manhunt after allegedly abducting 4-year-old Rebecca Lewis from her Lakeland, Florida, home over the weekend. Police were looking for the suspect, who legally changed his name to West Wild Hogs, since Saturday morning. His family told investigators that he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder, said Donna Wood, spokeswoman for the Polk County (Florida) Sheriff's Office. Hogs was spotted driving a silver Nissan Versa in Nashville, Tennessee, around 2:30 a.m. Monday, said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. Hogs has no criminal history, according to authorities. Judd did tell reporters, however, that Hogs had previously lived with the Lewis family, when Rebecca was an infant, but he pulled a gun on the family "so the mama ran him off." Sheriff blames Tennessee It was far from the only bizarre piece of information provided at a news conference Monday, before officers took Hogs into custody. Judd suggested they might have caught Hogs in Tennessee if state authorities had issued an Amber Alert earlier. Late Sunday night, a ranger encountered Hogs and the girl at Cove Lake State Park in Caryville, Tennessee, about 20 miles south of the Kentucky border, Judd said. Hogs told the ranger he was waiting on Rebecca's mother, the ranger told him the park was closed and Hogs left, the sheriff said. Only later did the ranger see a bulletin and realize that he'd spoken to Hogs, Judd said. Tennessee declined to issue an Amber Alert, Judd said, because there was no evidence the girl was in Tennessee. "Here's a news flash, Tennessee: He was there," the sheriff said. Feds: Use best judgment The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation did not have an immediate response to Judd's claims. TBI spokesman Josh DeVine told CNN the bureau there were "some potential developments in the case that (took) precedence." According to the Justice Department's federal guidelines, Amber Alerts should be issued when authorities have a "reasonable belief" a child younger than 18 has been abducted and is in danger of bodily harm or death. To issue activations without "significant information" indicating an abduction has occurred would be problematic, the Justice Department says, but "at the same time, each case must be appraised on its own merits and a judgment call made quickly. Law enforcement must understand that a 'best judgment' approach, based on the evidence, is appropriate and necessary." Cross-country trek The ordeal began last week, a few days before the kidnapping, Judd said. Hogs was at his home in Seale, Alabama, on October 3 when he told his wife he had a surprise for her. They got in the car and headed north to Interstate 75, which they drove all the way to Kentucky, Judd said. From there, they went to West Virginia, then Virginia, then Maryland, where they rested at a welcome center. They then took Interstate 95 South to Charlotte, North Carolina, and drove west to Tennessee, where they took Interstate 75 into South Georgia. It was Thursday by then, and his wife decided to abandon the trip, Judd said. She got out of the car and called relatives to take her back to Seale. On Friday, Hogs showed up at the Polk City, Florida, home of his grandmother, who he hasn't seen in a year. He spent the night, and when his grandmother was getting ready to go to work in Clermont, he asked about Rebecca's family, as well as for the addresses of Walmart stores in the area, Judd said. Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Rebecca's 16-year-old sister went to check on her and couldn't find her. Judd said he didn't know exactly how Hogs abducted Rebecca -- namely, whether he took her from the yard or home -- but he apparently kidnapped her before 9:30 a.m. and took her to a McDonald's where they spent about 30 minutes eating breakfast. Pink dress, leggings Hogs and Rebecca weren't seen again until 6:30 p.m. Saturday when they turned up at a BP gas station off Interstate 75 in Forsyth, Georgia, where Hogs bought drinks, the sheriff said. Rebecca was wearing a pink dress and leggings at the time, and Hogs wore blue jeans and a light T-shirt, he said. They were then seen in Caryville, Tennessee, late Sunday and in Nashville a few hours later. As of early Monday, five states -- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee -- had issued Amber Alerts, according to the sheriff's office. 28.039465 -81.949804 Filed in: News Topics: Amber Alert, florida, Rebecca Lewis Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Team 3 Professionals Visit them today!

(AP) — Two people suspected of killing a 95-year-old man and severely injuring his wife during a Massachusetts home invasion have been captured in Virginia. The Northwestern district attorney's office says 23-year-old Joshua Hart and 27-year-old Brittany Smith are being held without bail pending arraignment Tuesday in Virginia on fugitive-from-justice charges. The Athol (ATH'-uhl), Massachusetts, residents are suspects in a home invasion last week in the adjacent town of Orange that left Thomas Harty dead and his 77-year-old wife, Joanna Fisher, in the hospital. The couple's car was also stolen. The suspects were caught Saturday in a rental truck outside a Wal-Mart in Rockbridge County, Virginia. They face murder, attempted murder and other charges in Massachusetts. Authorities have not disclosed a motive. It wasn't immediately known if they have attorneys.

(contributed photo) By Emily Gillespie, Columbian Breaking News Reporter Published: October 10, 2016, 10:50 AM A   A Two piglets were taken from a Brush Prairie farm over the weekend. One of which was returned safely, but the other was found dead, according to the farm’s owners. Bill Zimmerman said that he arrived at his farm, Bi-Zi Farms at 9504 N.E. 119th St., Sunday morning and found a bin of apples had been pushed over in the yard, a bench thrown into an animal pen and straw bales thrown around. Zimmerman said that when the farm, which runs a pumpkin patch and corn maze, closed at 10 p.m. Saturday, nothing was amiss. He didn’t think the damage to the property was too awful until an employee found a pair of 2-week-old pigs missing. A third piglet and the mother were alone in the pen. The hog and the three piglets, all American Guinea hog, had been borrowed from the NW Love All Animal Rescue for a petting zoo, which also helps out the nonprofit by advertising the animals as up for adoption. Zimmerman and his family looked everywhere for the little black pigs, but couldn’t find them. He said he didn’t call police because he didn’t think it would result in anything, but his daughter did post about the missing baby animals on Facebook. Within about two hours, a family in Battle Ground responded that they had found one of the piglets. “They had found the baby pig under their car and took it into their house to get it warm,” Zimmerman said. “It was very heartwarming. When they brought the first pig back and got within about 3 feet of fence, the mother knew. … She lay down right away to nurse.” A couple of hours later, another Battle Ground resident reached out to the farm owners, but this time with bad news. The second baby pig was found dead. Zimmerman said he thinks that whoever stole the pigs likely dropped them off near the Battle Ground Wal-Mart, because the pigs were found in that vicinity. Zimmerman said he believes the dead piglet likely died of hypothermia. “At that age, the pigs rely on the mom for warmth,” Zimmerman said. “Out in the open, they have nothing. They were exposed to the elements.” Tracy Nichols, founder and president of NW Love All Animal Rescue, said she regularly loans out animals to both give back to the community and help with adoptions. She said just three days prior to hearing the bad news, the group had named the male piglets Larry, Curly and Moe. Moe, she said, is the one who died. “I’m just disappointed,” Nichols said. “It’s very upsetting when there are people who can do something like that and can ruin it for everyone.” She said she doesn’t blame Zimmerman. She knows that he does a good job keeping the animals safe and said that she has had pigs stolen from her property in the past, too. Zimmerman said he feels bad about what happened. “We realize a lot of these animals will be raised for meat, but I don’t like to see them mistreated,” Zimmerman said. “It’s heartbreaking for me to hear this little pig was treated this way. This little pig was completely defenseless.”   Emily Gillespie Columbian Breaking News Reporter  360-735-4522  @col_cops  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Nuclear weapons, sexual assault, America's Sweetheart Anderson Cooper being attacked on national television. But it ended with a bright spot--a man named Ken Bone asking the second to last question, about energy policy, and then snapping some pics with his disposable camera. Bone is a friendly-seeming man, with a mustache and a signature red sweater. He's taken the internet, weary after a couple days of "locker room talk," by storm. And he's sure to be a big hit come Halloween. Want to get a head start on your Regular or Sexy Ken Bone costume? Here's how to get his look. 1. Red sweater GQ believes they have found the perfect Ken Bone sweater: the IZOD's quarter zip solid cable knit sweater. Of course, red is already sold out on Amazon. There's a similar red, quarter zip sweater available at JC Penney, and a spendier Ralph Lauren number at Macy's. Another idea: get to Goodwill. Today. If you want to be Sexy Ken Bone for Halloween, either find yourself a red cable knit vest, a crocheted red bikini top, or cut strategic holes in your quarter zip sweater. 2. White button up shirt White button up shirts are sold literally wherever shirts are sold. But if you're going for the Sexy look, purchase instead a dicky, like this one at Kmart. 3. White tie One key Ken Bone detail is his white-on-white tie and shirt combination. And guess what--you're in luck! Party City sells a white tie for $4.99. 4. Light khakis L.L. Bean has all your khaki needs covered. But if you're going for Sexy Ken Bone, Macy's has khaki leggings. 5. Black, rectangular glasses frames Zenni optical has this pair of black, rectangular frames for $13.95. You might also be able to find a workable pair of reading glasses at your local Fred Meyer/Target/Walmart/Safeway. 6. Mustache Party City has an assortment of fake mustaches, the first one of which looks very Ken Bone-esque. Walmart also has a good collection. 7. Disposable camera It is the details that will make this costume and you are going to need a disposable camera. Amazon has a variety of these available but why not get a two-pack and make it a couple's costume? Happy Halloween, America. Only 28 days until the election. Hang in there. -- Lizzy Acker 503-221-8052 lacker@oregonian.com, @lizzzyacker Most Read Active Discussions on Politics Vantage Point Perspective and personality from Oregonian/OregonLive columnists, delivered every Sunday.

Soon after Orange Police Department and Massachusetts State Police began investigating the apparent home invasion that left Thomas Harty dead and his wife, Joanna Fisher, injured, police issued a Be On The Look Out alert for their 2003 Toyota Corolla station wagon stolen during the armed home invasion. Massachusetts State Police quickly learned of two suspects believed connected to the incident: 27-year-old Brittany Smith and 23-year-old Joshua Hart, both of Athol, who were believed to have fled the state to Virginia. Late Friday evening, law enforcement in Virginia learned the pair may be hiding out in Rockbridge County. Members of the Rockbridge County sheriff's department began searching the area for Hart and Smith, the department said in a statement. They were found Saturday morning living in a U-Haul truck parked in a Rockbridge County Wal-Mart parking lot. The stolen motor vehicle was also found in Virginia this weekend. Hart and Smith face murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, larceny and conspiracy charges connected to the armed home invasion in Orange. They're also accused by Virginia police of receiving stolen credit cards. Both are scheduled to have fugitive from justice arraignments Tuesday in Virginia. If they waive rendition, Hart and Smith could return to Massachusetts as early as Thursday.

West Wild Hogs is seen in an image provided by the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. Her suspected kidnapper, West Wild Hogs, is in custody, the TBI said. Hogs was captured after an employee of Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, called security to say Hogs was at the hospital, Memphis Police Department spokeswoman Lt. Karen Rudolph told reporters. She did not know why Hogs visited the medical center, she said. Police pulled over Hogs in the hospital’s parking lot, she said. Hogs was arrested without incident. “It doesn’t seem that she has any apparent injuries,” but paramedics are examining her to be sure, Rudolph said. Earlier, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd held a news conference in Florida in which he warned that Hogs was a truck driver by trade and feels “very comfortable on highways. He was seen in Nashville around 2:30 a.m. Monday, the sheriff said. His family has told investigators that he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder, said Donna Wood, spokeswoman for the Polk County (Florida) Sheriff’s Office. Though Judd told reporters that Hogs has no criminal history and does not seem violent, he also said Hogs had previously lived with the Lewis family, when Rebecca was an infant, but he pulled a gun on the family “so the mama ran him off.” Did Tennessee drop ball? It was far from the only bizarre piece of information provided at the Monday news conference. Judd suggested Hogs might already be in custody if Tennessee authorities had issued an Amber Alert earlier. Late Sunday night, a ranger encountered Hogs and the girl at Cove Lake State Park in Caryville, Tennessee, about 20 miles south of the Kentucky border, Judd said. Hogs told the ranger he was waiting on Rebecca’s mother, the ranger told him the park was closed and Hogs left, the sheriff said. Only later did the ranger see a bulletin and realize that he’d spoken to Hogs, Judd said. Tennessee declined to issue an Amber Alert, Judd said, because there was no evidence the girl was in Tennessee. “Here’s a news flash, Tennessee: He was there,” the sheriff said. TBI spokesman Josh DeVine told CNN on Monday morning that the bureau would respond, but there were “some potential developments in the case that’ve taken precedence for the time being.” According to the Justice Department’s federal guidelines, Amber Alerts should be issued when authorities have a “reasonable belief” a child younger than 18 has been abducted and is in danger of bodily harm or death. To issue activations without “significant information” indicating an abduction has occurred would be problematic, the Justice Department says, but “at the same time, each case must be appraised on its own merits and a judgment call made quickly. Law enforcement must understand that a ‘best judgment’ approach, based on the evidence, is appropriate and necessary.” Cross-country trek The ordeal began last week, a few days before the kidnapping, Judd said. Hogs was at his home in Seale, Alabama, on October 3 when he told his wife he had a surprise for her. They got in the car and headed north to Interstate 75, which they drove all the way to Kentucky, Judd said. From there, they went to West Virginia, then Virginia, then Maryland, where they rested at a welcome center. They then took Interstate 95 South to Charlotte, North Carolina, and drove west to Tennessee, where they took Interstate 75 into south Georgia. It was Thursday by then, and his wife decided to abandon the trip, Judd said. She got out of the car and called relatives to take her back to Seale. On Friday, Hogs showed up at the Polk City, Florida, home of his grandmother, whom he hasn’t seen in a year. He spent the night, and when his grandmother was getting ready to go to work in Clermont, he asked about Rebecca’s family, as well as for the addresses of Walmart stores in the area, Judd said. Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Rebecca’s 16-year-old sister went to check on her and couldn’t find her. Judd said he didn’t know exactly how Hogs abducted Rebecca — namely, whether he took her from the yard or home — but he apparently kidnapped her before 9:30 a.m. and took her to a McDonald’s where they spent about 30 minutes eating breakfast. Hogs and Rebecca weren’t seen again until 6:30 p.m. Saturday when they turned up at a BP gas station off Interstate 75 in Forsyth, Georgia, where Hogs bought drinks, the sheriff said. They were then seen in Caryville, Tennessee, late Sunday and in Nashville a few hours later. A the time of Hogs’ arrest, five states — Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee — had issued Amber Alerts, according to the sheriff’s office. 35.149534 -90.048980 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Florida, Memphis, Rebecca Lewis, tennessee, West Wild Hogs Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Facebook Popular Ku Klux Klan to Hold Donald Trump Victory Parade in North Carolina Last-Ditch Effort Underway to Elect Hillary Clinton, Block Donald Trump Presidency California Election Results: the State’s 17 Propositions California Election Results: Prop 64 Passes; Ballot Initiative Legalizes Recreational Use of Marijuana Latest News Hundreds Attend Anti-Trump Protest in Former Republican Stronghold Orange County In First Interview Since Winning Election, Donald Trump Addresses Divided Nation Family, Friends Mark Anniversary of California Student’s Death in Paris Terror Attacks Trump Says He’ll Seek to Deport up to 3 Million Undocumented Immigrants; Keeps Plan for Border Wall Nation/World Officers Go ‘Above and Beyond,’ Take Care of Family Saved From Fatal Crash in Alabama, Relatives Say Nation/World Video Shows Couple Passed Out on Sidewalk After They Allegedly ‘Snorted Some Heroin’ in Memphis Walgreens Nation/World Memphis Woman Says She Caught Burglars Having Sex on Her Couch Nation/World 3 Girls Injured After Falling From Ferris Wheel When Basket Overturns at Tennessee Fair Nation/World 6-Year-Old Girl Dies in North Carolina After Being Stabbed in Heart; Dad Charged With Murder Nation/World Nationwide Warrant Issued for Illinois Man Accused of Kidnapping 13-Year-Old Girl, Her Newborn Son Nation/World Tennessee Man Suspected of Killing Daughter, 11, After She Got Off Bus on First Day of School Nation/World Elk Spotted in South Carolina for First Time Since the 1700s Nation/World Florida Mother Arrested After 6-Year-Old Boy Allegedly Beats Crying Newborn to Death While Left Alone in Car Nation/World Woman Dies After Being Run Over by Her Own Vehicle in Parking Lot of Memphis Wal-Mart Local News Couple Sought in Death of Mother, Kidnapping of Children Arrested in Colorado Local News Man Shot After Trying to Escape LAPD Custody Charged in Kidnapping, Rape of Teen Girl: DA’s Office Nation/World Woman, 73, Fatally Shot by Officer During Police-Sponsored Civilian Gun Safety Academy in Florida Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2016, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Police have been looking for the man, who legally changed his name to West Wild Hogs, since Saturday morning. His family has told investigators that he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder, said Donna Wood, spokeswoman for the Polk County (Florida) Sheriff’s Office. Hogs was last seen in Nashville, Tennessee, around 2:30 a.m. Monday, said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. He’s driving a silver Nissan Versa with an Alabama handicapped tag, 4JL26. “Don’t you hurt that baby. You keep that baby safe and take her to a police department,” Judd said. “We’ll worry about catching you later, but we want that child back right now.” Hogs has no criminal history and does not seem violent. It would be “totally appropriate to talk to him” in an effort to stall him after calling 911, the sheriff said. That seemed to contradict a piece of background Judd provided to reporters: that Hogs had previously lived with the Lewis family, when Rebecca was an infant, but he pulled a gun on the family “so the mama ran him off.” Sheriff blames Tennessee It was far from the only bizarre piece of information provided at the Monday news conference. Judd suggested Hogs might already be in custody if Tennessee authorities had issued an Amber Alert earlier. Late Sunday night, a ranger encountered Hogs and the girl at Cove Lake State Park in Caryville, Tennessee, about 20 miles south of the Kentucky border, Judd said. Hogs told the ranger he was waiting on Rebecca’s mother, the ranger told him the park was closed and Hogs left, the sheriff said. Only later did the ranger see a bulletin and realize that he’d spoken to Hogs, Judd said. Tennessee declined to issue an Amber Alert, Judd said, because there was no evidence the girl was in Tennessee. “Here’s a news flash, Tennessee: He was there,” the sheriff said. Feds: Use best judgment The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation did not have an immediate response to Judd’s claims. TBI spokesman Josh DeVine told CNN the bureau would respond, but there were “some potential developments in the case that’ve taken precedence for the time being.” According to the Justice Department’s federal guidelines, Amber Alerts should be issued when authorities have a “reasonable belief” a child younger than 18 has been abducted and is in danger of bodily harm or death. To issue activations without “significant information” indicating an abduction has occurred would be problematic, the Justice Department says, but “at the same time, each case must be appraised on its own merits and a judgment call made quickly. Law enforcement must understand that a ‘best judgment’ approach, based on the evidence, is appropriate and necessary.” Cross-country trek The ordeal began last week, a few days before the kidnapping, Judd said. Hogs was at his home in Seale, Alabama, on October 3 when he told his wife he had a surprise for her. They got in the car and headed north to Interstate 75, which they drove all the way to Kentucky, Judd said. From there, they went to West Virginia, then Virginia, then Maryland, where they rested at a welcome center. They then took Interstate 95 South to Charlotte, North Carolina, and drove west to Tennessee, where they took Interstate 75 into South Georgia. It was Thursday by then, and his wife decided to abandon the trip, Judd said. She got out of the car and called relatives to take her back to Seale. On Friday, Hogs showed up at the Polk City, Florida, home of his grandmother, who he hasn’t seen in a year. He spent the night, and when his grandmother was getting ready to go to work in Clermont, he asked about Rebecca’s family, as well as for the addresses of Walmart stores in the area, Judd said. Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Rebecca’s 16-year-old sister went to check on her and couldn’t find her. Judd said he didn’t know exactly how Hogs abducted Rebecca — namely, whether he took her from the yard or home — but he apparently kidnapped her before 9:30 a.m. and took her to a McDonald’s where they spent about 30 minutes eating breakfast. Pink dress, leggings Hogs and Rebecca weren’t seen again until 6:30 p.m. Saturday when they turned up at a BP gas station off Interstate 75 in Forsyth, Georgia, where Hogs bought drinks, the sheriff said. Rebecca was wearing a pink dress and leggings at the time, and Hogs wore blue jeans and a light T-shirt, he said. They were then seen in Caryville, Tennessee, late Sunday and in Nashville a few hours later. As of early Monday, five states — Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee — had issued Amber Alerts, according to the sheriff’s office. Judd repeatedly spoke directly to Hogs in Monday’s news conference, urging him to drop Rebecca off with police, a church or any responsible adult. The park ranger in Tennessee did not get the sense that Hogs was endangering the girl, he said. “He only offered to lie and keep possession of that baby,” he said. “We don’t know what his proclivities are or what they might turn into.” Student's unexpected gift to teacher is a real throwback US death toll from Matthew climbs to 20; 1,500 stranded in NC city Related Posts Tiger found wandering streets of suburban Houston Orlando shooting: Mateen’s effort to buy armor was reported, gun store says South African judge throws out charges in honeymoon murder trial #Blizzardof2015: Lots of snow, warnings — and jokes Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Erin Peters said she was stopped Friday at an Idaho Walmart and questioned for 45 minutes after being mistaken for 18-year-old Whitley Evenson, of Independence, Missouri, who is charged with killing her six-week-old baby in September 2015, The Coeur d'Alene Press newspaper reported (http://bit.ly/2dFGlGr ). "I felt humiliated in front of Walmart, crying," Peters said. Peters said members of the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force believed she was the Missouri fugitive because her hair is very short. She says she shaved her hair because of cancer treatments. She said the task force members went through her purse, her phone and her Facebook account. She said they "ransacked everything." "The way they went about this was so wrong," Peters said. FBI spokesman Richard Collodi said he regrets that Peters was inconvenienced but the task force had to be sure. He said suspects often come up with creative excuses to avoid arrest. "I'm confident she was treated professionally," Collodi said. The task force had information Evenson would be at that Walmart, Collodi said, Evenson was arrested later on Friday at the store. She was booked into Kootenai County jail until she can be extradited back to Jackson County, Missouri, where she is charged with second-degree murder. Prosecutors accused Evenson of suffocating the infant. She was out on bond when she failed to appear for a court hearing in July. ___ Information from: Coeur d'Alene Press, http://www.cdapress.com Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
