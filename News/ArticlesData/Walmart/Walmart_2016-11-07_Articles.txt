They are among the most highly-anticipated items of the year for bargain hunters to score. Whether consumers want to purchase holiday gifts or get a great buy for home entertainment, Black Friday deals this year on televisions are worth checking out. Blasting News reports that Target and Walmart are offering some deep discounts on HDTVs and Smart TVs for Black Friday 2016. In fact, the two stores are boasting big savings with deals that can be taken advantage of now. For instance, Walmart already has its pre-Black Friday sales or “early bird” specials underway with the following TVs: 50-inch HDTV from Proscan for just $279.99; 40-inch HDTV from Proscan offered at $189; 43-inch Vizio D-series HDTV priced at $228.00; and a 32-inch Roku HDTV is available for only $125 for the entire month of November and December.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Wal-Mart sued over sale of fake 'Egyptian cotton' linen By Reuters Published: 16:45 EST, 8 November 2016 | Updated: 16:45 EST, 8 November 2016 e-mail By Jonathan Stempel Nov 8 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc was sued on Tuesday on behalf of consumers who said the world's largest retailer sold products falsely labeled "100 % Egyptian Cotton" from an Indian textile company for many years after it first became suspicious of their origin. According to the complaint, Wal-Mart questioned the fiber content of Welspun India Ltd's products as early as 2008, but waited until two months ago to halt sales of its mislabeled Egyptian cotton bed linens, following a similar halt by Target Corp. The plaintiff, Dorothy Monahan of Michigan, said she overpaid at a Wal-Mart for Better Homes and Gardens bed linens made by Welspun that she thought were made of Egyptian cotton, and therefore higher quality than cheaper bed linens. She accused Wal-Mart of violating U.S. laws governing textile fiber labeling and advertising, and is seeking damages for everyone who has bought bed linens at Wal-Mart made by Welspun and labeled "100% Egyptian Cotton." "We plan to vigorously defend the company," a Wal-Mart spokesman said. He said the retailer removed such products after conducting a comprehensive review nearly two months ago and since then has offered customers a full refund. A lawyer for Monahan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Monahan is represented by the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, whose specialties include product liability. Her complaint was filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Egyptian cotton typically commands premiums from shoppers because its long cotton fibers contribute to a finer, lighter, softer and more durable fabric. Although the United States and Australia produce more high-end cotton, the Egyptian product has retained its prestige because of the northeast African country's long history of growing it. Wal-Mart has also sold Welspun bed linen under the "Canopy" name, and in September called "unacceptable" the Indian company's inability to assure that its products were 100 percent Egyptian cotton. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer nonetheless decided to work with Welspun to improve quality control and labeling, rather than cut ties. Other U.S. retailers, including Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and J.C. Penney Co, also began reviewing their ties to Welspun after Target's announcement. The case is Monahan v Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-08662.

Walmart Sued For Selling Mislabeled Welspun Egyptian Cotton Sheets Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Sued For Selling Mislabeled Welspun Egyptian Cotton Sheets Image courtesy of Patrick November 8, 2016 4:26 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler a welspun walmart lawsuit welspun walmart lawsuit retail egyptian cotton marketing labels facing a lawsuit claims Two months after textile manufacturer Welspun was sued for allegedly fraudulently labeling its bedding as premium Egyptian cotton, Walmart — which sold and then pulled the products — is facing a lawsuit of its own. Reuters reports that a Michigan woman filed the lawsuit — on behalf of consumers who purchased the products from the big box store — claiming that Walmart continued to sell the falsely labeled Welspun-manufactured linens for several years after questions began to surface about the sheets’ origins. According to the lawsuit, Walmart first raised questions about Welspun’s “100% Egyptian Cotton” claims back in 2008, but continued to sell the products until two months ago. At that time, the company removed the products — sold under the company’s house brands Better Homes & Gardens and Canopy — from its shelves and began to offer customers refunds. “Our customers trust us to provide products that are what they say they are on the label,” a Walmart spokeswoman said at the time. “Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 percent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable. While the sheets are excellent quality, we are offering our customers a full refund.” The Michigan woman claims that she overpaid for Better Homes and Gardens bed linens made by Welspun, as she was led to believe they were made of Egyptian cotton and were of higher quality than other, lower-priced sheets. Shoppers pay premium prices for long-fiber cotton types like Pima or Egyptian. The lawsuit accuses Walmart of violating federal laws related to fiber labeling and advertising. The suit seeks damages for anyone who has bought Welspun-made linens labeled as 100% Egyptian cotton.

    Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            Walmart Offers New Vision For The Company's Role In Society by Walmart Posted: Tuesday, November 8, 2016 at 3:49PM EST PHILADELPHIA-- Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon outlined a roadmap that will guide the company’s role in society on critical issues over the next several years, pointing to a “new era of trust and transparency.” The roadmap adds fresh detail to Walmart’s sustainability agenda and contains new commitments that reflect a wider recognition of the company’s impact on communities and the planet. Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S.; expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea; and implementing a new plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company’s energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. In his remarks, McMillon will also discuss company programs that will train hundreds of thousands of U.S. associates by the end of next year, providing them with skills needed to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay, along with a new pledge to take a leadership role in promoting ethical recruitment and treatment of workers in the global retail supply chain. Taken together, the initiatives are designed to make good on the company’s desire to become the most trusted retailer, not just by delivering affordable goods and a time-saving shopping experience, but with trust-building transparency and actions. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of - and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” The roadmap builds upon the three environmental sustainability goals Walmart set in 2005: to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100 percent renewable energy, and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society. The commitments shared today include: Power half of the company’s energy from renewable sources under a plan designed to achieve science-based emissions targets: Walmart is one of the largest private-sector investors in renewable energy, including solar and wind power. In 2015, 25 percent of Walmart’s operations were powered by renewable energy, a significant step towards the 2005 goal. Going forward, the company will source half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, as part of a plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. Under the recently approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with expanded use of renewable energy, to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. Achieve zero waste to landfill in key markets by 2025: Progress so far has been significant on the original goal. In 2015, 75 percent of Walmart’s global waste was diverted from landfills, helping to reduce costs to the business, customers and society. Under the roadmap, the company will achieve zero waste to landfill from our own operations in key markets, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada by 2025. The commitment is designed to meet or exceed EPA zero waste guidelines. Walmart will also continue working to reduce landfill waste in all markets, moving as fast as infrastructure and best practices allow. Sell more sustainably produced products while maintaining the low prices customers expect: Packaging: Walmart pledges to work with suppliers to reduce product and packaging waste and preserve natural resources. Our goal by 2025 is for Walmart’s private brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. Affordable, safe and healthier: Walmart will double the sales of locally grown produce in the U.S. by 2025 and work with suppliers and its own private brand products to remove certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors in products where customers don’t expect to find them, as well as reduce sodium, added sugars and saturated fat where possible. Additionally, Walmart will expand and enhance sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, grapes, coffee, and tea. Natural resources: Walmart is expanding sourcing of commodities produced with zero net deforestation. In partnership with governments, NGOs and industry groups, Walmart has previously been working to source private-brand palm oil and beef from Brazil’s Amazon with zero net deforestation. Under the roadmap, Walmart will expand its work into additional critical commodities, including all Brazilian soy and private-brand pulp and paper. McMillon will also discuss the company’s $2.7 billion investment over the past two years in education, wages and training for associates in the U.S. and called for a broader industry push to ensure retailers are seen as employers of choice. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he said. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates.” Walmart will work to achieve the following: Support the human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain: Walmart is joining the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, a collaboration of businesses and NGO partners working to ensure ethical recruitment and treatment of workers globally. This is on top of Walmart’s work underway in four areas that present risk to the dignity and safety of workers: seafood; apparel; produce; and electronics. Be the place to go for an individual’s first job: Walmart will further its efforts to afford a good experience for the thousands of people who come to the retailer for their first job. Associates will be provided with workplace mobility - a good start, new skills and a clear path to grow and succeed - whether or not they remain with the company. To further these efforts, Walmart has recently signed on to the White House First Jobs Compact, a nationwide effort to help connect out-of-school, out-of-work youth to their first jobs. Provide a clear path for career advancement: By 2025, Walmart U.S. will put millions of associates through focused training programs to equip them with skills to improve career growth, from entry level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay. The retailer’s Pathways program provides training in core skills for entry-level associates and rewards them with a pay increase upon completion. The Academy training program - for supervisory associates - is expected to graduate 250,000 people alone by the end of 2017. As part of this commitment, Walmart strives to be a destination employer for young people and returning service members. Predictability, stability and pay: Walmart is committed to improving predictability in the lives of its associates by providing work schedules more than two weeks in advance in the U.S.; as well as implementing a strong leave policy that empowers associates to decide how to use their paid time off based on individual needs. Walmart also believes in equal pay for equal work. Associates with the same qualifications, performing the same jobs and making the same effort to achieve the same results, should receive the same pay. Improve the lives of people in communities: Walmart will source more products locally around the world, including $250 billion in products supporting American jobs by 2023 and $20 billion in products from women-owned businesses in the U.S. by the end of this year. The retailer also committed to donating 4 billion meals to fight hunger by 2020 and, over five years, to contributing $25 million towards disaster relief and resiliency around the world.

Pet Rescue of St. Augustine, Florida, which was impacted by Hurricane Matthew. S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue is comprised of three adoption centers, two in St. Augustine, and one in Hollister, Florida, located roughly 60 miles southwest St. Augustine.  As Hurricane Matthew approached the Florida coast, S.A.F.E. was forced to evacuate more than 150 dogs and cats to their Hollister location, which was already housing approximately 75 animals.  Despite a lack of electricity and air conditioning and a tense and crowded environment, the organization was able to keep all of their animals safe and dry during the storm, however, the financial impact will be felt for some time. "During times of emergency, keeping our animals safe is always our top priority, however this commitment doesn't come without cost," said Robin Kantner Nordan, Founder, S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue.  "The cost of transport, emergency and veterinary fees and 24-hour staffing during the storm were significant.  This generous donation from Ainsworth Pet Nutrition will ease the financial burden of feeding the 195 dogs in our care for quite some time.  We are very grateful." "At Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, our commitment to helping animals in need goes beyond doing what's right, it is engrained in who we are as an organization," said Steve Joyce, Vice President of Marketing for Ainsworth Pet Nutrition.  "When we heard about S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue and what they had been through during Hurricane Matthew, we knew we needed to do something to help.  We are so happy that this donation will be beneficial to the shelter and the animals in their care." Pure Balance super-premium food for dogs and cats is available exclusively at Walmart.  Each recipe is designed without any corn, wheat or soy and is prepared with carefully selected ingredients like real chicken, carrots, peas, and flaxseed.  Made with natural ingredients with added vitamins and minerals, Pure Balance makes premium pet nutrition available to Walmart shoppers without a special trip to the pet store. The donation will be delivered to the S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue within the next week.  ABOUT AINSWORTH PET NUTRITION Founded in 1933, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition is a fifth generation, primarily family-owned and operated company headquartered in Western Pennsylvania and focused entirely on pets.  With a goal of changing the way consumers shop for Super Premium pet food, Ainsworth's mantra is "Pet Store Quality.  Supermarket Easy."

Click here for the new web site. © 2016 North Jersey Media Group November 8, 2016 Last updated: Tuesday, November 8, 2016, 1:54 PM Ten residents seek seats during Garfield's first November election By Kristie Cattafi Staff Writer |  Community News (Garfield Edition) Garfield will be holding it first November council election after the governing body approved to change the date this year. Ten residents are competing for five, four-year seats on Nov. 8. Incumbents Gaetana (Tana) Raymond, Glenn Mati, Louis Aloia, Joseph Delaney III and Franic Calandriello are seeking re-election along with residents Erin Delaney, Richard Rigoglioso, Romi Herrera, Nikolce Milevski and Tony Lio. Louis Aloia Aloia has served as mayor of Garfield from 1996 to 2000 and as a councilman from 2000 to present. He is married to his wife, Rosemarie, with six children and six grandchildren. He is the owner and manager of Aloia Funeral Home. Aloia said in the last four years he is most proud of the city's redevelopment including the General Pulaski statue at the new Garfield River Drive Park, Garden State Signature Place, Walmart, Applebees, McDonalds, and Wawa. He said he is also proud of the council for saving and maintaining the Garfield VFW. He said the VFW exemplifies community spirit and service. If re-elected Aloia wants to see future development of the city especially with the new police department and safety of town. He said he also wants to establish more fire vehicles and create a better public safety net for the city. Future redevelopment projects he wants to focus on is getting the Monroe Street complex developed. He said developing the Monroe Street area will be key because it will increase value in the first ward. He said the next four years will be focusing on developing the first ward and "making it equally blessed" like the rest of the city. He is a founding member of the Garfield Redevelopment Authority, is a former president of Garfield UNICO, was the director of the Garfield Chamber of Commerce for 10 years, is a former member of the Garfield Planning Board, housing authority and library board and the recipient of the Garfield Mayor's Award for outstanding civic contributions. Frank Calandriello Calandriello is running with Glenn Mati and Louis Aloia under the slogan "Working for you 2016." He has served on the council for 20 years, including three consecutive terms as mayor. He is the president of Frankie's Express Moving and F&M Leasing, a 55-year family owned business. He was inducted into the New Jersey State League of Municipalities in 2011 in the Mayoral Hall of Fame. He is been trustee of the Garfield Boys & Girls Club for the last 25 years, a Garfield Jr. Boilermaker coach for the last 20 years, and a coach for various sports for several years. He is also a founding member of the Garfield Redevelopment Authority, former chairman of the Garfield Housing Authority and former planning board member. Calandriello said he is very proud of his voting record. In 2016, the municipal tax was reduced. He said he felt the taxes were stabilized but a reduction is very "unique." He said the tax reduction was accomplished with the city's redevelopment efforts. Calandriello said he was a founding member of the redevelopment committee in 2001 where they successfully identified 54 acres. Since then, the redevelopment agency has brought in $5 million in developer fees to the city, including $2.8 million toward the new police station. The redevelopment has also brought new jobs to the city with the Passaic Street shopping center stores, Wawa and Price Rite. "During the recession across the state tax revenues dropped with tax appeals, but Garfield stayed steady with redevelopment," Calandriello said. "We still continue to do a great job bringing in new ratables and maintaining a healthy surplus." He said in the last four years the city also improved their bond rating to AA- and received millions in grants saving the taxpayers money. Something he is very proud of is holding the developer Vornado accountable for their "good faith commitment" of a property donation that is now being used for the dog park on Hobart Place. The grant money originally awarded for the dog park is now being used for River Drive's second phase of the river restoration project and being used to acquire land. "I have always supported smart development without compromising the quality of life for residents," he said. He said that is why he voted against using eminent domain in the first ward. "I'm in favor of redevelopment just not the eminent domain aspect," he said. "People have the right to stay in their homes or at least be compensated fairly." In the last four years, he has supported new protective lightening warning at 20th Century field, the General Pulaski statue and Garfield River Drive Park, hiring more police officers and getting more fire and safety vehicles, the VFW with refurbishing the building, library improvements, and the council of affordable housing program. If re-elected, Calendriello said he will continue the superfund fight along with state and federal legislatures for funding of the cleanup until the city is chromium free. He also wants to see Passaic Street redeveloped without using eminent domain, and continue redevelopment especially on Monroe Street. He also wants to continue monitoring and improving the quality of water, especially the safety and quality while keeping water affordable. Calandriello will also like to see the recreation center expand with the hours and activities. "I also want to continue to support our police and firefighters who work so hard every day protecting our citizens and ensuring our public safety," he said. Joe Delaney Delaney said when he first became mayor four years ago his focus was increasing the redevelopment in the city. "The Passaic Street redevelopment was at a standstill with only the Walmart and Applebee's," Delaney said. "Within my first month as mayor, McDonald's called and after it being previously denied I was able to push it forward despite resistance from the planning board." After McDonald's came to the location, Delaney said other businesses like Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory and Pet Smart followed. "I don't want to wait another 10 years for redevelopment to move forward. I know government moves slowly but in Garfield sometimes it moves at a snail's pace and that's what I'm totally against," Delaney said. Delaney said if re-elected, he wants to focus on the redevelopment of Passaic Street. He said six months ago a plan for that area was voted down and it hasn't been spoken about since. "If we don't redevelop Passaic Street now, it will look the same if not worse 10 years from now," he said. He said he also wants to focus on hiring more employees for the department of public works. He said he recently voted against purchasing half a million dollars of equipment for the DPW because there needs to be more employees especially with redevelopment in the city increasing. He said he also wants to create a code enforcer to go around the city enforcing ordinances that the city already has like putting out garbage too early and cleaning up after pets. He said it may seem small, but enforcement of minor things will make a huge impact to the city and alleviate the police who are busy. Delaney said one of the quality-of-life issues he also wants to make a priority is speeding throughout the city. He said the council needs to encourage the police department to write more speeding tickets and do more radar posts. As a representative on the Bergen County Community Development Board for more than 12 years, he was able to obtain more than $10 million in grants to improve Garfield's parks, roads and community buildings. Delaney said he was also instrumental in moving the May municipal election to November. In the next four years, Delaney wants to focus on the redevelopment on Passaic Street and to turn into a downtown shopping area. He also wants to get the entire community more involved with more events in the city like fireworks, festivals, community weekends, movie nights and events at the River Drive Park. Delaney is also running with his daughter. "Some members of the sitting council have said my daughter is too young, but I feel we need some new young and fresh ideas," he said. "If we don't come up with these ideas then the city will be stagnant. We have to look towards the future. Our slogan is 'Our Future is Now.' We don't want to put off for tomorrow what we can do now. Erin brings fresh, educated ideas to the council and that's what we definitely need." Delaney is a lifelong resident of Garfield, a parishioner of Most Holy Name Church and is married with five children who all graduated from the Garfield Public School system. He has served the community as mayor, deputy mayor, councilman and board of education trustee. He is also a member the YMCA board of directors and the Boys & Girl' Club Coaches Association for more than 20 years, he's also a Garfield PBA Silver Card recipient. Erin Delaney Delnaey graduated from Garfield High School in 2009 and was a member of the National Honor Society and Top 20 Seniors. She received her bachelor's degree in psychology and master's degree in public administration. She is the founder of the Garfield Stigma Free Committee and member of the Garfield Prevention Coalition and the Garfield Municipal Alliance. She has worked in the field of substance abuse for four years for Partners in Prevention, the Bergen County Office of Alcohol and Drug Dependency and The Center of Alcohol and Drug Resources. Delaney also has experience in grant work, community organization, community outreach, program development, coalition management and event planning. While working at The Center for Alcohol and Drug Resources, a five year $125,000 per year grant was secured for Garfield. She has been a volunteer in several community organizations such as Food for Thought Healthy Living, Garfield Clean Communities, and a volunteer coach with various youth organizations. Delaney has been instrumental in bringing various programs to the city at no cost to the residents such as Strengthening Families, Second Step, Training for Intervention Procedures, Mental Health First Aid certified instruction and Smoke Free Public Space. She has experience in public speaking and presentations and has delivered multiple trainings for different entities such as Garfield Junior Police Academy, Bergen County Juvenile Officers Association, Bergen County Social Services, the faith based community in Passaic County, school nurses across Bergen County and countless schools throughout Bergen County. Delaney wants to run for council because she has seen her father, Councilman Delaney be involved in politics and has seen first hand what a difference he has made in the community. She said she wants to do the same and would love to have the opportunity to give back to the community that she grew up in. She said her and her father share similar goals including focusing on redevelopment, taxes, increasing community involvement and quality-of-life issues. "Community involvement is so important for people to feel invested," she said. She said she also wants to encourage residents to share their opinions and ideas. "It's important for residents to be heard. Their ideas do matter," Delaney said. "I want to work hand in hand with the community and open up a dialogue and open door with the council and residents." She said she also wants the open door to include the police department and residents and to have the community come together as a big family. Delaney said she wants to bring new events to the city and look into bringing back old events like the Boilermaker bonfires. She said she also wants to create ways to make community events more attainable to residents. She said some residents may not be able to attend due to childcare. She said she will look into ways to bring free childcare at events and break down any other barriers that prevent residents from getting involved. Delaney said running with her father has been wonderful. "He's my best friend and he knows my strengths and weaknesses and I know his," she said. "I think it will be great to bring that to the council. I think we make a great team and will be an even better team on the council." She also believes it's easier as well for a father and daughter to accept constructive criticism. "We don't always agree on the same thing, but we are able to work through it positively," Delaney said. Romi Herrera Romi Herrera has been a resident and homeowner in the City of Garfield for 11 years. As an active member of the community, Herrera has continuously demonstrated his commitment and dedication to improving the condition and well being of Garfield and its residents. Herrera is now up for a new challenge that would allow him to better represent the residents of Garfield on the city's council. Back in 2012, Herrera founded Garfield United, an organization aimed at empowering families through advocacy, resource management, and recreation. Since then, it has developed and expanded its reach to offer services to many of Garfield's residents and beyond. Through Herrera's leadership, the organization has successfully provided assistance with citizenship applications, naturalization classes, and speech workshops for those seeking legal status. Together with Garfield United, Herrera has also helped low income families fill out forms for their tax payments, advised residents about the process of property tax appeals and implemented recreational programs for children such as summer soccer camps and music lessons. Herrera also currently serves as an active member in the city's zoning board. In this role, Herrera has been keen to identify the issues that arise when residents and small business owners are barred from receiving the necessary permits and licenses to develop their businesses and properties. Herrera is determined to make more impactful change as a member of the Garfield City Council. He said he is dedicated to ensuring that Garfield's neighborhoods and school districts are safe for all children and residents. He and his wife, Elena, have three children, Solange, 22, Brittany, 21, and Peter, 9, who have gone through the city's public school system. If elected, he also wants to see the implementation of a volunteer safety unit that will help community policing and improve the relationship between local residents and police officers. He also wants to improve the quality of water and the infrastructure. Looking forward, Herrera envisions a more economically prosperous business district in Garfield. In order to achieve this goal, Herrera wants to improve the infrastructure of Garfield by proposing measures that would beautify the areas of commerce and make city officials more readily available to respond to the needs of small business owners. Herrera said he will work with the rest of the council to stabilize taxes and maintain an equitable tax system for all the residents of Garfield. Tony Lio Tony Lio is a lifelong resident of Garfield married to his wife, Dana. They have twin sons, Anthony and Dane. Both children are graduates of Garfield High School. Anthony is currently attending college and Dane is in the Bergen County Police Academy soon to be a police officer in Garfield. Lio is the owner/operator of a Garfield-based finance company offering corporate financing and leasing. He is a graduate of Garfield High School and attended Bergen Community College majoring in Business Administration. He has served as an agent for the Bergen County SPCA Law Enforcement Division, civically active with the children of the city coaching at the Boys & Girls Club, YMCA, Garfield Little League and the Garfield Jr. Boilermakers. He is presently a board trustee at the Boys & Girls Club of Garfield, a member of the Garfield UNICO and previously served on the Garfield Planning Board and is a former Vice President of the Garfield Board of Education. "As a lifelong resident of Garfield, I am unhappy with the current leadership that is running Garfield," he said. "I have asked myself; is Garfield a better place to live than it was 10-20 years ago? I think not. I am always listening to my friends and neighbors complain about issues within the city. It seems these important issues are always getting ignored or overlooked. Like crime, graffiti, public safety, absentee landlords, illegal apartments, sewer tax, street paving, quality of life issues, community re-development, attracting and maintaining businesses and supporting our schools." If elected, he has goals for the next four years. "We must work on bringing back respect, government transparency and a better quality of life to the residents of Garfield, restore confidence and trust in government, stabilize property taxes, increase programming and educational opportunities for our youth, support local businesses and enhance economic development in Garfield, improve Garfield's emergency services by updating equipment and facilities for police, fire and ambulance personnel," he said. "My running mate, Nikolce Milevski, and I will work hard and be a strong voice for the people and an advocate for the taxpayers." Lio would like to see the city a sound, healthy, united and growing city people would like to reside in during his term if elected. Glenn Mati Mati is finishing up his first term on the Garfield Council as the deputy mayor and has served on the Garfield Planning Board for the last four years. He is a retired Garfield Police Captain where he served for 34 years and is an active firefighter in the city for the last 43 years. He is currently employed as a safety officer with the Garfield Board of Education. In the past four years, he said the council's biggest accomplishment has been having a zero percent increase and actually reducing taxes. He said that was able to be accomplished by pushing redevelopment and getting businesses to help offset taxes for the residents. He said recently the city was able to build up the city's infrastructures by updating the roads, water and gas lines with Public Service. He said the city has also been able to acquire millions in grants to do things like upgrading 20th Century Field without taxing the residents. If re-elected, Mati said the next redevelopment priorities include Monroe Street and River Drive. He said developers are already interested in the areas. He said another major focus will be transforming Passaic Street into a Transit Village and upgrading the entire area. The dog park will also be built in the next couple of months at no cost to the taxpayer due to grants. He said the council has also been building up the police department. Mati said they next need to focus on building up the Department of Public Works to get more services to the residents faster. "Garfield to me is a hidden jewel," Mati said. "There are so many backgrounds in the city that all live together so well. With the development and new businesses the city is on the rise where other towns are struggling." "I believe in the last four years as a council we have all worked really hard together. We don't always agree but we do what's best for the city," Mati said. "We work well together and I'm proud of that. I believe we all deserve re-election for what we have accomplished in the last four years. We don't do it alone and we all earned it." Nikolce Milevski Milevski's family moved to Garfield in 1970 from Macedonia when he was just over a year old. He attended Garfield elementary schools and Elmwood Park High School. He then went to Ramapo State College and studied Business Administration. His wife lived in Garfield and went through the Garfield school district along with his two children. Milevski is currently the Vice Chair on the Garfield Planning Board and a member of the Garfield UNICO. He is also the President of the Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral in Cedar Grove and is the owner of the Firehouse Restaurant on Plauderville Avenue. He previously was a coach and mentor at the Garfield Little League, YMCA, Garfield Boys and Girls Club. "I still support and sponsor these organizations that do so much for our youth," he said. "While spending years on the Garfield planning board I feel it's my duty to help steer Garfield in a positive direction," he said. "Even though it's going to take time from my business and family, I know if good people don't get involved, Garfield will never become the great city it can be." If elected, he wants to improve quality of life issues, enforce laws against illegal apartments, restructure parking problems, make sure that the police department has the council's full support along with its citizens, and invite and entice new businesses to open locations in Garfield, and stop needless spending of tax dollars. He wants to spend the next fours years creating a well-informed city where all the citizens know about community events or when road construction projects or an emergency happen. Milevski said he wants to see the police department construction started and completed. He also wants to knock down condemned buildings and hold "slumlords landlords" accountable to properties they own in the city. He said he also wants to see the city work with the board of education more with shared services to save tax dollars and see redevelopment of the first ward. Tana Raymond Raymond was first elected to the city council in 2008. Raymond holds a bachelor of science degree in nursing, a master's in urban education and a master's in administration. She has a supervisor certification for public schools and an administrator's certificate. She is currently the supervisor of nurses in the Garfield School District and has served on many volunteer organizations and was part of the creation of the Garfield Animal Rescue Foundation. Raymond said one of her biggest accomplishments the past four years has been fighting illegal apartments in the city. She said more than $100,000 has been collected in illegal apartment fines. "It's so important to the city. If people have four families living in one house they need to pay taxes accordingly. It's stealing from the taxpayers," she said. "There are still a lot more to find." She said residents have been calling in tips every week and no one has accepted the $100 bounty. "That shows how much they care about the town," she said. Raymond said she has also tried to continue and carry on Councilman Delaney's redevelopment work. In October she has done four ribbon cuttings for new businesses. If re-elected, she has some of the same visions from the past four years like making the streets safer. She said she has met with some teenagers who hang on the streets and had good conversations. "I want to see them contributing. A lot of them have no support systems," Raymond said. "They really wanted a basketball court." Raymond said she suggested it to the council but it was met with resistance. She said if re-elected she will continue to pursue having a basketball court and creating more positive activities to help get their life back on track. "I always feel if I can save one child I've accomplished a mission," she said. She said she also wants continue the city's redevelopment plans while keeping Garfield affordable for the taxpayers. Last year, Garfield saw a decrease in the municipal taxes, which she said is important with hard working families in the city. Raymond also wants a K-9 unit for the police department. She said some of the police department's new hires have military backgrounds and have worked with K-9 units in the past. "I want to pursue avenues to make the addition to the police department. If we have our own K-9 unit it will save a lot of response time waiting for the county especially with school incidents," she said. She said she also wants to continue the Memorial Day parade and continue to honor veterans. In addition to the blue star program at the schools it creates an excellent source of collaboration between the city and veterans. "Working in the middle school has offered me the opportunity to have the city and board of education work together in shared service ventures," she said. "There is a good relationship now which was not always the case. We have developed a very good relationship and I truthfully believe working in the school district is an advantage." Raymond said the city is also in good financial standing with a AA- bond rating. "One of the most important factors in achieving that is the city manager and his conservative management of the city," she said. "There is more work to be done. I want to continue to serve and make the city a safer place for everyone to live I've lived in Garfield my whole life and have a lot invested," Raymond said. "I want people to know that if they came to Garfield and break the law they will get in trouble. I will try to address all these issues. The next big thing is the redevelopment of the first ward which is already in the works." Richard Rigoglioso Rigoglioso has served as the vice principal of Garfield Middle School for the last five years. He comes from a family of 10 and has lived in Garfield his entire life. He now has six children of his own who are the main reason why he is running for council. He said the town is changing and going in the wrong direction. "I take my kids to events in other towns but they are beginning to be more involved in the community with football and cheerleading," he said. Rigoglioso said he has worked in the school system for the last 20 years and sees things are changing and "not positively." "I think it's time for a different vision," he said. "The community needs to be more involved. If other towns can do it we can too if we reach out more." If elected, he said he would like to impose a term limit of three terms. "There are too many politicians stagnant and going through the motions. I think the council terms should be limited to 12 years," he said. "I know people vote you in, but after so many years there is so much power. After 12 years there should be some new fresh ideas. Right now if it's not their ideas. it's not a good idea." He believes that if there is a term limit the council will act more swiftly to get policies in motion and promote the growth of the city. Rigioglioso said he also sees a lot of redevelopment but that there are more anchor stores now. He said the city needs to focus on bringing in more "mom and pop" shops like in Ridgewood, Englewood and Montclair to attract outsiders into the town. He said there are many positive aspects to the city, like having two train stations, other forms of public transportation, being close to major highways, and minutes away from the Garden State Plaza and Hackensack University Medical Center. "We don't promote anything in a positive aspect. I think people should want to stop here and stay here. If people leave they don't talk about Garfield positively," he said. If elected, Rigoglioso said he wants to focus on promoting the superfund area in the city. "Chromium is the city's Achilles heel," he said. "The Environmental Protection Agency says the area is safe and they are planning to clean it, but what are we doing to promote the area?" He said people are renting out homes in the area and that people have redeveloped worse around the country. "I don't have the answers but I have a lot of questions that I'm willing to ask," he said. "People throw Garfield under the bus. People used to say it was a good blue collar town and it really bothers me and I'm passionate about it."

He has served on the council for 20 years, including three consecutive terms as mayor. He is the president of Frankie's Express Moving and F&M Leasing, a 55-year family owned business. He was inducted into the New Jersey State League of Municipalities in 2011 in the Mayoral Hall of Fame. He is been trustee of the Garfield Boys & Girls Club for the last 25 years, a Garfield Jr. Boilermaker coach for the last 20 years, and a coach for various sports for several years. He is also a founding member of the Garfield Redevelopment Authority, former chairman of the Garfield Housing Authority and former planning board member. Calandriello said he is very proud of his voting record. In 2016, the municipal tax was reduced. He said he felt the taxes were stabilized but a reduction is very "unique." He said the tax reduction was accomplished with the city's redevelopment efforts. Calandriello said he was a founding member of the redevelopment committee in 2001 where they successfully identified 54 acres. Since then, the redevelopment agency has brought in $5 million in developer fees to the city, including $2.8 million toward the new police station. The redevelopment has also brought new jobs to the city with the Passaic Street shopping center stores, Wawa and Price Rite. "During the recession across the state tax revenues dropped with tax appeals, but Garfield stayed steady with redevelopment," Calandriello said. "We still continue to do a great job bringing in new ratables and maintaining a healthy surplus." He said in the last four years the city also improved their bond rating to AA- and received millions in grants saving the taxpayers money. Something he is very proud of is holding the developer Vornado accountable for their "good faith commitment" of a property donation that is now being used for the dog park on Hobart Place. The grant money originally awarded for the dog park is now being used for River Drive's second phase of the river restoration project and being used to acquire land. "I have always supported smart development without compromising the quality of life for residents," he said. He said that is why he voted against using eminent domain in the first ward. "I'm in favor of redevelopment just not the eminent domain aspect," he said. "People have the right to stay in their homes or at least be compensated fairly." In the last four years, he has supported new protective lightening warning at 20th Century field, the General Pulaski statue and Garfield River Drive Park, hiring more police officers and getting more fire and safety vehicles, the VFW with refurbishing the building, library improvements, and the council of affordable housing program.

At least that is what I infer from my receipt of its Holiday Gift Guide in my email. As far as timing is concerned, the Mint is mainstream. I was in Wal-mart on Saturday morning and the cashier was wearing an elf cap. When I complimented her on it, she said she had just gotten it the day before. Of course, the Mint, Wal-mart and other retailers hope we all will spend, spend, spend. The Mint’s gift guide prominently features the two 2016 commemorative coin series. If you know someone who is fond of the works of Mark Twain, a gold $5 or silver dollar honoring the classic American author just might be the perfect present. A lover of the great outdoors might be a prime candidate for one of the coins celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. There is a $5 gold piece, a silver dollar and a clad half dollar. If you consider both the proof and uncirculated versions, you have six coins to choose from. Gifts are probably the last hope for either commemorative program to move the sales numbers much higher. Collectors have had most of the year to make up their minds. If they have not purchased them by now, the only added inducement might come in December when a last look at sales numbers might reveal one that is extremely low – implying future profits if you buy it. For something current, the Mint’s catalog takes the viewer to a page on which appears the uncirculated mintmarked silver American Eagle celebrating the 30th anniversary of the program. It has a lettered edge rather than the standard reeding as appears on the regular issue 2016 bullion silver Eagle. But it will not be available until Dec. 1. That should be no problem as in recent years the Mint has excelled in swift delivery times. For me this year, the best part of the gift guide is the portion devoted to medals. Medals do not get enough attention. I am as guilty as the next collector at relegating them to second class status compared to coins. The old Life cereal commercial seems an appropriate mention here. Everybody in it wanted to let Mikey try the new cereal first. Well, with medals, a gift of a medal to Mikey might just lead to greater numbers of collectors if he likes it. The medals offered have attractive artwork and honor incredible people, from veterans to Mother Teresa. This entry was posted in Buzz.

And it’s also a leader in the area of sustainability. It just announced a new plan to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that conform to the standards set by the Paris climate accords. Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S. and expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea. The company’s announcement came in Philadelphia last Friday at its Net Impact Conference, all with a goal of increasing “trust and transparency.”  “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of – and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” says Doug McMillon, chief executive of WalMart, at the conference. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” It is sourcing more energy from renewables and has dedicated itself to paying its associates more. It says it is dedicated to doing the right thing, and giving people more access to more products. It says it wants to redefine what it means to do good. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015, the company says. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and renewable energy to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. Is this the WalMart that you know? McMillion asked attendees. He says WalMart is a quite a different company from what people have perceived it to be. While the company felt it had good people doing good work, Hurricane Katrina caused it to reach an epiphany. It resolved itself to throw its people, merchandise and money to solving that specific problem. But it changed the company, he said. How can we be this company all the time? he asked, thus committing itself to such a standard, always. He said that WalMart listened to its critics, who were concerned about its environmental and labor practices. Walmart has a platform. And so it chose to set three goals and to improve in the following areas: achieving zero waste, increasing renewable energy  and selling increasingly sustainable products over time in sustainable packaging. The company set them in aspirational ways and since 2005, it has been on its way to chipping away at these aims. It is serving all stakeholders, McMillion says. On Friday, it set new objectives: Building on those sustainability goals it set in 2005, it shoots further —  to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100% renewable energy — 50% by 2025 — and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. “Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society.” The record so far? In 2015, 25 percent of Walmart’s operations were powered by renewable energy, a significant step towards the 2005 goal. Going forward, the company says that it will source half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, as part of a plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, 75 percent of Walmart’s global waste was diverted from landfills, the company says, helping to reduce costs to the business, customers and society. Under the roadmap, the company will achieve zero waste to landfill from our own operations in key markets, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada by 2025, it continues. The commitment is designed to meet or exceed EPA zero waste guidelines.  McMillon also discussed WalMart’s $2.7 billion investment in its employees — money that has been targeted to education, wages and training. On average, a store manager makes $175,000 a year. It will hire for talent and train for skill, he noted, saying that his first job was unloading trucks at WalMart — and that he rear-ended his boss’ car the first day on his job. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he says. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates … People will have a better shot of taking advantage of the opportunities in front of them.”  Mars Drinks’ Single Serve Packaging Redesign Cuts Carbon Footprint by 31% Alcatraz Cruises Launches Hybrid Ferryboat Walmart to Save $150m with Sustainability Initiatives in FY13 Walmart Foundation, Target, US Chamber Foundation to Launch Circular Economy Pilot Keurig Transitioning to Recylable K-Cups Reader Comments There are no comments for this story.   Name (required) Mail (will not be published) (required) Website Energy Manager News ERC Price Benchmark Trends Week Ending: November 4, 2016 The Evolution of Whole Building Interval Data Updated Standard from ANSI, ASHRAE and IES Wyoming Refining to Save with New Motors, LEDs Washington State Rejects Nation’s First Carbon Tax at the Polls Where’s Oil Headed?

As shopping season kicks into high gear, most retailers are cutting back on sales help in their stores, a survey of hiring announcements reveals. Walmart, which last year proudly announced that it was hiring 60,000 extra workers for the holiday shopping season, this year is staying uncharacteristically silent on its plans. “We don’t yet have a number to share, mainly because we are looking at seasonal hiring on a much more local, store-by-store basis this year,” a Walmart spokesperson told The Post. Retailers typically advertise for seasonal help in September and hire in October. The giant discounter’s plan includes giving current workers “access to extra hours,” the spokesperson said. Walmart said earlier this year that it would use existing employees as “Santa’s helpers,” giving them a yellow vest and a Santa hat. CareerTrends | Graphiq At Toys R Us, executives are not disclosing the number of temporary workers the chain will hire. Last year, it announced that it would hire 40,000 workers. “With an expected growth in online shopping,” said a Toys R Us spokeswoman, “we’ve placed a greater focus on hiring for our e-commerce fulfillment centers as well as back-of-house operations at our stores.” Retail employment in October fell 21 percent, to 154,600, from a year ago, or the steepest such decline in five years, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “The numbers coming out from the Labor Department show that most retailers have announced hiring plans that are flat to down from last year,” said Chief Executive Officer John Challenger. Nordstrom and Macy’s are trimming their ranks by small percentages — 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively — while GameStop is reducing the number of people it hires in its stores, a spokeswoman said. To be sure, some retailers are adding about the same number of part-time workers as last year, including Target and Kohl’s. Meanwhile, highlighting the phenomenal growth of online sales, Amazon said it is hiring 120,000 extra workers — 20 percent more than last year. “The megatrend here is that as more shopping migrates online, the fewer people retailers need in their stores,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. Indeed, Target is adding 7,500 workers to its fulfillment and distribution centers, or 1,000 more than last year, “because our online sales are increasing,” said a spokeswoman.

Previous: CVRep story on future Cathedral City theater purchase Walmart opened its first training academy in California on November 1 at the Walmart Supercenter located at 79295 Highway 111 in La Quinta. Academies are a dedicated facility located in, or adjacent to, a Walmart Supercenter where hourly supervisors and department managers will receive two weeks of hands-on training that combines both the classroom and the sales floor. Walmart has created a new end-to-end training program called Pathways for associates at all levels of store operations, from entry-level to Regional General Manager. Hourly frontline supervisors and department managers will attend a dedicated two-week training program at the academy facility as part of Pathways. Braille Institute Rancho Mirage announced that it will unveil its newly updated and remodeled teaching kitchen in a special community ceremony on 10 a.m. November 10. The fully remodeled kitchen features both gas and electric stovetops, typical kitchen storage and sinks, and other appliances that the average person has in their own kitchen. To help students regain confidence in the kitchen, the Braille Institute Rancho Mirage Kitchen Confidence instructors highlight topics such as safely pouring hot liquids, kitchen organization and food safety, lighting suggestions, and how to identify, mark and label foods. In addition, students get hands-on experience applying the new skills to meal preparation. Kitchen Confidence class instructors’ offer free programming in English and Spanish to any Coachella Valley resident who experiences vision loss. The instructors combine general kitchen safety lessons with creative tips to adapt traditional cooking techniques. The relaunched Kitchen Confidence program is available year-round. Although there is no fee to participate, students must register with Braille Institute by calling (760) 321-1111 or by visiting the center located at 70251 Ramon Road in Rancho Mirage. CV Link, has been recommended to receive $24.3 million in active transportation funding from the State of California, officials have announced. This is the largest single award announced for the valley’s multi-modal transportation corridor, and it ensures that the project’s construction can be funded from Palm Springs to Coachella. The grant was recommended to be funded by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) staff, which identified 50 projects statewide that should receive $158 million from the 2017 Active Transportation Program. CV Link received 89.5 points and topped the statewide list in terms of the amount of funding allocated. The CTC staff recommendations will be presented to the California Transportation Commission for approval in December. Previous story and video interviews on CV Link funding Philanthropy Desert Healthcare District, a local government agency that provides health-related community grants, recently approved funding to LifeStream Prostate Cancer Treatment Program to purchase new advanced cellular collection technology. The grant will allow LifeStream to expand its “autologous cellular immunotherapy” program, an FDA-approved treatment regimen proven to prolong the lives of prostate cancer patients. The apheresis machine, Optia, collects mononuclear cellular products from men with advanced forms of prostate cancer, which are then processed and transformed into cancer-fighting cells that are returned to the patient. Optia uses the patient’s own immune cells and reprograms them to attack existing cancer cells. This treatment is proven to prolong the lives of these men. Recognition Designed to rate how well hospitals protect patients from accidents, errors, injuries and infections, the latest Hospital Safety Score honored Eisenhower Medical Center, in Rancho Mirage with an “A,” the top grade in patient safety. The Hospital Safety Score is compiled under the guidance of the nation’s leading experts on patient safety and is administered by The Leapfrog Group (Leapfrog), an independent industry watchdog. The Hospital Safety Score is fully transparent, offering a full analysis of the data and methodology used in determining grades on the website. Patients can also review their hospital’s past safety performance alongside its current grade on the Hospital Safety Score site.To see Eisenhower Medical Center’s full score, and to access safety tips for patients and their loved ones, visit the Hospital Safety Score website at www.hospitalsafetyscore.org.

Idaho Falls 0  Updated at 4:17 pm, November 7th, 2016 By: Natalia Hepworth, EastIdahoNews.com Share This Story We Matched Construction in front of the Idaho Falls Walmart. IDAHO FALLS — A lot of residents have noticed construction in front of the Ammon and Idaho Falls Walmart stores, but store management says the inconvenience will soon be coming to an end. Managers at both locations have confirmed gas stations are being built on their parking lots. Groundbreaking for these stations began at the end of September for both the Ammon and Idaho Falls stores. Construction is expected to be complete by the beginning of the new year. Management for the Ammon Walmart confirmed that the gas station will be owned and operated by Walmart and will included a convenience store. EastIdahoNews.com reached out to the Idaho Falls Walmart and they confirmed that there will be a gas station, but did not confirm if it would be Walmart owned and operated. Store officials say Walmart gas stations are part of a new Walmart standard. CSP Daily News reports that Walmart is moving forward with its plan to build and operate its own gas stations across the nation. The Rexburg Walmart, which opened at the beginning of this year, was the first in east Idaho to have a Walmart gas station. It includes a convenience store run by Walmart employees as well.

Target co-created content on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter most often than other networks.   Instagram pros—All eight brands used Instagram for visual storytelling, with North Face, Nike and Sephora being the strongest.   The top performers on Twitter and Facebook are below.   Ranking of average response times (Twitter):      1. Sephora – 62 minutes 2. Lululemon – 132 minutes 3. Target – 212 minutes 4. Amazon – 220 minutes 5. Walmart –  1,710 minutes 6. REI – 1,655 minutes        Ranking of average response times (Facebook):   1. Amazon – 76 minutes 2. Sephora – 87 minutes 3. Lululemon – 87 minutes 4. Target – 333 minutes 5. Walmart –  496 minutes 6. REI – 1,132 minutes   More specifically, the State of Social Engagement unveiled the tactics retail brands are successfully using on social media:       Amazon and Sephora were at the top of the rankings with the highest engagement on online communities, strong visual storytelling, appropriate use of each social channel and content integration across channels.     Target performed well in co-creating content with influencers.     All eight brands surveyed leveraged Instagram for visual storytelling, with The North Face and Sephora doing so most successfully.     The majority of the eight retail brands surveyed focused their content on converting, persuading and support. Sephora and Target both had the most "convert" content – defined as linking to a microsite where the consumer can make a purchase or learn where to buy.   The State of Social Engagement uncovered the areas of social media where retail brands succeed over the other surveyed industries (telecommunications, consumer products, travel & hospitality, financial services, media, technology and pharmaceuticals):       Engagement: Of the industries surveyed, the retail industry ranked at the top when it came to engaging consumers. In fact, the top five most engaging brands in the study were all from the retail industry. The brands with the highest engagement scores also tended to have the highest Klout scores. As a top performer, the retail industry also had the highest average scores for Facebook and Twitter engagement.     Influencer Collaboration: Very few brands in the survey used influencer collaboration well, but those in the retail industry performed best, with Target being a standout. Influencer co-creation helps "amp up" sharing and opens the brand to exposure among the influencers' followings. Retail was the only industry that used all six major social channels studied (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and online communities).     Online communities: Retail brands were among the most adept at using online communities to drive deeper understanding about their products and provide answers to consumers' product questions.

Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said on Thursday. Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card. Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964. "The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind," Eckert said. U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc's Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores. Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 U.S. stores. Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register. An e-receipt is sent to the app. Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month. He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay. Wal-Mart leads a consortium of U.S. retailers developing a mobile wallet app called CurrentC. The group, which includes Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc, said earlier this year it would delay launching the app after the project hit several roadblocks.

Traditional retailers are scrambling to catch up in the e-commerce space, particularly with Amazon, and as a result, management roles are being shaken up. Top executives from both Walmart and Target are exiting the respective companies as the retailers look to adjust their business models and better meet consumer needs. Both Walmart and Target are losing multiple executives: Walmart: After acquiring Jet.com for $3 billion in August, former Jet CEO Marc Lore has taken over Walmart's e-commerce operations, which includes operating both sites' digital platforms. This month, Walmart is losing some of its core e-commerce team members, including Fernando Madeira, head of Walmart.com, Dianne Mills, SVP of global e-commerce human resources, and Brent Beabout, SVP of e-commerce supply chain, reports The Wall Street Journal. Target: Target likewise has been experiencing a fundamental shakeup in its management. Last week it was announced that Target's grocery chief Anne Dament would be stepping down after just 18 months, reports Retail Dive. This follows the exit of Target's chief digital officer Jason Goldberger in September, and chief marketing officer Jeff Jones' departure in August. The firm reported a a 7% year-over-year (YoY) decline in total sales during Q2 2016. Walmart's confidence in Lore to grow its overall digital business could signal a lack of success the company has with its own e-commerce division. While acquiring Jet.com could add to Walmart's overall online sales, simply onboarding the company does not address internal issues that remain, according to Columbia University professor Mark Cohen. Leaning on Jet.com's assets could help propel Walmart's online business, but the company should remain committed to enhancing its current e-commerce operations outside of Jet.com as well in order to become a stronger player in the online market. Target has faced numerous hurdles in the e-commerce market. It has struggled to find success with grocery — a product line that lends itself well to click and collect — and overall, digital still only accounts for 3.3% of total sales. Goldberger's exit after only four months in the role, along with other recent departures, highlights an instability within Target that could further push the company behind its competitors.

The big-box super chains Wal-Mart and Target appear to be imitating each other this holiday season. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times; Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Associated Press Privacy Policy Wal-Mart and Target are each taking a cue from the other this holiday season.  After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target Corp., which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals.  The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise.  Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Ark.-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell.  Stores hustle to get their holiday goods as fallout from the Hanjin shipping mess continues Natalie Kitroeff The last Hanjin Shipping vessel dropping off goods in California has set sail from the Port of Long Beach, finally clearing the many ships left stranded by the company’s sudden collapse two months ago.

The last Hanjin Shipping vessel dropping off goods in California has set sail from the Port of Long Beach, finally clearing the many ships left stranded by the company’s sudden collapse two months ago. But in its wake, the giant shipping line has left a mess that retailers across the country will... (Natalie Kitroeff) “Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. “I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle.”  Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped.  For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot.  It’s adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week.  “We want to serve the customer as they want to be served,” Wal-Mart Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna said.  Target also is focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it had 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the previous number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores.  Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices and to offer more consistent pricing, instead of short-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88.  Target, which has acknowledged that it failed to deliver on the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan, says about 60% of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20% from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year’s promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store.  “Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop,” said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice president of marketing.  Target is also extending its free shipping promotion by a week, waiving the shipping fee for all digital orders until Jan. 1.  Both Target and Wal-Mart are offering even more exclusive products.  Wal-Martis offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It’s also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup.  Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15% more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of “Friends in Low Places.” The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere.  Wal-Mart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss LAPD will not help deport immigrants under Trump, nearly 4,000 students from L.A.

The five sisters—Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney Kardashian, and Kylie and Kendall Jenner—spend so much time in hair and makeup, some of them actually have a room in their house devoted to the cause. Khloé’s glam room is the stuff of legend, and Kylie has called hers “my favorite room in the house.” Yes, that is correct: Kylie would rather be chilling in her glam room than be snuggled up in bed or kicking it in the living room. To be fair, the room sounds sort of like a boudoir, living room, and bathroom all rolled into one, but—keep in mind that she has a lot of rooms to choose from. MORE: Everything You’ve Ever Wanted to Know About the Kardashians’ Glam Rooms Thing is, most of the makeup jammed into those drawers—or, more likely, neatly organized within them—is not the cheapest. Nor are the hair products they favor, nor the skin care serums and lotions they gravitate toward. But every so often, the Kardashian women divulge their favorite drugstore beauty products, and we are never disappointed. (As an aside, it seems as though Kourtney is too into all-natural and high-end beauty to pay a visit to the drugstore; we didn’t find any bargain product recs from her at all. Most of our pics came from Kim and Khloé, who love talking beauty on their apps.) First off, they definitely favor certain brands: As we combed the internet, determined to shine a light on all of their top faves, we found products of every stripe, but especially picks from Rimmel, L’Oréal, and Maybelline. We also discovered that the Kardashians definitely like a nude lipstick, which should not come as a surprise; but if you’re in the market for one and would prefer not to break the bank, you’re in luck. Ahead, find 45 beauty products that you can find at the nearest drugstore—all, of course, Kardashian-approved.

Newsletter FAQ | Cancel Any Time | We Value Your Privacy Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing How Deep-in-the-Money Options Offer a Solid Alternative to Stocks Published Fri, Sep 21, 2012  |  Lee Lowell, Chief Options Analyst Whether you read my Wall Street Daily articles, you’re a subscriber to my Instant Money Trader or you’ve read my book, I’m sure you know by now that I’m a huge fan of selling put options. If that’s not for you, though, there’s another strategy I highly recommend as an alternative to just buying stocks. And that’s buying deep-in-the-money (DITM), long-dated, call option contracts. You see, option contracts are the greatest financial products ever created, since leverage lets many investors participate in trades that would otherwise be out of reach. Now, many investors think that leverage is too risky. And they have a point. Leverage’s ability to magnify your gains can have the reverse effect, as well. But here’s a way you can participate in the massive upside potential options offer, while reducing risk at the same time. Buying Shares At a 73% Discount Let’s use Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) as our prime example. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of Wal-Mart today, it would cost you roughly $7,475. But by using DITM options, those same 100 shares would cost you roughly $2,020. That’s a solid $5,455 cheaper – or a 73% discount.  So what does deep-in-the-money mean? Basically, DITM options have strike prices that are set much lower than the current price of the stock. The options chain to the right shows a partial listing of available call option contracts to trade on Wal-Mart (at its current price of $74.75). Let’s focus on the January 2014 $55 strike price, which is around $19.75 below the stock price. The cost to buy the option is roughly $2,020 per contract. Remember, each contract represents 100 shares of stock. The benefits of buying the option instead of the stock are two-fold: First, you’re only spending $2,020 instead of $7,475 to control the same 100 shares, but you’re benefiting from similar movement (more on that below). Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020. Wal-Mart shareholders have $7,475 at risk. That’s a big difference. However, DITM isn’t the only thing you need to focus on to make sure you’re getting the best deal possible. High Delta is Key It’s also crucial that you pinpoint the options with at least a 90% or higher “delta.” Delta refers to how closely the option price moves in relation to the underlying stock. In other words, the higher the delta, the more the option moves in lockstep with the stock. Since the whole point of buying options is to pocket massive gains when the stock moves in your favor, the best way to do that is to choose options with a high delta. Have you ever bought a call or put-option contract and its value didn’t increase – even though the stock price moved a good distance in your favor? Depressing, wasn’t it? Most likely it was because you didn’t own an option with a high enough delta. As I said, a good delta to go with is at least 90%. Just to clarify, that means the option price should move 90% in the same direction of the stock’s movement. As you can see, the $55 strike price option boasts a 96% delta. The screenshots of an options calculator below show this principle working in real-time. The calculator on top shows what the options trade for at Wal-Mart’s current price of $74.75. The one on the bottom shows what the option would likely trade for if shares hit $75.75. As you can see, the option price went up almost a dollar, just like the stock. That’s the kind of movement you need. What novice option traders usually do is pick the cheapest option contracts based on the actual dollar value. It makes them feel like they’re getting a better deal. But what they don’t realize is that the cheaper the option price, the lower the delta will be, which means they’ll see less cash in the end. So what happens when the options expire in January 2014? Well, if Wal-Mart increased like you hoped it would, you can sell the options and bank the gain. Or you can “exercise” the option and turn it into actual shares of stock. If you choose the latter, you’ll have to pay for the stock in full at that time. Usually, the first scenario is the best bet, since you could just sell the option and use the profits to buy another position. And you’re still participating in the move higher like you would if you actually owned shares. Only this way, you’re keeping your cost and risk low at the same time. So do yourself a favor… If you’re ever going to buy a stock, consider buying DITM options with a high delta instead. You’ll be glad you did.

[Reply] Joseph says: April 26, 2015 at 3:00 pm You say “Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020.” This is only partly true. Yes, the amount of money that’s on the line is smaller; but on the other hand, there is a much greater chance that you will lose all your money when buying the option than buying the actual stock. This is because if the stock price drops below your strike price you lose your entire investment whereas when you buy the actual stock the only way you lose all your money is if the company’s share price goes down to zero, a much less likely scenario than the price falling below the strike price. [Reply] Max Baer Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:27 am Excellent point, Joseph! Even deep-in-the-money options pose a high risk if a stock goes into an unexpected, yet temporary, free fall. If the option expires before the stock recovers, you could lose all your money on the position, whereas the underlying stock may well appreciate nicely after the expiration of the option, but too late for you to benefit from it. [Reply] Dominic says: July 11, 2015 at 4:15 am So I should find a DITM call with a high delta, right? As opposed to what? A DITM call with a low delta? (If your broker offers you a DITM call with a low delta you should find another brokerage.) [Reply] 56 says: August 9, 2016 at 10:11 am Deep in money have deep premiums in addition to another deep premium cost factor for options (time, and its your forgiving friend if you buy enough of it) . Less contracts for that $2000. What’s wrong with at the money/slightly out of the money. Lower premiums, more contracts, and time if you choose to pay for it. Delta of .6-7 isn’t as nice as .9 for sure but considering you can ramp up the number of contracts the $ buys and/or get more time I mean really the thing that matters is being proved right on strike+premium anytime before expiration. I would recommend the hell out of put options vs shorting. More gains, no obligations,no sneaky dividends. Time is against shorts anyways, not such a big swallow for a put.

Chase Pay QR codes will be among the mobile payments options available at Walmart locations in the U.S. next year. This mobile wallet will be worked into Wamart’s own app. Customers will be able to use it to make in-store purchases with Chase Visa and debit cards. Instead of relying on NFC technology, this mobile wallet uses QR codes shown at the checkout counter. To pay for a purchase, users display Chase Pay QR codes at the checkout counter. The cashier can then scan the quick response codes as a part of the authentication process. The Chase Pay service will also be added to the official Walmart website in 2017. In this way, consumers will be able to make purchases through mobile commerce or on the desktop site using those credit and debit cards. This will also allow them to earn rewards and obtain offers. Those transactions are secured with token technology. The complex Chase Pay QR codes are unique and are used only one time for each transaction. The goal is to make sure that consumer card information is kept secure. Chase Pay appears to have wooed Walmart in a way that Apple was never able to accomplish. Apple Pay currently uses NFC technology with Touch ID security added to its tokenization. So far, Walmart has held firm in its decision not to allow consumers to use that technology to pay for purchases in-store. Instead, Walmart has chosen to use services based on QR codes such as Chase Pay and its own Walmart Pay. The retailer has stated that it will still be willing to consider additional digital wallets in the future. Chase Pay was first developed in partnership with MCX. That mobile payments service was created by a consortium that also launched CurrentC. The CurrentC service has been postponed indefinitely. Within the MCX consortium, Walmart was a leading member from 2012 through 2015. After that point was the expiration of the three-year exclusivity portion of the contract. Walmart has been directly stating that it would not accept Apple Pay since 2014.

Flipkart is trying to raise $1 billion in the next round of funding, The Hindu BusinessLine reported on Sunday. In a reply to an email seeking comment, sent by Techcircle to Flipkart, a company spokesperson said that, “It is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” The report, quoting two unnamed sources, said that if this deal goes through, it would be Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s (CPPIB) first investment in an internet company in India. The report also said that Flipkart is also talking to Wal-Mart for a minority stake sale. There have been several media reports, in the past three months, surfacing on the same lines. Flipkart’s outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja, in an interview to Techcircle, had said that, “There is no absolute aggressive fundraise programme. As of now, we are not doing anything. There is enough runway available. Funds are available for more than two years. That is one aspect. But yes, one or two transactions will continue to happen.” He also added, “If there are investors who want to talk to us, whether strategic or financial, we will continue those (talks). But are we aggressively pursuing or running a process? That is not true.” While it is undeniable that Wal-Mart is a global giant that employs around 2.3 million people in its 11,527 stores across 28 countries and churned $482 billion in total revenue last year, it is definitely worried about its declining online sales in the US while Amazon continues to grow impressively, both in the US and India. Also, Wal-Mart’s online sales were a mere $13.6 billion in 2015 against Amazon’s $107 billion. The retail giant has been looking to expand its e-commerce play both in the US and international markets. Baweja had stepped down from Flipkart last month, but he will continue working till the end of this year. In the meanwhile, Flipkart had made interim changes in its finance management vertical. As a part of the interim organisational change, commercial, taxation, accounting and treasury functions will be consolidated under Rajnish Baweja, the group finance controller of Flipkart. Business finance has been reporting to Nitin Seth, who is currently the chief administrative officer, as part of the “strategy to execution” function. Corporate affairs and campus functions will also report to Seth. Presently, Flipkart stands strong in India but arch rival Amazon is close at its heels. Citing comScore data a few months ago, the Indian arm of the US-based e-tailer claimed to have overtaken Flipkart as the most visited e-commerce site in India. Earlier, citing data from an unnamed logistics company that services online retailers, The Economic Times had reported that the market share of Flipkart and Snapdeal fell to 37% and 15% from 43% and 19%, respectively while Amazon’s market share grew between 21% and 24% from 14% in 2015.

Would Sanjay Baweja have left if Walmart was going to pump in a billion. We are not so foolish that we cannot co-relate two atories.

 Walmart sued for selling fake 'Egyptian cotton' sheets Jonathan Stempel, Reuters Nov. 9, 2016, 12:26 PM 1,629 facebook linkedin twitter email print Thomson Reuters Wal-Mart Stores Inc was sued on Tuesday on behalf of consumers who said the world's largest retailer sold products falsely labeled "100 % Egyptian Cotton" from an Indian textile company for many years after it first became suspicious of their origin. According to the complaint, Wal-Mart questioned the fiber content of Welspun India Ltd's <WLSP.NS> products as early as 2008, but waited until two months ago to halt sales of its mislabeled Egyptian cotton bed linens, following a similar halt by Target Corp <TGT.N>. The plaintiff, Dorothy Monahan of Michigan, said she overpaid at a Wal-Mart for Better Homes and Gardens bed linens made by Welspun that she thought were made of Egyptian cotton, and therefore higher quality than cheaper bed linens. She accused Wal-Mart of violating U.S. laws governing textile fiber labeling and advertising, and is seeking damages for everyone who has bought bed linens at Wal-Mart made by Welspun and labeled "100% Egyptian Cotton." "We plan to vigorously defend the company," a Wal-Mart spokesman said. He said the retailer removed such products after conducting a comprehensive review nearly two months ago and since then has offered customers a full refund. A lawyer for Monahan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Monahan is represented by the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, whose specialties include product liability. Her complaint was filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Egyptian cotton typically commands premiums from shoppers because its long cotton fibers contribute to a finer, lighter, softer and more durable fabric. Although the United States and Australia produce more high-end cotton, the Egyptian product has retained its prestige because of the northeast African country's long history of growing it. Wal-Mart has also sold Welspun bed linen under the "Canopy" name, and in September called "unacceptable" the Indian company's inability to assure that its products were 100 percent Egyptian cotton. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer nonetheless decided to work with Welspun to improve quality control and labeling, rather than cut ties. Other U.S. retailers, including Bed Bath & Beyond Inc <BBBY.O> and J.C. Penney Co <JCP.N>, also began reviewing their ties to Welspun after Target's announcement. The case is Monahan v Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-08662.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Black Friday 2016 Gamer's Guide: Expect great deals on these consoles this year Black Friday 2016 Gamer's Guide: Expect great deals on these consoles this year By Mike Rougeau Gaming   Get ready for lots of PS4 Pro and Xbox One S deals Shares It’s 2016 - the future - which means you don’t even have to leave your house to get the best Black Friday deals. So long, midnight lines, hello comfy couch! And for anyone looking for Black Friday gaming deals, you need click no further than Amazon or another online retailer to score the hottest consoles, bundles, games, controllers and more. Every year Black Friday for gamers is like Christmas come early; last year was bananas, with more PS4 deals and Xbox One bundles than you could shake a PS Move at. This year, we expect plenty of PS4 Pro deals, Xbox One S deals and much more for your favorite gaming tech.  With Black Friday 2016 potentially being the biggest day of spending ever, it helps to get some hints ahead of time.  Whether shopping for the gamer in your life or yourself, keep reading to learn what Black Friday console and game deals to look for this year! Black Friday console deals to watch for Sony PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro The PlayStation 4 has won the current console war in many gamers’ minds, and Black Friday 2016 will likely be the perfect opportunity to pick one up.  That's especially true considering there are two new versions, the PS4 Slim (currently $299 with Uncharted 4/ £224 on Amazon) and the PS4 Pro ( $399/ £332), both of which will be available by Black Friday this year.  What's more, retailers have a history of discounting PS4s to record levels on Black Friday, so now is the time if you want to take the plunge. The best cheap PS4 deals in November Last year’s PS4 Black Friday deals included bundles with Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection, Call of Duty Black Ops 3, Star Wars Battlefront, Disney Infinity 3.0, The Last Of Us Remastered, Grand Theft Auto V, and more top-tier titles from retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop , Target and Walmart.  Expect to see even more tempting bundles this year, perhaps even one with the PlayStation VR headset. Or, if you’re just looking for the cheapest possible version, Black Friday will likely feature a standalone PS4 deal that will rock your world. Sony PlayStation VR The PlayStation VR (currently $399/ £332 on Amazon) is only one of the several virtual reality headsets available this year, but given that it doesn’t need a high-end PC or a specific Android smartphone to pair with - just a PS4 console - it’s easily the most accessible for many gamers. That makes it the perfect gift (for a loved one or yourself). Sony said recently that PSVR sales are “on track,” whatever that means, but the headset isn’t selling out and is currently available on Amazon, so there may well be some deals going on during Black Friday to help you dive into virtual reality. The best PlayStation VR deals in November You'll also find the headset up for order at Best Buy, GameStop , Target and Walmart, so keep an eye on those retailers for PSVR deals and bundles on Black Friday, too. Microsoft Xbox One S Like the PS4, the Xbox One got a new hardware SKU this year: the Xbox One S (currently $399 for 2TB version/ £237 for 500GB and FIFA 17 on Amazon).  So if you or a loved one has been on the fence about picking up an Xbox One - and if the console’s massive bulk was a partial factor there - now is the best time yet to pick up Microsoft’s latest console. Last year’s Xbox deals included bundles with Halo 5: Guardians, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Gears of War Ultimate Edition, Forza Motorsport 6, Fallout 4, and others, so watch out for Black Friday 2016 Xbox bundles with hot Microsoft exclusives of the season - not to mention the new hardware. The best Xbox One deals in November As you can imagine, Best Buy, GameStop , Target and Walmart all offer the Xbox One S, including with a number of game bundles. Microsoft has also put together a number of Xbox One S holiday bundles, including a Battlefield 1 bundle for $299 and a Gears of War 4 package for $349. Nintendo Wii U With the Nintendo Switch finally revealed, the jury’s out on whether the Wii U (currently $299 with Mario Kart 8/ £237 on Amazon) will even remain in production.  Either way, Black Friday 2016 will likely be a good time to pick one up if you’ve been unsure about Nintendo’s under-powered, under-supported underdog console. And it may be one of the last times.  There's still reason to buy a Wii U: it has plenty of great games for Nintendo diehards, so it’s definitely worth getting - especially if it’s cheap. The best Wii U deals in November Last year’s Wii U bundles included Mario Kart 8, Super Mario Maker, or Skylanders Swap Force, but it wouldn’t be surprising if the 2016 Wii U deals were a tad more aggressive as retailers try to move as many of remaining units as possible to make room for the Switch launch in the spring. You'll find some Wii U offers going on right now over at Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart. Keep checking those retailers for Wii U clearing deals on Black Friday, too. New Nintendo 3DS Unlike the Wii U, Nintendo’s 3DS is still going strong, having handily defeated the PS Vita long ago. So if you or the gamer in your life still doesn’t have one, Black Friday may be the time to right that heinous wrong. The 2DS is thankfully a mostly forgotten slice of cake, but the current hardware iterations - the New 3DS (currently $174 with Super Mario 3D Land/ £139 standalone on Amazon) and New 3DS XL (currently $199 Amazon exclusive lime green with Super Mario World/ £169 standalone) - have all the features a 3DS owner could want, including a second analog nub and head tracking for vastly improved 3D effects. The best Nintendo 3DS deals in November The usual suspects - Best Buy, GameStop , Target and Walmart - will all help you get your Nintendo 3DS fix. 3DS game bundles come and go like Bowser’s confidence, so watch out for any new ones this year and the price is sure to be right on Black Friday 2016. Get your game on during Black Friday Shoppers of all ilk have looked forward to Black Friday every November for years, but it’s become a great holiday for gamers in particular.  Retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, Walmart and even digital storefronts like Steam, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live always go all out on gaming deals. And it’s not just game consoles that go on sale - keep an eye out, too, for accessories like controllers and headsets, not to mention the many individual games that go on sale, especially online. So no matter what you’re looking for this year, chances are, you’ll find it. Find tons of amazing Amazon Black Friday deals this year!

Lifestyle 7 0 0 November 6, 2016 What’s Open On Veterans Day 2016 And Where Can Vets Get A Free Meal On Friday? Cheryl P Veterans Day is observed every year on November 11, and just like on other federal holidays, people are never quite sure what’s open and what’s closed on Friday. Although there are a number of federal offices and local business that will be closed, rest assured that restaurants will be open and many of them will be serving up a free or discounted meal to veterans. Whether you have the holiday off or you’re working, find information below about the holiday hours for banks, retail stores like Walmart and Target, and the U.S. Post Office, as a list of Veterans Day restaurant freebies and deals offered on a day that was created to honor those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Veterans Day [Image by Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images] According to International Business Times, all U.S. Post Office locations will be closed and there will be no mail delivery on Friday, but you’re in luck if you are expecting a package from UPS or FedEx — both delivery services will be open at regular business hours on Veterans Day. The Office of Veterans Affairs reports that it’s not mandatory for state offices to close on Veterans Day, but most federal offices will be closed. However, many states observe the federal holiday calendar, so expect your local Department of Human Services, Department of Motor Vehicles, public schools, and libraries to close for the day on November 11. Veterans Day is a bank holiday, so that means you may have to use the ATM or your mobile app to do your banking. However, there are a few banks that will be open on Friday, including TD Bank in the Northeast. It’s always a good idea to call ahead before you go or check your bank’s operating hours online. If you have shopping to do on Friday, most big box stores like Walmart, Target, and Kmart will be open, as well as most malls, supermarkets, and liquor stores. Veterans Day [Image by Win McNamee/Getty Images] Most chain restaurants and many local eateries will be open on Friday. Every year, restaurants across the nation are honor veterans as well as active members of the U.S. Military with free or discounted meals on Veterans Day, with some extending the offer throughout the weekend. Some restaurants will be offering a full breakfast, lunch, or dinner with a proper ID to say “thanks for your service.” Others will give a discount or free appetizers, desserts, or simply a free cup of coffee. We love to serve those who served us! All military eat FREE on Veteran's Day, Nov. 11th! #VeteransDay pic.twitter.com/xdhPlZAgMJ — Hooters (@Hooters) October 31, 2016 One thing is for sure — veterans can expect long lines for the freebies on Friday, but it’s worth the wait for some of the offers and it’s likely you will be in line with other veterans who would be more than happy to share their stories with you. Every year, the most popular Veterans Day free meals are offered by popular chains including Olive Garden, Applebee’s, TGI Fridays, Boston Market, Hooters, Golden Corral, and Cracker Barrel. Keep in mind, you’ll need a valid ID that indicates that you are a vet, although some restaurants will allow you to come in uniform to get your freebie. According to The Military Wallet, dozens of restaurants are participating this year and they’ve come up with a printable page of free meals and deals that may come in handy if you’re out and about looking to score a good meal for free — or at least a restaurant that offers a Veterans Day discount. Whether you’re in search of a quick breakfast or a complete meal, it won’t be hard to find a number of chain restaurants that will honor our nations’ veterans this Friday with a free Veterans Day meal.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, November 9, 2016 Updated: 6:10 AM, November 9, 2016 Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> was sued on Tuesday on behalf of consumers who said the world's largest retailer sold products falsely labeled "100 % Egyptian Cotton" from an Indian textile company for many years after it first became suspicious of their origin. According to the complaint, Wal-Mart questioned the fiber content of Welspun India Ltd's <WLSP.NS> products as early as 2008, but waited until two months ago to halt sales of its mislabeled Egyptian cotton bed linens, following a similar halt by Target Corp <TGT.N>. The plaintiff, Dorothy Monahan of Michigan, said she overpaid at a Wal-Mart for Better Homes and Gardens bed linens made by Welspun that she thought were made of Egyptian cotton, and therefore higher quality than cheaper bed linens. She accused Wal-Mart of violating U.S. laws governing textile fiber labeling and advertising, and is seeking damages for everyone who has bought bed linens at Wal-Mart made by Welspun and labeled "100% Egyptian Cotton." "We plan to vigorously defend the company," a Wal-Mart spokesman said. He said the retailer removed such products after conducting a comprehensive review nearly two months ago and since then has offered customers a full refund. A lawyer for Monahan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Monahan is represented by the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, whose specialties include product liability. Her complaint was filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Egyptian cotton typically commands premiums from shoppers because its long cotton fibers contribute to a finer, lighter, softer and more durable fabric. Although the United States and Australia produce more high-end cotton, the Egyptian product has retained its prestige because of the northeast African country's long history of growing it. Wal-Mart has also sold Welspun bed linen under the "Canopy" name, and in September called "unacceptable" the Indian company's inability to assure that its products were 100 percent Egyptian cotton. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer nonetheless decided to work with Welspun to improve quality control and labeling, rather than cut ties. Other U.S. retailers, including Bed Bath & Beyond Inc <BBBY.O> and J.C. Penney Co <JCP.N>, also began reviewing their ties to Welspun after Target's announcement. The case is Monahan v Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-08662.

(Source: WMBF News) NORTH MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - What was supposed to be a quick trip to Walmart for 49-year-old Raye Farrar took a tragic turn. An accident left his two children without a father and his deaf wife without a husband. “I thought he was gone for a bit too long, you know I'm texting him. You know, where are you? No answer.  Next thing I know I've got troopers on my front porch, and they're like 'Oh your husband was in an accident.' So I'm like 'Okay, which hospital? I'll go get him.' And they are like 'No, he's not coming home,'” Tina said in tears. Her children, Amy, who is 11 years old, and Michael who is 13 years old, heard Tina screaming. Tina says the motorcycle was nothing but a heap of metal, and the only thing to come out of the accident unscathed were Raye's riding boots. A grim thought for Tina: her son asked to go with him that night. “…he said no not this time Mike. And I thank God, I thank God. But if I lost both I would be catatonic right now. I mean I'm not in great shape losing him, but I would be a million times worse if I lost them both,” she said. Tina has to stomach driving by the crash scene every day, and passing the cross she placed there in Raye's memory, but she knows she has to stay strong for her children, something she's struggling with financially now that Raye is gone. “So it's, I pay this guy, and these guys say you're late paying, turns out it was due the day he died. So nobody knew about it nobody paid it,” she said. Though Raye was a veteran and served in the Navy, Tina says she is having trouble collecting benefits, and social security payment. “I tell people okay, he's deceased. 'Well okay we have to have the death certificate.' Well we won’t have those for another ten to twelve weeks, I'm told,” she said. Tina says the bills aren't the only things building up. “We’ve got a pile of condolence cards already just a stack high that I've got to respond to. But sitting down and writing out thank you notes, is another nail of finality that I haven't quite been able to approach yet, because when you write them, it makes it more real,” she cried. Tina, who is trying to put together pictures of the past for Raye's memorial service, is having the hardest time coping with the thought of him not being there in the future, especially when it comes to Amy and Michael. “He’ll be playing in jazz band and jazz performances this Friday, and Raye would have been there and Raye would have taken him to the football game to play the game, you know he would have been there for all her plays and musicals that she's in,” she said. As much as it pains her to ask for help, she knows she needs to for her children. Though she is trying not to break down, she admits she's still struggling with the fact things may only get harder before they get any easier and when she can, she still talks to her husband. “Sometimes to have my mini conversations with Raye, why didn't you take the car keys, why didn't you do this. To tell him how hard it is, to tell him that we need him,” she said tearfully. Right now there is a Go Fund me account set up for the Farrar Family. You can help by donating. https://www.gofundme.com/raye-farrar Raye’s memorial service is November 19th from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the Lee Funeral Home and Crematory.  Related Story: UPDATE: Victim in deadly North Myrtle Beach motorcycle crash...

Published Nov 7th, 2016 6:25 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas The future is here in terms of robotic applications used by Wal-Mart Stores, Tyson Foods, Baldor Electric Co. and other large Arkansas employers. But a shortage in robotic techs is holding back more automation, said Tomas Blodgett, director of operations for automation and robotics at Multi-craft Contractors in Springdale. Blodgett was one of five speakers to discuss workforce shortages in the trades at the Northwest Arkansas Workforce Summit held in Springdale on Monday (Nov. 7). More than 500 educators and business professionals attended the first of what will be a two-day session dedicated to workforce shortages in many trades. He said there are several companies that could expand their operations if they had the necessary workforce. A partnership between MCC, the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce, NorthWest Arkansas Community College and other industry players is launching a Robotics Training Center in early 2015 aimed at next generation competency training such as robotics technicians. The NWA Robotics Training Center, located in downtown Fayetteville in the former Chamber offices at 123 W. Mountain St., has a capacity of 48 students per month. “We are negotiating with two robotics manufacturers —Fanuc and ABB (parent company of Baldor Electric in Fort Smith) — to become a certified and accredited training center for their robot systems. It’s a one-week class and once a student graduates they are certified as a Fanuc or ABB robotic technician, which includes maintenance and operations. To get it the students must pass an academic test and a skills test,” said Fayetteville Chamber CEO Steve Clark. He said one of the robotic systems uses a camera and the technician must be able program the robot to recognize certain traits in items it can see with the camera. “We hope to be up and running in early in the first quarter. We did get a grant of $450,000 from the Department of Commerce … to purchase the eight robots that will be used in the training. These are robots like what is being used at Pace Industries and Superior Industries,” Clark told Talk Business & Politics. He said the Fayetteville Chamber got involved in this program because its employers need the help. “We have to think about automation in the 21st Century the same way we thought about what the computer chip did in the last century. The impact can be very similar. Automation can help companies with efficiencies which allows more time for future innovation. Our goal is to create a workforce than can help facilitate automation and also attract other businesses here,” Clark added. Blodgett said there is little to no similar training in the many areas of the United States – except in Michigan which moved to robotics in the auto industry in the 1980s. He said if this region can have an accredited training center it will not only help the local employers automate faster, but it will be a magnet for others to follow. Blodgett said there are about 2,000 industry robots now in use within a 100-mile radius of Springdale. He said one project MCC is working on would double that number almost instantly if the workforce was available to support the transition. MCC is involved in robotics because it sets up manufacturing robotic systems and sells robots and the set-up and servicing for the two major manufacturers, ABB and Fanuc. Blodgett said one of the visioning robots used at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Northwest Arkansas sorts pharmaceuticals by color, size or other characteristics which are programmed into the machine. It does the work of pharmacy technician. He said 15 years ago the machine would have cost about $80,000, but now is priced at $26,000. “We have secured one instructor for the robotics training center, but we still have one more to hire. The companies have been supportive of this program with the understanding that the first slots in the classes go to local manufacturers who have personnel to train. But anyone can apply for the training, understanding that local industry gets priority on the open slots. We hope to be able recruit nationally after a few months,” Clark said. Blodgett said the industry realizes the need for such training, but state and federal funding has lagged behind.

November 7, 2016 CBS MoneyWatch Subscribe Industry News Retail News Trends Walmart may soon find out whether it’s easy - or profitable - being green. The country’s biggest retailer is ramping up its environmental goals, noting that the plan is part of a “new era of trust and transparency.” The vow, which will be delivered by chief executive Doug McMillon at the environmentally focused Net Impact Conference in Philadelphia, includes doubling sales of locally grown produce and supporting the “human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain.” The green-focused goals come amid a changing consumer landscape, with the millennial generation now outranking baby boomers in numbers and projected to move into their prime spending years. Millennials are also considered more likely to pony up for environmentally sustainable products, while members of Generation Z - the demographic that’s younger than 20 - are willing to pay more to shop at companies that are committed to helping social and environmental causes, Nielsen found in a 2015 survey.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, November 8, 2016 CHICAGO - Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> is in talks with several mobile wallet companies to offer more payment options in its Wal-Mart Pay app, an executive at the world's largest retailer said, after signing up JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> last week. Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said on Thursday. Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card. Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964. "The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind," Eckert said. U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores. Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 U.S. stores. Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register. An e-receipt is sent to the app. Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month. He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay. Wal-Mart leads a consortium of U.S. retailers developing a mobile wallet app called CurrentC. The group, which includes Target Corp <TGT.N> and Best Buy Co Inc <BBY.N>, said earlier this year it would delay launching the app after the project hit several roadblocks.

Washington and Tyrus L. Williams Print Email Andy Hoag | ahoag@mlive.com By Andy Hoag | ahoag@mlive.com The Saginaw News Follow on Twitter on November 07, 2016 at 4:49 PM comments SAGINAW, MI — A man and a woman will serve probation time for the their roles in the theft of ammunition commonly used for an assault rifle. Circuit Judge Robert L. Kaczmarek on Monday, Nov. 7, sentenced Shauna S. Washington and Tyrus L. Williams for receiving and concealing stolen ammunition. Kaczmarek sentenced Washington, 24, and Williams, 22, to 18 months probation and two years probation, respectively. Washington and Williams pleaded guilty to the ammunition charge, which carries a maximum possible penalty of 10 years in prison. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped a charge of possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony, which carries a mandatory, consecutive two-year prison sentence. Kaczmarek sentenced Washington and Williams one week after he sentenced Manndrell D. Fuller to six years behind bars for the ammunition charge as well as single counts of possessing a firearm as a felon and possessing ammunition as a felon and three counts of felony firearm-second offense. Man gets 6 years for theft of rifle ammo at Walmart Fuller, 23, pleaded no contest as charged for the Oct. 29, 2015, incident that started at the Walmart on Brockway in Saginaw Township. After observing a vehicle matching the description of one involved in the theft of ammunition from the Walmart, Saginaw police performed a traffic stop on the vehicle, which contained all three defendants, according to testimony from their preliminary hearing. Officer Matthew Carpus testified he observed an SKS-style rifle and SKS-style magazine on the floor boards of the back seat. Officer Isaac Babinski said the magazine was "high capacity," which he defined as a rifle magazine that accepts more than 10 rounds. Carpus testified that after he was alerted by another officer, he observed a box in the area of the front-seat passenger. Inside the box was a box of 9mm Winchester ammunition and multiple 7.62 ammunition in a plastic shopping bag. The 7.62 ammunition also was Winchester, police said. If Washington and Williams violate the terms of their probation and received jail or prison sentences, they would receive credit for 77 days and 131 days, respectively. Because he was on parole at the time of the incident, Fuller did not receive any credit for time served. He was on parole for assault with intent to commit great bodily harm, which he committed by opening fire on an East Side Saginaw house in March 2011.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. “He said ‘ma’am are you pregnant,’ and I said ‘yes I am,’ and he said ‘you did not look pregnant five minutes ago,'” said Pautke. “He said, ‘I’m going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don’t have anything under your shirt.'” Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. Then when she proved she wasn’t hiding anything, she said that employee told her to have a good day.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit From the Magazine How Envy Replaced Greed as the Cardinal Sin of Our Time Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER From the Magazine How Envy Replaced Greed as the Cardinal Sin of Our Time Thanks to trickle-down economics and Wall Street, greed was widely celebrated at the end of the last century, but an even darker sin may define the 21st. It’s tough to put a positive spin on this one. by Michael KinsleyDecember 2016 Email Facebook Twitter Photo Illustration by Darrow. My computer printer, a bottom-of-the-line model I bought at Walmart for $69, is named “Envy.” This is its trade name, not some cute name that I gave it, as you might name a dog “Byte” or a major corporation “Google.” The logic of naming an office appliance after one of the seven deadly sins is not obvious, but it must have something to do with an effort to make computer printers seem sexy. This is marketing gone mad. Oh, the two or three endless seconds between the moment you hit “print” and the moment that reassuring churning sound starts may have elements of erotic tension and release. But in the end, you are not looking for love with your printer. The relationship you should want is mutual professional respect. A printer should also know its place. You push its buttons; it doesn’t push yours. Nor are you looking for love when you buy a Subaru, another company that wants its product to take on an aura of illicit romance. TV commercials to the contrary notwithstanding, “love” is not “what makes a Subaru a Subaru.” How much extra am I paying for my car to love me—and can I buy a Subaru without love and have a strictly platonic arrangement with my car? It should be optional, like doing without the special undercoating that the salesman tries to pressure you into buying after you think you have a deal. Video: The Evolution From Business Mogul to Presidential Candidate Cars have always been marketed with romance in mind. Among pieces of office equipment, the effort to make consumers covet thy neighbor’s printer seems especially futile. A computer or other high-tech gizmo can be made to seem glamorous if it is exceptionally small (or, perhaps, exceptionally large). But a printer? Unlike some of the other deadly sins—one thinks of sloth—a little bit of envy can be useful. In fact, as is also the case with lust, society could not function without it. (“What do you mean, darling?” says Arianna. “Sloth is tremendously useful. I get 10 hours of sloth every night. It is my favorite deadly sin. What? Oh yes, sleep is what I mean. I get 10 hours of sleep every night. But my mind is working away all that time. Read my new book, Sleepytime Girl. It’s all in there. I’d give you my own copy here, except that it’s signed by President Trump.”) Ronald Reagan once had some thoughts . . . and I’ll stop right there for a moment so you can catch your breath . . . about what he called “greed and envy.” It was January 1984, and he aimed his remarks at people who opposed his tax cuts. “There will be those,” he said, “trying to appeal to greed and envy. Make no mistake, that is what they’re trying to do. They suggest our tax program favors the rich. Well, this is the same anti-business, anti-success attitude that brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.” I especially like that “trying to.” It’s not really hard to appeal to greed and envy. We’ve all got some of that in us. Reagan’s tax program did favor the rich, of course. Reaganites somewhat more honest, or awake, than Reagan were happy to admit as much. “Trickle-down economics” was the unkind epithet for this scheme, but “greed and envy” wouldn’t have been a bad slogan, either. Greed and envy are not the same thing. Greed is “I want to be rich enough to buy that ugly plastic computer printer.” Envy is “If I can’t have one, I don’t want him to have one, either.” But both greed and envy played a role in supply-side economics, Reagan’s economic program. It was not just that, if rich people grew richer, a bit of that money would dribble down the economic ladder. It was that the rich themselves would be “incented” (a word that has risen in prominence in the decades since Reagan) to work harder, take greater risks, and so on. Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas) in Oliver Stone’s movie Wall Street put it succinctly: “Greed is good.” It didn’t work. That’s why we now have the huge deficit that both parties, for reasons of their own, have decided to dismiss or ignore. So that’s greed. But what about envy? It carries a decadent aroma that straight-on greed doesn’t. Greed’s purpose is to finance envy. Greed has you working overtime in order to buy that printer. Envy has you stealing it. Envy also can cover almost anything—you can envy a friend’s complexion or a rival’s reputation—while greed pretty much is restricted to money. Nevertheless, by tying greed and envy together, Reagan was making an important point—in the process of denouncing it. You need greed and envy to spur people to work hard. Are we a more envious society than we used to be when Reagan was more than just an airport? It seems like it. Opinion surveys are pretty clear in documenting rising levels of consumerist resentment toward people who “have more than they deserve.” Growing income inequality plays a role in this—tax cuts for the upper-income brackets really did contribute to this phenomenon (though they don’t explain everything). The way wealth is flaunted these days can only feed envy. Keeping up with the Joneses used to be about things that were within reach of ordinary middle-class citizens. That, I guess, was the useful form of envy. When Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous first appeared on TV, it had a cheesy quality to it that almost made you feel sorry for the celebrities it featured. People snorted. Now the real-estate ads in the weekend Wall Street Journal and Financial Times offer properties that no ordinary aspirational person could ever own. Unrequitable envy is no fun at all, but there’s always the flip side: inducing envy in others. This is a pastime for everyone, and one of the main uses of social media. Ordinary people once flaunted their lives in mass holiday mailings. With Facebook and Instagram these holiday letters can be posted every few minutes. “There are a lot of awful braggarts,” one Instagram user told The New York Times, “whose posts have a vibe of ‘Hey, you’re not invited to my awesome.’ ” Yes, envy is an engine, but one that starts to cough and wheeze as you move up the ladder of wealth and fame. I’m not advancing the familiar but possibly false idea that love is more important than money. But I am asserting that money and things become less and less important as you ascend the wealth scale and have more and more of each. There’s a limit to all the things you can buy, and another limit on how much pleasure you get from the next thing. That’s why so many billionaires keep working. At Microsoft, where I worked in the late 90s, the folks who had gotten there first and now had more money than Arianna were called “volunteers.” Supply-side economics does not explain why they get out of bed in the morning, let alone why they get out of bed, eat their granola, and bicycle to work. Why do they do it? It’s a mystery. I mean, the motivation can’t be that my printer has automatic sheet feed (which actually sounds like it belongs to lust, not envy) and yours doesn’t. No one is going to think less of you for it.

Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From NBC/Getty Images (Stewart). MARTIN SHKRELI The so-called “pharma-bro” created a national media frenzy when he hiked the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000 percent overnight in 2015, and continued to fan the flames by buying a $2 million single-copy Wu-Tang Clan album and picking fights with presidential candidates. In the midst of the firestorm, he also got arrested and charged with 8 counts of fraud after prosecutors accusing him of using a public drug company he ran as a personal piggybank to pay back investors whose money he lost at his now-defunct hedge funds. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Shkreli). BERNIE MADOFF The name Bernie Madoff has become synonymous with reprehensible greed after the Wall Street fraudster was caught stealing his victims’ fortunes to live like a king. Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison—the maximum for his crimes—after pleading guilty to 11 counts of myriad financial crimes related to a Ponzi scheme that swallowed up $10 billion of investors’ money. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Madoff). ALLEN STANFORD In the early 2000s, Allen Stanford was enjoying the spoils of a $7 billion Ponzi scheme—a knighthood awarded by Antigua, a handful of yachts, $2 billion to his name, and a cricket team of his very own. But the international fraud empire he built over the course of two decades, in which he offered phony high-interest certificates of deposit at a bank he started in Antigua, imploded. He was charged with 13 counts of wire and mail fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering and sentenced to 110 years in prison without parole. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Stanford). STEVE COHEN If he is not number one, Steve Cohen is pretty close to being considered the luckiest man on Wall Street. While federal investigators circled Cohen and his firm, S.A.C. Capital, for nearly a decade, only his employees were convicted of wrongdoing, while Cohen was never nailed. His firm pleaded guilty to insider trading and forker over a record $1.8 billion fine, but all Cohen got was a two-year ban on managing outside money—a most gentle slap on the wrist from the S.E.C. while he happily manages his family office and prepares for his next steps in the hedge fund world. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Cohen). RAJ RAJARATNAM Raj Rajaratnam was a frugal billionaire of sorts—opting to fly commercial and flouting the fancy art and high-end collectables that many of his fellow hedge fund managers favored. But he was also keen on skirting the law, a court found. Rajaratnam was charged with trading on inside information in 2009 and convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud in case considered to be one of the biggest prosecutorial wins in white collar criminal history. He is currently serving out his 11 years in the main prison at the Federal Medical Center at Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Rajaratnam). MICHAEL MILKEN That billionaire Michael Milken, the high-flying junk bond king of Beverly Hills, found himself sobbing in front of a courtroom in 1990 as he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, surely felt like a cruel twist of fate. That he ended up there because another convicted fraudster, Ivan Boesky, traded his name as part of his insider trading charges, surely felt even crueler. Milken was originally charged with 98 counts of racketeering, securities fraud, and mail fraud, though he pleaded guilty to just six counts of conspiracy and fraud related to illegal securities trading. He was ordered to pay $600 million in fines. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Milken). JEFFREY SKILLING Jeffrey Skilling was the chief executive of Enron when the energy-trading giant crumbled under the weight of its accounting schemes, which hid the scope of its financial woes and stripped billions of dollars from shareholders and employees. He was initially sentenced to 24 years in prison—a punishment that was later reduced to 14 years and a $42 fine. He reportedly spent his time behind bars tutoring in Spanish and reading the newspaper to a blind inmate each day. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Skilling). R. FOSTER WINANS A scheme that netted less than $1 million in profits and resulted in an 18-month jail sentence is hardly the sexiest on this list, but the transgression is perhaps the most unusual. Former Wall Street Jornal columnist R. Foster Winans admitted that in the early 1980s, he would slip Peter Brand information about a stock he would be featuring in his column, “Heard on the Street”—the contents of which would often move markets. Brant would make trades based on the early information, and Winans would receive a kickback in kind. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Winans). MATHEW MARTOMA Over the course of several days in July of 2008, Mathew Martoma sealed his fate. That was when the former S.A.C. Capital portfolio manager allegedly used inside information about a clinical trial for Alzheimer’s drugs to bring in a windfall for his firm. Martoma was one of about 85 individuals who were either convicted of or pleaded guilty in the ensuing investigation that rocked Wall Street, though Martoma’s 9-year sentence was on the harsher side. A judge ruled that he also had to forfeit nearly $9.5 million in bonuses he received while working at S.A.C. in 2008, including the Boca Raton home he bought for $2 million. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Martoma). SAGE KELLY By Wall Street standards, Sage Kelly had it all: a cushy, $7 million-a-year gig running Jefferies’s health-care investment-banking unit, a home in Sag Harbor, a growing family, and a group of buddies to pal around with. But it all came crashing down when his wife filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that they had engaged in a foursome with clients and that he would often take so many drugs that he would pee all over their home. Jefferies denied all of the allegations and Kelly’s wife later recanted the statements, but the banker found himself out of a job for two years. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Kelly). BRUNO IKSIL Bruno Iksil earned himself the moniker the “London Whale” for a $6.2 billion trading loss he made on J.P. Morgan’s ledger in 2012. The Frenchman, who contends that his risky trades were made at the behest of his superiors, avoided any sort of prosecution. But the bank was subject to government probes and $900 million in regulatory fines, and its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, took a 50 percent pay cut. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Iksil).

Why Wal-Mart will never pay employees as much as Costco The Motley Fool 11/7/2016 Jeremy Bowman Click to expand Replay Video 48.7 million Americans to travel this Thanksgiving AAA says 48.7 million Americans will be traveling this Thanksgiving. CNBC Facebook, Google enact new policies to fight fake news Two of the world’s biggest internet companies, Google and Facebook, are taking new steps to fight the rising tide of fake news. Conspiracy theories and misleading information from no-name sites masquerading as news exploded on their platforms during this campaign cycle. Both companies have come under fire for widely-shared fake news stories. Such stories spread false information about the candidates.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 151.15 -0.85 -0.56% After years of operating as a bare-bones retailer, paying employees the minimum wage or as little as possible, the company seems to have turned over a new leaf. CEO Doug McMillon, who took the helm in 2014, has invested billions in higher wages and training in order to bring stores up to modern standards and improve customer satisfaction. McMillon lifted the base wage to $9/hour in 2015 and again to $10/hour in February of this year. The moves seem to have paid off as same-store sales reached their fastest clip in years in the company's most recent report, increasing 1.6% in the second quarter. It's been a long time coming for Wal-Mart critics. For years, advocacy, worker, and union-backed groups like OUR Walmart have called on the retail giant to hike wages and improve workers' rights, eyeing a minimum of $15/hour. The United Food and Commercial Workers, a 1.3 million-strong union, has repeatedly tried to unionize the company's workers. However, Wal-Mart's recent efforts are causing some to see it in a different light.  This new strategy of paying workers better to improve company performance instead of minimizing all costs has caused some to draw comparisons with Costco Wholesale (COST), the membership-based warehouse retailer that has outgrown Wal-Mart for several years.  When it comes to labor relations, Costco may be the diametric opposite of Wal-Mart. It's a veritable darling of labor advocates, and has avoided all of the union fights that have sullied Wal-Mart's brand. The warehouse giant pays a minimum of $13/hour and many of its store-level employees make upwards of $20/hour. It regularly ranks as one of the best places to work, and it has an exceptionally low turnover rate for a retail business.  Costco's philosophy is pretty simple -- treat people well and they'll return the favor. The company believes it's more profitable in the long-term to pay people a decent wage because it minimizes turnover and maximizes productivity, commitment, and loyalty. Borrowing from Costco Paying its employees better and giving them more opportunities seems to be paying off for Wal-Mart, but those decisions didn't come cheap. Those two years of wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, which is the primary reason why earnings per share are down this year and expected to remain flat next year. Wal-Mart and Costco have very different operating models. As a no-frills warehouse operation, Costco displays its goods on pallets, meaning it does not need employees to stock shelves as Wal-Mart does. The buy-in-bulk nature of Costco also means it needs fewer cashiers as a percentage of sales as the average amount its customers spend is much higher, and the help-yourself nature of shopping there means there are hardly employees on the floor to assist you.  As a result, Costco is much more efficient with its use of labor, meaning it can afford to pay its employees less.  Costco's revenue per employee, a popular way of measuring labor efficiency, is nearly three times that of Wal-Mart, as the chart below shows. © Provided by Fool WMT Revenue Per Employee (Annual) Chart That explains why it can pay its hourly workers about 50% more than Wal-Mart, since even with that gap its overall labor costs are still less. According to a study by the UC Berkley Center for Labor Research, if Wal-Mart were to accede to labor activists' demands and pay a base wage of $15/hour, it would cost the company an additional $4.95 billion a year. That study was performed at the request of advocacy group OUR Walmart, so the actual number could be even higher, but a $5 billion increase in expenses would cut more than a third off of Wal-Mart's profit, a sacrifice shareholders would be unlikely to tolerate. Wal-Mart and other retailers have raised wages as the labor market has tightened, making hiring good employees more competitive. But continuing wage hikes would have diminishing marginal returns, as there is little need for the company to offer a starting wage that's at least 50% better than that of the average retailer. On the question of higher wages, Wal-Mart simply doesn't have the leverage that Costco does through its warehouse business model to pay average employees around $20/hour. The two companies' diverging pay scales may be due in part to strategic choices, but mostly they're a reflection of their much different business models.

Baucom apologized for the delay and said he’s been taking extra care of his mother who has been gravely ill over the past few weeks. We know it’s late in the campaign season to be publishing a candidate profile, but we didn’t provide Mr. Baucom with a deadline to respond, so we’re posting his answers now. A former Walmart manager is one of two candidates to challenge Mayor Lioneld Jordan in the 2016 general election, along with local developer Tom Terminella. Baucom, 59, currently works part-time at MailCo USA while caring for his 89-year-old mother. Baucom said his Christian faith guided his decision to run for mayor, and said that he believes Fayetteville is “in serious trouble” because of poor decisions made by the current administration. He criticized the planning of the new regional park in southwest Fayetteville, and said he believes the infrastructure will not be able to handle the kind of traffic and attendance the park will attract. Baucom noted Jordan’s absence from a Nov. 2 event held on the University of Arkansas campus. The event was first announced on Oct. 27 as a mayoral forum hosted by the Fayetteville High School Young Democrats and Young Republicans. Baucom and Terminella agreed to participate, but Jordan told club representatives he already had commitments and wouldn’t be able to change his plans with such short notice. Jordan offered to send a representative, Stephen Smith, in his place. The club initially agreed to allow Smith to make opening and closing remarks, but later told Smith the other candidates were not comfortable with a representative speaking for Jordan. Smith criticized the handling of the event in a Facebook post where he provided a timeline of his exchanges with the students. “Needless to say, I am disappointed that I will not have the opportunity to represent Mayor Jordan in the “forum” or even be allowed to give opening and closing remarks,” Smith wrote. “It will surely be ‘fair and balanced.'” Two hours before the event was set to begin, a club representative sent a press release to the media stating that the forum had been cancelled because all three candidates couldn’t attend. Videos posted to Facebook later that evening showed Baucom and Terminella participating in what appeared to be a mayoral forum inside the same room where the original event was scheduled in the UA’s Agriculture, Food and Life Sciences Building. During the event, both candidates made opening statements and answered questions submitted by high school students. A club representative later told the Flyer that the high school was not associated with the event that took place. Baucom later accused Jordan and Smith of “bullying” the club and said they owed the students an apology. Early voting continues through 5 p.m. at the Washington County Courthouse in Fayetteville. Election Day polls open at 7:30 a.m. on Nov. 8 at over 40 locations in Washington County. Profile: Ron Baucom Position sought: Mayor Age: 59 Residency: Lived in Fayetteville entire life Employment: Former Walmart employee Education: B.A. Business Administration (double majors in Accounting and Finance), University of Arkansas Political Experience: None Questions What made you decide to run for mayor? Is it something you’ve been considering for a while? I was born and raised in south Fayetteville. I have seen what previous politicians have claimed as advancements and changes for the city. It is not a whole city approach. I want to make those changes. Most of our city has not been able to enjoy the amenities that are being promoted. Yes, I have thought about this for quite some time, and my Christian faith has guided me in this direction at this point and time in my life. I believe that our country and our city are in serious trouble, and a big part of that is due to the poor choices of our leaders. With the region’s recent growth, what keeps you in Fayetteville? How would you describe the city today? The growth that has been referenced is not near what it needs to be. We need to bring in businesses that will help with living wages and employment. Our median household income in Fayetteville is $37,350. That is below the state averages of a little over $41,000 and the national averages of over $54,000. Our state is only ranked 49th out of 50 and we are still below the state average. 25.2 percent of the population for whom poverty status is determined in Fayetteville live below the poverty line, which is higher than the national average of 15.5 percent. Over 13 percent of our citizens live on a household income of less than $10,000 per year and that figure is probably much higher because we don’t have an accurate count of our very large and growing homeless community. I have not seen the changes that are constantly being promoted and marketed. The folks that are bragging about our prosperity are the ones that are at top of the hill. I want to see a whole city improvement. Are there any recent city administrative decisions you agree or disagree with? If so, please explain. Our new regional park was very poorly planned. There is only one lane in and out. There is a serious problem with getting emergency personnel in and out to treat injured children or adults. The administration’s answer to this is that it will be addressed in future phases. The water tables were not properly studied and a lot of the fields are on a flood plain. Numerous soccer games were cancelled while they were still held at the Lewis facilities. The soccer fields are too small. There are parking and bathroom facility issues. They want to hold regional and national events there but as evidenced by Bikes and Blues, we have a lack of enough lodging in Fayetteville and lose a lot of tax revenues because they have to go to other cities to stay. Our present leaders have created large tax burdens on our city, that could have been prevented with proper analysis, prioritization, and resources. Our present mayor and his designated representative Stephen Smith should publicly apologize and be held accountable for their actions last week in their treatment of the Fayetteville High School Young Democrats/ Young Republicans forum and their undue influence and bullying that encouraged the high school to cancel the event for the students less than two hours before it was to begin is inexcusable! They can bash me all they want, but to discourage our future leaders is a disgrace!! Fortunately, the College Democrats/ Republicans picked it up and the forum was still held. But of course the Fayetteville High School students were told not to attend and Mr. Jordan, of course did not attend.

Lifestyle 7 0 0 November 6, 2016 What’s Open On Veterans Day 2016 And Where Can Vets Get A Free Meal On Friday? Cheryl P Veterans Day is observed every year on November 11, and just like on other federal holidays, people are never quite sure what’s open and what’s closed on Friday. Although there are a number of federal offices and local business that will be closed, rest assured that restaurants will be open and many of them will be serving up a free or discounted meal to veterans. Whether you have the holiday off or you’re working, find information below about the holiday hours for banks, retail stores like Walmart and Target, and the U.S. Post Office, as a list of Veterans Day restaurant freebies and deals offered on a day that was created to honor those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Veterans Day [Image by Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images] According to International Business Times, all U.S. Post Office locations will be closed and there will be no mail delivery on Friday, but you’re in luck if you are expecting a package from UPS or FedEx — both delivery services will be open at regular business hours on Veterans Day. The Office of Veterans Affairs reports that it’s not mandatory for state offices to close on Veterans Day, but most federal offices will be closed. However, many states observe the federal holiday calendar, so expect your local Department of Human Services, Department of Motor Vehicles, public schools, and libraries to close for the day on November 11. Veterans Day is a bank holiday, so that means you may have to use the ATM or your mobile app to do your banking. However, there are a few banks that will be open on Friday, including TD Bank in the Northeast. It’s always a good idea to call ahead before you go or check your bank’s operating hours online. If you have shopping to do on Friday, most big box stores like Walmart, Target, and Kmart will be open, as well as most malls, supermarkets, and liquor stores. Veterans Day [Image by Win McNamee/Getty Images] Most chain restaurants and many local eateries will be open on Friday. Every year, restaurants across the nation are honor veterans as well as active members of the U.S. Military with free or discounted meals on Veterans Day, with some extending the offer throughout the weekend. Some restaurants will be offering a full breakfast, lunch, or dinner with a proper ID to say “thanks for your service.” Others will give a discount or free appetizers, desserts, or simply a free cup of coffee. We love to serve those who served us! All military eat FREE on Veteran's Day, Nov. 11th! #VeteransDay pic.twitter.com/xdhPlZAgMJ — Hooters (@Hooters) October 31, 2016 One thing is for sure — veterans can expect long lines for the freebies on Friday, but it’s worth the wait for some of the offers and it’s likely you will be in line with other veterans who would be more than happy to share their stories with you. Every year, the most popular Veterans Day free meals are offered by popular chains including Olive Garden, Applebee’s, TGI Fridays, Boston Market, Hooters, Golden Corral, and Cracker Barrel. Keep in mind, you’ll need a valid ID that indicates that you are a vet, although some restaurants will allow you to come in uniform to get your freebie. According to The Military Wallet, dozens of restaurants are participating this year and they’ve come up with a printable page of free meals and deals that may come in handy if you’re out and about looking to score a good meal for free — or at least a restaurant that offers a Veterans Day discount. Whether you’re in search of a quick breakfast or a complete meal, it won’t be hard to find a number of chain restaurants that will honor our nations’ veterans this Friday with a free Veterans Day meal.

Despite strong circulars from Kohl’s, JCPenney, Sam’s Club, Costco, and BJ’s, the largest retailers — notably Walmart, Best Buy, and Target — have all been quiet. While they still may hold out a few more days, it is likely all of their ads will be leaked by Friday. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the recently released circulars from Staples, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Michaels. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. 2016 Staples Black Friday Ad [Image by Staples] Leaked on November 6, the 15-page Staples Black Friday ad features an assortment of desktop computers, laptops, printers, monitors, office furniture, and accessories. Staples will be closed on Thanksgiving this year, which is a policy that they implemented in 2015. Regardless, their online store will remain open on Turkey Day, and shoppers can make purchases and pick their order up anytime on Black Friday. Here are a few important facts about the sale. Doors Open at 6 a.m. on Friday Limit 1 Item Per Customer for Top Doorbusters HP Laptop wit Intel Core i5 Processor for $389.99 (save $250) HP Laptop with Intel Pentium Processor for $229.99 (save $190) HP Laptop with Intel Core i3 Processor for $299.99 (save $170) 5 Percent Back in Rewards on Everything Free Shipping for Orders over $14.99 You can see the entire 15-page Staples Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. 2016 Bed Bath and Beyond Black Friday Ad [Image via Bed Bath & Beyond] Leaked on November 5, the 2-page Bed Bath & Beyond Black Friday ad only has a few deals this year. This is nothing new for them, as their ad last year was only a single page. Thanksgiving hours are going to depend on your specific location, but doors open on Black Friday at 6 a.m. Here are a few important facts about the sale. 20 Percent off Your Entire Purchase (Friday Only) Select Dyson Vacuums & Heater for up to $200 Off Save $30 on Keurig K55 Elite You can see the entire two-page Bed Bath & Beyond Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. 2016 Michaels Black Friday Ad [Image via Michaels] Leaked on November 6, the 14-page Michaels Black Friday ad has an assortment of holiday-related items to get your home ready for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The sale begins early online on Thanksgiving at 4 a.m. EST. Retail stores will be open from 6 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving. On Black Friday, they will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. They are also extending the sale through Saturday, and they will be open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Here are a few important facts about the sale. 30 Percent off Your Entire Purchase on Thanksgiving with Code: THANKS1 30 Percent off Your Entire Purchase on Black Friday with Code: THANKS4 40 Percent off All Regular Price Purchase on Black Friday from Noon to 10 p.m. with Code: THANKS3 25 Percent off Entire Purchase on Saturday from 8 a.m. to Noon with Code: THANKS6 50 Percent off Any One Item on Saturday from Noon to 10 p.m. with Code: THANKS7 You can see the entire 14-page Michaels Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Update While the Walmart ad has not yet leaked, there is strong evidence that it will be released by the end of this upcoming week. Here are the dates over the past few years that Walmart’s ad has been released. 2012 – November 8 2013 – November 11 2014 – November 11 2015 – November 11 This upcoming week covers all of those dates, so Walmart’s ad should be out by Friday, November 11. Since Black Friday is earlier this year, November 25 compared to November 27 last year, it is unlikely Walmart would push their ad release back another week. Additionally, Walmart has already warned BestBlackFriday.com to not post their ad early. Traditionally, this notice comes a few days before the actual ad is going to be released, so it should be here soon. Expect it to come in the very early morning hours on November 10, with the possibility of it being pushed back to a little after midnight on November 11. As a reminder, Walmart’s website is currently hosting an “Early Bird” Pre-Black Friday sale, but you are better off waiting until Thanksgiving or Black Friday for the best deals.

Shocking moment a man ‘is robbed while he has a seizure’ at busy supermarket – but not all is what it seems Footage shows crowd of shoppers standing back as brazen 'thief' walks away with wallet By NEAL BAKER 8th November 2016, 10:57 pm THIS is the shocking moment a brazen thief steals the wallet of a man having a seizure — but not all is what it seems. The footage, shot at a busy Walmart supermarket in Philadelphia, shows a man collapsing in front of shoppers before a passerby appears to rob him. Not known 3 ‘Theft’ … Supposed pickpocket can be seen bending over to take seizure victim’s wallet as crowds look on Not known 3 Wallet thief coolly walks away from his ‘victim’ while shoppers stand by idly But the incident is a set-up designed to test how people react to a blatant crime — and the result is shocking. Not one person intervenes to stop the ‘thief’ as he coolly walks out of the shop having just pick-pocketed the apparent victim. The shocking stunt has raised questions over the public’s ability to turn a blind eye to crime.

As he leaves the store shouts increase in volume, but still no one stands in his way. The footage was uploaded to YouTube by user Chris Mendez who posts prank clips filmed in the Philadelphia area. “What happened afterwards [was] they screamed at us for playing around and we just left”, he said describing the stunt.

Last year sweet potato pies with the music legend’s face on the box sold out in a flash at Walmart thanks to a viral video review, leading LaBelle to expand the line with cakes. (Sadly, they are not called Patti Cakes.) Now, LaBelle’s onto the natural next phase of her lifestyle branding: a cooking show. The Cooking Channel has ordered six half-hour episodes of her new series Patti LaBelle’s Place, set to debut next month. LaBelle will enlist a healthy roster of celebrity guest stars — 50 Cent! Oprah’s BFF Gayle King! Carla Hall! — to help her whip up homey-sounding dishes, many of which boast her name in the title (think Patti’s Southern-Style Fried Corn and Patti’s Secret Homemade Salad Dressing, which will presumably no longer be a secret once it’s broadcast on national television). Her new cooking show debuts December 3 with two back-to-back episodes. For posterity’s sake, here’s that video review of the “Lady Marmalade” singer’s sweet potato pie, which has racked up more than 5 million views (if she’s lucky, maybe he’ll also review her new show): More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos Supported By The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Internet Crazies Think This DC Pizzeria Is the Center of a Clinton Sex Ring The 2016 Eater Gift Guide Vivian Howard Can’t Swear on TV This Article has a component height of 7.

Most of the changes referred to outmoded permit and related fees that were set by law years ago. Now, planning and zoning board members will have the ability to update them as needed rather than going through a more protracted legal process. One other change will give the zoning administrator the power to act concerning commercial vehicles that may be improperly parked in residential areas and yet another expanded the permitted use of light industrial zoning to include towing and vehicle storage. The last was to make laws regarding the advertising of beer and liquor conform to each other. Aldermen had wanted to prohibit such advertising inside a building that was visible from the outside and now that is true for both beer and light wine, and wine and spirits. Building inspector and zoning administrator Eric Thomas reported a good month with about $10,000 received in permit fees. He said John Ellis and Mrs. Richard Hamric had asked the board for permission to rezone adjoining lots at 202 and 204 Oxford Rd. from R-2 residential to C-2 commercial. This is on the edge of the area popoulated by medical-related offices behind the hospital. The planning and zoning board approved so a public hearing needs to be set before final approval by aldermen. The hearing will be at the next aldermen’s meeting in December. It appears the city will be adding to its inventory of speed tables and three-way stops. Aldermen agreed to install speed tables on Eastview after a request by 32 families living in the area because of the danger of speeding drivers to young children playing. This brought up discussion about a possible need for similar speed tables on Oxford Road behind Wal-Mart, and on Cleveland Street. Some aldermen expressed concern about a “snowball effect” in adding more and more speed control devices. “Now, everybody will be wanting one,” one board member said. Aldermen agreed the first choice was to try to increase police enforcement of speed limits before adding too many speed tables. In another traffic-related matter, the status of efforts to have a traffic light installed at the intersection of Hwy. 30 West and Starlyn Drive is unchanged, Mayor Tim Kent said. Transportation officials say a light is justified but they have no money for it. Alderman Johnny Anderson asked how much a light would cost and whether the city could install one, but estimates were in the $200,000 range including lights, poles and arms. Nothing new also was reported concerning repairing the rough railroad crossing on Glenfield Road, with Mayor Kent saying he had not heard back from railroad officials. There was also nothing new to report on the possibility of replacing the wooden railroad trestle where it passes over Snyder Street. Mayor Kent said he hopes work will be completed so Main Street can be opened in the next few days. Aldermen approved paying Paul Smithey $65,964.32 and $67,371.75 plus ESI engineers $8,852.90 toward the project. The money comes from a Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks grant and was used to cover Camp Creek Branch after installing large culverts and placing a concrete trail access path over it. Also included was the work now going on to place a large box culvert under Main Street beneath the Tanglefoot Trail bridge intended to end street flooding in the even of heavy rains. In department business: • Police Chief Chris Robertson asked for permission to apply for the FY ’18 DUI grant from the department of public safety. “We have got it for the past seven or eight years,” he told the board, adding that the grant helps pay for a full-time DUI officer plus overtime and extra enforcement during high-risk periods such as holidays. • Robertson also asked for and received permission to sell two abandoned vehicles. He said the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia were seized on I-22 and driven by undocumented aliens, who were turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. A 120-day waiting period was required before the vehicles can be sold and Robertson said no one has tried to claim them. Officers have been unable to contact anyone who might have filed a claim. • Light, gas and water manager Bill Mattox told the board that he needed to “beef up” the Butler Street substation and needs a new circuit breaker. Because the cost is expected to be more than $50,000, Mattox will need to advertise for bids. He said the breaker was included in the department budget. • Union County Development Association Executive Director Phil Nanney reported on the CREATE Foundation’s “Imagine the Possibilities” career fair held at the BancorpSouth Arena where more than 7,000 area eighth-graders were given hands-on exposure to 17 career paths encompassing many more different occupations. He said a career planning event was held especially for kindergarten students at the fairgrounds here recently as well. Nanney reported on use of the civic center for an Imperial Trading training meeting and told aldermen that the sale of 30 acres in the Martintown Industrial Park to the PUL Alliance had been completed. This is the land that will be used for the solar energy farm. • Assistant Fire Chief Mark Whiteside received permission to advertise for a hiring pool for the fire department. He said they do this once a year so that if an opening occurs they have qualified replacements waiting. Among agenda items: • Aldermen approved the October claims docket and minutes for the Oct. 4 and 17 meetings. • They elected Mayor Tim Kent to represent the city on the Three Rivers Solid Waste Authority board, which he has been serving on in the past. • Aldermen amended the budget to allow purchase of Bush-Hog for the street department. The item was inadvertently left out of the budget. • Aldermen approved a freeport tax exemption for Emerald Home Furnishings, which county supervisors had already approved as well. The exemption is on personal property that was not manufactured in the state or intended for sale here, but rather just being stored here on a temporary basis before reshipping. • The board voted to put a new roof on the community center, which has been experiencing leaks. The nearly 70-year-old building remains in frequent use. • Aldermen approve 10-year ad valorem tax exemptions for Albany Industries, Emerald King’s Creek, VIP Cinema, a second earlier year for VIP Cinema, Diversity Vuteq and Sugarees Bakery. • Before adjourning the board met in executive session concerning a personnel matter but Mayor Kent said they took no action.

Jo of Lake County last month received a call that she'd won $2.5 million through the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes. All that she need to do is send $295 to cover the taxes. So she arranged a wire transfer. Then when the gentleman called back the next day, he said he needed $995 more. She asked why he couldn't take the taxes out of her winnings, but agreed to wire transfer the additional $995. It wasn't until he called the third time and demanded $5,000 more that Jo got a really bad feeling. She talked to one of her children. She then called Publishers Clearing House and was told she'd been scammed. In fact, there's been a surge of Northeast Ohio residents who've been suckered by the exact same scam, according to Sue McConnell, president of the Better Business Bureau in Cleveland. Jo, who didn't want her full name used, said she's embarrassed that she fell for the ripoff. On one hand, she does actually buy merchandise from Publishers Clearing House, so she thought she might have won a jackpot. And, she said, the guy "was very convincing." On the other hand, the person who called asked her to do the wire transfer through Walmart. That's not the way taxes are normally paid. Publishers Clearing House told Jo to call the police and the BBB and, if the guy called again, to tell him she wouldn't be sending any more money. He called repeatedly over a period of days and she didn't cave. But she worried the thief might hunt her down at her home, if he knew where she lived. "I was never so scared in my life," she said. McConnell of the BBB said the tales of loss from consumers, who typically are senior citizens, are heart-breaking. "Not a day goes by here when we don't get a call about a phony sweepstakes," McConnell said. These sorts of scams have been around for years. Some involve people posing as IRS agents who calls someone and says the person owes back taxes. Some involve thieves who hack into someone's computer and convince the person the computer has a virus but can be fixed on the spot -- for a fee of perhaps $300. Other thieves call someone and pose as a grandchild who's in trouble and needs money wired immediately. "It often seems like this is old news," McConnell said. "But to someone, this is new. People find (these pitches) to be very believable." McConnell notes that many senior citizens don't report suspected incidents to authorities because either they're embarrassed or they're afraid of losing their financial independence if a relative finds out what happened. Senior citizens are particularly vulnerable to these sorts of ripoffs, McConnell said, because many don't have a lot of social contact and many are reluctant to end a suspicious phone call. "They feel it's rude and nasty and they don't want to just hang up on people." Back in Lake County, Jo wishes she had done something different. She realizes it's unlikely she'll get her $1,200 back. The mechanism she used, Walmart-2-Walmart funds, allows customers to send money that the recipient can pick up at any Walmart store nationwide. In the case of Publishers Clearing House, it should be noted that the company doesn't announce sweepstakes winners by phone and doesn't require any form of payment to receive winnings. For more information about the PCH scam, go to: http://info.pch.com/consumer-information/fraud-protection The BBB offers this advice to detect scams: You can't win a contest you didn't enter. It is illegal to require the payment of any sort of fee or the purchase of any item before getting sweepstakes winnings. If you get a call, letter or email that you won a prize, always ask a friend, a relative or your local BBB office to gut-check the information and sniff out a scam before you take any action.  Never, ever provide personal information, including your Social Security number, bank account number, credit card account number, date of birth or anything else, to a stranger over the phone or online. If you have older relatives or anyone you think may be vulnerable to such a scam, tell them about this Publishers Clearing House scam and other possible efforts to steal their money or con them into revealing personal information.  Check with the BBB at bbb.org/cleveland or call the BBB at 216-241-7678. Report the scam to bbb.org/scamtracker.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Ainsworth Pet Nutrition Donates to Shelter Impacted by Hurricane Matthew PITTSBURGH, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, a manufacturer of Pure Balance® – Walmart’s private brand of super premium pet food – announced today that it will donate more than 260,000 meals of Pure Balance dog food to Saving Animals from Euthanasia (S.A.F.E.) Pet Rescue of St. Augustine, Florida, which was impacted by Hurricane Matthew. S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue is comprised of three adoption centers, two in St. Augustine, and one in Hollister, Florida, located roughly 60 miles southwest St. Augustine.  As Hurricane Matthew approached the Florida coast, S.A.F.E. was forced to evacuate more than 150 dogs and cats to their Hollister location, which was already housing approximately 75 animals.  Despite a lack of electricity and air conditioning and a tense and crowded environment, the organization was able to keep all of their animals safe and dry during the storm, however, the financial impact will be felt for some time. “During times of emergency, keeping our animals safe is always our top priority, however this commitment doesn’t come without cost,” said Robin Kantner Nordan, Founder, S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue.  “The cost of transport, emergency and veterinary fees and 24-hour staffing during the storm were significant.  This generous donation from Ainsworth Pet Nutrition will ease the financial burden of feeding the 195 dogs in our care for quite some time.  We are very grateful.” “At Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, our commitment to helping animals in need goes beyond doing what’s right, it is engrained in who we are as an organization,” said Steve Joyce, Vice President of Marketing for Ainsworth Pet Nutrition.  “When we heard about S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue and what they had been through during Hurricane Matthew, we knew we needed to do something to help.  We are so happy that this donation will be beneficial to the shelter and the animals in their care.” Pure Balance super-premium food for dogs and cats is available exclusively at Walmart.  Each recipe is designed without any corn, wheat or soy and is prepared with carefully selected ingredients like real chicken, carrots, peas, and flaxseed.  Made with natural ingredients with added vitamins and minerals, Pure Balance makes premium pet nutrition available to Walmart shoppers without a special trip to the pet store. The donation will be delivered to the S.A.F.E. Pet Rescue within the next week.  ABOUT AINSWORTH PET NUTRITION Founded in 1933, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition is a fifth generation, primarily family-owned and operated company headquartered in Western Pennsylvania and focused entirely on pets.  With a goal of changing the way consumers shop for Super Premium pet food, Ainsworth’s mantra is “Pet Store Quality.  Supermarket Easy.” They achieve this promise by providing consumers with the high-quality pet food where they currently shop for the rest of their families.  The company makes multiple brands and types of dog and cat food, including the Rachael Ray™ Nutrish® line, as well as Super Premium retailer specific brands.  Ainsworth Pet Nutrition is committed to food safety and prepares all of its dry pet food in the United States using high-quality, natural ingredients with added vitamins and minerals.  To learn more, visit www.ainsworthpets.com.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Fiat Chrysler Plans To Stick With Big Cars Until 2020 Posted: Nov 8 2016, 1:16pm CST | by M. Affan, in News | Cars & Vehicles   FCA’s Large Vehicles are here to stay till at least 2020   The LX based RWD cars extended till the end of current decade The famous and bog Dodge Challenger and Dodge Charger are here to stay with us for the next coming four years. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles have recently made the decision to stick with producing these big cars. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com It was rumored earlier on that these cars will be discontinued soon, however according to the news by Automotive News, these cars are here to stay till at least 2020, according to Automotive News. The information was provided by two unnamed sources who had this inside information and confirmed the details of Fiat’s new contract with Unifor which is Canada’s auto union for labors. The company is planning to refresh the Challenger, and Charger both along with 300 until these vehicles are switched to FCA’s new Giorgio Platform in the future. The Giorgio platform is actually used by Alfa Romeo Giulia and is currently in its use. It is supposed to make way in three new and large American vehicle in the year 2021 as well. It also predicted that FCA will either discontinue Charger or 300 as per these changes in the year 2021.  If we are looking to bid farewell to any vehicle among these three then it’s most likely to be 300. The platform of 300 which is based on LX will be almost 15 years old in the year 2020. Thus it will be the best choice for the company to move forward and to introduce a new one at its place. The Charger was switched from LX platform to LD platform in 2010. On the other hand Challenger was also switched from LC platform to LA platform recently. It is only 300 which was not given any update. Thus we are hoping to see Challenger and Charger in a way after 2020.  You May Like The Author M. Affan M.

But this scenario has played out in our nation’s history before. In 1824, John Quincy Adams was elected president despite not winning either the popular vote or the electoral vote. Andrew Jackson was the winner in both categories. Jackson received 38,000 more popular votes than Adams, and beat him in the electoral vote 99 to 84. Despite his victories, Jackson didn’t reach the majority 131 votes needed in the Electoral College to be declared president. In fact, neither candidate did. The decision went to the House of Representatives, which voted Adams into the White House. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes won the election (by a margin of one electoral vote), but he lost the popular vote by more than 250,000 ballots to Samuel J. Tilden. In 1888, Benjamin Harrison received 233 electoral votes to Grover Cleveland’s 168, winning the presidency. But Harrison lost the popular vote by more than 90,000 votes. In 2000, George W. Bush was declared the winner of the general election and became the 43rd president, but he didn’t win the popular vote either. Al Gore holds that distinction, garnering about 540,000 more votes than Bush. However, Bush won the electoral vote, 271 to 266.

Buzz60 Through a window, voters could be seen casting their general election ballot at the John F. Kennedy High School polling site in Tamuning, Guam, on Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (Photo: Rick Cruz, (Guam) Pacific Daily News) 26187 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 207 COMMENTEMAILMORE HAGÅTÑA, Guam — Hillary Clinton has overwhelmingly won the vote on the tiny U.S. island of Guam. The territory, located west of the international date line, is 15 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and bills itself as “Where America’s Day Begins.” With 32,071 voters casting ballots, Democrat Clinton received 71.6% of the vote. Republican Donald Trump received 24.2%, and Socialist candidate Emidio Soltysik — the only third-party candidate on the ballot — received  4.2%. Although all voters here are American citizens, their votes in the presidential race do not count because Guam has no representation in the Electoral College. Unlike U.S. citizens who live in foreign countries, Guam residents are not allowed to vote absentee from the states. USA TODAY Trump takes 32-25 lead in New Hampshire after midnight voting While the result of the Guam election has no bearing on the national election, it may be an indicator of how the rest of the country will vote. Residents here have correctly chosen the winner of each presidential race since 1980, when the first straw poll for president was conducted. Most recently: • In 2012, President Obama received 72.4% in the straw poll vs. 26.5% for Republican Mitt Romney. • In 2008, Obama won the island 57.3% to 34% for the GOP nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. • In 2004, incumbent President George W. Bush won 64% to 35.1% for Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic nominee. The predictive ability of the island was upset in 1996 when an Election Day typhoon delayed voting. America already had selected Bill Clinton as president before islanders went to the polls. Guam had almost 52,000 registered voters as of Nov. 1, according to the Guam Election Commission.

By Holly Cook Roeland Park city council members on Monday heard recommendations to improve traffic flow in the section of Roe Boulevard from W. 48th Street to W. 52nd Street. CVS, Walmart, Price Chopper and Walgreens are among the business located along this .4 mile stretch of Roe Boulevard that contains five traffic signals. FROM OUR SPONSORS: The traffic study recommended removing signals at Bella Roe Plaza/Walgreen’s and Roe Boulevard and at W. 52nd Street and Roe Boulevard. Removing and redirecting through and left-turn movement on from the east and west legs of the Bella Roe Plaza/Walgreen’s intersection was also recommended. Following these changes the remaining three traffic signals would need timing updates and improvements. Approximately 34,875 people travel through the Roe Boulevard corridor each day. The proposed changes are expected to decrease the total amount of stops for vehicles during peak hours by 450 and save 10.7 hours in total travel time. The report, conducted by engineering firm Shafer, Kline, and Warren, is meant to be incorporated into the larger discussion to rebuild Roe Boulevard in 2020. Director of Public Works Jose Leon said the most frequent complaint he hears is that there are too many traffic signals on Roe Boulevard. Leon said the traffic study was “long overdue.” City Administrator Keith Moody also said the city has received significant feedback on the amount of time it takes to use Roe Boulevard as a commuter route. Moody said he expected the recommendations would spur community discussions. “We realize this is something that will be political,” he said. Engineer Cheryl Bornheimer said the traffic signal at W. 52nd Street was initially meant to facilitate an easier entrance and exit for large trucks but that the report found the light was mostly being used by passenger cars. Councilmember Michael Rhoades asked if the traffic signals being removed could be repurposed for the redevelopment plan at Roeland Park’s old pool site. City staff responded that could be discussed. The traffic lights targeted for removal are owned by KCP&L and the city may need to pay a fine to have them removed since they were placed so recently, Moody said. Councilmember Teresa Kelly said she would like councilors to consider all types of transportation, including biking and walking, when discussing Roe Boulevard improvements. Monday’s presentation was solely for informational purposes. City staff said the next step is to initiate determining the scope and cost of the recommendations.

The building was evacuated as a precaution and people remained outside as of 9:30 a.m., authorities said. Officials were awaiting the arrival of gas company representatives.

I asked my 13-year old son last night how he thought the election would go. His answer: Bad — somebody is going to win. Of all the things this election will impact, I wonder if apathy levels of a future generation of voters are among them. Oh well, at least I have local news about two of the most American of foods: pizza and burritos. Spin! Pizza has announced it will open the doors of its new west Lawrence location on Monday. (Is it appropriate I have news of a restaurant called Spin! on election day?) We have reported on the restaurant several times. It will open in a new commercial building just east of the Wal-Mart near Sixth and Wakarusa. It will be next door to another new establishment, the Blue Moose Bar & Grill. Spin! got its start in Kansas City, and the menu was developed by Michael Smith, a James Beard award winning chef. Pizza, of course, is the featured item of the menu, but it also includes antipasti (not to be confused with antipasta, which is a position that is sure to hurt you in every poll), fresh soups, sandwiches and some Green Party creation called “salads.” The dessert menu also features something called creamy “piccolo” gelato, which is my second favorite kind of gelato. (Creamy tuba gelato is my favorite.) In case you are curious, I think piccolo refers to the 4 oz serving size. As for the pizza, it is Neapolitan style, which means a thin crust. The restaurant, however, isn’t thin on toppings to put atop the crust. In addition to all your standard pizza toppings, the menu also includes items like shrimp scampi, goat cheese, arugula, glazed pecans, pesto, and even fig marmalade, for when you get that craving. Lawrence’s Spin! will be owned by area businessman Brent Boles. He has decided to have the restaurant participate in a program called Token for your Kindness. The program involves giving elementary school teachers and coaches tokens that they can then give out to students who they see are doing something kind. Each token can be redeemed for a mini pizza and gelato. “We have made it our mission to help generate kindness in Lawrence,” Boles said in a release. “With this in mind, we decided to start in our classrooms and on the playing field/court.” • I also have burrito news. Qdoba opened its Lawrence restaurant on Monday. As we have reported, the restaurant is located just west of 23rd and Ousdahl in the spot that formerly housed a Kwik Shop. It is the only Lawrence restaurant for the chain, although it once briefly operated in downtown Lawrence. Remember where? It is where Ingredient is now located, which of course, serves thin crusts pizza, sandwiches, salads and soups. (The food universe works in mysterious ways — and, in the process, usually ruins three of my ties a week with pizza sauce or salsa.) As for Qdoba, I assume most of you already are familiar with the chain. It is similar to Chipoltle, but has a broader menu. In addition to the Mexican wraps and bowls, it also has tacos, nachos, quesdillas, and soups and salads served in crispy bowls you can eat. The new Qdoba restaurant on 23rd Street in Lawrence. by Chad Lawhorn Print Comment E-mail to a friend Facebook Tweet LinkedIn StumbleUpon Google + Tumblr Wordpress Reddit Copy and paste the link: Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

By Jan Miller November 7, 2016 6:48 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Photo: Jan Miller, Lonestar 99.5 FM You can show your support for Veterans this Veteran’s Day when you turn on a green light. The initiative, which you can learn more about at Greenlightavet.com, asks people to “change one light in a visible location in your home or office to green, and keep it glowing every day as a symbol of support and appreciation for our veterans.” There are stories from across the country of sold out shelves of green light bulbs, so I went out to investigate. Most of our local Walmarts still have plenty of green light bulbs in stock. Food King’s Ace Hardware said they had sold out, but were expecting to have green light bulbs in on Wednesday. At Home Depot, they only have a few left and the man who helped me said he was a veteran and had just learned of the initiative. I was glad for the opportunity to talk to him about the Green Light a Vet project and thanked him for his service. If you know of any other places that are selling green light bulbs, please let us know in the comments or on our Facebook page. Greenlightavet.com also gives us more ways to show our support by sharing the #greenlightavet hashtag, by green lighting our profile picture and by mapping our location so veterans everywhere can see how many of us are thankful for their service. This is such a great way to show our support,  It’s simple but powerful and imagine how great it will be when little by little we have more green lights up for these incredible men and women. Our Veterans have made an extreme sacrifice and deserve all the show of support we can offer.

During the previous election his company saw sales double. This time it's triple. "We have everyone we can on the phones," he said. "We are overwhelmed." Purchases at other long term food supply companies are up as well. Emergency preparedness online store TheEpicenter reports a 6 percent uptick in year over year sales. Another company, Legacy Foods, predicts they'll see a 1-2 week spike in sales after the election, if Hillary Clinton wins, said owner Phil Cox. The meals, sold by the plastic bucket or tote bin, are typically dehydrated or freeze-dried food in sealed military-grade Mylar packs. Menu items include pasta primavera, Hawaiian Style Sweet n' Sour, cheesy broccoli and rice soup, orange energy drink mix and chocolate pudding. They're sold in bundles based on how long they'll feed you. Big name retailers are in on the game. Costco sells a 1-month supply of 390 servings in plastic gallon buckets for $114.99. Wal-Mart has a bucket deal, too. What's feeding this new urgency? Survivalist consumers says they're preparing for post-election unrest that could involve everything from massive riots, to power grid outages, to the total collapse of the financial system where a can of food becomes currency. And it's not just guys digging a hole on their farm and filling it with MRE's who are driving sales, companies say, but schoolteachers, moms, and successful financial planners. Nor is it limited to just rural areas. "Frederick Reddie," a 41-year-old "urban prepper" from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is stocking up on staples like rice and peanut butter and working on expanding his 6-month supply of emergency food to two years. He has to use a pseudonym to protect his supply from any future hungry neighbors, he told NBC News. Reddie predicts a Trump win that has the urban poor revolting across the nation and the imposition of martial law to quell riots and the burning of businesses. But he's also getting ready for the possibility of a Clinton victory that he says could lead to conflict with Russia and "World War 3 in 2017." Either way, Freddy's ready, with both supplies and a word of advice. "At minimum stock up your cabinets as if you knew a hurricane was coming," he said. "It'll be like a hurricane that could touch every city in America." The companies take pains to point out that they sell food not just for the collapse of civilization but also for camping, outdoor recreation, and natural disaster preparedness, like Ebola or volcanoes. Their customers are careful, self-sufficient and pragmatic types, they say, students of history who know things like stock market bubbles and crashes go in cycles and are taking small, meaningful steps, to reassert control over a toxic election. They're always thinking ahead. Cans of food that last 25 years are "better than money in the bank," said Nelson. "If you think the value of money is going to go down, then you could convert dollars into something tangible that you can use later" for either eating or barter. Bansemer said that his customers don't necessarily fear a specific election outcome, but change itself. "You hear them saying, no matter who wins, I know I could take a positive step myself and secure what's important," he said. "They're securing their food supply."         LATEST STORIES (4) Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation Battle for Mosul Day 29: Iraqi Forces Only 3km from Mosul Airport Kurdish Fighters Seize over 550 sq/km of Raqqa from ISIL Iraqi Police Confirm Liberation of Entire Area South of Mosul City Iraq: ISIL Hits Nineveh's Al-Qayyara Town with Chemical Missiles Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win 17 Arrested Protesting at US Senator's Office Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul TEHRAN (FNA)- The Iraqi volunteer forces in a statement announced that Hashd al-Shaabi continued its advances further on the second day of the third phase of the military operations in areas to the West of Mosul.

Photo by Cristina M. Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com NEW YORK • Thanksgiving Day shopping — a delight to some, anathema to others — isn’t going away, but some stores are rethinking their strategies on whether it makes sense to be open on the holiday itself. Many of the nation’s major mall operators and the big retailers that anchor them, such as Toys R Us, J.C. Penney and Macy’s, are sticking with what they want to be a new tradition, kicking off the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving Day. Big-box retailers Walmart, Target and Best Buy also plan to open on the holiday. Others, including the Mall of America, the nation’s largest shopping mall, are closing for Thanksgiving this year after being open for the past several years. Some retailers that are closing cite respect for the holiday, but in truth the cost of being open may be more than the return. “Once you let the genie out of the bottle, it’s hard,” said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, a mall operator that is closing 72 of its malls, including four in the St. Louis area, for the day. “More retailers are coming to their senses and realizing it is a family holiday and from a business point of view, it’s not making much business sense.” Stores being open on Thanksgiving started in earnest in 2011 and took a punch out of sales on Black Friday, which had usually launched the shopping season. Many places like Macy’s, Target and J.C. Penney have been opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving as they try to outdo others to get first dibs on customers who could easily buy online. But the move has been controversial, as many workers have voiced complaints that stores are putting profits over workers’ time to be with their families. Some 89 of the 145 properties that Chattanooga, Tenn.-based CBL owns or has interest in opened at 6 p.m. on the holiday last year. Though dozens of those will be closed this year, the department stores, movie theaters, restaurants and retailers with exterior entrances have the option to open on Thanksgiving. Other retailers, including Office Depot and consumer electronics chain hhgregg Inc., plan to be closed after being open for the past several years. Plenty of retailers, particularly high-end stores such as Nordstrom or those such as T.J. Maxx that offer discounts every day, never opened on Thanksgiving and have collected goodwill because of that. In reality, analysts say, it’s all about stealing share in a market that isn’t growing that much. For department stores, the competition is fierce. Last year, J.C. Penney opened at 3 p.m. for the first time, three hours earlier than its rivals Kohl’s and Macy’s. That may have hurt Macy’s, which had a weak holiday season and aims to reverse a sales slump. This year, Macy’s decided to open an hour earlier at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Penney is sticking to 3 p.m., while Kohl’s will be opening again at 6 p.m. Most Sears stores will be open on Thanksgiving for the fourth year in a row, starting at 6 p.m. — the same as a year ago. Best Buy, the nation’s largest consumer electronics chain, suffered over Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 because it didn’t open until midnight, while stores such as Walmart and Target began their sales earlier in the evening. This year, most Best Buy stores will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Walmart and Target will kick off in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving again this year. Both chains said their online Black Friday sales would start in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. For many big retailers, covering expenses such as paying employees holiday pay is not that costly, said Joel Bines, a managing director at retail consulting group AlixPartners. But for small stores or those with specialized merchandise, it may make more sense to close. AlixPartners also found that some retailers who did open on Thanksgiving were simply pulling Friday sales a day earlier and their profit margins took a hit. Bob Riesbeck, president and CEO of hhgregg, says business on Thanksgiving actually declined over the previous two years when it opened at 4 p.m. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis CBL’s Lebovitz says when he surveyed stores in the company’s malls this year before deciding to close, the reaction was “overwhelmingly positive,” particularly with the specialty stores. The big anchors plan to stay open. Last year, the reaction was different. Most of the specialty stores wanted to be open. “They didn’t have enough data” to make the decision, he said. Andy Mantis, executive vice president of NPD Group Checkout Tracking, says stores should open on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday to maximize their sales. The company, which analyzes receipt data to understand consumer behavior, found that the share of buyers who shopped on both days declined, while the number who shopped only on Thanksgiving Day or on Black Friday increased. Mantis believes specialty retailers, especially those near big stores such as Macy’s that are open, should think again about whether to stay closed. “It is a heavy promotion time,” Mantis said. “People are buying, and they’re not always willing to go to multiple stores.” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

That title is now held by California, or Massachusetts, or New York, or even Washington. But recently, funding, professional support, and office space for entrepreneurs have been springing up all over the state — for those who know where to find them. Universities are helping to lead the way. A number of New Jersey universities are seeing it as part of their role to encourage business incubation. For instance, Anne-Marie Maman, executive director of the year-old Princeton Entrepreneurship Council, says her organization provides tools and training to foster entrepreneurs and an entrepreneurial mindset. University commitment from the very top has been proceeding at a rapid pace unusual for higher education. Support for students, faculty, and alumni includes tech space at the Princeton Entrepreneurship Hub, technology licensing opportunities, and an open-ended venture fund. Next year PEC will open an Innovation Center — offering wet labs (for pharma), dry labs (for electrical engineering), as well as co-working space to support faculty members, students, alumni, and the local community. Further north at Montclair State University, former Verizon President and CEO Dennis Bone leads the Feliciano Center for Entrepreneurship. According to Bone, entrepreneurial thinking is an essential survival skill for anyone in this world of rapid change — identifying problems that need fixing and collaborating on solutions. The Feliciano Center hosts many seminars and workshops open to the general public for learning and networking. They focus on all aspects of entrepreneurship. Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken last August opened the Stevens Venture Center to provide workspace, prototype lab, and networking opportunities for Stevens-affiliated entrepreneurs. It’s housed in the same waterfront building directly across from New York City as Jet.com, the e-commerce startup Walmart acquired for $3 billion in September. In the model of Silicon Valley (infused with talent from Stanford University) or the Route 128 corridor of Cambridge (with proximity to MIT), the idea is to create a culture that sparks innovation and creates jobs by connecting like-minded people to resources. Tech entrepreneur Aaron Price launched Propeller last May as a way to bring New York and New Jersey innovation communities and funders together on Hoboken’s Pier A. Some of the more visible efforts to link business innovation to a supporting ecosystem are happening in downtown Newark — where Amazon-owned Audible is pouring financial and intellectual capital into attracting and mentoring businesses to bring jobs and economic revival to the city. (A comprehensive list of resources has been compiled by the NJIT Innovation Acceleration Center.) Over in Holmdel, the legendary Bell Labs space (the length of three football fields) is being reborn as BellWorks, and private developers are creating a self-contained environment to work, play, and innovate. New Jersey’s future economic vitality is linked to entrepreneurial innovation, coordinating and leveraging resources, noted Michele Siekerka, president and CEO of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, at its recent Innovation Summit at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. “New Jersey was the Innovation State. New Jersey is the Innovation State,” she said. “Collaboration between industry, academia, and government is essential.” Elsewhere throughout the state NJIT, Rutgers, Rowan, and Seton Hall are expanding support of entrepreneurship and see it as a way to attract the best and brightest while preparing these students to thrive in the “gig economy.” The New Jersey Business Incubation Network offers a community of experts and facilities (many affiliated with community colleges) for both early-stage and expansion-stage startups. Despite all the activity, not everyone is impressed. David Sorin, partner in McCarter & English, LLP, says New York universities are running circles around their New Jersey counterparts by providing real funding for students to start real businesses. It’s the logical evolution of “career services” when a clearcut path no longer exists to graduate, join an established corporation, and enjoy a safe and steady lifetime career. Rowan started a $5 million innovation fund in 2014. Rutgers Business School is part of Newark Venture Partners, which will soon take applications to fund a second round of companies. Kathleen Coviello, director of technology and life sciences for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, says the 500th angel investment has been approved since the state established the angel investment tax credit three years ago. (Entrepreneurs can follow this link to apply for NJEDA funding.) NJEDA also operates an incubator in North Brunswick for life sciences companies that can’t build labs on their own and offers tax credits through the Grow NJ assistance program. Katherine O’Neill, executive director of the JumpStart New Jersey Angel Network, says more than $50 million has been invested since 2002 in Mid-Atlantic region companies — close to half in New Jersey. JumpStart angels typically invest between $200,000 and $500,000 but only if there’s value to add in the form of introductions, category expertise, or other ways to accelerate growth. (Follow this link for more information on how to apply.) Investors are looking for businesses whose owners show an open mind and the ability to iterate quickly and have a team with a track record of success. Jim Gunton, general partner at the NJTC Venture Fund, recommends persistence. A rejection today can turn into success tomorrow. What’s the best way to connect with an investor? Personal introductions from accountants and attorneys who know your business are key to opening doors. NJBIA Innovation Summit keynote Bob Hugin, executive chairman of Summit-based pharmaceutical company Celgene Corp., says it took 17 years for the company to become profitable and New Jersey tax law allowing the sale of losses kept it in the game. Today, Celgene’s market capitalization is $80 billion. Laurie Petersen is a writer, editor, and event organizer based in Hoboken. Click here for reuse options!

Great Bend Post Great Bend News, Opinion, Video Local News Sports Events Entertainment Other Trading Post Obituaries Great Bend Eats Ernie’s Bar & Grill Granny’s Kitchen Kiowa Kitchen Lone Wolf Restaurant Playa Azul The Rack Billiard Cafe Employment Wall After much debate, Great Bend chooses to add more income-based housing November 7, 2016 by Cole Reif 7 Comments The Great Bend City Council determined the push for new housing development outweighed the concerns of a few landlords, and passed a Rural Housing Incentive District for phase two of The Reserves at Trail Ridge near Walmart. The RHID awards tax credits to the developer, Overland Property Group, for building new housing in rural areas from the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation. Matt Gillam, Vice President of Development for the developer based out of Leawood, told the city council Monday night that the RHID is needed to bring the additional 48 units to towns like Great Bend. Matt Gillam Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/reserve-gillam.mp3 At the October 3 meeting, council member Mike Zinn brought up the point that the current 48-unit apartment complex that opened in August of 2015 has seen more than its fair share of criminal activity. Great Bend Police Chief Cliff Couch says over the past year his department has received 163 calls for cases involving civil issues, domestic violence, and arrest warrants. Couch also noted that this activity is not unfamiliar with income-restricted housing. Cliff Couch Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/reserve-couch.mp3 The Reserves at Trail Ridge noted they currently have 11 vacancies but that was mostly due to chosen evictions and hope to have the troublesome residents removed. Great Bend Housing Authority High Rise and many other property owners like Jason Mayers from MPIRE Property Management mentioned an increase in rental vacancies since the apartment complex on Grant Street opened. High Rise Executive Director Lynn Fleming went on to say there was no need for more income-based housing in town. Despite more criticism from a crowd member, Mayor Mike Allison said the housing development can make Great Bend become a more viable city for future business. Mike Allison Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/reserve-allison.mp3 The Great Bend City Council approved the RHID with a 6-2 vote. Council members Zinn and Brock McPherson voted against the motion. Share this: Google Twitter Email Facebook Filed Under: Featured, Local Comments Retcol says November 8, 2016 at 2:12 am Wrong, wrong and wrong. This article totally missed the point. This wasn’t a matter of allowing apartments into town…..it was a matter of giving them an incentive by the city to come to town via no property taxes for years and years. This project is already funded federally. So now, even though local landlords are struggling, and the police department is tapped out we’re going to let this property not pay Hundreds of thousands of dollars like everyone else does. The city father’s that passed this are ignorant and disgusting. Mike Allison admits that Great Bend is not growing and therefore won’t be able to fill these new apartments but yet pushes to pass this because he and the others idiots aren’t smart enough to know any better. They’d rather believe some greasy salesman from out of town rather than listen to the police Chief or local business people. Real positive growth, morons.

However they do have a right to charge as they wish. Just like people have a right to go elsewhere and leave them without renters. They made the bed that they lay in. And as for taxes, are people and businesses not taxed enough? I’m taxed every time I turn around. Police are paid to respond. That is what they do. If they don’t like it, quit.

Report this comment Reply charlieshorse says November 8, 2016 at 2:15 pm Since when has our current leadership been the benchmark of forward, progressive thinking? We have a ceremonial mayor who has been in office since Noah was a baby, city administrators who arrived on the Mayflower, and a self-serving city council looking after their own interests. (Always has been, most likely always will be!) Our thinking has been spoiled by the easy way…. reliance on energy production and agriculture to support the “retail/housing” economy of Great Bend, but those days are numbered…and nobody sees this. As long as retail and real estate (both of which are a seller’s market in GB, as there is little or no competition) are doing well, our leaders happily wear their rose-colored glasses. Very little interest has been shown in promoting long-term growth of our community…the city has NEVER wined and dined businesses interested in coming to GB (case in point, the proposed Cessna assembly plant now in Independence, Ks.), as much as they have the housing industry, as illustrated by the breaks they have given to “Reserves at Trail Ridge”, Amber Meadows, as well as Stoneridge. More income adjusted housing is great! This will provide an opportunity for all of the fast-food employees to have a decent home! Here’s an idea…how about bringing in some businesses that will provide decent wage paying employment, so more folks are here to eat in our fast-food, cookie-cutter eating joints, shop at Wal-mart, and live in our already overpriced real estate? The better the wage these businesses pay, the more $$ being returned into the general economy. Leave the GBCOC and Jan Peters out of this…they are non-entities. Hello, Ace! I’m still here.

The Ole Bus Stop Diner is the only restaurant in the tiny Appalachian town of Booneville that is still open for business. The others have long since closed down. Tucked between the tree-specked mountains in southeastern Kentucky, Booneville is the seat of Owsley County, an almost uniformly white community and one of the most food stamp-dependent counties in the United States. "Mind your own biscuits and it's all gravy," reads a wooden decorative sign on the wall. "It's my kitchen and I'll fry if I want to," says another. On the adjacent wall hangs a wooden plaque glorifying the constitution's Second Amendment - the one that guarantees the right to bear arms - along with a US flag and the silhouette of a rifle-toting soldier. READ MORE: White Lives Matter - A new US hate group shows its face Kayla Reed, a 22-year-old waitress at the diner and mother of a two-year-old son, says there are few opportunities for young people in Owsley County. "There's not much you can do around here," she says. "There's not really many jobs." Reed, who completed two years of university courses before returning to work after having her child, hopes to go back to school and leave Booneville . "I don't plan on raising my son here … I would rather my kid get a better education,"she says. Many young people search for work in larger cities such as Lexington or Richmond, both of which are more than an hour's drive away, Kayla explains. "I don't think [the presidential elections] make much of a difference. I'll be glad when it's over." The US Census Bureau estimated last year that Owsley county's 4,461-person population is more than 98 percent white. According to Al Jazeera's analysis of US census data, it is the nation's poorest white-majority county in terms of annual median household income. At 10.4 percent last year, the county's unemployment rate in 2015 was nearly twice as much as the national average of 5.25 percent. Worse still, Owsley county's median household income of $19,146 was just over a third of the national median income of $55,775 in 2015. More than 45 percent of Owsley county's population lives below the government-designated poverty line, including 56.3 percent of children and more than a third of those over 65. According to recent data available from the US government, more than half of personal income came from governmental monetary benefits in 2009, and at least 52 percent of the county's residents received food stamps in 2011. The Ole Bus Stop Diner is the epicentre of public life in Booneville, where Owsley county's administrative offices are located. Dozens of locals pass through the diner every hour. Some sit for a while, drinking coffee with friends; others pop in to pick up their takeaway orders. READ MORE: The US homeless camps offering a lesson in democracy A heavy set, grey-bearded man in a baseball cap, denim jacket and blue jeans saunters to the register. "Got any money with you today, boss?" the cashier asks him. "Naw," he replies. "All right boss," she says and writes his name on a pad. Across from the diner is the county court, the nucleus of the town's tiny square. Down the road a single-screen cinema, closed for more than two decades, sits in disrepair. Beyond its busted-out windows there is just darkness. Dead weeds are twined around a blank sign in the parking lot. A group of old men in baseball caps and button-up plaid shirts sit outside the courthouse, smoking their cigarettes in silence. One of them has a pistol holstered to the belt loop of his jeans. His arm rests on a walker. More than 45 percent of Owsley county's population lives below the poverty line, including 56.3 percent of children and more than a third of those over 65  [Shaghayegh Tajvidi/Al Jazeera] Lowell Morris: 'It was easier being poor back then' As is the case in many rural areas of Appalachia, poverty here is as old as the county itself. Hidden in the rough, mountainous terrain and without a railroad, the county didn't develop like many of those around it. The population of Owsley County peaked at 8,957 in 1940, according to US Decennial Census data. But mass migration from Appalachia as people left in search of work after World War II and the ongoing trickle of young people out of the region to find jobs in urban centres left the population at less than half of that. Sixty-eight-year-old Lowell Morris was born and raised in Booneville. He wears denim overalls and work boots every day and only occasionally removes his camouflage hat with its bent, blue peak and the word "Kentucky" on it. A pair of glasses sits slightly slanted on his face, a beard covers the bottom half of it. He dropped out of high school in the tenth grade so that he could work to support his grandparents, who had raised him. With his opportunities limited to working in tobacco fields, his income was meagre. Money was scarce, but life was manageable, he says. Though they lived in a small wooden shack, Lowell remembers how, on Saturdays, there wouldn't be an empty parking space in the town square and the eateries would be bustling with life. READ MORE: Life in the colonias of Texas Back then, during morning drives along the snaking hillside roads, Lowell would see bountiful tobacco farms. As he made his way out of town to a neighbouring county, he would pass dozens of coal trucks on their way to and from the mines that tunnelled through the hills. Being poor was easier in the 1950s and early 1960s, he says, because the community would band together to help those who were in need. "You didn't go to the mailbox to get a cheque," Lowell says, referring to government welfare benefits. "You didn't go to a mailbox to get food stamps. Everything came from the garden … Everybody grew what they ate." Lowell, who worked as a school security guard and volunteer deputy sheriff for more than three decades, has never married. For most of his adult life, he has taken care of his two disabled sisters. On a walk through downtown Booneville, he points out deserted businesses, a closed down barber's shop and the Hometown Cafe, empty save for a few tables and chairs and masses of dust. "None of these places could survive when Walmart came to neighbouring counties in the 80s and 90s," he says sadly. "We used to have some good times down here, I tell you what." Starting in the 1960s and 1970s, many men found work in the coal mines of neighbouring counties. But Owsley's own mines were smaller, less abundant and unable to bring in comparable revenue for the county's development. READ MORE: 'In America, rich people get richer and poor people like us get poorer' Today the tobacco fields are deserted and have grown into unruly backcountry, with towering weeds and tangled brush blanketing the land. They have been left to the elements by their former owners and money-strapped county authorities. In recent years, the closure of coal mines across the Appalachian region has left residents with ever fewer job options. On the routes out of Booneville, a handful of roads leading to old coal mining sites are sealed with padlocked gates. Smoke billows from the chimneys of old wooden homes and trailers, disappearing into the mist that clouds the town's streets and hovers above the fields. The memories of a better past haunt Owsley County, and its abandoned homes and drooping barns are testament to the incremental collapse taking place in low-income communities across eastern Kentucky. Lowell Morris, 68, was born and raised in Booneville  [Shaghayegh Tajvidi/Al Jazeera] The Mayor of Booneville: 'We're in some bad times' Ninety-seven-year-old Mayor Charles Long sits in a recliner in the living room of his two-storey, antebellum-era home in downtown Booneville. He has held office uncontested for the past 58 years. "I think we're in some bad times. They keep sayin' we're in good times, but Lord I tell you what," says Charles, who is wearing a maroon hat that reads Booneville Mayor.  "I don't know - the jobs just aren't here." The mayor mentions an industrial building erected more than a decade ago. A host of prospective tenants never materialised, and no new businesses have set up shop in years. The building sits empty. READ MORE: The US homeless camps offering a lesson in democracy "Well, when the kids get through school here usually they had to go to Ohio or Indiana to find work," Charles adds. Pictures of Booneville throughout history and of his relatives, past and present, cover the wood-planked living room walls. "There ain't nothin' here." Although a Republican, he says he doesn't plan on voting because he has little faith in Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to take care of small-town communities like Booneville. "I wish a good Christian man was running," he says. The mayor's proudest achievement came in the late 1960s, when the county was able to expand water and sewage services to homes outside of the town's municipal limits. Mayor Charles Long, 99, has held office uncontested for the past 58 years  [Shaghayegh Tajvidi/Al Jazeera] Katie Bennett: 'The grown-ups can do without food more than the kids' When President Lyndon B Johnson announced the signing of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 he was making permanent a pilot programme that had run for the previous three years. He said the programme "[would] be one of our most valuable weapons for the war on poverty". More than 50 years later, many residents of Booneville remain dependent on food stamps. [Food stamps] don't last the whole month. It really does [scare] me. I raise my kids alone since they been born. It's harder for a parent to do anything now Katie Bennet  A few kilometres outside of town, Katie Bennett, a 30-year-old single mother of three, sits on the porch of the Baptist Church near the hollow where she lives in a rundown trailer. Her three-year-old daughter Theresa rests in her lap, alternating between fiddling with a tiny pair of pink-rimmed, flower-printed sunglasses and taking swigs from a plastic bottle of Mountain Dew. Bennett is one of the 52 percent of Owsley County residents who rely on welfare and food stamps to survive, drawing $649 a month to feed her children and herself. Without a car or an education, she has been unable to land a job and cannot easily make it to town to search for work. Like others with no opportunities and little hope, she has struggled to put enough food on the table for her children as food stamps have been cut time and again in recent years. Single mothers, she says, feel the cuts more than anyone else. In February 2014, President Barack Obama signed into law $8.7bn in cuts to the food stamp programme, resulting in an average monthly loss of $90 for upwards of 850,000 homes across the country. "[Food stamps] don't last the whole month. It really does [scare] me. I raise my kids alone since they been born. It's harder for a parent to do anything now." The food stamps last "probably till the middle of each month", Katie says. For the rest of the month, she relies on the goodwill of neighbours and relatives to feed her daughter and two sons. Often faced with choosing between feeding herself or her children, Katie frequently goes to bed hungry. "The grown-ups can do without [food] more than kids. I love my kids; I want the best for my kids,"she concludes. READ MORE: Life on the Pine Ridge Native American reservation Nothing improves for her or the others like her after the elections, she says before heading off into the hollow and along the gravel path that leads to her trailer home. Although neither Clinton nor Trump have threatened to do away with the food stamps programme, the Republican and Democratic parties share a long history of making deep cuts to it. In Booneville, people are bracing themselves for more. Single mother of three, Katie Bennett, says food stamps only last until the middle of the month [Shaghayegh Tajvidi/Al Jazeera] Hayes Smith: 'People will starve to death if food stamps are cut' Hayes Smith, 54, stands in the driveway of his small wooden home, which shares a lot with a crumbling shack and a deserted trailer home. Surviving on $2,000 of disability benefits, received because of a back injury he suffered while working in a nursing home, he explains that "people would starve to death" if food stamps were cut entirely. Talking over the barking of two dogs chained to rusty old cars in his front garden, he explains that he used to receive food stamps. Although he plans to vote for Trump, Hayes says: "That's a shame we just got them two people to vote for. Hillary's a snake in the grass and Trump probably is too. In eight years, things will be the same here or even worse. I can see each month go by and it gets a little worse here." Against the bleak backdrop of job losses, institutional inattention, developmental neglect and negative stereotyping, many locals are openly resentful of the federal government and distrustful of outsiders and the media. Owsley County voted an overwhelming 80.9 percent Republican during the 2012 presidential elections. But many residents of the poverty-ridden county say they feel abandoned by both parties. Della and Carl Noble: 'Whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, there's no jobs' Carl Noble, a 69-year-old retiree, sits on a rocking chair on his porch watching the occasional car pass along the country road that leads from Booneville to neighbouring Breathitt County, where he worked in the coal mines for 26 years. He speaks softly, almost mumbling, and his sentences are punctuated with a wheezing sound caused by black lung disease - the result of inhaling coal dust for two-and-a-half decades. He gets up, walks cautiously towards the screen door and then disappears inside. A few moments later he is back on the rocking chair with a Pepsi in his hand. In 1996, Carl had to leave his job to have open heart surgery. Unable to work afterwards, he spent two years hopping through bureaucratic hoops to get governmental compensation for his lung condition and disability benefits. The things that Hillary and Donald stand for is just not something I like. One's no better than the other Della Today his only income is a little above $2,000 in government disability benefits. "I'm voting for the young generation. I'm voting for my grandchildren," he says. Carl's father died when he was 11 years old. With his mother receiving a monthly welfare cheque of $160 to support Carl and his 14 brothers and sisters, he dropped out of school in the eighth grade and went to Chicago to find work. Reflecting on not being able to complete his studies, he says: "Free education - I'm for it. You're in one of the poorest counties, well, in the United States." Carl was a supporter of Donald Trump until the recent media uproar over the sexist comments the Republican presidential hopeful has made. Now he plans to vote for Clinton. Although his wife, Della, says she hasn't yet decided how she'll vote, she echoes many of her husband's sentiments. She recalls how her son was unable to find a job in Owsley County after graduating from university. He spent years working in West Virginia before moving back to Booneville and finding a job in Lexington, an hour's drive away. "I would love to see [young people] have opportunities to stay in the mountains and stay with their families and see the county grow, to see our future here. It doesn't look right now," Della says. "The things that Hillary and Donald stand for is just not something I like. One's no better than the other," she adds. "There's no difference. Whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, there's no jobs." Like many residents of Booneville, Della resents depictions of low-income communities in the Appalachian region as lazy and uneducated. "People here are not respected in the way they need to be. We're looked at like backwoods people who don't know anything, but that's not right. There's good people here," she says. "The stereotype of people in the mountains in not true. I see people that want to work," she says, explaining that people don't want to be dependent on food stamps and welfare. Eric Kerl: 'Hillbillies, racist illiterates and sexual deviants' Eric Kerl is an editorial board member of the International Socialist Review Journal and a writer who focuses on the Appalachian region. He argues that mainstream media depictions of white poverty, particularly in Appalachia, is laden with sweeping stereotypes and "poor-bashing" generalisations. The phenomenon has a long history in popular culture and media coverage of the region, Eric explains, pointing to how the Appalachians are portrayed as uneducated "hillbillies, racist illiterates and sexual deviants". There is certainly no shortage of examples, he adds. Call of the Wildman, a reality television series, followed the exploits of Ernie Brown Jr, an almost completely toothless Kentuckian also known as the Turtle Man for his appearance in a viral YouTube video. For four seasons, the series documented Brown's animal removal business, following him as he went to people's homes and businesses to catch racoons, possums, snakes and other vermin. In July 2012, the show set a then-record of 1.6 million viewers in a single weekend, according to a press release published at the time on the Animal Planet channel's website. Between 2012 and 2014, the popular TV programme Here Comes Honey Boo Boo told the story of Alana Thompson, a child competitor from the reality show Toddlers and Tiaras, and her family in the southern state of Georgia. READ MORE: Reflections of a former white supremacist The show, which played on offensive tropes about obesity, poverty and the supposed ignorance of poor communities, was cancelled in 2014. Yet, at its peak it attracted more than 2.2 million viewers. In 2004, the popular comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL) introduced a skit called Appalachian Emergency Room, which drew on stereotypes of Appalachians as uniformly poor, uneducated and dirty. Further back still, the 1973 film Deliverance - starring John Voight and Burt Reynolds, among others - tells the tale of four Atlanta men who wind up separated while canoeing in the northern Georgia Appalachia region. While trying to find their companions, two of the story's protagonists are captured by local Appalachian men who proceed to rape one of them. More recently, a series of articles in mainstream US newspapers and media outlets have deemed Appalachia as "Trump country". Last month, New York Times columnist Roger Cohen visited Paris, Kentucky, writing a portrayal of the region as almost homogenously right-wing. "Now Kentuckians are clambering aboard the Trump train - and to heck with its destination," Cohen wrote. Evoking sweeping generalisations, he continued: "The race is tightening once again because Trump's perceived character - a strong leader with a simple message, never flinching from a fight, cutting through political correctness with a bracing bluntness - resonates in places like Appalachia where courage, country and cussedness are core values." Similar stories have appeared on NBC, the Associated Press and Vanity Fair, among others. "It's about basically making the argument that poor white people in the mountains uncritically support Donald Trump, that it's a bastion of racism and uncritical politics," Eric says. In September, The Atlantic published an analysis of data on Trump supporters. Though nine out of every 10 supporters were white, the analysis concluded: "Only 23 percent of Trump's white, non-college-educated voters make less than $50,000 a year". For his part, Eric argues that Trump represents the interests of America's wealthiest class even if he commands high support among the middle class and a fair, if exaggerated, degree of support among working-class whites. "The people responsible for Donald Trump are on Wall Street - not the poor people in Appalachia."

Sitting in the Ole Bus Stop Diner, 67-year-old Lora Turner spins her coffee mug on the table as she speaks. Born and raised in Booneville, Lora spent the past 33 years working with churches from across the country who come to Owsley County to help build homes for poor families. She keeps a list of families and children who need housing, clothes, medicine, food and other necessities, coordinating with churches to distribute the goods. "We lived up here in a hollow and were very poor," she says, adding that she was one of 11 children. "We didn't have no electricity till I was 14 years old, but we learned to appreciate the good things in life." Speaking over the chatter of the cafe and the clatter of dishes, Lora says 133 volunteers came from a Pittsburg church to help build three homes for families in Booneville this past summer. "We got good people here." Around the corner in a shop-turned-donation centre, 68-year-old Cleda Turner fills backpacks with food and medicine for children as part of a programme run by her NGO, Owsley County Outreach. A pair of cats sleep next to one another on the shelf behind her. After living in Lexington for 37 years, Cleda and her husband came back to Booneville. After working with soup kitchens and church charities in the city, she says she was saddened to find a lack of services for hungry children. READ MORE: America's hidden homeless - Life in the Starlight Motel In 2007, she registered the NGO and focused her efforts on the Food Backpack Programme. Because many children from low-income families only have access to proper meals at the school cafeteria, the programme provides them with food packs to last the duration of a weekend. "There's little or no food in their homes on the weekend," Cleda says, explaining that she and two other volunteers deliver to the local schools an average of 180 food packs for children each Friday. The programme hasn't been without its challenges. When she first started, Cleda would give the children canvas backpacks full of food that they had to return at the end of the weekend. "We wanted to teach them responsibility, you know," she recalls. But during the first month, she noticed that the returned bags had been chewed on by what appeared to be rats or mice. "Some of the homes don't even have floors," she says by way of explanation. Yet more barriers have arisen in recent years due to a volatile combination of no work, no opportunities and little hope leaving Booneville to grapple with a surge in drug use, namely prescription-strength painkillers and methamphetamines. Cleda learned how prevalent methamphetamines were the hard way. A few months into the Food Backpack Programme, she found herself feeling increasingly ill. "I was achy and had headaches. I was just in the most awful shape I ever was," she says. After a doctor told her that she had been exposed to methamphetamine residue, she started using plastic grocery bags in place of the canvas sacks. Though Cleda considers the NGO's efforts a success, she argues that there needs to be a structural change to address the devastating poverty and hunger gripping places like Booneville. "You would think America can do that, but America has forgotten about the children," she says. "It's getting worse, and worse, and worse … You're going to always have your haves and have-nots in this country. It's because there's no such thing as equality."

"If it was a tree it would have been the most beautiful tree I ever saw" said a somber Eddy McKallen as he happened on to the vacant site with his easel and painting supplies. "I spent hours here painting that tree. Well I suppose I can paint the empty sky, that might be easier than painting thousands of fake pine needles" he said Carbon County chief of detectives Sam Hogan was assigned to the case and after inspection of the site and some ingenious intuition began to crack it. "I looked at the base of the cell tower and saw that there were empty holes where giant metal screw had fastened the tower to it and then I remembered being here in this area hunting a few days back when I saw Gary Schmidt the tree guy cutting down a giant tree. Gary says to me 'hey Hogan Carbon county will be famous now because this here tree is going to Rockyfeller center for Christmas' that's great I says but I ain't never seen no tree screwed into the ground before." The detective said "and Schmidt tells me it must have been leaning over so someone came and supported it." After several days of pondering, Detective Hogan came to the conclusion that the missing cell tower was indeed the same tree that Gary Schmidt had removed. "Well hell" Mr. Schmidt told reporters "some feller from New York shows up and tells me he'll give me five thousand bucks to cut the son of a bitch down so I cut the son of a bitch down". Apparently the tree had been spotted by a helicopter fly over by Rockefeller center chief of Christmas tree scouting Spatz Fisher. "cell tower? Whatever! I had to have it" he explained standing under the decorated "tree" at Rockefeller center "look at it. It's the most beautiful tree I ever saw." And it seemed like every visitor, tourist, office worker, and area resident agreed with Mr. Fishers opinion. The crowds have been larger than any Christmas prior and the amount of cash flowing into mid-town Manhattan has made this a record year for profits. "So we have decided to keep it" said Mr. Spatz "we're financing a new tower for the folks in Pennsylvania and keeping this tree permanently. We'll take down the decorations in January but the tree remains standing offering its majestic presence as well as fine cell service. And of course we no longer have to cut down any more trees" he continued "which is fine by me because I hate helicopters" "well this is great news for me" said Patsy Lang from her land line while waiting to check out at the Carbon county Wal-Mart "my extension cord keeps getting-". We lost contact with Patsy at that moment but we're pretty sure we know what she was saying.

Progressive Real Estate Partners retail leasing expert Paul Su exclusively marketed the property and represented the lessor.  Brian Denton of JLL in Los Angeles and Joseph Brady of the Bradco Co. in Victorville represented the lessee. Built in 2008, the 43,000 square-foot Topaz Marketplace is home to a variety of health, beauty, fitness and food users reflecting a "21st Century" tenant mix.  The space Kaiser will be occupying (a portion of former Fresh & Easy) is highly visible, has excellent parking and prominent monument signage.  The center is easily accessible and ideally situated on the main thoroughfare that a majority of Hesperia's residents use to access the heavily-traveled 1-15 freeway.  In addition, it is located at a signalized intersection with an average daily traffic count of over 42,000 cars.  Neighboring retailers include Stater Bros., Walmart, 99 Cents Only and Target as well as several national fast food users and sit down restaurants.

Protectionism is on the rise. For a trade-dependent country like Canada, that spells big trouble. Chris Sorensen November 4, 2016 Follow @chrisser8r Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   A Hanjin Shipping Co ship is seen stranded outside the Port of Long Beach, California, September 8, 2016. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) Kathryn Murray has a front-row seat to the world of international commerce. The manager of Vancouver’s Mission to Seafarers, a charity that supports homesick mariners, tracks all the massive container ships—carrying everything from dishwashers to diapers—that call on bustling ports in B.C.’s Lower Mainland. But lately, she says, the industry looks vulnerable. “They’ve got these really big ships, but they don’t fully load,” says Murray. “They’re capable of holding 2,000 containers, but they’re showing up with only 800 containers on them. A lot of companies just can’t exist on that.” South Korea’s Hanjin Shipping is the most recent casualty. The company filed for protection from creditors in early September, leaving some 45 of its ships and an estimated $14 billion worth of cargo stranded at sea—including two off the B.C. coast. One of the ships, the Hanjin Scarlet, was finally allowed to come into port in Vancouver on Oct. 27. The 255-m ship’s 24 crew only had 10 days’ worth of stored food left, the fresh fruits and vegetables long gone. The shipping industry’s woes point to a much larger global economic problem: declining international trade. Since 2012, the global trade in goods and services has grown at less than half the rate of the previous 30 years. While much of the downturn can be explained by the lingering effects of the 2009 recession, some economists fear there may also be more insidious factors at play—namely a growing public backlash against globalization. Two high-profile examples: the United Kingdom’s surprise June vote to withdraw from the European Union and the intensely anti-trade rhetoric routinely being spewed by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during their U.S. presidential campaigns. Even Canada, a self-described “trading nation,” recently got bitten by rising anti-trade sentiment. Ottawa’s seven-year effort to negotiate a free-trade deal with the European Union was nearly scuttled by the tiny, economically depressed Belgian region of Wallonia, which last month initially refused to sign off on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA. There are also growing fears the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, of which Canada is a signatory, may be dead in the water. That’s a potentially big problem for Ottawa, which was counting on more exports to pull the country out of an oil-induced slump. “More of our export shortfall may be structural than previously believed, rather than cyclical,” warned Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz in a recent speech. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz. (REUTERS/Chris Wattie) Why is this happening? While economic theory says a rising tide of international trade eventually lifts all boats, it also brings disruptive change that can leave some feeling as if they’re been left to drown. In the U.S., for example, an estimated five million U.S. factory jobs disappeared over the past 15 years, with many of them moving to China and Mexico. In exchange, U.S. consumers enjoyed heaping shelves of cheap, foreign-made goods at their local Wal-Mart store—a gain, to be sure, but one that likely comes as small consolation if you’ve been handed a pink slip. If all that weren’t enough, today’s trade deals are more complicated—and controversial—than ever, reaching far behind borders to deal with issues of regulatory and legal harmonization. There’s also growing disagreement about how much more benefit they will actually yield. Yet, despite the challenges, turning our back on global trade seems a recipe for ruin. Consumers are rarely willing to pay more than necessary, and isolationism, even if it were economically desirable, is unrealistic in an era when a growing number of firms like Netflix and Amazon offer products and services via the borderless Internet. “There’s a whole frontier of 21st-century trade issues that are going to have to be discussed, debated and negotiated,” says Lee Branstetter, an economics professor at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon University. “Otherwise we could face first-order losses relative to a world where we continue to move forward.” Global trade in goods and services grew at an average annual rate of about nine per cent between 2003 and 2007, according to a recent IMF study. But it fell to just three per cent between 2012 and 2015 for goods, and just five per cent for services. Even more alarming, the slump has been remarkably widespread, with 143 of 171 countries recording trade declines over the same period. Relative to gross domestic product (GDP), the downturn is even more stark: world trade grew on average twice as fast as GDP between 1985 and 2007, according to the IMF, but in the past four years it’s barely kept pace. “Such prolonged sluggish growth in trade volumes relative to global economic activity has few historical precedents during the past five decades,” the report said. Related: Why free trade is a losing issue for Hillary Clinton Economists aren’t entirely sure what’s going on. As much as three-quarters of the downturn can probably be explained by weak domestic economies in countries around the globe, from Canada to China. The rest may be due to companies hitting a natural plateau as they fan out their manufacturing footprints across the globe. It’s also possible, according to the IMF, that the slump is being exacerbated by “the waning pace of trade liberalization over the past few years and the recent uptick in protectionist measures.” It’s certainly easy to see why someone might come to that conclusion. In June, 52 per cent of the British electorate turned back the clock on nearly a quarter-century of European integration by voting to leave the EU, the world’s largest free-trade zone, catching just about everyone off guard. The government collapsed, the pound fell to a 30-year low and snarky economists warned the British may have become the first to vote in favour of a recession. The lesson? “You’ve now got massive globalization critics throughout the world, which you have to take seriously,” says Harald Bathelt, a professor of geography and planning at the University of Toronto. Closer to home, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump continues to wage a campaign against the liberalized trade policy that’s been a hallmark of American foreign policy for half a century. He’s promised to build a towering physical wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement and levy huge tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports (even though Trump’s clothing lines are made in China and much of his real estate business’s steel is sourced there as well). Not to be outdone, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has refused to support the TPP, prompting former prime minister Brian Mulroney to recently suggest the trade deal between the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan and eight others “is not going to fly.” Clinton barely even defends the NAFTA deal that her husband, former president Bill Clinton, signed in 1993. Branstetter says the anti-trade rhetoric can be explained by the electoral map, with workers in Rust Belt swing states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania feeling duped by politicians who said global trade would make them richer. “Voters were promised a quick trip to the promised land, but several decades later find themselves in an economic wilderness,” he says. “If I remember my Bible correctly, what followed was a period of flirtation with idolatry—and here comes Donald Trump with his golden calf.” Canada, for the most part, has so far managed to avoid falling into a similar anti-trade trap—possibly because our more generous welfare system helped blunt the impact of the 500,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost between 2000 and 2009. But that doesn’t mean we’re unaffected by the backlash. By conventional measures, more than a third of the Canadian economy is dependent on trade—mostly with the U.S. and China. That means if we want to get the economy growing again—the IMF is predicting barely-there GDP growth of 1.2 per cent this year—Canadian firms will need to sell more goods and services overseas. No wonder, then, that Canada pushed so hard to get CETA signed last month, with Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland nearly coming to tears when it appeared negotiations were at an impasse. But CETA still has a long way to go before coming into force. It must be ratified by all 28 of the EU’s member states and scores of regional governments, including Wallonia. And many Europeans remain wary of the pact’s complex Investor State Dispute Settlement system, which could allow multinational corporations to override governments whose policies impact their profitability. “It’s not really about Canada,” says Bathelt. “It’s about a deal that’s been decided behind closed doors, and that people don’t understand.” President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (R), Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (C) and EU Council President Donald Tusk (L) signed the agreement on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a planned EU-Canada free trade agreement, in Brussels, Belgium on Oct., 30 2016. (Stephanie Lecocq/CP) Not everyone is wringing their hands over the uphill battle Canadian trade negotiators are facing on the other side of the Atlantic. Michael Hart, a professor emeritus at Ottawa’s Carleton University and a former official at Global Affairs Canada, says the nearly 1,600-page CETA agreement has more to do with satisfying Europe’s Byzantine internal rules than opening up brand-new markets for Canadian companies, which already export about $35 billion worth of goods and services to the EU. Even if CETA is signed and ratified, the Conference Board of Canada estimates that only an additional $1.4 billion would be added to Canada’s merchandise exports by 2022—mainly via gains in the chemical, rubber, plastics, agriculture and automotive sectors. “There comes a time,” says Hart, “when you have to do the political and economic arithmetic and ask: how much bending do we need to do for an agreement that, in my opinion, will yield fairly marginal results?” Indeed, the trade deals of the 1980s and 1990s were largely focused on reducing tariffs and thus captured much of the low-hanging fruit available to Canadian firms. Today’s deals, by contrast, tend to be focused on removing non-tariff barriers—from domestic labelling requirements to government procurement programs—all while taking steps to provide investors with a way to side-step local courts in the event a dispute arises. In short, they often require governments to rewrite laws and alter programs, which guarantees opposition from entrenched interests. “We’re now dealing with the fruit that’s at the very top of the tree,” Hart says. Hart also warns that dwindling global trade numbers should be taken with a grain of salt due to growing problems with the way they’re measured. Take the iPhone, for example. It’s officially listed as an import from China, where its final assembly takes place. But studies have shown only about US$10 of the device’s US$275 cost is related to Chinese labour since the components are sourced from throughout Asia, and the design and marketing work—which account for the bulk of phone’s price—is handled by Apple in California. The same is broadly true of many other products. The Conference Board tried to account for the phenomenon a few years ago by measuring only how much value is added to a product as it passes through a country. The results were surprising. Under the new calculations, the share of Canada’s trade-related GDP fell to just 24 per cent from 35 per cent, suggesting Canada’s dependence on trade may actually be below the world’s average, not above. The 2011 report suggested the finding may explain why Canada was less impacted by the 2009 recession than other countries: we are far less exposed to the global economy than we think we are. It may also explain why today’s cheap loonie has failed to give the economy much of an export boost. Another factor that’s weighing down global trade numbers, both in Canada and abroad, is the rising importance of services, which are also poorly measured. Branstetter, the Carnegie Mellon professor, uses the example of a Canadian couple who flies from Toronto to Bangkok, booking beach rentals through Airbnb and taxi rides on Uber. “They’re basically interacting with a global network of computers and servers, and many of the companies providing these services are headquartered in the U.S,” he says. “But very little of this counts as international trade in services.” It also means those U.S. corporations pay almost no taxes for delivering those products. Of course, just because trade may be happening without being properly tracked doesn’t negate the need for future agreements. If anything, it makes them even more important so that the full value of these new web-enabled services can be realized. But it won’t be easy. “This will require international coordinating efforts because a democracy in one part of the world may value customer data differently than another,” says Branstetter. It will likely also require countries to figure out how to properly assess taxes on the likes of Google, Facebook and others. Moreover, policy-makers must be mindful of what’s known as the bicycle theory of trade liberalization: if you stop pedalling, you fall over. Put another way, failing to push for future trade deals not only carries an opportunity cost, but threatens to unwind gains made through earlier agreements. It takes far more effort to dismantle protectionist walls than it does to build them up. Yet the trade monitoring group Global Trade Alert warns the number of protectionist measures implemented by countries this year has climbed to the highest level since 2009. The trend, if allowed to continue unchecked, threatens to raise prices for just about everything—from sweatpants to car tires. Unless, of course, you happen to be in the market for a few dozen (slightly used) ocean-bound container ships.

Um, no. I know that writers and editors avoid reading comment pages, but somebody should start doing that. You will find that there is widespread, angry anti-trade sentiment in Canada. As Donald would say, “It’s Huge!” The reality is that politicians have largely been pro-trade until now. That will change as more and more uninformed and semi-literate voters climb aboard the anti-trade bandwagon. Politicians who want to be elected or re-elected will soon abandon the sensible strategy and join “NAF-EXIT”. If Trumpo wins the election, that sudden, religious conversion will happen within weeks. Reply ↓ Tangler on November 4, 2016 at 3:19 pm What we have to understand is that the trade off for free trade agreements is loss of jobs versus cheap goods. This will happen as long as we sign free trade deals with countries that have no labour or environmental laws. But these cheap goods also come with a cost. This is the cost of global warning which is a direct result of our consumerism and throw away culture which our politicians claim is necessary to keep the economy growing. What we need to ask ourselves is: 1. Is this sustainable forever? 2. What do we do with the people who get left behind. Right now we have fentanyl. If the answers to these questions are not desirable then we need to change. Reply ↓ Dough on November 7, 2016 at 6:34 pm Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Logout.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. "He said 'ma'am are you pregnant,' and I said 'yes I am,' and he said 'you did not look pregnant five minutes ago,'" said Pautke. "He said, 'I'm going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don't have anything under your shirt.'" Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. Then when she proved she wasn't hiding anything, she said that employee told her to have a good day.

Previously, this toy had only been available at Entertainment Earth for all of about a few hours, so this is the first confirmed sighting of the toy in brick and mortar retail, or anywhere else really. The price was given as $19.97. You can check out the image that Scotty provided to us below, and you can start heading out to your local Walmarts and other stores to hunt this guy down.

Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1839687) Posted by Kurona on November 7th, 2016 @ 9:10pm CST It is pretty stealthy, actually.

Seriously though, what's with the empty box? Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840077) Posted by Hellscream9999 on November 9th, 2016 @ 9:43pm CST Fellow Seibertronians, Scottimus Prime Toy Hunter Productions was on the hunt at a Target in Commack, within Long Island New York, and found the new 3 Step Drift and Energon Boost Bumblebee. This Drift is unique in that it is the first 3 Step version of the character with his original deco. The first 3 Step figure was the 'Blizzard' themed deco and featured a different head. This Drift has a new head based on the original design of his face. And Bumblebee has blue highlights... So check them out and let us know what you think of them - or if you've seen them - in the comments below. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840199) Posted by Tyrannacon on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:11pm CST Saw this show up on io9 and BWTF: http://bwtf.com/news/rid2015-io9-figure ... ember-2016 http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-robots-i ... 1788753393 Soundwave is apparently taking from his WFC/FOC design while Cyclonus is a play on his G1 design like Starscream. Plus, Skywarp? It looks like so. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840214) Posted by Bronzewolf on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:47pm CST We've got some huge news for you today, Seibertronians! User Mindmaster has alerted us to an article on the website Io9, Where they revealed a majority (if not all) of the toys coming out in the Robots In Disguise Spring 2017 wave! The big news here is most of the new figures are classic characters no one expected to be included in RID2015, so this is a surprise certainly coming out of left field for most. Spanning all size classes, characters like Blurr, Bludgeon, Cyclonus and, most importantly, Soundwave will be joining the cast sometime in the future! The toys also have some interesting new gimmicks, such as Activator Combiner Soundwave, who comes with a Laserbeak who turns into a small weapon, with "Deploying Battle Cannons". This calls back to the similar Minicon Deployers that are currently included in this line. Take a look at all of the images of the new toys down below and tell us in the comments what you think of these new incarnations of classic Transformer Characters! Warrior Class Legion Class 3-Step 1-step Activator Combiners Soundwave Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840215) Posted by Cobotron on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:50pm CST Wow! Some of those look amazing! Blurr and Twinferno look fun. And Hey! Skywarp before Thundercracker? Now we're talking! Yo News crew! You guys seeing this? EDIT: Bronzewolf with the save! Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840217) Posted by Kurona on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:53pm CST Someone in Hasbro REALLY likes Twinferno, huh? First being the only Monsterbot to get the Generations treatment and now this. I'm getting a John Warden Deluxe Vehicles vibe here While this all looks majorly badass, I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it. RiD 2015 used to mostly be it's own thing with the recent Starscream harkening back to the past so much being a big surprise, but what made it so great is that it was unique. Now it feels like the toyline's starting to overflow with G1 influence when before it was packed with originality and new characters. Don't get me wrong, I still prefer these G1 characters to what RiD has put out and I'm excited for most of these figures - especially that Soundwave holy shit - but... I dunno. It's starting to feel like RiD's uniqueness is starting to fade and mesh in with everything else. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840218) Posted by Sigma Magnus on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:53pm CST The one article said Hasbro is making designs inspired by G1...that's not all that new, and Titans Return is a much better example of that... Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840221) Posted by Cobotron on November 10th, 2016 @ 12:58pm CST When the Bludgeon mold was revealed at NYCC he was a Bot and had a different name. So we're getting two, or they changed their mind? And I agree Kurona. Although these look fun, I wouldn't mind the line staying the course of originality it was on.

I was groaning at the article the whole way through. Acting as if this is the first time there's been full-on G1 influence... meanwhile, there is literally a direct remake of the G1 Soundwave toy in a Titans Return Leader box, original alt-mode (or at least a close approximation of it), cassette partners and all. "The warrior class features some of the largest figures in the RiD line" oh come on Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840224) Posted by JelZe GoldRabbit on November 10th, 2016 @ 1:00pm CST Warrior Class Starscream Bludgeon Blurr Soundwave Twinferno Skywarp Legion Blurr Cyclonus Starscream Of note is that the Warror Starscream is a regular retail release, and thus may have some changes from the TRU Clash version. As for Bludegon, I'm going to assume he's a redeco of Blastwave, as I don't see any of the others revealed earlier. Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840225) Posted by Railbomb on November 10th, 2016 @ 1:04pm CST I kinda like how that Soundwave takes design cues from both the WFC/FOC and Prime designs. And depending on how well that Bludgeon looks in hand I might use him as my G1 Bludgeon.

The 3 we saw in new york arent there so I am assuming these all come after. That means that we will first get Blasstwave, White Drift and Stormshot. So far they have been releasing 3 new warriors per wave, so I dont know how this will all play out. So much for those who thought this line was dead is growing more and more and giving us more stuff. I love it. I still want a warrior hamerstrike but this is all good stuff. I dont know if I will get that skywarp or not but all the rest of these warriors are definite buys. And I find it cool how taht Soundwave has the same body type as Prime Rumble and Frenzy. It will be a cool dynamic to have him stand in the middle of the two with them acting like his goons. About Soundwave, man, that guy's agent must have been working overtime.

Re: Robots in Disguise Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock Sighted at US retail (1840241) Posted by Kurona on November 10th, 2016 @ 1:16pm CST Soundwave will definitely be a big thing in the show; probably the new 'con leader. You don't just get a whole slew of toys like that, all original molds and don't appear. Cyclonus too considering he's a new mold. I'd expect Skywarp and Bludgeon too but since they're easy redecoes of past figures, won't be surprised if they don't appear. Then again, Soundwave probably needs team fillers, and there don't appear to be many Decepticon toys not currently arrested and taken back to Cybertron...

She listed tips to help professional truck drivers avoid being involved in low clearance accidents -- and has announced a reward and challenges.   Aiken, SC -- (ReleaseWire) -- 11/07/2016 --Vicki Simons of Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com has named November 8 "Low Clearance Awareness Day" for the purpose of helping professional truck drivers avoid driving commercial motor vehicles under or into structures that are shorter that their vehicles. The date November 8 (11/8) was selected in honor of the "11 foot 8" (11'8") railroad trestle in Durham, North Carolina, where many low clearance crashes have happened despite the installation of numerous warning devices. Many videos have been made of large and straight trucks -- and recreational vehicles -- that have been damaged by the "can opener" bridge, which can be seen on the website 11foot8.com or the site's YouTube channel. "Low clearance truck accidents -- which are always costly -- are 100% preventable," Mrs. Simons said. "With all of the technology available today, though, why are these accidents still happening?" A photo from a news report about a low clearance truck accident appears on the TruckersSavings Pinterest social media channel on the "Truck Under Blunders" board. It originally appeared in an article on OregonLive.com on February 25, 2013. The article says that according to the Marion County Sheriff's Office, the driver attempted to take a Walmart truck measuring 13'6" high under a 12'9" bridge at River Road South and Orville Road South. Mrs. Simons notes two seemingly contradictory pieces of information in the article: 1. The trucker "misread the height limit" and 2. The trucker "was relying on directions from the truck's navigation system" at the time of the accident. She wants to know why a navigation system installed in a commercial motor vehicle would route a trucker under a low clearance bridge and what brand and model of navigation system it was. While truck low clearance accident statistics have been hard to come by, Mrs. Simons speculates that many truckers are having these accidents because they are relying upon GPS -- or Global Positioning System -- units in one of two respects: - Either the GPS unit being used by the trucker was not properly configured for commercial motor vehicles; - Or despite the GPS unit in use, the truckers didn't heed clearly marked low clearance signs. In order to help her learn more, Mrs. Simons announced the following reward to help raise awareness among professional truck drivers about low clearances. In the name of Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com, she will give a $50 Amazon.com gift card to - the first professional truck driver who can document to her satisfaction - that any GPS (Global Positioning System) unit that has specifically been configured for 13'6" commercial motor vehicles - has routed him/her to go under any overpass that is shorter than 13'6" in the lanes of travel (not on the shoulders) within the continental USA. Truckers are invited to submit information through a special form on the site in order to qualify. Besides challenging professional truck drivers to be aware of low clearances, Mrs. Simons also challenged: - News reporters who report about low clearance truck accidents, to always ask the driver if he/she was following the routing of a GPS unit that was specifically configured for commercial motor vehicles; and - Trucking companies to provide their drivers with lists of brands, models and specifications of GPS units that are allowed for use in their trucks. To help American truckers who are traveling in Canada -- and Canadian truckers who are traveling in the USA -- Vicki Simons has created a "Truck Height Feet to Meters Conversion Table", which is available through their Free Downloads page. To get instant access to the printable PDF document, enter your name and email address in the form on our website and confirm your subscription. Mrs. Simons listed five tips to help professional truck drivers avoid low clearance accidents: 1. Know the height of your entire truck: tractor and trailer(s). 2. Do not use non-CMV GPS units. 3. Plan your route according to approved truck routes. 4. Always watch for and heed low clearance signs. 5. If you're unsure your truck will clear an overpass, it's always better to stop than risk having an accident. For more information, visit the Low Clearance page of Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com. About Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com Truck-Drivers-Money-Saving-Tips.com was created by trucker consumer advocates Mike and Vicki Simons "because truckers know that no trucker deserves to be stung financially". Through the site, the couple provides real world tips that help professional truck drivers save hard-earned money and personal reporting about products and services for use on the road. They share the tips they have learned through the years and encourage other professional drivers to do the same. Since 2009, Mike and Vicki have helped untold numbers of professional truck drivers and their home support team members save money in many different ways. The couple's 25+ years of marriage, frugal lifestyle and commercial driving experience serve as the backdrop for blending two of their passions: truck driving and saving money. They have published hundreds of articles and reviews on their site, have sent thousands of news snippets to their continually updated Truckers' Savings Blog and publish a free monthly email newsletter.

COURTESY OF BEV RESH By STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF If you go When: Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Where: Walmart, 27470 Alicia Parkway. Information: cityoflagunaniguel.org For the past decade, Laguna Niguel has hosted an annual toy drive dedicated to providing military families with gifts and well wishes. The drive returns Friday when the Laguna Niguel Military Support Committee hosts the event at Walmart. New toys for kids aged 1 to 12 and gift cards for teenagers will be accepted. Rich Encinas, who sits on the military committee, said the toy drive provides about 250 children with Christmas presents. “When they see what we give them, they are literally blown away and amazed," he said. Once the toys have been collected, Encinas said, they are delivered to USS Stockdale sailors and their families. “We have taken it to the point now where the parents only need to get a couple small toys.” Laguna Niguel Mayor Laurie Davies, co-chair of the military committee, plans on collecting toys for the committee Saturday from 1 to 3 p.m. “It's amazing how generous our community is,” she said. Davies said committee events are beneficial in part because they provide some services to sailors that they often have to pay for, such as toiletries. In a typical year there are two car washes, a golf tournament, baby shower drive and other events helping local military. Residents wishing to support sailors and their families can stop by Walmart Friday through Sunday and drop off the gifts.

By TonyaGarcia Reporter Amazon.com Inc., with its online retail and web services businesses, is facing competition from a wide range of companies, and has the goods to win on both sides, Moody’s says. On the e-commerce side, Amazon AMZN, +3.36%   is well-positioned for the fourth quarter, but could feel the pinch from a highly promotional holiday season. “Based on what we’ve seen so far, we think this fourth quarter is shaping up to be an excellent one, with revenues likely growing at least 22% as the company reaps some nearer-term benefits from its protracted investment program,” Moody’s wrote in a note published Monday. Still, the e-commerce giant will have to deal with a holiday shopping season rife with discounts. Retailers like J.C. Penney Co. Inc. JCP, -4.20%  , Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY, -0.15%   and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.32%   have already announced holiday plans, including pre-Black Friday sales. Amazon has also launched its Black Friday Deals Store, weeks ahead of Thanksgiving Day. See also: Distracted consumers could pause holiday shopping around election, but they’ll come back “We believe this early activity is laying the groundwork for promotions that will be above what we have been seeing in recent years,” Moody’s wrote. “We believe the investment thesis for Amazon should be on top-line growth for now.” Netflix, Amazon: How Best to Capture India Viewers (4:12) As Amazon.com and Netflix look to grow their business in India amid a global expansion, they are following two diverging scripts. WSJ's Shalini Ramachandran has details on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: Amazon Amazon reported third-quarter sales of $32.7 billion for the third quarter on Oct. 27, up from $25.4 billion last year, and in line with the FactSet consensus. Earnings per share were 52 cents, up from 17 cents last year, but falling short of the 76 cents FactSet consensus. Moody’s highlights that Amazon “‘absorbed’ over $500 million more in shipping costs than in third-quarter 2015.” See also: Amazon posts smaller-than-expected profit increase Moody’s calls these results “solid,” and believes Amazon will continue its online dominance over other retailers. “The better-performing brick-and-mortar retailers are expecting fourth-quarter online sales to grow at least in the high teens – a level that Amazon should easily eclipse,” Moody’s wrote. “Our ‘forecast’ holds margins steady at fourth-quarter 2015 levels, though there is a greater potential downside risk due to uncertainties around the company’s investment plans.” Among the areas of investment Amazon has highlighted are video content and fulfillment centers. See also: Amazon’s investment strategy doesn’t scare away analysts In addition to the aforementioned retailers, Moody’s believes Macy’s Inc. M, -0.41%  , Target Corp. TGT, -1.01%  , off-price retailer TJX Cos. Inc. TJX, -0.98%  , “or basically the entire brick-and-mortar universe,” which is focused on e-commerce and fighting for holiday season dollars, are Amazon’s competition. But the fight is on two fronts. Amazon Web Services posted strong results in the third quarter, with revenue of $3.2 billion. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.97%   and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +2.91%   are fighting for position in this space. See also: Most retailers would benefit from staying closed on Thanksgiving Day “On the web front, it faces Microsoft and Google, which are both focused on the cloud and have the desire and financial wherewithal to go head-to-head with Amazon,” Moody’s wrote. “While we believe both sets of competitors are formidable, if we had to choose, increased competition for the cloud is apt to be somewhat more cutthroat than the retail side.” Amazon shares are up 4% in Monday trading and up 16.2% for the year so far. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.75%  is up 4.1% for 2016 to date, and the Dow 30 Industrials Average DJIA, +0.29%   is up 2.7% for the period.

The biggest shopping day of the year will have many deals and bargains and stores open for your purchasing convenience. As the days go on, more info is coming out, including numerous ads and circulars to show all the big sales. Toys R Us has now revealed its Black Friday gameplan, and there is also a big update on the hours for numerous stores. Some of the bigger stores have not yet revealed their Black Friday 2016 ads, and shoppers are still waiting for Walmart, Target, and others. As they wait, Toys R Us has decided to at least issue a press release detailing their plans for the upcoming holiday, and it includes their store hours. [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Shoppers heading to Toys R Us for Black Friday will be able to enjoy “30 hours of straight shopping” if they so choose. Stores will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day (November 24, 2016) and will not close until 11 p.m. on Black Friday (November 25, 2016). That’s a lot of shopping, and the giant toy retailer is looking to make things as convenient for their shoppers as possible. At the front of every location, a G.P.S. (Gurus for Play Stuff) will be standing and assisting shoppers to find certain items. The G.P.S. assistants will be in place for every Saturday and Sunday in November, and then starting on November 25, Fridays as well. Extra store maps, longer hours, and more customer service will be there to make Toys R Us shopping experiences as hassle-free as possible for Black Friday this year. Now, many other stores are releasing more information about their store hours and deals that are coming out. One of the biggest things, aside from the bargains, is what hours will a store be open and it’s time to check out the most updated numbers. [Image by Yana Paskova/Getty Images] A lot of stores have not yet revealed their store hours for Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday 2016, but they will soon. The Black Friday put together a great list of those that have given forth that information so let’s see when some of the bigger retailers will have their doors open. Michaels – 7 a.m. Friday PetSmart – 7 a.m. Friday Costco – 9 a.m. Friday Sam’s Club – 7 a.m. Friday Belk – 6 a.m. Friday Staples – 6 a.m. Friday GameStop – 5 a.m. Friday BJ’s Warehouse – 7 a.m. Friday Office Depot/Office Max – 6 a.m. Friday JCPenney – 3 p.m. Thursday to 5 p.m. Friday Bed, Bath & Beyond – 6 a.m. Friday Kohl’s – 6 p.m. Thursday – midnight Friday Other stores such as Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Kmart, and others still have yet to announce their hours. Some other retailers may have hours that vary by location so always check with your local store before just heading out to shop. Getting organized and having a plan in place for Black Friday shopping is really one of the best things anyone can do. Heading out into the throngs of people and hordes of traffic without knowing where you’re going or what you’re chasing is not an ideal situation. When it comes to the holidays, shopping is a big part of it and there is no getting around that. Many feel that Black Friday 2016 hours and tactics should change, but as long as millions will head out to the stores, things will remain the same. Toys R Us is living proof of that, and it shows in their recently revealed holiday shopping plans. If you’re going to head out for the bargains, get your ads ready and a plan in place so you can make the most of your time and money.

The Connecticut Department of Transportation recently identified previously unknown Raymark waste in the area of the new Exit 33 interchange, according to Jim DiLorenzo, a project manager for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The waste was identified in five soil borings out of nearly 50 done as part of the DOT’s geotechnical design work for the interchange. The DOT also detected asbestos waste in other soil borings that were unrelated to Raymark Industries. The waste was located between Barnum Avenue Cutoff and the southbound side of I-95 across from Walmart and is not easily accessible to the public, DiLorenzo said. The current Exit 33 is a partial “diamond” interchange consisting of a southbound I-95 entrance ramp and a northbound exit ramp. The new configuration, according to state DOT officials, would be a full “diamond” interchange with the proposed southbound off-ramp connecting with Veterans Boulevard on the north side of I-95. The new northbound on-ramp would extend from Ferry Boulevard/U.S. Route 1 northbound on the south side of I-95, and the bridge carrying I-95 over East Main Street will be widened to accommodate the new on-ramp and acceleration lane. While DiLorenzo said it’s “fairly certain” the waste is the same as the Raymark waste found elsewhere in Stratford, more testing will be needed to verify it. DiLorenzo said the discovery will likely not change the recently finalized EPA cleanup plan. The agency finalized its plans to remediate waste found in four designated Operable Units, or OUs, throughout town. OU2 includes groundwater and vapor intrusion and the plan calls for the installation of vapor systems in a variety of impacted buildings and structures to protect building occupants against the intrusion of volatile chemicals from contaminated groundwater into air. OU3 covers the Upper Ferry Creek area, the Raymark ballfield site off Barnum Avenue is OU4 and 22 sites around town are considered OU6. The $95.7 million plan involves excavating contaminated soil and sediment from OU3 and OU6 and consolidating it at the ballfield with other waste as well as capping it. The waste at the Interstate 33 interchange would be included in OU6, DiLorenzo said. “We always anticipated the possibilities that more properties [with Raymark waste] would pop up,” DiLorenzo said. “The decision we had includes that…we will clean up these 22 sites and other properties in the same manner. We have a plan in place. We have no idea of the volume yet.”   The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the state Department of Public Health announced Friday that air and ground sampling and monitoring will be conducted after asbestos was found in the soil at the site of the Exit 33 design and reconstruction. Preliminary indications are that there is no immediate threat to public health, according to the two state agencies.

"She had a serious leg injury," said Michael Wilk, Chicopee Police public information officer. First aid was administered at the scene and the woman was taken to the hospital by ambulance, he said. The woman had just left the store at about 11:30 a.m. and was crossing directly in front when she was struck. The male driver who hit her stopped and has been cooperating with police, Wilk said. The names of the victim and the driver have not been released yet, he said. The area in front of the Walmart pharmacy is taped off while police gather evidence and the entrance near the pharmacy is expected to be closed for at least another hour, he said. The accident is being investigated by the Chicopee Police Traffic Department officers, he said.

 A travel hacker with 45 credit cards reveals his tricks for maximizing airline miles, points, and rewards Talia Lakritz, INSIDER Nov. 7, 2016, 12:52 PM 2,833 facebook linkedin twitter email print Daniel Gillaspia at Yosemite View Lodge. Daniel Gillaspia/Flickr The INSIDER Summary: • Daniel Gillaspia is a pro at managing airline miles, points, and rewards. • He recommends using many credit cards carefully. • Flying out of airline hubs and using companion passes also saves time and money. When Daniel Gillaspia isn't working as a full-time attorney in Houston, he and his partner Bradley Darnell travel around the world by expertly managing airline miles, points, and rewards from their 45 credit cards. "Travel is naturally a pretty expensive thing to to enjoy, but I knew that there were ways to do so-called 'travel hacking,'" Gillaspia said. "I started to learn the ins and outs of everything, and then I was like, 'Alright, well, I'm going to put this knowledge into practice and see how far it can get me.'" He now shares this knowledge on UponArriving, a website he runs that covers the latest developments in credit cards, airline and hotel award programs, and other travel topics. INSIDER asked Gillaspia for his best travel hacks. Here's his advice for making luxury travel happen at a fraction of the cost. Daniel Gillaspia/Flickr Make sure your finances are in order. "The average American household has something like $15,000 worth of credit card debt, and if someone is prone to running up credit card balances, they should think twice about getting into this, because rewards credit cards almost always come with some of the highest APRs (annual percentage rates)," he said. Choose cards with valuable sign-up bonuses. "There's the Chase Sapphire Reserve that offers a 100,000 point sign-up bonus, which could convert into $10,000 worth of first-class airfare, but you have people running into Wal-Mart signing up for cards that send them home with a free rotisserie chicken," he said. "Not all cards are created equally." Keep an eye out for multiple sign-up offers on the same credit card. "If you just search around a little bit more, you may find a sign-up bonus for the same card offering 20,000 more miles or something like that," he said. The more cards you have, the better — as long as you keep track of them. Daniel Gillaspia/UponArriving Gillaspia estimates that between him and his partner, they have 45 different credit cards. "A lot of people shudder when they hear that, they think our credit score is in the crapper," he said, "But actually, our credit scores are as strong as they've ever been." The key is keeping track of them and paying them off fully each month. Gillaspia uses two to four cards regularly, and organizes the rest in intricate spreadsheets. "The more credit cards you have, the bigger payment history you can build up over time. If you're responsible and don't run up a huge balance on your credit cards, pay them off each month and keep their utilization down to a minimum, you're going to inevitably increase your score over time," he said. Think of points as a form of currency, and spring for deals that give you the best exchange rate. "You don't want your points to be redeemed for poor values, really low values," he said. "You always want to maximize." Fly out of airline hubs. Daniel Gillaspia/UponArriving Flying out of an airline's headquarters means you will have more flight options, and thus save time and minimize extraneous connecting flights.  "It's just a better, more efficient use of miles a lot of times, if you're going through hubs," said Gillaspia. "And it also saves time, especially for people like me who like to do weekend getaways." Earn a companion pass. A companion pass allows another person to fly for free on any flight you book. It's earned after reaching a certain number of points, depending on the airline. Gillaspia's companion pass allowed him and his partner to get away about every two weeks to explore places around the US and the Caribbean. "I would say that while the first class experiences we enjoy are certainly our favorite way to fly, earning the Southwest Companion Pass was one of the best things we ever did," he said.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. “He said ‘ma’am are you pregnant,’ and I said ‘yes I am,’ and he said ‘you did not look pregnant five minutes ago,'” said Pautke. “He said, ‘I’m going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don’t have anything under your shirt.'” Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. Then when she proved she wasn’t hiding anything, she said that employee told her to have a good day. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases DHgate.com CEO Diane Wang Explains Effects of Globalization through Digitalization According to Wang, this is the effect of the adoption of technology and changing habits of consumers, “For example in China, street vendors must support mobile phone payment methods, or they will be abandoned by potential customers. This is also true for big chain stores like Wal-Mart, as well as mom-and-pop shops selling baked goods. These may be examples of the shallow integration of traditional industries and the Internet, but this is just the beginning. In the future, businesses more prominent use of the Internet will create inestimable opportunities.” Wang mentioned that digital globalization has brought another change, cross-border e-commerce platforms, like DHgate.com, which have been breaking down the trade boundaries between countries, gathering global business people and goods. “In our eyes, the future presents an image of people being able to buy and sell globally very easily. In actuality, digital globalization has not abandoned these major markets. Through cross border e-commerce platforms, they can transform their businesses, acquiring business from beyond the confines of their locality, and accept orders from across the globe. In addition, we have entered directly into the overseas market; we have established overseas exhibition centers in many countries, providing a multitude of services, including: product inspection, brand representation, online and offline sales, warehouse logistics, and after-sale customer service. The barriers to overseas markets have been significantly reduced, thanks to global digitalization. As a result, it is now far easier for Chinese sellers to enter more overseas markets.” About DHgate.com DHgate.com is the first to market and the biggest transactional cross-border B2B e-commerce marketplace in China, aiming to provide global buyers with quality products at competitive prices.

Police Captain John Sherwin says two SUV’s were spotted ramming a car and shots were also fired at the vehicle as it sped north on Broadway in the vicinity of the county fairgrounds around 7:30 p.m at about 80 mph.   Sherwin says the incident had its beginnings in the parking lot of the Pure Pleasure store in Stewartville .That’s where a 21-year-old Rochester woman made contact with a man she knows. She later left with two passengers, a 23-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl and drove back to Rochester.   The woman says while near 28th Street in the south Walmart store area, a white SUV suddenly pulled in front of her, forcing her to stop. She says the man she had met earlier also pulled up behind her car and boxed her in. The woman says when a man in the white SUV got out and began approaching her car, she decided to drive away.That’s when the drivers of both SUVs began chasing her, taking turns ramming her car as she decided to go to the Law Enforcement Center. The woman says 5-6 shots were fired at her car and at least one struck the vehicle before she was able to make it to the LEC. Sherwin says officers located the white SUV and arrested the suspected driver, 27-year-old Kristian Miranda. Kristian Miranda – Photo from Olmsted County Sheriff’s Office   The other SUV was also located and Sherwin says the search continues for its driver. Sherwin has identified him as 23-year-old Victor Miranda, believed to be the brother of the other suspect. Sherwin says the three people in the car were shaken up but not hurt. He says the wild chase was witnessed by several people who called 911. He says the motive for the incident is unknown at this point.

Palmieri Amazon, Macy’s and Target Garner Top Spots in ABX Effectiveness Report Retailers rolled out 595 new ads in October. By Arthur Zaczkiewicz on November 7, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Macy's Herald Square Clint Spaulding For ad effectiveness as measured by the ABX Advertising Benchmark Index, Amazon Inc., Macy’s Inc. and Target Corp. were among the top performers for October. According to ABX in its report, major retailers ran 595 new ads in October, and many scored well with the research firm’s new Gender Equality Measure, “which means the advertisers are portraying girls and women in respectful ways,” the company noted, adding that the GEM impacts several of the other measures in the index such as “Reputation” and “Action.” The company added the GEM last month as part of the #SeeHer hashtag effort from the Alliance for Family Entertainment as well as the Association of National Advertisers. The ABX Advertising Benchmark Index includes 14 variables, with a score of 100 being equal to “average effectiveness.” ABX said several major retailers delivered effective ads during the month that scored well over 100 while the same companies saw campaigns in other channels miss the mark. For October, some of the most effective ads were launched by retailers such as Macy’s, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kohl’s Corp., Kroger, J.C. Penney, Best Buy and Toys ‘R’ Us, among others. ABX noted that some of the least effective ads across media channels were from CVS, Gap Inc., Best Buy, Walgreens and Fry’s Electronics. Click here to see a chart of the ABX October Ad Report. For television, the number-one ad was Amazon Echo Dot “Just Ask” spot. It scored an overall ABX Index measure of 133. ABX researchers described the ad as a “fascinating spot with off-screen actors asking the Amazon Echo Dot questions that are humorous to the situation — such as losing jewelry down the garbage disposal, capturing a spider and wondering how many minutes are in 18 years in relation to a baby making a mess of spaghetti.” “This ad scores a strong +33 percent over norm in the overall ABX Index; a very high +103 percent in Reputation, and a great +53 percent in Action,” ABX said. “Within Action, all options for researching the product further scored extremely high, but Purchase was lower, at only 6 percent over norm.” The researchers noted that for average TV scores for the month, Amazon didn’t fare well despite the strong performance of this ad. Overall, it placed 14th out of 18 major retailers measured. For radio, Target delivered the most effective ad with the “Imagine hearing that your child has cancer…” spot. Its ABX Index score was 117 and had a whopping 201 “Reputation” score. In the ad, ABX said “a female voice asks listeners to imagine their child has cancer or Sickle Cell Disease and how terrible that would be. That’s why Target is teaming up with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Interestingly, Awareness and Message are only about average, but the association with St. Jude’s drove high Action subset scores in Intent to Contact, Research the Web, Recommend and Talk About it.” For print ads, “Macy’s teaming up with Breast Cancer Research Foundation” campaign scored the best with an ABX Index reading of 116. “This simple black-and-white ad shows how Macy’s is helping in the fight against cancer,” ABX said. “Of note is the new Gender Equality Measure, which evaluates how respectfully girls and women are presented in advertising. At +16 percent over norm, Macy’s has done a good job with this ad, showing a female with a healthy figure walking for the cause.” In the digital realm, J.C. Penney’s “Biggest Sale of Them All” spot was number one. The ad’s ABX Index score was 129. ABX said for the month, J.C.Penney ranked third out of 19 digital retailers placing major campaigns. In the free-standing insert category, Kohl’s “Columbus Day Door-Busters” was number one with an ABX Index of 122. ABX researchers said the retailer did a “good job of messaging,” which pushed other measures in the index up. “Also helping those scores is the 109 Gender Equality Index, which means Kohl’s is doing better than average in portraying its female models with respect.” For out-of-home ads, Best Buy was top with its “Prices Matched, Miles Saved” billboard ad. It had an ABX Index score of 110. You're missing something!

However, 2016 could bring different dynamics to holiday shopping with the imminent presidential election and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December. Year-to-date, Amazon (NasdaqGS: AMZN) and Dow component Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) have recently helped XRT’s rival, the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEArca: RTH), perform less poorly than XRT. XRT, an equal-weight ETF, has been plagued by slumping apparel retailers, among other corners of the flailing retail industry. With Amazon being one of the story stocks of 2016, RTH is primed to keep rolling, but XRT is reversing its fortunes for the better thanks to rebounding department store names. That scenario is bolstering the ETF’s technical outlook. SEE MORE: America’s Less Dressed: 3 Factors Weighing On Retail ETFs “The beginning of the Christmas holiday season (November) has been a good time to buy the group, and the post-shopping season (January) has been a good time to avoid (or be short) the sector,” reports ETF Daily News. “XRT has outperformed the market in November with an average gain of 2.26% in that month alone.  In addition, XRT has lost an average of 1.87% during January in the period examined (2006, 2009 to 2015). December has been a relatively neutral month for retail stocks compared to the S&P 500.” Trending on ETF Trends Trump’s ‘America First’ Mantra Helps Rally Small-Cap...

The ETF’s exposure to traditional department stores is light. Related: 46 Tech ETFs to Tap Into Big Growth Names Market analysts argued that department stores have experienced declining revenue on lower foot traffic as online stores like Amazon, which recently made an aggressive push into apparel and fashion, have started to take significant market share from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, reports Susaznne Kapner for the Wall Street Journal. “If you’re bullish on the 2016 holiday shopping season, history says to buy retail stocks in late October or early November. And be sure to exit your trade by the end of November or December,” according to ETF Daily News. For more news and strategy on the Retail ETF market, visit our Retail category.

The restaurant opened October 20 and is expected to observe a Grand Opening within the next two weeks. (Telegram Photos By Pete Wilson) Portsmouth resident Jordan Clark, owner-operator of the new Papa John�s restaurant in Jackson, has been very active in the operation of the new eatery and had his hands in the dough preparation process on a recent morning. PETE WILSON @NewsmanPete Owner-operator Jordan Clark was planning for a fairly quiet and smooth "soft opening" when his new Papa John's restaurant threw open its doors Thursday, October 20, in the former Radio Shack building at 1113 East Main Street, Jackson, located just south of the Jackson Heights subdivision and across State Route 93 from the Jackson Walmart Superstore. Even without any advance advertising or promotion, pizza lovers turned out in droves on those first few days and business has been good ever since. "It has been great, better than expected," Clark said of the steady flow of customers to Papa John's door. "We had to have another (delivery) truck come in because we didn't have enough ingredients." Papa John's is headquartered in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky and since being founded about 30 years ago has grown into the third largest pizza take-out and delivery chain in the nation with 4,900 locations in 37 countries. Other nearby Papa John's locations are located in Chillicothe, New Boston, Gallipolis, Athens, and Marietta. Like most others in the chain, the Jackson restaurant is a franchise location and represents Clark's first ownership experience after eight years of employment with Papa John's, starting as a customer service representative and most recently serving as the general manager of the New Boston restaurant. When Clark, who grew up in Wheelersburg and lives in Portsmouth, became interested in securing his own Papa John's, he settled on Jackson as a prime location with potential and was able to sell the company's brass on the proposal. The former Radio Shack building, which is in a prime visibility location, was available for lease and is actually a bit larger than most Papa John's restaurants. Clark already has a payroll of 35 full and part-time employees and expects to add 15 more based on the early volume of business. Clark feels the chain's overall popularity and success are due to its commitment to product quality and customer service. "We have better ingredients and use no fillers," Clark explained. "Everything we use is the gold standard and it's always fresh. We will never stray from service and quality and we take pride in what we do for our customers." Clark also says Papa John's prides itself on its community service programs and says the Jackson restaurant will be reaching out to and supporting the community as well. For example, the local restaurant will offer store tours to students in kindergarten through grade 2 and actually help kids make their own 10 inch pizzas. Other possible projects include a coloring contest, a canned food drive, and a "toys for tots" project. Although a specific date is yet to be determined, Clark says plans are being made for a Grand Opening which he expects to take place within the next two weeks. The Jackson Papa John's restaurant is open Monday-Thursday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. until 12 a.m.; and Sunday, 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. Article Comment Submission Form Please feel free to submit your comments about this story for possible publication online and/or in our print edition.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Record Hot Year Of 2015 May Become New Normal By 2025 Posted: Nov 7 2016, 5:37am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Current Record Levels of Heat may be the Norm by the Year 2030   It is being said that the current record levels of heat may be the norm by the time the year 2030 arrives. The hottest year was 2015 and it could be that by the time 2025 arrives, the record heat levels would have become the new norm. If such is the case, humanity will be subject to lassitude and heat exhaustion thanks to the high temperatures. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals The root cause of this heat wave during the summer months is carbon emissions. The novel research on the subject was published in the journal Bulletin of American Meteorological Society. Yet by now, the fact is clear as the light of day, that it is almost too late. Even if we drastically reduce carbon emissions, the new normal temperatures during summer would skyrocket by the time 2040 arrives in all its futuristic and grim reality. There is a slim chance of rewinding the climate change clock. Yet it will take enormous amounts of effort. It won’t be a walk in the park or a piece of cake. Were humanity to continue in its wreckless path of increasing carbon emissions, the future will be very bleak indeed.  Australia will be the first nation to face record heat levels due to this mistake we are making. In 2013, in Australia, the record summer temperatures were 50 degrees Celsius. Bushfires erupted in several regions due to  extreme and sultry heat. It was in fact so hot in the Land Down Under that it was termed the “angry summer”. Yet the fact that this could be the new norm by 2035 is frightening to say the least. If we were to really reduce carbon emissions and build an environmentally-friendly society on earth, only then will the temperatures normalize. This, however, is a pipe dream since it cannot be accomplished in such a short time basis.  The point about the record heat levels being the new normal has become a new definition of the stakes involved in the climate change game. It seems that we will have to act fast or we are going to be facing catastrophe on a grand scale. Using a supercomputer, a series of model simulations were made regarding the future weather. Australia, Europe, Asia and North America were the countries that were put under the microscope. There is hope yet for humanity but it will involve snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. The thing to remember is that we have one planet and only have one chance to save it from certain ruin.

Vock | November 9, 2016 Last year, a decision from lawmakers and regulators set off an exodus of solar companies from the state. (FlickrCC/BlackRockSolar)         Read all of our coverage on 2016 ballot measures at governing.com/ballotmeasures. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and Republican megadonor, doesn’t often agree with U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, the outgoing Democratic majority leader. But this year, they teamed up in an attempt to break up Nevada’s electric monopoly and secured an initial victory. The two are part of a larger effort to amend Nevada's constitution to force legislators to rewrite the state’s policies for electric utilities, giving customers the choice of which company they want to provide their power. The arrangement would make electric companies compete for business, rather than simply operating as monopolies in their area and charging rates set by state regulators. RELATED Solar Measure Fails in the Sunshine State The first step in that amendment process cameTuesday, when 72 percent of voters backed the plan. But it would still be a while before any changes could take effect: In order for the amendment to pass, voters would have to approve it again in 2018. Lawmakers would then have five years to overhaul the electric utility law. Whatever the long-term ramifications, the constitutional amendment is an outlet for pent-up frustration with NV Energy, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and has a monopoly in the state. The company says it's neutral on the proposal. Big-time customers like Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corporation and data-center operator Switch want to buy electricity from sources other than NV Energy but have been stymied by state regulators. Solar companies, meanwhile, are still chafing from decisions last year by lawmakers and regulators favoring the utility over solar providers, which set off an exodus of solar companies from the state. Reid, according to Nevada journalist Jon Ralston, orchestrated the amendment after repeated run-ins with NV Energy over clean energy. “The only way we’re going to effectively change policy is by resetting the table,” said Matt Griffin, an attorney for Nevadans for Affordable Clean Energy Choices, which drafted the amendment. “We’re stuck in a rut with our energy policy, and there’s no way out of it unless we get everybody together and say: What does our energy future look like?” Amendment 3 hadn’t received a lot of attention this year because Nevada also has competitive elections for president, U.S. Senate, several members of Congress and other ballot measures on guns and marijuana. Switch and Sands spent a combined total of $2.4 million to promote the electric deregulation amendment. Tesla, MGM Resorts, Patagonia and Walmart have also voiced support, and the solar industry has gotten on board as well. The only organized opposition to the amendment has come from unions, who worry that removing price controls could lead to big cost fluctuations that would hurt lower-income and middle-class electric customers. "They’re not spending millions of dollars each to make sure that the consumers are taken care of in this. It’s about the economic well-being and the bottom line of their companies,” said Dan Hart, a strategist for the No Handouts to Billionaires campaign that’s working against the measure and is largely funded by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The idea of deregulating an electric market certainly isn't new: 15 states and the District of Columbia, which together have roughly a third of the country’s population, use deregulated markets. But the idea lost much of its luster following the rolling blackouts in California and the bankruptcy of the energy speculating company Enron in 2001. Nevada officials had pulled the plug on an earlier attempt to deregulate its electricity market in light of those developments. Opponents of the current measure point to those failures as reason to stay away from further deregulation. But Griffin, the amendment’s author, says federal regulators are much better equipped to oversee electricity markets now than they were when the concept of allowing customers to choose the company that provides them power was still new. The two sides differ over which approach is more environmentally friendly. The opponents say that an open market for electricity will encourage customers to buy cheaper but dirtier power. The proponents say the freedom to choose your own provider will let customers get an even higher percentage of their power from renewable energy than is available now through NV Energy. Plus, the amendment would specify that people have the right to sell the energy they generate on their own, such as from solar panels. There's also considerable dispute over whether deregulation actually lowers customers’ bills. A 2015 study by the American Public Power Association, which opposes deregulation, concluded that, between 1997 and 2014, “retail electric price increases were higher in states with deregulated electric markets than in regulated states.” In 2014, for example, customers in deregulated states paid an average of 12.7 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with 9.4 cents for customers in regulated states. But proponents of the Nevada measure say that it could lead to average savings of 20 percent on electric bills. Finally, the two sides disagree over whether this issue belongs in the state constitution in the first place. “Why aren’t we having a discussion at the legislature?” asked Hart from No Handouts for Billionaires. “If they feel it’s obvious that this should happen, then they should be able to make that argument to the legislature.” Griffin, the proponent, sees nothing wrong with adding electric deregulation to the state charter, especially because, he says, advocates for change have tried for years to get the legislature to look at the issue with no success. The Nevada constitution already includes provisions on marijuana, mining taxes and lotteries, he noted. “I don’t know what the heartburn is with putting economic freedom and economic liberty in the state constitution. In fact, half of the original 13 colonies put economic freedom in their constitutions,” said Griffin. “This is nothing foreign to the United States Constitution or the state of Nevada’s constitution.” Read all of our coverage on 2016 ballot measures at governing.com/ballotmeasures.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 7, 2016 3:00 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Retail IT IT Management E-commerce Comments As we start the sprint to this year's holiday shopping season, I had hoped to start to see the disappearance of the store-centric mentality that has hurt so much of retail for years. This is best illustrated by complaints — from the likes of Target, Walmart and Home Depot — that they are being victimized by showrooming with Amazon. It was a bogus argument from the start. I mention this disheartening thought because I just tried — unsuccessfully — to give money to Home Depot, only to have Home Depot's store-centric — not even chain-store-centric but individual store-centric — mentality drove me into the waiting HTML arms of Amazon. This time, I really was determined to buy the item from Home Depot, but Home Depot's suicidal store-centric policies defeated me. And now, my tale. This weekend, I needed a new doorbell chime. (Who knew that they don't last forever?) It had very precise specs for a digital doorbell. Because I was working with a contractor from Home Depot, I wanted to get the chime from Home Depot. Best of all, there are several Home Depots near me, and the item is carried by the chain. In researching the product, I found that Amazon offered it for a few dollars less than Home Depot (and, as a Prime Member, I would get free shipping). Still, I wanted to get it from Home Depot. This was Home Depot's sale to lose — and it managed to do exactly that. I quickly found the item on the Home Depot website. Even better, the page volunteered that this product was in stock in more than 200 stores. So far, so good. The site, bizarrely, had set as my local Home Depot store a location that was quite far from me. If I had never visited Home Depot's site, this would be excusable, because using IP address to guess location is far from precise. The reality, though, is that I have made multiple buy-online-pickup-in-store purchases from Home Depot, and I routinely have to change my "local store" to the store actually closest. Ever heard of cookies, Home Depot? But this a minor matter. I changed to my actual local store and proceeded to check availability. None. Oh, well. It was a Sunday and I had some time. I would drive to a different Home Depot. I asked the site for the next closest. No stock. OK, how about the third closest? No stock. I went through six stores — none of them had stock, but the site kept bragging that it was in stock in more than 200 stores. Instead of forcing me through this sadistic guessing game, why didn't the site simply let me see the nearest stores where the item actually is in stock? It's certainly not because Home Depot's e-commerce team never thought of this. It's because Home Depot is not merely being store-centric, but  focusing on individual stores. The managers at specific stores want to tell you if a desired item is there. But if it's not, they'd rather sell you something similar. They would much prefer that than sending you to another store manager's turf, where you may also make a lot of other purchases. A Home Depot executive once told me how customer-centric the chain now is. He must have been sarcastic. After all this, I toyed with having it shipped, but the shipping from HomeDepot.com took far longer than Amazon and it cost more. I then went back to Amazon, with its lower price and free shipping, which said that it would have it to me by the next morning. I truly started out this chime-time aggressively planning on giving my money to Home Depot. This was not a sale that Amazon won. It was a sale that Home Depot went out of its way to lose.

Contact Us Newsletters Sales: 1-800-405-0844 Articles Customer Stories Why eMarketer Plans Product Tour Research Topics Mobile Payments in the US Growing Fast, but Still Far from Mass Adoption Fewer than 20% of smartphone users use proximity mobile payments this year, but mobile peer-to-peer payments are growing November 7, 2016 | Retail & Ecommerce | Mobile Share Email Print Despite double-digit growth this year and next, Americans’ use of mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, as well as branded apps that include mobile wallets like the Starbucks app, Walmart Pay and CVS Pay, will not reach mass adoption in the foreseeable future. This year, 38.4 million Americans 14 and over will have used their mobile phones to pay at the point of sale at least once in the preceding six months. That’s just 19.4% of US smartphone users. By 2020, that figure will grow to 33.1% of smartphone users. “There are several reasons why US consumers aren’t yet making proximity payments en masse,” said eMarketer analyst Bryan Yeager. “There are still concerns about security, a patchwork of merchant acceptance, and a lack of perceived value in replacing the use of cash or card with the tap or scan of a smartphone. Nonetheless, eMarketer expects those issues to be addressed over the next several years, which will help propel growth.” Proximity mobile payment users in the US skew young, with 11.9 million in the 25-to-34 age group in 2016—31.1% of the total. By 2020, this group will exceed 21 million, though its share will decrease to 27.8% as older consumers start paying at the point of sale with their phones. In 2017, close to 55% of all US proximity mobile payment users will be under 35, and more than three-quarters will be under 45. This year, proximity mobile payment transactions will grow 183.3% to $27.67 billion. That figure will more than double next year to reach $62.49 billion. By 2020, proximity mobile payment transactions are expected to equal $314.13 billion. “More than 90% of US retail sales ($4.45 trillion) will occur in traditional contexts like brick-and-mortar stores this year, which is where consumers primarily make proximity payments,” said Yeager. “Increasing acceptance of proximity payments at a wider array of merchants is pushing average spend via such methods higher, which helps explain why transaction value is growing far faster than the number of users.” Mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) payment apps, such as Venmo and Square Cash, have been more widely adopted by US consumers than proximity mobile payments. eMarketer defines a mobile phone P2P payment as a transaction made between two individuals using a mobile phone as a payment method via mobile browsers and mobile apps. This year, 45.8 million US adults—nearly one-quarter of US adult smartphone users—will use a P2P payment app at least once per month. That figure will exceed one-third by 2018. The value of P2P mobile phone transactions will total $59.42 billion this year, with that figure growing to $92.10 billion by next year.

Saimin (Blog) - November 7, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail This is the time of year when everyone is waiting for good deals but few other important questions remain uncovered.

Although it mainly features his work experience in WWE, the recent episode disclosed a bizarre Halloween experience of the ‘Human Wrecking Ball’. During his WWE tenure, Ryback was once invited to a Halloween party hosted by the real life brothers, Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas. The only condition was for every guest to attend wearing a costume. In order to find something suitable, Reeves decided to visit a local Wal-Mart. Not to his surprise, it was packed with John Cena merchandise and costumes. Reeves had no other choice but to buy one for himself.  Although he couldn’t recollect most of the events of that night, Reeves remembers the moment when he was watching TV in Bray’s bedroom after taking what he believes were ‘mushrooms’ as his state of mind was altered and he had never felt that way before. Wyatt was amused to witness Ryback, under the influence of mushrooms laughing without any reason. Moreover, on the same night, under the influence of mushrooms, Reeves confessed his love for Wyatt’s wife, which everyone seemed to have laughed off.  The former Intercontinental Champion affirmed that such kind of behaviour was an anomaly: “What happened the rest of that night is so outside of how I normally am. I can’t explain.” Till date, both of them cherish those incidents whenever they meet. Apart from the awkward party story, Reeves also praised the in-ring work of the two brothers. During this edition of the podcast, he stated : “Bray was awesome. He just kind of came in there, and, like, you could just tell this guy was going to be a star, just his promos and there was just something. Him and Bo both.” Ryback, Big Show and Kane were involved in an angle with the Wyatt Family earlier this year. That feud culminated with another ‘heel’ turn of the Big Guy. Within a few months, Ryback and the WWE ended up parting ways.

Gateway Dr. in Marion, Iowa on Nov. 1, 2016. Municipal and economic development leaders are exploring the possibility of expanding public transit services east to encompass this area. (Lynda Waddington/The Gazette) Lynda Waddington The Gazette More stories from Lynda Nov 6, 2016 at 11:00 am | Print View City Manager Lon Pluckhahn and Marion Economic Development Corporation President Nick Glew made the pitch to Cedar Rapids Transit: Expand public transit services farther east, across Highway 13, to the police station and 184-acre business park known as the Marion Enterprise Center. Brad DeBrower, CR Transit manager, answered that call, providing statistics and options to the Marion City Council. One clearly rose above the rest. Marion can expand access and give current riders a convenience boost with a new “circulator” route. With this option, Marion would have a transit bus looping the city throughout the day. Riders would connect with other routes through a hub at Lindale Mall. Current service has two routes — 5N and 5S — that travel between Marion and the transit hub in downtown Cedar Rapids. As their names suggest, one route serves northern portions of Marion, the other serves southern portions. It may seem counterintuitive that a reduction of buses in Marion would be better. But the circulator route would offer a larger service area and save riders time. For instance, Ann Roberts, who I met last spring, is an older Marion resident with mobility challenges who needs accessible bus stops near her destination. Because existing routes loop between Cedar Rapids and Marion, Roberts has a short ride to a stop near the Marion Library, but the return trip is nearly the full route. Each trip to the library requires an extra hour that’s spent simply riding the bus. Transit staff looked at a week’s worth of 5N and 5S data — every trip, every passenger — to explore the possibility of Marion’s requested expansion. They learned most stops are regularly used, and that Marion has three hot spots — apartments along 10th Street near the Linn-Mar campus; apartments at the other end of town near Grand Avenue; and Walmart. “Neither route can absorb additional service without negatively impacting service,” DeBrower said. “We’ve kind of stretched these rubber bands as far as we can without really having to do something differently.” In other words, an expansion requires a trade off. And, except for the circulator, the trade offs would negatively impact current riders. Marion could, for example, extend one route east of Highway 13, keeping service otherwise limited to Seventh Avenue. This would become the only route to the popular Walmart stop. The other route would enter Marion and loop between the popular northern and southern stops at the apartment complexes. DeBrower would like to see this loop travel as far east as 35th Street, but he can’t guarantee it. He’d also like the two routes to intersect at least once so that riders could wait at a shared stop for the bus going east to Walmart. Even so, if the routes don’t intersect twice, riders would be in a worse situation than now — waiting for the intersecting route to go further east, then either riding to Lindale Mall (where they’ll wait again) or the Cedar Rapids hub. Unfortunately, council members seemed drawn to this frustrating option because it could be done at no additional cost. The best option for transit riders, the circulator, has an additional price tag of $167,000 a year. Nevermind that the cost could easily be met with an increase of Marion’s existing 15-cent transit levy rate, which is far less than what’s assessed by other similarly sized Iowa communities. (Clinton is at 69 cents, Fort Dodge at 43 and Ottumwa at 71.) The business park that city and economic development leaders hope to connect to transit was made possible, at least in part, by $3.2 million in city funds. And tax increment financing was used to develop water, sewer, roads and storm sewers, establishing the now “shovel-ready” lots. No doubt public transit access would give the Marion Enterprise Center a marketing boost, but such benefits can’t come at the expense of residents who depend on transit services. Cedar Rapids residents have carried more than their fair share of public transit’s cost. Even with state and federal subsidies, Marion’s yearly contribution has fallen about $100,000 short. Future budgets include increases to address this disparity. But if the city believes public transit is important enough to expand, then it’s valuable enough to justify an investment.

Fielder is the president and founder of Cozy CoverZzz, a club that makes blankets for children in hospitals, homeless shelters and domestic abuse shelters, Fielder said. “They’re like kid-themed blankets with patterns and colors and animals or sports or whatever ones we buy,” she said. Fielder said she got the idea for the club when she participated in SPARTANS WILL. POWER Global Day of Service last year. For the service day, Fielder and a friend went to Grand Rapids to make blankets for kids in hospitals. When she returned to MSU, she checked to see if there was an organization that did something similar on campus, but said she didn’t see one.  Fielder decided to start Cozy CoverZzz, whose name was inspired from the sleeping face emoji, she said. Human biology sophomore Vito Vitale is another member of Cozy CoverZzz. He said Fielder encouraged him to join the club during one of their classes together.  “She was just extremely passionate about it,” Vitale said. “It was a great idea. Once she explained it to me I was all for it, and I knew eventually a lot of other people would join, too.”  Although turnout for the club was low at the first meeting on Oct. 5, both Fielder and Vitale said the numbers grew exponentially for the second meeting. Membership dues for the club are $10 and students have two weeks in between meetings to produce at least one blanket, Fielder and Vitale said. So far, Vitale has made four blankets for the club. During Halloween weekend, he and his roommates, who are also in the club, put on a scary movie and each cranked out a blanket, he said. The materials for the blankets come from Wal-Mart, as it’s generally cheaper than Michaels or Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, Fielder said. She usually gets 30-35 blankets to pass out at their meetings. Instead of using two blankets to produce a single tie blanket, they only cut and tie one so they make twice as many, Fielder said. Vitale likes to go with designs he thinks will resonate with kids more. When making the blanket, it’s hard to keep the ties at the end even. He described tying the blanket as being similar to tying a water balloon and said the first blanket was rough to make, but was worth it. “I feel like there’s not a lot of opportunities where we actually get to give back,” he said. “I guess a lot of clubs are just like resume boosters and people just join like, ‘yeah I don’t really know what I do.’ But you go to a fundraiser every now and again. I guess it helps but here you actually get to see the difference that you’re making. You make the blankets for the kids in the hospital then you can come to the hospital, and actually drop them off.” Sherri Szilagyi, Women and Children’s Shelter manager for City Rescue Mission of Lansing, said when organizations like Cozy CoverZzz drop off blankets to her shelter, they get added to the blanket supply and are given on an as-needed basis. This is to make sure the shelter is being a good steward of the donations it receives.  Some people are overwhelmed at first when they come to the shelter and are in need of many things. After becoming acclimated with their new environment, guests are able to appreciate donations like those made by Cozy CoverZzz, Szilagyi said. “Once here and settled, many guests will share their happiness with their accommodations and care, which includes the nice, warm blankets,” she said. “They are greatly appreciated by our guests and guests are grateful to be able to take the blankets with them when they leave for their new place.” Although they were unable to meet with the children they donated the blankets to at the City Rescue Mission of Lansing, Vitale said as the club donates to more places they will be able to see the difference they are making. Fielder said for Cozy CoverZzz meetings, students can stay just long enough to gather the supplies to make their blankets or they can stay and make a blanket there. The time it takes to make a blanket depends on the person making it, as Fielder said it takes her between 30 and 45 minutes to make a blanket while Vitale said it takes him around an hour. The next meeting will be Nov. 16, Fielder said. Fielder said that she is very thankful to the Associated Students of Michigan State University, or ASMSU, for funding Cozy CoverZzz for the semester and the club is always looking for new members. “It’s really easy and it’s fun and it’s not a big time commitment,” she said. “You can give an hour out of two weeks to help a little kid.”  Want more articles like this?

This massive carrot cake is enough to feed 23,000 people, and a Guinness Book of World Records rep is expected at the Guildford Town Centre celebration. PNG Share Adjust Comment Print SURREY — One giant carrot cake will be served to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Guildford Town Centre next week. The 2.25-tonne slab crafted by Saint Germain Bakery is set to break a world record because, well, no such record exists. A special cake-cutting event took place Tuesdsay — exactly 50 years after the centre officially opened at the corner of 104th Avenue and 152nd Street. On that day in 1966, close to 15,000 people streamed through the region’s newest, most spectacular shopping centre, home to “30 ultra-modern specialty shops and businesses,” according to a full-page ad in the broadsheet Columbian newspaper, the Surrey Now’s predecessor. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE OLD PHOTOS OF GUILDFORD TOWN CENTRE An opening-week sale at the Woodward’s department store featured a Kodak Instamatic camera (with one flash cube) for $14.88, men’s dress shirts for $2.99 and nylon tubeless winter tires for $18.88 each. Other first tenants included Macnaughton Realty, Sherwin-Williams Paints, Orange Julius, Pacific Plywood Building Centre, Sparlings Winter Sports and Stardust roller rink. When planning for the mall began in the early 1960s, developer Grosvenor-Laing envisioned the birth of a new “satellite city” in the forested area of Surrey. Guildford was named after the cathedral city in England, the business and administration centre of the County of Surrey. Rather than “shopping centre,” the description of “town centre” was used because that’s what planners had envisioned. Today, the Ivanhoé Cambridge-owned mega-mall is home to 250 stores, services and restaurants. Last renovated and expanded in 2013, Guildford Town Centre has become a magnet for close to 14.5 million shoppers annually. Anchor tenants include Hudson’s Bay, Walmart, Sears and London Drugs.

Submitted photo Mickey Zhao, head baker and co-owner of the mall’s Saint Germain Bakery, began baking the carrot cake on Sunday (Oct. 30) with the help of staff at the company’s production facility in Richmond. “The cake is going to be big, enough for 23,000 people,” he said. Zhao said he’s donating the food and labour costs – an estimated $20,000 to $25,000. “If we sold this cake to a customer, it’d be for $100,000 or more,” Zhao said. “The recognition for it will be nice.” Tuesday’s anniversary event will include a visit by a Guinness World Records rep, according to Kyla Way, the centre’s marketing director. “We thought this was a great opportunity for us to be the first ones to make the world’s largest carrot cake, and we have a contest along with that,” she said. The first 1,000 people at the event will have a chance to win “karats” in the form of a $1,000 shopping spree at one of the mall’s jewelry stores. A third of the cake, to measure 20 feet by 20 feet, will be donated to NightShift Street Ministries, a Surrey-based charity, Way added. tom.zillich@thenownewspaper.com Newspaper clipping shows construction of Guildford Town Centre.

Many of the nation's major mall operators and the big retailers that anchor them, such as Toys R Us, J.C. Penney, and Macy's, are sticking with what they want to be a new tradition, kicking off the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving Day. Others, including the Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping mall, are closing for Thanksgiving this year after being open for the past several years. Some retailers that are closing cite respect for the holiday, but in truth the cost of being open may be more than the return. "Once you let the genie out of the bottle, it's hard," said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, a mall operator that is closing 72 of its malls for the day. "More retailers are coming to their senses and realizing it is a family holiday and from a business point of view, it's not making much business sense." Stores being open on Thanksgiving started in earnest in 2011 and took a punch out of sales on Black Friday, which had usually launched the shopping season. Many places like Macy's, Target and J.C. Penney have been opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving as they try to outdo others to get first dibs on customers who could easily buy online. But the move has been controversial, as many workers have voiced complaints stores are putting profits over workers' time to be with their families. Some 89 of the 145 properties that Chattanooga, Tenn.-based CBL owns or has interest in opened at 6 p.m. on the holiday last year. While dozens of those will be closed this year, the department stores, movie theaters, restaurants and retailers with exterior entrances have the option to open on Thanksgiving. Other retailers including Office Depot and consumer electronics chain hhgregg Inc. plan to be closed after being open for the past several years. Plenty of retailers, particularly high-end stores like Nordstrom or those like T.J. Maxx that offer discounts every day, never opened on Thanksgiving and have collected goodwill because of that. In reality, analysts say, it's all about stealing share in a market that isn't growing that much. For department stores, the competition is fierce. Last year, J.C. Penney opened at 3 p.m. for the first time, three hours earlier than rivals Kohl's and Macy's. That may have hurt Macy's, which had a weak holiday season. This year, Macy's decided to open an hour earlier at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Penney is sticking to 3 p.m., while Kohl's will be opening again at 6 p.m. Most Sears stores will be open on Thanksgiving for the fourth year in a row, starting at 6 p.m. — the same as a year ago. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, suffered over Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 because it didn't open until midnight, while stores like Wal-Mart and Target began sales earlier in the evening. Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have not announced their plans for this year. But all indications are they'll start the doorbuster sales on the holiday. For many big retailers, covering expenses like paying employees holiday pay is not that costly, said Joel Bines, a managing director at retail consulting group AlixPartners. But for small stores or those with specialized merchandise, it may make more sense to close.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it November 8 HOUSING Supreme Court hears arguments on lending Supreme Court justices signaled they may divide over the ability of cities to use the Fair Housing Act to sue banks for discriminatory lending practices. The high court grappled Tuesday with a case that grew out of the subprime mortgage crisis. A federal appeals court read the Fair Housing Act as giving Miami the right to sue Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. Miami says the banks targeted minorities for riskier loans, leading to foreclosures that cost the city property-tax revenue and forced it to spend more on police and fire services. Some of the liberal justices indicated that they would vote to let the cases go forward. “Everything about this complaint is about racial segregation, it seems to me,” Justice Elena Kagan said. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy suggested that they saw a need to limit the types of suits that could be filed under the landmark 1968 housing law. — Bloomberg News ENERGY Iran, French firm sign $4.8 billion gas deal Iran on Tuesday signed a preliminary $4.8 billion natural gas agreement with the French company Total. It was the first such deal after a nuclear accord with world powers ended international sanctions that had squeezed the nation’s fossil fuel-based economy. The deal, to be finalized next year, is for new development at the vast South Pars gas field and aims to produce 1.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day for domestic consumption and export. Total would have a 50.1 percent stake; China National Petroleum would have 30 percent, and Petropars, a subsidiary of Iran’s national oil company, would have 19.9 percent ownership. — Associated Press Also in Business ● CVS Health’s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales. But revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations, and the company trimmed its outlook. The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion. Adjusted earnings were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts. Revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion in the period, but missed Street forecasts of $45.31 billion. ● U.S. job openings rose in September from the lowest level of the year while hiring slowed, figures from the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed Tuesday. Job openings edged up to 5.49 million, matching median estimates, from a revised 5.45 million in August. Hiring declined to 5.08 million from 5.27 million, while the hiring rate dropped to a four-month low of 3.5 percent. Some 3 million Americans quit their jobs, and layoffs decreased to 1.47 million from 1.69 million. ● Walmart is being sued on behalf of consumers who said the retailer sold products falsely labeled “100 % Egyptian Cotton” from an Indian textile company for years after it first became suspicious of their origin. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, said Walmart questioned the fiber content of Welspun India’s products as early as 2008, but waited until two months ago to halt sales of its mislabeled Egyptian cotton linens, following a similar halt by Target. — From news services Coming Today ● 10 a.m.: Commerce Department releases wholesale trade inventories for September. ● Earnings: Mylan politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Should you run a Black Friday press release? That depends… Should you run a Black Friday press release? That depends… Posted on November 8, 2016 by Brian in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Black Friday is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. It falls the day after Thanksgiving (November 25th this year) and often features great deals on products and services. The question for marketers and publicists is whether it makes sense to run a press release for your business for Black Friday. We will try to answer that. First, if it makes sense to have a Black Friday sale for your business, then absolutely have one. Your customers will likely appreciate it (and may expect it). But as far as a press release goes, you have to remember that a lot of the benefit of an online press release for a small and medium sized business is the Google News/Google boost you get based on targeted keywords in your headline. If your main keywords are ‘Black Friday” and some other general words, the competition in Google News/Google will be so extreme from major media and major retailers that there is almost no way your press release will get much attention. Look at the number of stories even today (https://www.google.com/#q=black+friday&safe=off&tbm=nws) The one caveat might be if you have a very specific niche, that when combined with ‘Black Friday’, might actually get some attention. A ‘long tail’ play on Black Friday. For example, painters in a smaller city could run a press release headline such as “San Rafael painters Contigo Brothers offer Black Friday deals”. You might actually rank ok for niche searches for “San Rafael painters Black Friday”. Or, substitute ‘painters’ for other services (massage, manicure, haircut, steakhouse, hotel, plumbing, roofing, etc). Whatever your product or service, make sure it has enough long tail keywords in the headline to be uniquely non-competitive. You are never going to get many views for your press release for Black Friday deals on Flat Screen TVS, unless you are Target/Best Buy/Walmart/Amazon. You get the idea. PS: The same goes for other major events on specific dates (Cyber Monday, Superbowl, Xmas, Back To School, etc). Unless you are going with long tail keywords in a specific niche, the competition in Google is just too extreme to get much attention for your press release. In general, probably the best way to promote your business around Black Friday and similar events is by a direct email deal to your customer email list.

The Star reports reports that the Ban the Box resolution for Jackson County, Missouri – signed by County Executive Frank White – “does not prevent county hiring managers from performing a background check, or from asking about an applicant’s criminal history in a job interview.” Kansas City’s city government passed a Ban the Box order to stop requiring job applicants to check a box on application forms if they had a criminal record while Missouri state agencies adopted a Ban the Box policy under an executive order issued by Governor Jay Nixon last spring, The Star reports. “The Ban the Box movement claims that convicted felons are unfairly screened out of consideration for employment when they are forced to disclose their criminal history up front,” The Star reports. The full story is at www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article113137963.html. The Ban the Box  movement is spreading rapidly. According to the National Employment Law Project (NELP), more than 100 cities and counties as well as 24 states have adopted Ban the Box policies to delay the criminal history question until later in the hiring process. Large U.S. employers who have taken the White House Fair Chance Business Pledge to Ban the Box include American Airlines, Best Buy, Coca-Cola, Facebook, Google, Hersheys, Lyft, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Staples, Starbucks, Uber, UnderArmour, Walmart, and Xerox.

More than 90 red barrels are currently up at Marysville businesses to collect toys, food and other goods as part of the All City Food Drive which kicked off on Nov. 5. The donations provide the Marysville Community Food Bank with a new supply of food and provide toys at the Marysville Toy Store for the food bank clients as well. "This kicks off the whole season for us," said Marysville Community Food Bank director Dell Deierling. "It plants the seed in people's minds about what's needed." Deierling said that many families hope to make the holidays special and the food bank wants to help in any way they can. "A lot of folks that are limited in their resources want to do something more for their families, so anything we can do that frees up resources for them, like providing food or toys, allows them to do more," he said. While the need for food is only marginally greater compared to other times of the year, the holidays bring out a lot of generosity which is used to stock the shelves of the food bank well into next year. "What we bring in now is not just going to provide the food for the holidays, but helps provide food through May," said Deierling. Deierling said that meats are good to donate, especially from some local stores like Fred Meyer which provide a free turkey to those who buy enough. "Rather than declining those, you can bring them to us and we can put them in our freezer," he said. Canned fruit, canned sauces and butter are more good foods for the holiday season he said. Clients can also take advantage of the Marysville Toy Store which provides free Christmas toys to families in need. Families are referred from the Marysville School District or the Marysville Community Food Bank. The toy store has served more than 1,100 local children each of the last two years, said toy store volunteer Rita Henry. "There's definitely a need. We want all those children to have a Christmas," she said. The store helps spread joy for the holidays. "The only thing that matters to these parents is that 'my kids need to know there's joy out there,'" said Lil Dayton, a volunteer for the toy store. "That's what the toy store does." Dayton recalled one man who came in late to the toy store last year and there was nothing left but the toys that weren't taken, mostly broken ones. "The kids spotted these busted toys and begged to have them ... they were so appreciative of these busted toys because they had nothing," she said. Items for teenagers, "tween" age girls and books are usually the most needed toy donations, said Tara Mizell, one of the organizers of the All City Food Drive. Families also receive coats and mittens at the toy store. Volunteers try to help families in any way they can, said Mizell. Many of those coats are provided by Zumiez. "Zumiez has been huge, they've donated coats and hats and mittens for years. We really, really appreciate that," she said. Last year was also the first year the Marysville Police Officers Association collected coats. They donated 650. "We're excited to see where that goes this year," said Mizell. Marysville Police Officers will again be collecting coats and other cold-weather clothing on Nov. 18 at Fred Meyer from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., and Nov. 19 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Marysville Walmart. Donations can be dropped off at a number of local businesses that have the All City Food Drive's red barrels. Barrel coordinator Mike Ferri said around 90 Marysville businesses are participating this year. "It's grown exponentially over the last five years because as people see the red barrels they'll go back to their business and say 'hey, can we get a barrel here?'" he said. "We just talked that we have to get some more barrels." Deierling encourages local citizens to continue donating. "If there is a feeling that the economy is doing better, we need to remember there is still a really high need in Marysville," he said. "Some of the other regions' need is going down, but here in Marysville the need remains high." More information about the food drive is available at msd25.org/AllCityFoodDrive.

Republican tolerance of Sid Miller is evidence of declining American values For all those voters out there confident in their decisions as they stroll into local polling places, we offer no further evidence of how mistaken many of these same voters have been in the past than Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. It's easy for some Republicans to laugh him off as GOP comedy relief, but a lot of folks in the agricultural industry haven't been laughing since GOP primary voters in 2014 bypassed two eminently qualified Republican candidates and instead chose this rodeo cowboy to oversee our state's farming and ranching sectors. Now a number of Republican women — at least those with any modicum of respect for their sex — have reason to doubt as well. Miller, who proudly assumed the role of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's designated champion in Texas and lists himself a "deplorable," labeled Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, with the sexually derogatory term "c--t" in a tweet Tuesday. When this provoked uproar, his staff claimed his Twitter account had been hacked, but that turned out to be a lie. Then Miller showed his colors: He blamed it all on a staff member. His office has also claimed the offensive tweet was merely a retweet by somebody else, but Miller or his office took the time to repackage the tweet under Miller's own name and brand. Even accepting that they did just retweet someone else's sexually derogatory comment, didn't anyone take the time to read the comment before sharing it? By now we have learned to expect such shenanigans from this office. The diligent Houston Chronicle this year furnished evidence indicating Miller purchased flights to and from Mississippi with an agriculture department credit card so that he could compete in a rodeo. He explained that while he intended to vie in rodeo competition, he also sought to set up meetings with agricultural officials while there. The meetings never happened, but he reportedly won $880 roping calves. Another investigation showed Miller charged taxpayers more than $1,120 to fly to Oklahoma and meet ag officials — except again no meeting occurred. Miller was there to receive a "Jesus shot" from a convicted felon for pain incurred by rodeo injuries. (Miller later pleaded confusion and paid the state back.) This is the same guy who after campaigning as a "fiscal hawk" in 2014 gave out $413,700 in bonuses to his staff in 2015. Ironically, he was handing out bonuses while trying to increase state fees for farmers. No less than Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has correctly dismissed Ag Commissioner Miller's sexually debasing language as "reprehensible" and added: "No true Texas gentleman would ever talk this way." Yet, next time Miller shows up at some local event, we expect many will slavishly welcome him with adoring applause and even a standing ovation, in the process further demonstrating the corruption of our American values. ___ The (Bryan-College Station) Eagle. Oct. 30, 2016. Once election is over, America and Americans must come together We all need to step back and take a breath. We are nearing the end of a long, ugly presidential campaign that has spawned great passions for one candidate or another. That is good: People should be involved in selecting their leaders. Every citizen 18 or older should register to vote and then go to the polls, not just in presidential election years, but every time an election is held. It's the American way — or at least it should be. Four years ago, when President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney faced each other, only 58.2 percent of registered voters went to the polls. In Texas, only 49.6 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. With this year's presidential race drawing to a close in little more than a week, those percentages could be even lower. We hope not, but are not optimistic. The two major party nominees — Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton — are the most unpopular candidates in memory. Trump has no government experience and, while Clinton has spent years working for government, she has dark clouds of scandal surrounding her — including revelations Friday that the FBI has discovered more emails that could raise new questions about her conduct as secretary of State. (FBI Director James Comey later said the bureau's findings remained unchanged.) Both candidates have their own core group of supporters. Each must convince uncommitted voters in sufficient numbers if he or she hopes to win on Nov. 8. And that may be a problem. Many Democrats — especially young voters who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primaries — may decide they simply don't want either candidate and so will stay home on Election Day. For Trump, he has problems with the leadership of his party. Many of them have said they cannot vote for Trump, even though he heads their ticket. Some even have announced they will cross party lines to vote for Clinton. The question now is how many other Republicans will vote for her and how many will stay home or just skip voting for president. We hope voters on either side don't decide to skip voting. Every vote does matter. Author David Foster Wallace said, "In reality, there is no such thing as not voting: you either vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some Diehard's vote." However you vote, we all need to accept that either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will be president come Jan. 20. Third party candidates have no realistic chance of winning; all they do is pull votes away from the major candidates. In past years, while the candidate may grumble about the outcome of the election, acknowledge the victor and get on with their lives. This year is different, though. Whoever is elected in nine days will enter the White House terribly wounded. Trump's repeated epithet of "Crooked Hillary" and Clinton's proclamations that Trump is unqualified and even dangerous will leave whoever wins severely weakened as president. Whoever wins will have to work with Congress — something President Barack Obama and congressional leaders never seemed to grasp. And, a weakened president will have a much harder time dealing with our international friends and enemies. There are further concerns, too, concerns that deal with the future of our republic. In the third and final presidential debate, Trump refused to say whether he would accept the outcome of the election. The next day, amid criticism from Democrats and Republicans, he said he reserved the right to challenge the results if he suspected fraud or other miscounts. That's not what he meant at the debate, though. On Thursday, Sen. Ted Cruz, our very own junior senator, said that is Clinton wins, he and other Republicans just might refuse to consider any nominees she would make to the Supreme Court — as they have done with Merrick Garland, who was nominated by President Obama on March 16 to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Arizona Sen. John McCain, who tried unsuccessfully to become president, said something similar earlier this month. Such comments go against what Americans believe and accept. According to our Constitution, the president — every president — appoints nominees to fill vacancies on the High Court. And then, Congress is supposed to consider the qualifications of a nominee and decides whether to approve him or her or not. The Constitution does not say that only Republican presidents can name a nominee or that only conservative nominees will be considered. Whether we vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, we understand that whoever is president will nominate candidates for the court who reflect his or her philosophy. That's simply the way it works, although it concerns us when we have "Republican" justices and "Democratic" justices. Finally, we are concerned with the aftermath of the election. We understand that supporters of the winner will be elated and supporters of the other candidate will be dejected. But we always — always — have accepted the election results and moved forward, Republicans and Democrats, working together to make our country even stronger. Talk of "taking her out" if Clinton is elected has no place in America. We all lose when we have a president who cannot get anything done. ___ Houston Chronicle. Oct. 27, 2016. AT&T merger: Politicians need to start ringing the alarm on overpowered companies Where is Wright Patman when you need him? A longtime East Texas populist, Patman represented Texas' first congressional district in Washington for 46 years, where he worked as chair of the House Committee on Banking and Currency to block bank mergers and slow the concentration of corporate power. Over his storied career, the maverick politician fought to get World War I veterans their promised bonus payments, stopped Wal-Mart style stores from undercutting mom-and-pop shops, and was the first Democrat to investigate Watergate. In an unlikely alliance, Patman worked closely with Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis on limiting the power of wealthy families, foundations, corporations and banks. Think of him as a cross between Ron Paul and Elizabeth Warren. And we imagine he'd be spitting mad to read about AT&T's plans to buy Time Warner in a $85.4 billion deal. That merger would result in a media company that not only controlled television and internet access — including DirectTV — but also the movies and shows aired over those networks. Experts call it a vertical merger, in which a company buys one of its suppliers, and we're seeing more of them in the media world. In 2009, Comcast had little trouble purchasing NBC/Universal in a similar melding of telecom and media company. But in the past seven years, the United States political landscape has undergone a disorienting upheaval. Both the Republican and Democratic tickets have expressed concern about the AT&T merger. "Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media," vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said on "Meet The Press." The leaders of the antitrust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee have also called for a thorough investigation as to whether it would create a harmful monopoly. And the FCC has to approve that the merger is in the public interest, as well. From Donald Trump's neo-nationalism on the right to Bernie Sanders' left-wing socialism, there's a growing skepticism of concentrated power in the corporate world. This pushback comes after years of bipartisan support for this sort of consolidation. Matt Stoller, a budget analyst on the Senate Budget Committee, wrote in an October essay for The Atlantic website about the turning point when Baby Boomer politicians replaced New Deal populists like Patman. A Great Depression-era fear of monopolies gave way to a new generation that saw large corporations as key to efficient management and new innovation. Looking at the corporate landscape, however, it is hard to deny that we've swung too far. It isn't just a question of whether these super-sized behemoths reduce consumer choice. There's a greater danger of yielding so much power to individual entities that it undermines our republic. As Justice Brandeis said, "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both." We're seeing that play out as our government has no trouble rushing to save banks that have become too big to fail, but is all too slow when mill towns crumble in a changing economy. We also see it as private companies conspire to violate individual liberty. In 2013, AT&T was caught selling customer data to law enforcement at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. The telecom collected cash while authorities circumvented the Constitution. Imagine the sort of power AT&T would wield after this merger. The AT&T-Time Warner deal may end up being worthwhile, but we'd feel more comfortable if it were scrutinized by the likes of Patman or Brandeis. And it has been a long time since men of their caliber held power in Washington. ___ San Antonio Express-News. Nov. 6, 2016. A need for Texans to enroll in ACA The fourth enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act opened Tuesday. The imperative to enroll is undiminished in terms of personal health needs, but there is some added urgency this time around. Full tax penalties come into play next year. The penalties had been phased in amid angst about the so-called ACA mandate for coverage. Federal law requires everyone to have health insurance through the federal or state exchanges, or through an employer. Enrollment ends Jan. 31. Apart from ensuring the obvious societal good that comes with coverage for as many Americans as possible, there is the need to make sure that the pool of those insured is a mix of healthy people and those in need of medical care. Costs stay down with such a balance. The absence of that balance is part of the reason premium costs will go up an average of 25 percent nationally. Too few healthy young people have been signing up. That needs to change. Federal outreach has to be stepped up, though these premium increases also reflect the underpricing some carriers did at the beginning. Some 84 percent of Texans enrolled through the exchanges received subsidies this year. A high number is likely to be eligible in 2017. And despite some departures of private insurers from the exchanges — Aetna and Cigna among them in Texas — 12 carriers are planning to sell through the exchanges in the state in 2017. Despite the rhetoric from Texas elected officials about the ACA, it has been a success. The uninsured rate in Texas declined from 25 percent to 16.8 percent in 2015, with more than 1.3 million Texans enrolled this year. That is more of an impact than the Legislature has managed to make for Texans not eligible for Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. And Texas' uninsured rate still leads the nation, making the state's refusal to expand Medicaid under the ACA a mystery. ACA can be even better for Texas if everyone who is eligible enrolls.

Better inmate conditions are dependent on Sandra Bland settlement having lasting impact A federal judge's sign-off last week of a $1.9 million settlement between Sandra Bland's family, Waller County officials and the trooper who arrested her brings some measure of closure and justice in this tragic case. Of course, nothing can make up for the loss of a loved one in such a senseless way. Bland was found hanged in her jail cell in July 2015, three days after a minor traffic stop went very bad. Her mother, Geneva Reed-Veal, sued Waller County officials and law enforcement for negligence. But if some good can come in this case, it's that the settlement requires improvements in how inmates are booked and supervised at the jail. And there are already signs that it could also lead to statewide reforms, such as better training for jailers and immediate access to medical care for inmates in rural jails throughout Texas. Bland became a national symbol of the escalating tensions between African-Americans and police. Hers was one of several violent encounters that sparked outrage and protests throughout the country. The 28-year-old had just moved to Texas to take a job at her alma mater, Prairie View A&M, when she had the misfortune of being pulled over by state trooper Brian Encinia for failing to signal a lane change. As a dashcam video shows, she became irritated from almost the moment the trooper puller her over. But Encinia's responses suggested an officer who had no interest or proper training in de-escalating the situation. Their clash ended with Bland arrested, thrown in jail and, apparently, distraught over not being able to make the $500 bail. She was found hanged in her cell. Bland said at booking that she previously tried to commit suicide; she should have been checked on every 30 minutes. Encinia was fired and indicted on a perjury charge. It's good to see that lawmakers appear ready to make changes to prevent such tragedies in the future. State Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Houston Democrat and chairman of the House County Affairs Committee, has promised to introduce a Sandra Bland Act in the next session. He says he wants to consider ways to ban stops without probable cause by law enforcement and require additional de-escalation training. Better approaches to dealing with mental illness will also be considered, with more detainees diverted away from jail and into treatment. Those are good places to start. But we've heard these reform promises before. It's incumbent on the feds and lawmakers to monitor progress to ensure that specific reforms are carried out. Nothing will bring back Sandra Bland. But maybe the circumstances of her death can lead to real healing — and steps toward rebuilding trust between law enforcement and the community it serves. That's going to take real action. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(AP) — The old ex-con wakes in darkness. He can't sleep. Not on this day. He checks his watch - 2 a.m. Not yet. He's waited 57 years for this. He'll have to wait a few more hours. Nearly 80, Spellman Bernard Smith Jr. has stolen cars, robbed a drive-in at gunpoint, watched people get killed in prison, watched others OD and die. He's spent nearly half his life behind bars, cycling in and out of cells for robbery, drugs, theft, violating his probation. But he's never done this. Not in all of his 78 years. Fourteen times he might've voted; fourteen times he couldn't. Fourteen times he watched as millions of other Americans chose a president. Fourteen times an outsider. Fourteen times a bystander to democracy. It was the summer of 1957 when Smith robbed The South Drive-In on Campostella. He was 19. Workers were stacking money at the end of the night, which made things easier. He can't remember how much he got away with. He got caught and was convicted - felon. That scarlet letter has dogged him for more than a half-century, whether in or out of prison. He hasn't been able to run for elected office, serve on a jury, get a passport. Or vote. Then came Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Smith was one of the 13,000 felons who applied to have his rights restored after McAuliffe signed an executive order for more than 200,000. The state Supreme Court struck down the order in July, saying he couldn't restore rights en masse, but had to do so individually. So he did. For all 13,000, Smith included. Now the Norfolk man with the white beard is in his bed on Election Day, unable to stay asleep. He nods off for 20 or 30 minutes at a time, but then wakes up. Checks his watch. Not yet, not yet, not yet. He gets up around 6:45. Listens to the blues radio station but finds himself humming the national anthem. When he goes to get ready in the bathroom, he blasts it. Smith pins his political buttons to his chest - made them himself. He says goodbye to his old dog, Lucky. Puts on his red tennis shoes. Time to go. Smith - who goes by Bernard or "Sir Dog" - opens the door of the house his family's owned for generations, off Chesapeake Boulevard. He limps over to the porch steps - bad knee. Because it's tough to walk, he's arranged to have a friend pick him up and take him the mile or so to his polling place: Rosemont Middle School. He limps into the old auditorium, a cane in one hand, an American flag he bought at the nearby Wal-Mart in the other. He makes friends in line. He makes friends as other soon-to-be voters sit around. Smith is the kind of guy who can make friends at the DMV, an emergency room or a prison. Booth No. 5 opens up, and Smith walks to it. A poll worker shows him how to insert his electronic voting card. Then he presses the screen to choose who he wants to represent him as president and in Congress. "Bam!" he says as he taps. "Bam!" Then he votes for a constitutional amendment. "Bam!" And another: "Bam!" It's all over in less than two minutes. He walks away from the booth and starts to sing in a beautiful baritone, loud enough for voters in other booths and the 100-plus people waiting in the auditorium to hear his voice. A poll worker stops him, afraid he might disturb other voters. He limps to the door with his cane and exits. He goes down the path toward the parking lot, past people waiting in line. He raises his flag in the air and waves it. "Yes! Say yes to democracy!" Then he pauses. "By God, I'm doing it." He pauses again. Longer this time. A tear gathers and then hangs fat under his right eye. He wipes it. "I'll cherish this day for the rest of my life." He limps to the car, his chest emblazoned with some new red letters.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The once unlikely prospect of a Donald Trump White House took surprising shape Tuesday night, as a nasty and divisive election careened toward a nail-biting climax that saw the Republican named the next U.S. president. Pushing an anti-free-trade, nativist platform that galvanized white, less-educated American men while turning off many women and minorities, Trump was behind in the opinion polls through most of the presidential campaign. Within a couple of hours of polls closing, Trump had sketched out a potential path to that goal that seemed unimaginable before results started streaming in. Trump broke through a longstanding Democratic firewall, carrying Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — states that hadn’t voted for a GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s. Related John Ivison: Inexplicable Trump victory caught Trudeau Liberals off guard, but Canadians must accept it Kelly McParland: Donald Trump victory launches second American revolution Kevin Libin: Cheer up, Canada — President Donald Trump just might be good for you He needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states, and he did just that, claiming Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and others. His triumph over Hillary Clinton will end eight years of Democratic dominance of the White House and threatens to undo major achievements of President Barack Obama.  But in an acceptance speech early Wednesday morning, Trump took a more conciliatory tone, congratulating Clinton on “a very, very hard-fought campaign” and calling on Americans to “bind the wounds of division.” “We owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country,” Trump said. “It is time for us to come together as one united people…. I will be president for all Americans.” Despite an erratic style that frequently veered off message, Trump connected with working-class white Americans who felt left behind by the U.S. economic recovery. World markets reacted quickly and negatively to the possibility of his winning and implementing economic policies that include tearing up various free-trade deals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures on Wall Street, Japan’s Nikkei index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index all plummeted. “It’s all a little bit crazy now,” Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, told the Washington Post. “Pollsters need to go away and have a holiday — every single one of them should be fired. Markets weren’t prepared for this.” By 11:30 p.m. ET, U.S. media outlets had declared Trump the victor in Florida, an always-critical, vote-rich swing state. The former host of TV’s Apprentice won North Carolina, another lynchpin state, and Ohio, where the vote has lined up with the election results since the 1960s. Trump even won Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and was leading in Michigan, perennial Democratic enclaves, and just barely lost Virginia, where Clinton running mate Tim Kaine was governor. Clinton was vying to become the country’s first female head of state — encumbered by controversies from her years as secretary of state and in the years afterward. By 2 a.m. ET, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta told the crowd at an election event that the Democratic nominee wouldn’t make a speech until later Wednesday morning. PM Trudeau congratulates Donald J. Trump on his election as the next President of the United States: ow.ly/up2b3060ezf—   (@CanadianPM) November 09, 2016 “Get some sleep,” he said. “It’s been a long night and it’s been a long campaign.” In his victory speech, Trump said Clinton called him early Wednesday to concede defeat and congratulate him. On Wednesday morning, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement congratulating Trump on his victory. “Canada has no closer friend, partner, and ally than the United States. We look forward to working very closely with President-elect Trump, his administration, and with the United States Congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security.” Trump was trying to make history as a political outsider who promised to clean up the “swamp” of Washington — yet battled accusations of racism, sexism and questionable business practices. “To be historic, we have to do a great job,” Trump said early Wednesday. “And I promise you that I will not let you down.” In an increasingly polarized political environment, they were two of the most disliked candidates ever to vie for the White House. Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigrants, scrap free-trade deals he considers unfair and better seal the country’s borders. Election day came in the United States at the end of a campaign like few others, pitting Trump, an extraordinary political outsider who broke most of the rules of the game, against Clinton, a political veteran trailed by years of baggage and multiple controversies. Results from Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump As a larger-than-life real estate mogul and reality-television star, Trump was never given a chance when he launched his campaign in June 2015, entering a crowded race for the Republican nomination. He generated controversy from the first day, announcing he would have a wall built along the border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants he suggested were mostly rapists and drug traffickers. Trump continued to draw condemnation as the primary season unfolded and he pursued a combative, politically incorrect strategy. He was lambasted for vowing to bar Muslims from entering the country as a way to limit the risk of terrorism, and to expel millions of illegal immigrants, but also built a powerful core of loyal supporters. By the end of the Republican contest, he had improbably and convincingly triumphed. Clinton, who lost a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2008 to Barack Obama, had at one point been viewed as a shoo-in for the position in 2016. But she faced a surprisingly strong fight from Sen. Bernie Sanders, who challenged a party elite he argued had lost touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans. But she eked out a solid victory over Sanders and strode into the general election ahead of Trump in most polls, despite lingering questions about her use of a private email server while secretary of state, and the Clintons’ relationship to wealthy donors to the family foundation. What followed were a series of twists, turns and tumbles into the gutter that stunned Americans and the world. Trump clashed with the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq and hurled Twitter insults at a former Miss Universe he had criticized for gaining weight. He not only refused to release his income-tax returns as has become tradition for presidential candidates, but seemed to admit that he hadn’t paid personal income taxes for years. But after falling behind in the polls, the Republican crept back into contention, only to see his campaign crater when The Washington Post reported on a decade-old recording in which he talked of kissing and sexually touching women without their permission. Clinton seemed to have the race in the bag. But then she fell victim to an unexpected development herself, as the FBI announced it was looking again at the email-server issue after discovering thousands more emails in the course of another investigation. With barely a day to go before polling started, the bureau announced that it had found nothing that warranted further charges.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Hatchimals Are Best-selling Toy In Amazon Pre Black Friday Sale Posted: Nov 8 2016, 8:00am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 9 2016, 4:11am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The Hatchimals take second and third spot in the Amazon Toy sales charts. The Hatchimals are the hottest Holiday toy of 2016. The demand for these cute interactive hatchlings is already causing prices to triple from the regular $59.99 price. Spin Master, maker of Hatchimals, has already issued a warning that most consumers who want a Hatchimals Egg will not get one in time for the Holidays. The supply is limited for November and demand will only be fully filled in 2017.  Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Despite the shortage, the Hatchimals are listing in the toy best seller chart on Amazon. Amazon has a bustling reseller market for Hatchimals and we have seen in stock alerts for Hatchimals on Amazon as well over the past days. The scale of Hatchimals sales must be quite high considering that Hatchimals are the 2nd and third most selling toy on Amazon in early Black Friday sales. Hatchimals are only topped by the family game Pie Face, which is on sale for $12.99 on amazon.com. In this game you literally get pie (whipped cream) in your face when you lose. Update 11/09: Hatchimals just took over the top spot in the best-selling toy chart. The Hatchimals Penguala Pink egg is the new toy best seller on Amazon. This comes after the Amazon sold new stock of Hatchimals priced at the regular $59.99 price. The best-selling Hatchimals Egg on Amazon right now is the Pink Penguala, followed by the Purple and Blue Draggles. The Pink and Blue Penguala rank at 10th place. Spin Master has underestimated the demand for Hatchimals in the United States. The clever designed Hatchimals push all the right buttons to become a viral hot Holiday toy. To begin with the little creature are extremely cute with their wide eyes. The interaction between kids and Hatchimal already starts inside the egg. Hatchimalls blink with their eyes, make cute noises and knock against the shell. There is surprise factor until hatching as each egg has one of two different colored Hatchimal inside. There are five kinds of Hatchimals with three of them sold exclusively at specific stores including Walmart, ToysRUs and Target. The "Furby inside an egg" toy are shipping world-wide, adding extra constraint to the domestic availability of the toy. UK consumers also facing a shortage already too.  Another sign how big Hatchimals are is the growing availability of third party items for Hatchimals.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Thanksgiving Day shopping — a delight to some, an anathema to others — isn't going away, but some stores are rethinking their strategies on whether it makes sense to be open on the holiday itself. Many of the nation's major mall operators and the big retailers that anchor them, such as Toys R Us, J.C. Penney, and Macy's, are sticking with what they want to be a new tradition, kicking off the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving Day. Others, including the Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping mall, are closing for Thanksgiving this year after being open for the past several years. Some retailers that are closing cite respect for the holiday, but in truth the cost of being open may be more than the return. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Once you let the genie out of the bottle, it's hard," said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, a mall operator that is closing 72 of its malls for the day. "More retailers are coming to their senses and realizing it is a family holiday and from a business point of view, it's not making much business sense." Stores being open on Thanksgiving started in earnest in 2011 and took a punch out of sales on Black Friday, which had usually launched the shopping season. Many places like Macy's, Target and J.C. Penney have been opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving as they try to outdo others to get first dibs on customers who could easily buy online. But the move has been controversial, as many workers have voiced complaints that stores are putting profits over workers' time to be with their families. Some 89 of the 145 properties that Chattanooga, Tennessee-based CBL owns or has interest in opened at 6 p.m. on the holiday last year. While dozens of those will be closed this year, the department stores, movie theaters, restaurants and retailers with exterior entrances have the option to open on Thanksgiving. Other retailers including Office Depot and consumer electronics chain hhgregg Inc. plan to be closed after being open for the past several years. Plenty of retailers, particularly high-end stores like Nordstrom or those like T.J. Maxx that offer discounts every day, never opened on Thanksgiving and have collected goodwill because of that. In reality, analysts say, it's all about stealing share in a market that isn't growing that much. For department stores, the competition is fierce. Last year, J.C. Penney opened at 3 p.m. for the first time, three hours earlier than its rivals Kohl's and Macy's. That may have hurt Macy's, which had a weak holiday season and aims to reverse a sales slump. This year, Macy's decided to open an hour earlier at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Penney is sticking to 3 p.m., while Kohl's will be opening again at 6 p.m. Most Sears stores will be open on Thanksgiving for the fourth year in a row, starting at 6 p.m. — the same as a year ago. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, suffered over Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 because it didn't open until midnight, while stores like Wal-Mart and Target began their sales earlier in the evening. Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have not announced their plans for this Thanksgiving weekend. But all indications are they'll start the doorbuster sales on the holiday. For many big retailers, covering expenses like paying employees holiday pay is not that costly, said Joel Bines, a managing director at retail consulting group AlixPartners. But for small stores or those with specialized merchandise, it may make more sense to close. » Next page...
