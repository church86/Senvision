Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com A family tragedy unfolded Thursday in a series of dramas in Glen Carbon and Highland: a deadly house fire, an infant saved from a sinking SUV, a body recovered in a lake. A woman's body was pulled from the lake. The body was later identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon. She was the mother of the infant. A body found in the Glen Carbon house was a man, a source said. The baby boy was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. He was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. "Fortunately there is something good that can come of this," Lakin said of the child's survival. Authorities were notified about 5:15 a.m. that a house on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon was burning. Six children who were in the house when the fire began escaped. Some of those children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart to call 911, said Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White. The caller said there was a possible victim inside, White said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter until they had put the fire out. The body was removed midafternoon Thursday. An autopsy will be done. A surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows an SUV's headlights switching on in the driveway of the house about 4:50 a.m. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. Around 5:30 a.m. about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon house, a 911 caller notified the Madison County Sheriff's Office that a vehicle had driven into Silver Lake, off Route 143. Highland EMS made it to the lake first and paramedic Todd Zobrist rushed into the cold water and searched the vehicle.  Lakin lauded Zobrist as a "hero," saying he swam out 50 to 75 feet into the lake, did a sweep of the car and found the three-month-old baby floating inside the vehicle with about six or eight inches of air space. The baby was lifeless when Zobrist pulled him from the SUV and Zobrist began CPR on the roof of the vehicle, which was partly submerged, Lakin said. The infant was rushed to a St. Louis hospital. At the same time, authorities launched a boat to search for the driver. They issued a plea for the public's help in finding Cristy Lynn Campbell, a "person of interest." +12  Police have released his photo of Cristy L. Campbell, 32, who is a person of interest in the house fire that killed one person in Glen Carbon, Ill., Thursday morning.  Glen Carbon police Cristy Campbell's body was found around 11:15 a.m. about 400 feet from where the vehicle went into the water, Lakin said. It was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. A gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. Cristy Campbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, according to court records. She identifies Justin Campbell on Facebook as being the father of her children. The divorce was granted by default when he failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. Cristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. A neighbor, Sherry Ricker, said she believed that Justin Campbell was living at the house, a split level on a street of well kept ranch and two-story houses. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. She said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. "She was happier than I had seen her in a long time," Ricker said. All seven children, "to include the infant child rescued from the submerged vehicle," are accounted for and safe, the Madison County Sheriff's Office said in a press release. They are with family members, Lakin said. Court records point to a tumultuous relationship between Cristy and Justin Campbell. In 2005, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse. Prosecutors said he caused bodily harm to Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy L. Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was 16 weeks pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to a year of probation and fined $500. The couple, who by this time had three children, was married on Nov. 3, 2006, at the Madison County Court House. Justin Campbell's probation was revoked when he failed to pay on time and appear in court, and he was arrested in October 2007. The case was closed again in December 2007. In 2010, Cristy Campbell sued her husband for divorce, but withdrew the suit. On April 24, 2012, she alleged abuse again. "He has choked me, he has pushed me several times, he has slapped me in my head, he has pushed me into bricks,” she wrote. A judge granted an emergency order of protection on April 25, 2012, and Cristy Campbell sued again for divorce. On May 10, 2012, the couple appeared in court together and Cristy Campbell asked for the protection order to be dismissed; it was. The divorce was finalized on July 27, 2012. She was awarded custody, he was granted visitation rights. In February 2014, Cristy Campbell requested supervised visitation, alleging that one of the children told her his father had pinched and punched him, and another child said he had been choked. The court ordered that Justin Campbell’s visitation take place at a court-approved neutral location. In May 2014, Glen Carbon Police cited Cristy Campbell after she allegedly allowed a 5-year-old child to leave their home on Dogwood Lane and “wander around the streets of Glen Carbon unattended.” She attended parenting classes in exchange for prosecutors dropping the charge. Authorities said at the news conference that they had answered about 50 calls at the house since 2010, including hangup 911 calls, barking dog calls and some domestic calls. The house stood Thursday with melted siding and a charred roof line. A Spiderman bicycle was propped against a wall, near an angel statue. A manager at Bob Evans restaurant in Collinsville, where Justin Campbell was employed and worked on Wednesday, said the staff is distraught. Campbell was "an outstanding guy," he said, who "loved his kids." Silver Lake is about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon home that burned. Jeremy Kohler, Ashley Jost and Robert Cohen of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this article. Here's our earlier coverage: A deadly house fire early Thursday in Glen Carbon and an SUV carrying only an infant rolling into a lake in Highland are connected, authorities said. The body of a man was found in the Glen Carbon house, and a woman's body was pulled from the lake, a source said Thursday afternoon. The woman was identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Glen Carbon, according to the Madison County Sheriff's Office. The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. The baby was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. The body was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. It was found in a brushy area near the edge of the lake. A gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. An ID found inside a purse in the SUV belonged to a female who lived at the address where the fire occurred in Glen Carbon, the press release said. The man's body found at the house has not yet been identified. Law officers had launched a boat to search the lake and the coroner was called shortly after 11 a.m. Police in Glen Carbon, where one person died in the house fire early Thursday, had asked for help in finding the owner of the home. Cristy Campbell was a "person of interest," police said. By the time of the press conference Thursday afternoon, authorities said they were no longer looking for Cristy Campbell. Six children who were in the home when the fire began all escaped, authorities said. Cristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. "We believe the infant in the lake at Highland could be the seventh in the family," said Glen Carbon Fire Chief Ralph Well. A paramedic went into the water to search the vehicle and found a baby floating in water with about 6-8 inches of air space inside the SUV. The baby was unresponsive when the paramedic pulled him out and the paramedic began CPR on the hood of the SUV, Lakin said. The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital, said Fire Department Capt. Brad Menz. Menz said the SUV appeared to have rolled down a hillside into the lake around 6 a.m. near Illinois Route 143. No one else was in the vehicle, and it was not immediately clear how the car wound up in the water. At least 20 police officers were seen at the house next to where the car went into the lake. It was unclear if there was a connection between the home and the SUV. Detectives at the scene did not answer questions. Campbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, whom she identifies on Facebook as being the father of her children, according to court records. The divorce was granted by default when Justin Campbell failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. Months prior to the divorce, Cristy Campbell sought and obtained an order of protection from the father, alleging abuse. The order was dismissed about two weeks later at the request of Cristy Campbell.  In a news conference earlier Thursday, Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White said two of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart and called 911 after the fire broke out about 5:15 a.m. The caller said there was a possible victim inside, Well said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter it until they had put the fire out. Police informed firefighters that it was a crime scene and possibly related to the Highland incident, Well said. The body inside the house was removed about 3:40 p.m. A surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows the headlights turning on in an SUV parked in Campbell's driveway about 4:50 a.m. Thursday. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway and two small children can be seen in the headlights. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. About 5:01 a.m., a black sedan pulls into the frame and parks across the street from the house. Two men walk in the direction of the Wal-Mart. A few minutes later, the men return to the car, turn around in the cul de sac and sit there as a fire truck comes down the street. The car leaves when the fire truck passes it. Sherry Ricker lives across the street from the Campbell residence. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. She said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. "She was happier than I had seen her in a long time," Ricker said.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.89 -0.55 -0.78% About 6,700 pizzas sold under Wal-Mart's Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative of the supplier said on Thursday. RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547. Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas. The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose & Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR. The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam's Club was not affected. People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible listeria contamination during routine sampling. Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacterium, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems. An estimated 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. In an unrelated case, the CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to the consumption of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery that has led to two deaths.

Thanks for checking out our new design, please let us know if you have feedback SFist is a website about San Francisco View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC SF Indie Online Retailer ModCloth Sold To Walmart by Caleb Pershan in News on Mar 16, 2017 12:40 pm ModCloth via Facebook At an all-hands meeting at its San Francisco headquarters Wednesday, the CEO of online independent clothing retailer ModCloth, Matthew Kaness, disclosed to his staff that the company had been sold to another online retailer, Jet.com. Walmart announced last August that it had acquired Jet, a fast-growing e-commerce site. Jezebel reported news of the sale, which they write will be formally announced tomorrow, disclosing that current ModCloth employees received offer letters from Walmart yesterday and adding that the deal is said to be closing today. ModCloth, a darling among customers for its feminist, body-positive credo, was co-founded by Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger in 2002. An advocate for equal pay and representation for women, Gregg Koger wrote that she and many of her colleagues would take the day off recently to participate in the International Women's Strike. "As the founder of a business that sells to and employs women (in fact, 64% of our workforce is female), it has always been important to me that ModCloth supports women, too. That is part of why the “gender pay gap” is a deeply personal issue for me." By contrast, Jezebel points out that Walmart was sued for discrimination based on gender in 2011 in a case that made its way to the Supreme Court before it was sent to back down to a lower court. Like many other San Francisco-based companies, ModCloth, which employs more than 350 people at its SF, LA, and Pittsburgh offices, was founded in a college dorm room (this one at Carnegie Mellon). Of late, financial difficulties have led to rounds of layoffs employees reportedly refer to as "reapings" for their frequency in a reference to the brutal lottery of the Hunger Games. "When I think about the quality of people I‘ve met at Jet and their ambitions and how it aligns with ours,” Kaness reportedly says in a recording of the meeting provided to Jezebel. "And when when I think about their parent company Walmart, who has the resources — but also has when you’ve spent time researching it and understanding it, they’ve spent a lot of time working on corporate responsibility and environmental initiatives and opportunities for their employees and their careers. I think there’s a lot of overlap culturally with what they’re about and what we’re about. I think over time this is going to become an incredible marriage.” Here, some in the room were said to have been laughing uncomfortably.

Wal-Mart loss prevention personnel notified Bangor police Sgt. Tim Shaw that they had video of a second woman exiting the suspect’s vehicle just two hours after the first two images were released, the sergeant’s report states. Shaw knew the second woman from prior interactions, and after he located her, she told the sergeant that she was another passenger in the car with Michaela Sargent. She said that Sargent “owed her $100 for a drug debt,” but that she didn’t know Sargent was planning a robbery. “Michaela told [the woman] that her mother had given/sent her a money order and she had to cash it at the customer service desk,” Shaw states in the probable cause affidavit for Sargent’s arrest, which is filed at the Penobscot Judicial Center. Sargent did go to the customer service desk, but she didn’t cash a money order. She requested a pen and piece of paper, witnesses said, which she used to write a note that demanded $300 in cash and stated that “she had a gun and not to make a scene,” the affidavit states. The cashier handed over the cash, then was forced to walk to the front of the store with Sargent who left on foot but got into a white car, the document says. The robbery occurred at 9:35 p.m. on March 6. By 4:30 p.m the following day, Detective Gary Decker and Shaw had tracked Sargent to a room at the Ranger Inn where they confiscated a bag of white powder that later tested positive for crack cocaine, the report states. Sargent was allowed to leave the motel room while the officers applied for a search warrant, which was issued at 7:30 p.m. on March 7. The investigators, who included Officer Jeremy Caron, found the shoes and clothing that “she appears to be wearing in the video,” the report states. Bangor Police released that detectives had identified the female suspect as Sargent and she turned herself in at the police station on Sunday, March 12. Sargent was charged with felony robbery, a Class B crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000, as well as misdemeanor unlawful possession of a scheduled drug for the crack found in the motel room. She was taken to Penobscot County Jail and her bail was set at $10,000 during her first court appearance. She remained behind bars on Thursday afternoon, a jail official said.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Maine father who had used shock collar on kids pleads to explosives charge Midcoast man with sex assault history indicted on recent charges Veterans are putting roots down in Maine — as farmers Rockland J.C.

Politics How do you think Trump did this week? Let us know FASHION Wal-Mart adds vintage vendor ModCloth to its growing collection of fashion-focused e-commerce sites ModCloth WWD ModCloth's October collection is the first from fashion director Lizz Wasserman. ModCloth's October collection is the first from fashion director Lizz Wasserman. (WWD) Sharon Edelson | WWD Wal-Mart is getting even more serious about fashion. The retailer is expected to announce Friday that is has bought ModCloth, an e-commerce site known for selling vintage clothing and its own line of apparel in a full range of sizes. The price of the deal was not available and the retailer did not reply to a request for comment. Wal-Mart has been gaining style cred with a string of e-commerce purchases. The retailer in January bought Shoebuy, an apparel and accessories site for $70 million from IAC. The move was seen as a turning point for Wal-Mart in terms of fashion, and the deal was aimed at Amazon, since Shoebuy is a direct competitor of the Amazon-owned e-tailer Zappos. Wal-Mart in February followed up its Shoebuy acquisition, paying $51 million for Moosejaw, a web site selling apparel and footwear with an outdoor focus. Hayneedle, a home furnishings and decor e-tailer is also part of Wal-Mart’s stable. What the deals all have in common is that the e-commerce sites target more affluent shoppers than Wal-Mart’s typical customer. Shoebuy sells 800 brands, some including suede boots for $750 and Baffin parkas for $798.94. Moosejaw sells more than 400 brands such as Patagonia, The North Face, Marmot and Arc’teryx, as well as apparel for yoga, biking, skiing and swimming, among other sports.

(ModCloth / WWD) Jet.com, which Wal-Mart in August acquired for $3.3 billion, has facilitated and fueled the retail giant’s interest in fashion and upscale shoppers. Prior to the Jet.com acquisition, the Bentonville, Ark., behemoth demurred when asked about its designs on fashion, pointing to its basics business. Jet.com, which adds 40,000 new shoppers each month and averages 25,000 orders a day, has also been seen as Wal-Mart’s attempt to tackle the online juggernaut that is Amazon. “Jet attracts a more affluent, more urban and younger customer,” Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said Tuesday at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer and Retail Technology conference. “Some suppliers don’t want to sell on walmart.com, but want to sell on Jet.com. Marc’s [Lore, president and ceo of Wal-Mart global e-commerce] has got some ideas of what Jet might be in future.” McMillon explained that Wal-Mart’s recent e-commerce acquisitions have been driven by the web sites’ assortments. “It’s not very complicated; the customer wants great assortment, price and service, and we haven’t been delivering as well. [Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Hayneedle] are great, but they don’t have enough money to go market their brands and scale them. By joining Wal-Mart, they can make their products available through Wal-Mart and Jet and they can scale faster.” Wal-Mart has aggressively grown its online Marketplace to 30 million stockkeeping units, making it the third-largest GMV retailer. “What we offer starts with the assortment,” McMillon said. The Marketplace offering has changed enormously with J.Mendel long dresses, $3,107.06; Stella McCartney coats, $2,095; Vionnet wrap skirts, $2,085; Moncler and Gamme Rouge jackets, Dolce & Gabbana cocktail dresses, and various Giorgio Armani styles. Wal-Mart seems more eager to develop private-label brands. “We have resourced private brands,” McMillon said. “We have more talent there. We have footwear and apparel — and we’re investing in that.” ModCloth, which has gone through two rounds of layoffs, may have found McMillon’s pitch about scaling faster, compelling. While the site’s sales reportedly reached $150 million by the end of 2015, ModCloth has been having a difficult time turning a profit. Items on the site include a Hopes & Cheers shirtdress for $89; Work to Play A-line dress, $64.99; Eclectic Academic blazer, $119.99, and Whisker Takes All Arc’teryx denim jacket, $79.99. ModCloth in 2002 was founded in a college dorm room by high school sweethearts Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger. The company has grown to 350 employees in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. ModCloth sells its exclusive apparel collection in a full range of sizes, “because we believe fashion is for everyone,” its web site says. The web site talks about its “community” and features extensive product ratings by consumers. Modstylists are available by phone to help with personal styling, bridal and wardrobing free of charge. The company operates a store in Austin, Tex., which it claims is designed to change the way women shop.

Lore decided make the best use of the newly expanded talent pool and streamlined the organization giving online buyers full control of all the various online channels which includes first party, marketplace and direct shipments by suppliers. He also said the mass audience sites of Walmart.com and Jet.com will continue to look for ways to share merchandise when possible and though operating independently, the backend inventory will be aligned. Lore also said he wants Moosejaw, Hayneedle and ShoeBuy merchants to oversee and manage those specialty categories of outdoor, home and footwear. All of the changes, while applauded by Wall Street analysts, have raised questions by suppliers about how it will impact relationships and opportunities to grow sales. Jane Ewing, senior vice president of digital acceleration at Walmart U.S., recently spoke to suppliers about the changes at the retailer’s Supplier Growth Forum in Bentonville. (Talk Business & Politics received a transcript from the event which is the basis for this report.) Ewing said the top questions from suppliers about these changes dealt with how they will best work with store buyers and online merchants in the future, given that Walmart U.S. wants all items sold in stores to also be offered online, with the exception of items that require special handling over hazard concerns. BUSINESS REALIGNMENT Ewing reiterated to suppliers that buyers for store merchandise will also handle online business. She said these buyers will choose and buy items for stores and for online, but it will be the online buyers who focus on the customer end of the business by managing and monitoring the first party and third-party marketplace inventory as it’s ordered by customers. She said the online merchants are located in New England, New Jersey, California and elsewhere. Ewing said it’s the online merchants who will determine the fulfillment options best suited for customer’s needs. Walmart U.S. continues to bring in deeper category expertise in the areas of home merchandise. Suppliers were told that Hayneedle CEO Jon Barker will oversee Matt Baer, general manager for the home category which includes furniture, appliances and storage as well as major appliance for Walmart U.S. in-store and online. Rebecca Gray is general manager for the large home category and is reporting to Barker. Gray is responsible for lawn garden, bed and bath, home decor and as well as kitchen and dining, again for the retailer’s multi-channel approach. Shelley Huff is the vice president of private and proprietary brands as well as general merchandise, and is also reporting to Barker. Her duties also involve in-store and online. In the entertainment category, Lore set up a multi-channel team with Darren MacDonald in the lead role of group general manager for Walmart Entertainment in the U.S. and e-Commerce divisions. MacDonald oversees five executives in various item specialties. Terrance Oliver is the general manager for electronics overseeing products online and in stores. Mario Pacini is in a similar role overseeing video games, books and other media for the retailer’s various shopping channels. Shrenik Shah is the general manager of music, arts and crafts for instore and online. Also reporting to MacDonald is Carrie Huie as general manager for photo and print and Chris Sponiar, general manager for toys, games, hobbies and seasonal items instore and online. It’s expected Lore will realign the outdoor and footwear management in the coming weeks with the acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw. Those likely changes were not shared with suppliers in the recent meeting. Lore did tell the media during a Feb. 21 earnings call the retailer would work to line up the best category talent in the areas of footwear, outdoors and adventure gear and any other speciality retailer Wal-Mart should acquire. When asked what categories were appealing, Lore said there were plenty of areas of opportunity and the retailer is actively looking. Analysts polled on the topic by the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal like the areas of baby, apparel, pet and perhaps hardware as good fits for the retail giant to consider. CONTENT PUSH Ewing told suppliers Walmart U.S. is working diligently to improve in-stocks, improve customer experiences online and in-stores and will rely on suppliers to help make that happen in part by providing better product content beginning April 1. She said Walmart eCommerce is about having many products and expanding assortment with good quality descriptions as the retailer again hammered home the need for suppliers to provide more item content to the retailer in order to enhance online and in-stores in concert. At the very minimum, Ewing said good content includes: • Powerful, concise title • Multiple images and videos • Full product attributes • Substantive reviews as well as questions and answers. Ewing told suppliers there will be a new process to add online content coming their way April 1. She said 10 companies have been approved for suppliers to work with to upload content to Walmart.com. She said after the in-store items are built up online, Wal-Mart expects suppliers to “top if off” with additional content for its online presences. Ewing also outlined the following steps Walmart U.S. is taking to ensure that store items are sold online. • Step 1: Store buyer negotiates the cost for store and .com purchase. The suppliers are asked to send in a sample of the product in its final packaging. • Step 2: Order specialist build the item for stores using the current content process and that store information is then loaded into Walmart.com item file. • Step 3: As of April 1, suppliers will be required to add online description, image and product features through using the Walmart supplier center help or a third-party content service provider. • Step 4: All items should be online accurate and complete within six weeks prior to the item launch. Ewing also discussed several ways Walmart U.S. and Walmart.com plan to optimize the supply chain. She said suppliers must ensure accurate case and product dimensions and when possible make the item conveyable among the various channels of in-store and online fulfillment which can vary widely. She said the latter is a must as consumers want to get their product in multiple ways today. Ewing said the same fulfillment centers for Walmart.com are now being used for Jet.com. This should simplify the back-end for most suppliers. For instance, once a product is set up by a buyer on Walmart.com, it should flow to the other sites such as Jet.com. If the supplier doesn’t want to sell on the other sites they can work with the category manager to avoid that happening. She said if suppliers are shipping directly to fulfillment centers the online replenishment team will handle. Otherwise, the Bentonville replenishment team will handle. ––––––––––––––––– Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

To do so, the chain is taking a few pages straight out of Wal-Mart's playbook. Quotes in the article Dollar General Corp DG ▼ 72.33 -0.87 -1.19% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.89 -0.55 -0.78% Following another slowdown in sales at its established shops, Dollar General on Thursday outlined its strategy to drive the business forward. While that plan includes the addition of 1,000 locations this year, it also incorporates investments that should boost performance at its existing stores. Here's what the company is doing: Doling out pay increases to managers It's no longer enough for retailers to compete on price alone. To improve the cleanliness and availability of products in its stores, Dollar General will take a 16 cents per share hit to boost compensation for its managers and ramp up their training. In the stores where it's already rolled out these changes, Dollar General has seen lower turnover among managers and hourly employees, CEO Todd Vasos said on the company's earnings call. It's also seen higher sales in those locations. This decision follows Wal-Mart's $2.7 billion investment into better training and pay for its employees, which it has credited for higher customer service scores. Investing in lower prices There's an all-out price war happening across retail. That includes both Dollar General and Wal-Mart. Shortly after Wal-Mart said it would move faster to lower prices, Dollar General rolled out price cuts on hundreds of items across 17 percent of its stores. These locations have performed better than the chain average ever since, Vasos said. While the company will continue monitoring prices, it doesn't anticipate further price cuts at this time, the CEO said. Bringing in fresh produce Dollar General's food offering has traditionally skewed toward packaged goods. But as its customers ask for healthier options, the retailer sees more opportunity in perishable items. The company is already testing fresh produce in some of its stores, including the 41 locations it purchased from Wal-Mart last year after it shuttered the Express format. Dollar General will now expand that pilot to some of its smaller shops. Wal-Mart has made fresh produce a key piece of its turnaround plan, as it drives more frequent visits from shoppers. While Vasos acknowledged there's stiff competition in fresh food, he said the company's massive fleet and small shops give it a competitive advantage. Going smaller Dollar stores are already a fraction the size of a Wal-Mart Supercenter. But as Dollar General peppers the U.S. with new shops, it's making those locations smaller. The company plans to open an additional 160 small shops this year. At 6,000 square feet, these locations cater to central metropolitan and rural areas. That will bring the total number of these shops to 250. Meanwhile, Dollar General is testing an even smaller 3,600-square-foot store that serves millennials living in urban areas. The expansion of these stores comes as Wal-Mart grows its Neighborhood Market footprint. Making a bigger bet on digital Dollar General lags much of the retail industry when it comes to digital commerce, but the chain is putting a bigger emphasis on technology. Though Vasos was mum on specifics, the decision comes as more low-income consumers purchase mobile devices, the CEO said. Becoming more digitally savvy should also help Dollar General attract millennial shoppers, whom Vasos says are playing a bigger role in its sales. Wal-Mart has also been rolling out upgrades to its website and mobile technologies, including the ability for shoppers to pay directly from its app. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

(Courtesy | Walmart) Print Email Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com By Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com The Grand Rapids Press on March 16, 2017 at 2:50 PM, updated March 16, 2017 at 2:58 PM comments GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- More than 3,500 Walmart employees in West Michigan received bonuses totaling $914,000 after the retailer posted a strong fourth quarter, the company said. The bonuses, added to workers' last paychecks along with an annual raise, were part of $157 million Walmart paid to 850,000 U.S. workers overall -- including $4 million paid out in Michigan. The West Michigan total, which covers employees at 20 stores, works out to an average bonus of about $261 per worker. The maximum payout was $550, according to a company representative. Walmart has offered performance bonuses for hourly associates dating back to the early days of the Arkansas company. The current incentive program, called MyShare, has been in place since 2004. The latest round of bonuses come after the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer reported its best quarter of the year for store sales, which were 1.8 percent higher than a year earlier. During those same three months, the company's profits fell 18 percent. The quarterly bonuses are tied to the performance of the stores where the employees work. "We're proud to be leaders in the new world of retail. No other retailer offers as wide a range of jobs, training opportunities, room for advancement, benefits and the opportunity for financial advancement," said Wei Ming Harrer, the retailer's regional manager in a statement. "We have invested in wages and training to create a system that can help our associates go as far as they want to go." Walmart has 108 stores in Michigan with more than 17,000 employees. In the last year, the stores paid $112 million in taxes, the company said. In its 2017 fiscal year, publicly-traded company reported a profit of $13.6 billion on sales of $485.9 billion. Walmart says it has invested billions of dollars over the last two years in training, education and higher wages for its 2.3 million global workforce. In the last year, Walmart said its U.S. operations promoted more than 200,000 employees, including 4,279 in Michigan, to jobs with higher pay and more responsibility. The company also moved 3,228 workers in Michigan to full-time from part-time jobs.

I spoke to a Lubbock Walmart deli associate under the condition on anonymity, and they stated that some of these pizzas were in Lubbock locations. None of the pizzas meeting the information below are currently for sale. But that doesn’t mean you might not already have one in your freezer. According to our friends at The Consumerist: The affected pizzas were sold under the Marketside brand, and the variety is an Extra Large Supreme Pizza. They’re 16″, and the lot code is 20547. Look for establishment 1821 on the round USDA inspection mark that appears on all foods with meat in them. For more information on the recall, you can visit the FDA’s website.

Posted 16 Mar 2017 19:10 Updated 17 Mar 2017 01:15 A sign is seen inside a Dollar General store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. May 23, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. discount retailer Dollar General Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and said it would raise wages for store managers, replicating similar moves by larger retailers such as Wal-Mart . The dollar store chain said on Thursday it would hike compensation and provide more training for its store managers, a strategy that it hopes will improve service quality in stores over time but will pressure earnings this year. Wal-Mart in 2015 had said it would spend US$2.7 billion on wages and training, a move it said has helped improve service quality and boost sales. A tight labor market and rule changes related to overtime pay have made other retailers raise wages as well. Dollar General said stores where it had already introduced pay hikes for managers had seen higher sales and greater employee retention. The moves come as Dollar General and larger rival Dollar Tree Inc face stiff competition from Wal-Mart and other grocery retailers, which have been discounting aggressively, even amid falling food prices, to win customers. "We don't see a further (price reduction) needed because we are priced very, very aggressively in most of our areas today, if not all," Dollar General Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a post-earnings call with analysts. The company said it had slashed prices on about 450 best-selling products in less than a fifth of its stores starting in mid-2016, which helped lift sales. "They are doing the right thing ... they are not going to be the low-price leader, but they're going to be in a range that is acceptable to their customer that doesn't cause them to lose to the competition," said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Dollar General's sales rose 13.7 percent to US$6.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, helped by higher average spending at its stores, even as store traffic declined slightly. Analysts had expected sales of US$5.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company said it expects earnings of US$4.25 to US$4.50 per share for the year ending Feb. 2, 2018, largely below the average analyst estimate of US$4.39. The forecast includes about US$70 million earmarked mainly for the wage hikes. Net income rose 10 percent to US$414.2 million or US$1.49 per share in the quarter, beating the average estimate of US$1.41. Dollar General's shares were up 3 percent at US$74.96 in midday trading. Up to Wednesday's close, they had fallen 1.7 percent this year.

Fair play Kevin! Kevin Westley has an inventive solution to the annual issue of offensive Irish merchandise leading up to St. Patrick’s Day. Go to your local big box stores, buy all the t-shirts emblazoned with drunken stereotypes you can find, keep them in your garage or car trunk so they never see the light of day, and return them promptly on March 18. “Put them on your credit card and you never spend a dime,” he told IrishCentral. (Provided the store's return policy offers a full refund, of course.) Westley, a decorated Irish dance instructor and radio host in Long Island, New York, came up with the idea last year. Like many in the Irish American community, Westley had grown increasingly weary over the years of the green t-shirts that appear in stores right after Valentine’s Day, bearing slogans like “Kiss me, I’m drunk or Irish or whatever,” or “I’m so Irish I sweat alcohol,” or “Irish car bombs make my clothes fall off.” 3 Whenever he’s in a store and sees such t-shirts, Westley said he always makes a point of speaking to the manager, explaining why they are offensive, and asking that they be removed from the shelves. But the answer, he said, is almost always the same. “The manager will say I have to talk to corporate about it,” and corporate will rarely respond. Last year, after encountering questionable t-shirts at three area Walmarts, Westley lodged a complaint with Walmart’s corporate offices. From them he learned that it was in fact the decision of the individual stores to carry the t-shirts. See more: Offensive Irish t-shirts that never should have been made (PHOTOS) Fed up with the cycle of the stores and corporate skirting responsibility, Westley went to the Walmarts near him and bought all the stereotyping t-shirts he could find – almost $900 dollars worth. “The idea is to take the t-shirts off the shelves,” he explained. He took the shirts home and put them in bags and storage boxes. Then, the day after St. Patrick’s Day, he drove to Walmart and returned the t-shirts. 3 One of the t-shirts Westley purchased “At the customer service desk I kept letting people pass me in line because I knew it was going to take a while,” he said. Eventually the representative called him to the desk and got started on the returns. He was able to return all the shirts at the same store. It took over an hour. Rather than the annoyed reaction he was anticipating, Westley said she was interested in his strategy. “She asked why I was doing this and I explained it’s because they’re very offensive,” he recalled. “She turned out to be a Sunday school teacher and she told me that the previous Sunday she had been trying to teach her students about St. Patrick’s Day. She agreed with me that they were offensive. “So then I tried to explain that you don’t really see this for any other holiday. It’s just that for some reason people feel they can get away with it for St. Patrick’s Day.” This year, he has already purchased $400 worth of the t-shirts. He said the response from friends and fellow Irish Americans has been encouraging, but that so far no one has taken him up on his call encouraging others to follow a similar tactic.  “I invite everyone, especially my brothers and sisters from the Ancient Order of Hibernians and Lady’s Ancient Order of Hibernians, to go to your local Walmart,” he recently shared in an e-blast. “If they are selling offensive T shirts, ask to speak to the store managers. If they don’t comply with your request to remove the shirts, buy all the offensive shirts. Leave them in the trunk of your car and return them on March 18. Also, in honor of St. Patrick, do not purchase anything from Walmart for the month of March.” In fact, he said that the most disheartening response so far has not been from Walmart but from other Irish Americans online who hear about what he’s doing and tell him to get a life. “I’ve been entertaining in the Irish community for 30 years, but every once in a while you see how we abuse each other, and that's the disappointing thing,” he said. “We should be standing together.” Will you be paying a visit to your local stores after learning about Kevin’s strategy?

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Mar 16, 2017 at 10:19AM When a company moves from being a start-up to becoming a more mature operation, it often loses some of what made it great in the first place. Once infrastructure, systems, and layers of management have been put in place, it becomes more difficult to charge forward, sometimes simply because it's harder to change direction when steering a larger ship. Both Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have been mature companies for a long time, but the two chains are each taking clear steps to make sure the entrepreneurial spirit has a place in their organizations. Wal-Mart has done so by putting Marc Lore, the serial entrepreneur who led Jet.com, which Wal-Mart purchased for $3.3 billion, in charge of its digital operations. Starbucks has taken a different approach, having both a dedicated executive in charge of leading entrepreneurial efforts and putting its outgoing CEO, Howard Schultz, in charge of its start-up effort to launch a premium brand. Wal-Mart ships online orders from fulfillment centers and its stores. Image source: Wal-Mart. What is Wal-Mart doing? In giving Lore the keys to its digital operations, Wal-Mart changed its entire way of thinking. That became evident when Walmart.com made the bold move of eliminating its $50-a-year membership, which gave customers access to unlimited two-day shipping, and replacing it by making that perk free for any qualifying order over $35. That move screams start-up. It's a money-losing action that will hurt the bottom line, but which should build audience share over the long term. That's the kind of thing Lore did at his previous start-up, Quidis (which owned Diapers.com), and at Jet.com, because in order to compete in an online retail market dominated by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), you have to disrupt conventional thinking. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon arguably bought Jet.com as much to secure Lore's services as he did to acquire its technology or customer base. The CEO also seems willing to allow his new hire to operate in the fashion he has become known for. "If Marc can be Marc within this company, then great things are going to happen," McMillon said at the company's October investor day conference.  What is Starbucks doing? Schultz actually built Starbucks as we know it from the ground up as an entrepreneur and he has clearly tried to keep that spirit alive over the years as his company has remained a pioneer, even as it became a global behemoth. This has led to failures like the company's soda line and its efforts to have an afternoon/evening menu, but it has also had great successes like the chain's technology. Starbucks was the first major restaurant brand to offer digital payment and mobile ordering, two technologies that are becoming standard across the industry. Those are some impressive feats, but Schultz clearly had an itch to go back to his entrepreneurial roots in a way he could not while running a company as large as Starbucks. To make that happen, he decided to leave his CEO job in order to take on a new challenge focusing "on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats." In his new job, Schultz plans to try to once again revolutionize how Americans drink coffee. The first time he did that he brought about his vision of a "third place," after work and home, that became the cafe chain. Now he's going to develop the company's high-end Roastery and Reserve brands -- an entrepreneurial effort that attempts to build a wine-aficionado-like experience for coffee lovers on a global level. Schultz, however, is not the only person attempting to keep the start-up spirit alive at Starbucks. The company also employs Richard Tait, founder of the game company Cranium, as senior vice president and entrepreneur in residence. In addition to his own start-up journey, Tait spent years at Microsoft, where he also operated as an entrepreneur in residence, creating numerous start-ups within the company, according to his Starbucks biography. Tait's job, which he has held for almost a year, gives him a broad portfolio that includes "helping the company foster a culture of innovation." In addition, he is charged with applying "an entrepreneurial lens to Starbucks operational planning and prioritization efforts across the organization, helping improve the speed and agility of decision-making." On his LinkedIn profile, Tait calls himself "Chief BoomBoom at Starbucks" and describes his role as working with the company leadership to bring the "energy and passion of a start-up inside the rhythm of a large corporation." Tait reports to incoming CEO Kevin Johnson and also works in product development as part of the steering committee for Starbucks' Innovation Lab. Get big, stay small In many ways, both Wal-Mart and Starbucks are following a path blazed by Amazon. The online retailer's CEO, Jeff Bezos, has famously and regularly used the phrase "today is day one." The company even named part of its Seattle office complex the "Day One" building, around the idea that the company is always a start-up. It's a philosophy that has empowered Amazon to act in its own long-term interest at the expense of quarterly results. Wal-Mart is clearly embracing the idea that continued growth requires breaking the mold and it has empowered Lore to make long-term moves that sacrifice short-term profit margin. Starbucks has always been a bit like Amazon as Schultz and Bezos seem to share a lot when it comes to vision, but Schultz's taking on a purely entrepreneurial role outside the core brand doubles down on that thinking. Add Tait to the mix and you can see that Starbucks' outgoing CEO wants to make sure that his company, no matter how big it gets, embraces the spirit that led to its growth in the first place.

 An indie retailer with a cult following was reportedly acquired by Walmart — and some customers are 'devastated' Kate Taylor Mar. 16, 2017, 10:57 AM 5,679 facebook linkedin twitter email print Modcloth Facebook Some customers are rebelling after news broke that the trendy clothing company ModCloth is being acquired by Walmart's e-commerce subsidiary.  Jezebel first reported Wednesday that Jet.com, which was bought by Walmart for $3 billion in August 2016, had acquired the clothing company. Customers quickly took to social media to complain about the news, arguing that ModCloth's progressive messaging is at odds with retail giant Walmart's business practices.  "I'm so devastated, I've been shopping with Modcloth since 2008. I also stopped shopping at Walmart around that time," wrote one of dozens of upset customers on ModCloth's Facebook page. "Walmart has horrid business practices, doesn't believe in the power of a union, and refuses to give their employees anywhere near a living wage. I'm sorry, even if they're your parent company — I cannot in good standing support your business anymore."  #modcloth died today. It killed itself. Death by #walmart. Disgusting. — (((em))) (@_spacegandalf) March 15, 2017 Losing @ModCloth to @Walmart is like that one really sensitive, quirky boyfriend who you thought was the one leaving you for Ivanka. — Anne of No Gables (@anneofnogables) March 15, 2017 Deleting the @ModCloth app. I can't support you now that you are owned by Walmart,a company that is against living wages. — magicshelle (@magicshelle) March 15, 2017 "I will not support [Walmart] as they are a horrible company that I have not shopped at because of their practices,"  wrote another. "You were inclusive, unique and independent. You are selling out to a company that has policies to keep their employees on government assistance. I will not support them." So disappointed @ModCloth that you are letting corporate greed take over a beloved brand. Guess I'll have to shop somewhere else. — Vickiepickles (@vickiepickles) March 16, 2017 So I guess I won't be shopping at @ModCloth anymore. A @Walmart by any other name is still a damn Walmart. pic.twitter.com/BnekugQmDT — Emily B (@cheesielove) March 16, 2017 In the comments of the Jezebel story breaking the news, ModCloth shoppers were already researching alternative retailers that sell vintage-inspired garb.  Walmart, the country's largest retailer, has been slammed by critics for its low pay and anti-union tactics. The company raised its corporate minimum wage from $9 to $10 in 2015.  Since it was launched in 2002, ModCloth has gained a reputation for its inclusive, pro-feminist business practices. The retailer found fans with its plus size offerings, and co-founders Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger have been vocal about their progressive, anti-Trump political views.  ModCloth didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.  Meanwhile, Walmart has been eager to expand its e-commerce offerings in an effort to compete with Amazon. Buying Jet.com was a major part of this plan, and the reported ModCloth acquisition would add another key online retailer to the retail giant's portfolio — if customers are willing to keep shopping at the indie retailer under its new ownership.  Get the latest Walmart stock price here.

Posted 16 Mar 2017 19:10 Updated 17 Mar 2017 01:15 A sign is seen inside a Dollar General store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. May 23, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. discount retailer Dollar General Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and said it would raise wages for store managers, replicating similar moves by larger retailers such as Wal-Mart . The dollar store chain said on Thursday it would hike compensation and provide more training for its store managers, a strategy that it hopes will improve service quality in stores over time but will pressure earnings this year. Wal-Mart in 2015 had said it would spend US$2.7 billion on wages and training, a move it said has helped improve service quality and boost sales. A tight labor market and rule changes related to overtime pay have made other retailers raise wages as well. Dollar General said stores where it had already introduced pay hikes for managers had seen higher sales and greater employee retention. The moves come as Dollar General and larger rival Dollar Tree Inc face stiff competition from Wal-Mart and other grocery retailers, which have been discounting aggressively, even amid falling food prices, to win customers. "We don't see a further (price reduction) needed because we are priced very, very aggressively in most of our areas today, if not all," Dollar General Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a post-earnings call with analysts. The company said it had slashed prices on about 450 best-selling products in less than a fifth of its stores starting in mid-2016, which helped lift sales. "They are doing the right thing ... they are not going to be the low-price leader, but they're going to be in a range that is acceptable to their customer that doesn't cause them to lose to the competition," said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Dollar General's sales rose 13.7 percent to US$6.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, helped by higher average spending at its stores, even as store traffic declined slightly. Analysts had expected sales of US$5.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company said it expects earnings of US$4.25 to US$4.50 per share for the year ending Feb. 2, 2018, largely below the average analyst estimate of US$4.39. The forecast includes about US$70 million earmarked mainly for the wage hikes. Net income rose 10 percent to US$414.2 million or US$1.49 per share in the quarter, beating the average estimate of US$1.41. Dollar General's shares were up 3 percent at US$74.96 in midday trading. Up to Wednesday's close, they had fallen 1.7 percent this year.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] iPhone 5s Sale Chops Price to $79 at Walmart Craig Lloyd08/21/2014 Ahead of the upcoming launch of the iPhone 6, Walmart is slashing the price of the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c, where you can grab the flagship smartphone for just $79 after signing a two-year contract, with the iPhone 5c priced at just three cents shy of a dollar. The best part about the deal is that it will last three whole months, which will be well past the launch timeline of the iPhone 6, meaning that if you want to get a great post-iPhone 6 deal on the iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c, now is the time to do so. These prices may sound incredible, but they’re only minor discounts from Walmart’s usual prices of the two phones, which were priced at $99 for the iPhone 5s and $29 for the iPhone 5c, making it just a $20 discount for the iPhone 5s and a $30 drop for the iPhone 5c. These are incredible prices for an iPhone because if you were to just go to the Apple Store or a carrier store and pick up a new iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c, you’d be paying at least $199 or $99, respectively. If you’re thinking about taking advantage of this deal, it’s currently available to AT&T, Verizon and US Cellular customers (sorry T-Mobile customers). We’ve definitely seen a fair share of iPhone deals this year, but they teetered off as we entered into the summer months. However, now that the iPhone 6 is right around the corner, stores are trying to get rid of their inventory of older iPhones and this latest Walmart deal just may do the trick. Hopefully more retailers and carrier stores will follow suit and introduce crazy iPhone 5s deals, allowing more chances for consumers to get a great deal on a great smartphone if they’re not wanting to wait for the iPhone 6. With the iPhone 6 launching this fall, we can expect Apple to naturally lower the cost of the iPhone 5s, and we’d be surprised if most retailers and carrier stores didn’t discount the device even further after the iPhone 6’s launch. We saw tons of iPhone deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday last year, as well as the days leading up to Christmas. Both the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c saw some really good price drops. The 5c has been the lowest-priced iPhone ever, even though Apple isn’t marketing the device as a budget iPhone. Instead, retailers have been turning the 5c into a budget device, discounting the phone heavily — as low as $0 on-contract from past deal. The 2013 holiday season was probably the most discounts we’ve seen with the iPhone. Granted, the iPhone 5 saw plenty of deals back in 2012, but with there being two new iPhones this year, it’s led to twice the deals on Black Friday and Christmas, and consumers certainly weren’t complaining. Of course, other carriers have offered off-contract deals for Apple’s flagship smartphone before, with Virgin Mobile having one of the most memorable iPhone deals so far this year. Customers were able to get an iPhone 5s for as low las $385 off-contract. Of course, there’s a catch. as these iPhones are locked specifically to Virgin Mobile, meaning that you can only use them on the smaller carrier. That’s not all bad news, since there are plans available for as low as $30 per month, but if you want to take one of these iPhones to another carrier, you’ll have to unlock it, and that can cost extra money that you may or may not be willing to shell out.

Area residents say their community lacks grocery stores (Todd Sumlin | Charlotte Observer) A pedestrian crosses West Blvd. near Remount Road. Area residents say their community lacks grocery stores (Todd Sumlin | WBTV) CHARLOTTE, NC (Katherine Peralta and Gavin Off/The Charlotte Observer) - Getting to the nearest grocery store takes Tribonia Ponder about an hour. Ponder, who lives off West Boulevard and does not have a car, typically takes the No. 10 bus uptown, then transfers to the No. 2, which drops her off at the Wal-Mart Supercenter on Wilkinson Boulevard. Ponder, who works as a locker room attendant at a fitness center uptown, has five grown kids, and nine grandkids who sometimes accompany her on grocery-shopping trips. Having a supermarket close by, she says, would make life much easier. “Shopping with my grandkids is an adventure,” Ponder says. “Plus, you never know if the bus is going to be late or early.” The West Boulevard corridor is home to approximately 14,000 predominantly low-income residents, most of them African-American. Those who want to shop nearby can choose from a handful of small convenience stores and gas stations, as well as two Family Dollar stores. What they won’t find nearby is a full-service supermarket with a full selection of fresh produce, meat and dairy. “Our residents have to travel beyond the community boundaries to access fresh healthy groceries and other amenities,” says Rickey Hall, a longtime resident of the West Boulevard area and president of the West Boulevard Neighborhood Coalition. Less than 3 miles away, it’s a different story, as Charlotte’s grocery wars heat up in the heart of fast-growing South End. Publix opened a 55,000-square-foot store – its 12th in the Charlotte region – in 2015 at South Boulevard and Iverson Way. Less than half a mile down South Boulevard, construction on a new Harris Teeter store is underway – and half a mile from there, German grocer Lidl is planning a new 33,000-square foot store. It’s a pattern repeated in other higher-income parts of Charlotte. In Cotswold, a new Publix is under construction across Randolph Road from a Harris Teeter. And in the Arboretum area, near another Harris Teeter, developers are seeking approval to rezone an office park to accommodate a 49,000-square-foot grocery store, rumored to be a Publix. The paradox of Charlotte’s grocery wars heating up in some areas, but not others, underscores the uneven economic growth in a city that has ranked among the worst in America for providing opportunities for poor residents to lift themselves out of poverty. “If we were to create a map of food deserts and places where you would consider cultural deserts, places that don’t interface with cultural institutions ... it wouldn’t surprise me if all of those would line up in the same way that middle school proficiency, officer-involved shootings and concentrated poverty do,” says Brenda Tindal, a Charlotte native and historian at the Levine Museum of the New South. The seven grocery stores that have opened in Mecklenburg County since 2015 are located in thriving, predominantly white neighborhoods where the median household income is nearly 50 percent higher than the county’s median of $56,800, according to an Observer analysis. Developers continue to target higher-income areas like uptown – where a Whole Foods is going up on Stonewall Street, and where Publix is planning a store on North Tryon – and remain less likely to build in lower-income areas. Retailers, too, tend to follow population growth – more rooftops mean more profits. That’s especially true in the grocery industry, which operates on thin profit margins. It’s no wonder grocers are flocking to South End: Up and down South Boulevard, new restaurants, breweries, clothing shops and offices are popping up at the same time renters flock to the area. Mecklenburg County has permitted more than 20 apartment developments in the South End area, worth some $360 million since 2012, records show. In its 2015 “State of the Plate” report, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Food Policy Council identified three areas in the city as “high food insecurity risk areas” – the West Boulevard Corridor between Billy Graham Parkway and I-485, the Brookshire Boulevard corridor between I-85 and I-485, and the Albemarle Road corridor between I-584 and the Mecklenburg County boundary line. Simply put, experiencing “food insecurity” means a job loss or a car breakdown could disrupt your household’s access to food. In these areas, where the median income is lower than that of the county, most people could reach a full-service supermarket by car within five minutes. Trouble is, many don’t have a car. Over half of those in the report living in “high food insecurity risk areas” listed transportation as a challenge. And even for those who have cars, options are limited. There are simply fewer food stores of any kind in those areas. “It really comes down to median income of the census tract that you’re in. A lot of these lower-income areas aren’t going to see a major grocer come in,” says Katherine Metzo, Ph.D., a principal at Elemental Research and Consulting and an author of the report. “Most food insecurity is episodic, not chronic. Hunger is not a huge problem in Charlotte, but food insecurity is,” Metzo explains. “Maybe you lost your job and had to sell your car. Or suddenly you’re not working, so now you have to go far outside your neighborhood to buy milk.” On West Boulevard, Robin Lunn’s family has owned the BP gas station for years. She said having a full-service supermarket in the West Boulevard area would “mean a lot” for her customers. “We have a lot of groceries (at the gas station), but it’s not the same. We don’t have meat – it’s a lot of canned goods and stuff like that,” Lunn says. Location, location, location Phil Lempert, a supermarket industry analyst, says he sees opportunity for smaller format stores – such as Wal-Mart’s new convenience store concept, as well as low-cost European grocers Aldi and Lidl – in lower income areas like those identified in the State of the Plate report. “Those (grocers) are the ones that make money and serve at the same time,” Lempert says. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said there are no plans yet to open convenience stores in Charlotte. Lidl and Aldi have not disclosed plans to open new stores in the three areas identified in the report, either. “For traditional supermarkets – Wegmans, Harris Teeter, Kroger, and the like – they have to look at what can the market do to really support a store that’s 50,000 or 60,000 square feet? Can they generate a couple million dollars in sales each week in that area?” For Matthews-based Harris Teeter, for example, factors involved in site selection include size and configuration of sites, existing and future traffic patterns, the proximity of existing Harris Teeter stores, as well as other demographic and economic considerations, including residential growth, according to spokeswoman Danna Robinson. Florida-based Publix, which entered the Charlotte market in 2014 and competes most closely with Harris Teeter, declined to discuss the site selection process. But, “all of our stores are exceeding our projected sales,” spokeswoman Kimberley Reynolds said. Still, some grocers like Food Lion do cater to lower-income shoppers – spokeswoman Christy Brown-Phillips said the company’s heritage is rooted in “low prices and convenient locations.” The Salisbury-based chain did not open any new stores in the Charlotte area over the last couple of years, but it did recently wrap up the $215 million renovation of its supermarkets in the Charlotte area. Bi-Lo also has converted three of its Charlotte stores into Harveys Supermarkets over the last year. Harveys focuses on low prices and has a special price point called the $1 Zone, in which 650 items are priced $1, including beverages, canned goods, cleaners, meals, greeting cards, baby and health items. None are in the “food insecurity” risk areas – although one, on Albemarle Road, sits close by. A total of 27 grocery stores – nearly all of them Food Lions – are under renovation or have recently been renovated around the Charlotte region. Unlike Mecklenburg’s new supermarkets, these stores are in areas where the median income is less than the county’s average, an Observer analysis found. Most of those stores are also in neighborhoods where minorities comprise more than half the population, records show. Community activism Efforts are underway in areas like the West Boulevard corridor to create neighborhood-run grocery co-ops, or nonprofit food-buying clubs. Hall, president of the area’s Neighborhood Coalition, has been involved with trying to get a supermarket to open in the area for almost three decades. His efforts began in the early 1990s, when the federal government seized the property of the Westover Shopping Center at the corner of West Boulevard and Remount Road. The shopping center sat vacant and neglected for a decade before it was turned into City West Commons. Hall says all kinds of stores were approached – including Food Lion, Bi-Lo and Winn-Dixie. Nothing materialized. So now, Hall is teaming up with other residents to launch a 15,000-square-foot community co-op grocery store and gardens at the corner of Clanton Road and West Boulevard. It’s a five-year initiative that will cost an estimated $814,000, with the bulk of that going to raised garden beds and a greenhouse, as well as employing local residents to work on the project. Wells Fargo is helping to fund part of it. Metzo lauds such grassroots efforts. “It’s not the same as having a grocery store and I wouldn’t pretend that it is, but it’s an important step in gaining a partnership at the level of people who are in a position to affect policy in a big way,” she says.

MLive.com File Photo  The Arkansas retailer said over 850,000 Walmart employees in the U.S., including more than 22,000 in Alabama, received a share of $157 million in cash bonuses based on their store's performance in the fourth quarter. Walmart recently recorded its strongest comp sales of the year. The company also said its customer service and inventory have improved. The bonuses and an annual pay raise were reflected in the associates' March 9 paychecks. Walmart, which has 144 retail stores in Alabama, paid more than $92 million in taxes and collected more than $660 million in sales taxes in fiscal 2016. Placing more emphasis on employee training and education, Walmart said it promoted more than 200,000 workers, including 5,150 in Alabama, in fiscal 2017. In Alabama, over 3,500 associates also moved from part-time to full-time status. Walmart announced in January it will create 10,000 jobs and open 59 stores in the coming year. The company estimates another 24,000 construction jobs will be supported through the opening of the stores and remodeling of existing properties. Walmart has faced criticism over the years for how it pays employees. Making Change At Walmart said in January "anything Walmart says should be taken with a grain of salt." "Today they may be announcing more jobs and more employee training, but tomorrow they could close more stores or slash more back-office jobs in Walmarts across the country," the national campaign said in a statement. "It is our hope that if Walmart keeps their word and does create new jobs, these jobs will provide hardworking Americans with a wage on which they can support themselves and their families; solid healthcare and other benefits; and a reliable schedule."

Here's where a KitchenAid mixer costs $100 less. By Laura Woods | March 16, 2017 Previously 12 Jobs That Let You See the World for Free 1/16 Show Thumbnails Rawpixel.com / Shutterstock.com From kitchen supplies and bath towels to lamps and candles, you can always count on stores like Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel, Sears, Macy's and Amazon to have what you need. Of course, as a savvy shopper, you also want to find your item of choice at the best price. It's always frustrating to buy something for your home, start using it and promptly realize you could've gotten it cheaper elsewhere. Make the most of your Macy's and Pottery Barn coupons by learning where to find the best deals on popular home items. 2/16 Show Thumbnails ©Macy's 1. KitchenAid Mixers The mixer you buy is largely dependent on the product features you want. Macy's offers a vast selection of KitchenAid mixers, so you have plenty to choose from. Plus, readily available Macy's coupons means you can almost always avoid paying full price. Sara Skirboll, shopping and trends expert at RetailMeNot, highlighted the KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quart Stand Mixer, currently on sale at Macy's for $249.50 — using online coupon code "FIFTY" to get 50 percent off the $499 retail price. This same mixer retails for $349.95 at Williams-Sonoma and $349.99 at Bed, Bath & Beyond. 3/16 Show Thumbnails Syda Productions / Shutterstock.com 2. Comforter Sets Bedding is the central focus of a room, so it simply must match. Comforter sets are an easy way to get everything you need, and Sears has a wide selection of budget-friendly options. For example, the Cannon Seven-Piece Trellis Comforter Set is $129.99 in both full/queen and king sizes. In comparison, the Tommy Bahama Sandy Coast Queen Comforter Set in beige costs $249.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond, rising to $299.99 for king-sized — and it only comes with three pieces.

Blankets There's nothing like cuddling up under a warm, cozy blanket on chilly nights. Sears offers an array of affordable blankets that don't put a dent in your budget. For example, the Grand Resort Collection Plush Blanket retails for $39.99 to $59.99, but has been on sale for $24.99 to $39.99 — the price varies by size and color. A similar option from Pottery Barn, the Cozy Blanket, retails from $79 to $99, depending on the size purchased. 5/16 Show Thumbnails Jeramey Lende / Shutterstock.com 4. Cutlery Sets If you love to save money by cooking at home, a cutlery set is a kitchen essential. But it can be costly if you don't do your homework before you buy. "Believe it or not, fancy cutlery sets don't have to break the bank," said Ivy Chou, marketing and SEO manager at DealsPlus. Chou found the Sunbeam Westmont 13-Piece Cutlery Set on Amazon for $18. The same cutlery set costs $24.29 on Overstock and $38.93 at Walmart. 6/16 Show Thumbnails ©Macy's 5. Cookware Sets Investing in a quality cookware set is often much cheaper than purchasing pieces separately. The abundance of Macy's coupons helps make this purchase more affordable, and the store has a huge selection from which to choose. Kyle James, founder of coupon site Rather-Be-Shopping, recommended heading to Macy's for All-Clad cookware. The All-Clad Stainless Steel Seven-Piece Cookware Set is sold only at Macy's, and was recently on sale for $499.99 — down from $699.99. The cheapest comparable item, the All-Clad Tri-Ply Stainless Steel Seven-Piece Cookware Set, can be found at Walmart for $524.99, said James. 7/16 Show Thumbnails Kosoff / Shutterstock.com 6. Food Processors Small kitchen appliances are some of the best deals at Macy's. And, when it comes to food processors, Macy's has you covered. The store offers a huge selection sizes, colors and brand names, ensuring you'll find something that perfectly blends with your kitchen. Macy's coupons and regular sales also make the store an economical place to buy your food processor. James noted the KitchenAid Mini Food Processor retails for $59.99, but a recent promotion using coupon code FIFTY brings the price down to $29.99, compared to $44 at Walmart. 8/16 Show Thumbnails ©Amazon 7. Le Creuset Cookware Le Creuset can be a great addition to your kitchen collection, but it's smart to shop around for the lowest prices on this durable and attractive cookware. The Le Creuset Toughened 9.5" Non-Stick Fry Pan retails for $105 at Crate and Barrel, but Amazon lists it for $76.97. The Le Creuset Toughened 4.25 qt. Non-Stick Sauté Pan retails for $155 at Crate and Barrel, but sells for $144.95 at Amazon. However, James noted that the Crate and Barrel clearance section offers excellent cookware deals, including on Le Creuset items. Be sure to check for those deals before you buy elsewhere. See: 15 Items That Are Cheaper on Amazon 9/16 Show Thumbnails JR-stock / Shutterstock.com 8. Pillows "The perfect way to spruce up a drab living room is by adding accent pieces, like Oversized Ivory Mongolian Faux Fur Pillows," said Skirboll. This particular pillow is $24.99 at World Market, but she said similar pieces often cost more at other retailers. For example, the Ivory Faux Fur Eyelash Pillow at Pier 1 Imports retails for $34.95, and the Norwegian Fox Faux Fur Pillow at Ethan Allen was recently on sale for $120. Since you can buy two pillows at World Market for the price of one at other stores, Skirboll recommended heading there to stock up. 10/16 Show Thumbnails Nomad_Soul / Shutterstock.com 9. Vases Target sells hundreds of vases. In addition to regular collections from celebrity designer Nate Berkus, the store regularly collaborates with guest designers, allowing you to score a vase from a fancy brand at an affordable price. "Marbled-everything is in right now and you don't have to pay more to keep up with the trend," Skirboll said. She found a Threshold Blue and White Marbled Vase at Target for $16.99 — a fraction of the price of comparables from other retailers. For example, Williams-Sonoma sells a Marbleized Ceramic Vessel in small and medium sizes that retail at $175 and $295, respectively. 11/16 Show Thumbnails suriya phonlakorn / Shutterstock.com 10. Bath Rugs Bath rugs add style to your space, while keeping the floor dry and warm. But purchasing one shouldn't break your budget. Thankfully, you can typically pair a Macy's coupon with the store's huge selection of colors, styles and brands to find a great deal. Featuring quick-dry technology, the Sunham Inspire Plus 17" x 24" Bath Rug — exclusive to Macy's — was recently on sale for $10, noted Brent Shelton, online shopping expert for FatWallet.com. In comparison, the Airia Luxury Dry Quick Dry Tub Mat was $24.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond. 12/16 Show Thumbnails Tom Kuest - Fotograf / Shutterstock.com 11. Luggage Sets Matching luggage looks great and it's an economical way to get all the pieces needed for your next trip. Macy's offers dozens of luggage sets and top brands to choose from — Samsonite, Delsey, London Fog — and regularly offers sales. If you time it right, you might be able to score a discount on your luggage and get free shipping. Shelton found the Travel Select Kingsway Four-Piece Luggage Set on sale at Macy's for $80. In comparison, JC Penney offers an American Tourister Fieldbrook Four-Piece Luggage Set for the current sale price of $119.99 — a reduction from its original price of $240. 13/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Mike Mozart 12. Keurigs A fun and easy way to make coffee, tea and hot chocolate, a Keurig could be a great addition to your home. If you're planning to buy one, head to Macy's, as the store offers a variety of machines to meet the needs of different households. Macy's can also help you save big and, you should always keep an eye out for upcoming sales and coupons to maximize your savings, as the same items often have a higher price tag elsewhere. Shelton found the Keurig K15 Classic Brewing System on sale at Macy's for $74.99 using the FIFTY coupon code. This is a much better deal than the same exact item at Bloomingdale's, which currently retails for $200. 14/16 Show Thumbnails WorldWide / Shutterstock.com 13. Table Lamps More than just a way to brighten a room, table lamps can serve as fantastic accent pieces. Pottery Barn is a great place to shop, because the store has plenty of styles at lower price points than you'd expect. For example, the Cooper Table Lamp is just $79, which is a steal considering a similar piece at Crate and Barrel — the Merie Blue Table Lamp with Bronze Base — is $199.99. 15/16 Show Thumbnails ©Pottery Barn 14. Candles Candles look amazing and smell great, and it's good to keep a few on hand. Pottery Barn has a variety of gorgeous candles that can transform any space into a tranquil environment. Many are very reasonably priced, including the Paper White Signature Homescent Candlepot — a 6.5-ounce jarred candle that sells for $19.50. In comparison, the 6.5-ounce Diptyque Baies Scented Candle costs $64 at Nordstrom. 16/16 Show Thumbnails iChzigo / Shutterstock.com 15. Glasses and Dishware Crate and Barrel furniture isn't always the most affordable, but the company does have great deals on glasses and dishware. Offered in an assortment of styles, colors and sizes, you can save serious cash by heading to the store to stock up the next time you're hosting. For example, a set of 12 Eddy 11-ounce Everyday Stacking Glasses costs just $29.95 — or $2.95 when purchased separately — at Crate and Barrel. Conversely, Mikasa Drink4 Wine Glasses — a stackable set of four — are $19.99, so 12 would bring your total to $59.97.

Rates and Terms are subject to change at anytime without notice and are subject to state restrictions. SoFi refinance loans are private loans and do not have the same repayment options that the federal loan program offers such as Income Based Repayment or Income Contingent Repayment or PAYE. Licensed by the Department of Business Oversight under the California Finance Lender Law License No. 6054612. SoFi loans are originated by SoFi Lending Corp., NMLS # 1121636. (www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org) Fixed rates from 3.375% APR to 6.740% APR (with AutoPay). Variable rates from 2.365% APR to 6.290% APR (with AutoPay). Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at either 8.95% or 9.95% depending on term of loan. See APR examples and terms. Lowest variable rate of 2.365% APR assumes current 1 month LIBOR rate of 0.79% plus 1.825% margin minus 0.25% ACH discount. Not all borrowers receive the lowest rate. If approved for a loan, the fixed or variable interest rate offered will depend on your creditworthiness, and the term of the loan and other factors, and will be within the ranges of rates listed above. For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month LIBOR index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the LIBOR index increases. The SoFi 0.25% AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. *To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit inquiry.

Soft credit inquiries allow SoFi to show you what rates and terms SoFi can offer you up front. After seeing your rates, if you choose a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit inquiry. Hard credit inquiries (or hard credit pulls) are required for SoFi to be able to issue you a loan. In addition to requiring your explicit permission, these credit pulls may impact your credit score.

By Jodi O'Connell | March 16, 2017 When you're trying to shave monthly expenses from your budget for savings or paying off debt, joining a warehouse store can be a smart move. A basic Costco membership costs $60 per year, but you can save that in your first few visits if you shop savvy. When you're figuring out what to buy at Costco, it's tempting to stock up on bulk items like toilet paper and diapers. However, these aren't the products that will score you the best Costco deals. According to GOBankingRates' research, these are the best things to buy at Costco if you want to cut spending. Alena Haurylik / Shutterstock.com 1. Workday Lunch Fixin’s Save money — and time spent waiting in line at the cafe — by bringing your lunch to work. The best way to stretch your lunch bucks is to buy sandwich items at Costco. Build your sandwich around Kirkland Signature USDA Choice roast beef for $6.99 a pound or hardwood-smoked black forest ham for $4.99 per pound. You can also discover deals on poultry, such as Foster Farms smoked turkey pastrami for $2.99. By contrast, buying lunch meat at your local deli will cost much more. Boar's Head Black Forest ham runs $9.99 a pound at Shlomo & Vito's New York Delicatessen in Tucson, Ariz. And you'll shell out $11.99 per pound for the deli's Boar's Head Italian roast beef. Explore ways to build your sandwich at Costco, as well. Delicious Dubliner Irish Cheese runs $5.89 per pound at the warehouse store. Although $4.94 sounds good for a 7-ounce chunk of the same cheese at Walmart, this rate works out to more than $10 per pound. You can also visit Costco's produce coolers to find value prices on hearts of romaine ($2.99 for a 6-count package). Related: How to Save $100 on Your Next Trip to Costco Alena Haurylik / Shutterstock.com 2. Granola Bars and Snacks If you're the kind of person who grabs a granola bar as you rush out the door in the morning, you'll want to stock up on Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey bars at Costco. The box store sells packages of 98 bars — wrapped in 49 individual packages — for $14.67. If you buy the 24-bar value pack (12 individual containers) at Walmart, you'll pay $4.50. Clearly, the 30-cent per container price at Costco is the better deal. Costco also delivers savings for those wanting mid-day snacks for the office. You can get Nabisco Mini Snack Packs in a 40-count box for around $24 at Walmart, but you'll find the same product for $13.29 at Costco. You can also keep the "hangries" at bay with Austin Cookies and Crackers. Get the 45-count variety pack — containing three types each of cookies and crackers — for $10.29 at the warehouse club. Walmart offers a smaller eight-count variety pack of Austin Cookies and Crackers for $1.98. At less than 25 cents per snack, the Costco deal scores you more product for the price. 279photo Studio / Shutterstock.com 3. Baby Formula Although you might guess that diapers and baby wipes are among the best things to buy at Costco, Walmart offers better deals on these purchases. Save your Costco shopping dollars and head for the real baby bargain: formula. Since babies drink 30 or more ounces of prepared formula daily for the first year of life, you'll likely feed your little one about 10,950 ounces by the time she turns 1. Head to Costco for the best deal on Similac Organic infant formula. Touted as the No. 1 brand fed in hospitals, this formula sells for $1 per ounce at the warehouse store. You'll pay 18 cents more per ounce at Walmart — a difference of $1,971 by the time you're celebrating your little one's first birthday. Save even more by feeding your cutie Kirkland Signature Organic formula. At a per-ounce price of 49 cents, Kirkland costs less than half the price of name-brand formula. And the non-GMO blend provides almost identical nutrition to Similac Organic. Related: 30 Things You Should Never Buy Without a Coupon iStock.com / shapecharge 4. Allergy Relief If just thinking of spring is enough to make you sneeze, head to Costco's pharmacy section for inexpensive ways to combat your allergies. Benadryl Allergy costs just 10 cents per pill when you buy it at Costco — a savings of 2 cents per pill over Walmart's price. However, you can save even more with Kirkland Allergy Medicine, which contains diphenhydramine HCL, the same ingredient found in Benadryl. The $4.49 bottle of 600 tablets prices out at less than a penny per pill. If you're after 24-hour non-drowsy relief, consider Claritin, which delivers extended-release relief with loratadine. Costco currently offers this product at $31.89 for 105 tablets, or just 30 cents per pill, after a manufacturer's discount. On the other hand, Walmart's price is 38 cents per pill. You can save even more by opting for the generic brand. Get a year's worth of relief for 3 cents per tablet by choosing Kirkland Signature AllerClear. The medicine delivers the same dose of loratadine for an everyday price of $12.49 (365 tablets). nata-lunata / Shutterstock.com 5. Gas Don't let long gas lines scare you away from the Costco pumps. You can usually save several pennies per gallon by filling up at your favorite big box store. Use Costco's Anywhere Visa Card to pay the bill, and you'll earn 4 percent cash back on the purchase. Kirkland Signature Gasoline also saves you money in the long run by extending the life of your engine, thanks to additives that prevent deposits from building up on critical components, like intake valves and fuel injectors. You'll experience improved performance and fuel economy to boot. Find out how much you'll save by checking GasBuddy.com to see the prices at gas stations near you. Costco rates don't always automatically populate, so use the "Search Gas Prices" function to include the store in the results. If you're still worried about those long lines, save time by pulling up to the pumps for cars with tanks on the passenger side. If your tank is on the driver's side, don't worry; the hoses are long enough to reach the other side of your vehicle. iStock.com / ShotShare 6. Alcohol You can stock your liquor cabinet with Costco's Kirkland Signature liquor for top-shelf taste at a fraction of the cost. For $19.99 each, bring home 1.75-liter bottles of distilled vodka imported from France, agave tequila imported from Jalisco, Mexico, or distilled London Dry Gin. Grey Goose vodka, also made in France, averages $50 per 1.75-liter bottle at other stores. Hornitos tequila is $55 per bottle, and you'd shell out at least $30 for a quality London Dry Gin, such as Tanqueray. And don't think buying at Costco means sacrificing taste. Kirkland Signature's 7-year-old Tennessee straight bourbon whiskey ($29.99 for a 1.75 liter bottle) received a gold medal rating from the Beverage Testing Institute. The spirit scored an exceptional 93 points out of 100. monticello / Shutterstock.com 7. Vitamins and Supplements If you made a resolution to eat healthier this year, head to Costco for low prices on vitamins and protein powders. Build your immune system with Emergen-C supplements, which provide a hefty boost of Vitamin C. Costco's 90-packet box includes three different flavors and costs $21.49, for a per-packet price of 24 cents. At Walmart, you have to buy each flavor of Emergen-C separately at $9.97 per box. This brings the per-packet price to 33 cents. You can also save big on vitamins at Costco. Get ready for baby with One-A-Day Prenatal vitamins. Costco offers a 90-count container for $29.99, or 33 cents per pill. By contrast, Walmart charges $31.88 for 60 pills, raising the cost per dose to about 50 cents.

Wickline This article was published March 16, 2017 at 4:30 a.m. Comments (4) aAFont Size READ MORE: 91st General Assembly Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday signed into law legislation that will allow grocery stores in wet counties to sell any brand of wine. Senate Bill 284 by Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, was backed by Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger Co., whose officials said it would allow them to improve their selection of wines and respond to consumers' demands. State law has limited grocery stores to selling only wines that are from "smallfarm wineries" that produce 250,000 gallons or less a year, according to the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. But many liquor store owners opposed the legislation because they said it would harm their businesses. Some county-line liquor stores supported the bill after grocers promised that they would not support elections in the next eight years seeking to add to the list of wet counties, or those that allow alcohol sales. Forty of the state's 75 counties are wet, according to the state Department of Finance and Administration. Hutchinson issued a brief written statement Wednesday night to explain his decision to sign the bill into law. "Alcohol is one of the most heavily regulated industries in our economy. Dating back to the repeal of prohibition, alcohol laws have evolved uniquely in each state, and Arkansas is no different," the Republican governor said. "I took a balanced view toward SB284, and in the end I was moved to sign the bill by its positive considerations for the consumer. I believe, in the end, this bill is a compromise solution and represents the best path forward," Hutchinson said. Hester said that "I was certain that if we got [the bill] to his desk, that he would sign it." [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] Michael Lindsey, director of public affairs and government relations for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said, "We are excited to be able to offer our consumers the choices they have been asking for." Rachel Booker, an adult beverage specialist for Kroger Co., said, "We are very excited for our next opportunity." Oct. 1 "is the target start date" to offer an expanded selection of wine in these stores, she said. John Akins, president of United Beverage Retailers of Arkansas and co-owner of Legacy Wine and Spirits in west Little Rock, said that "we are disappointed" with the governor signing the legislation. The new law dramatically changes the wine and spirits industry in Arkansas, he said. The Distilled Spirits Council, a national trade association for producers and marketers of distilled spirits sold in the United States, had called on Hutchinson to veto SB284, citing an economic analysis that shows existing liquor stores are projected to lose an average of $90,000 in annual revenue, or about 8 percent, and lead to 35-40 stores going out of business and costing 100-150 people their jobs. The council said it's disappointed that Hutchinson signed SB284 into law, which it said moves wine into grocery stores and devastates local, Arkansas package stores. "Instead of picking winners and losers, Arkansas should implement a plan that is consumer-friendly and provides a level playing field for beer, wine and spirits," Distilled Spirits Council Vice President Dale Szyndrowski said in a written statement. "We urge Governor Hutchinson and the Arkansas legislature to come back to the table and help retailers that were left out of this deal. We believe there is a fair approach to reforming Arkansas' outdated alcohol laws that serves all parties." Hester said in an interview that "as is the majority of the time when there are bills here in the Legislature people want to pitch worst-case scenarios. "There will certainly be an effect on local liquor stores. I don't think it will be anything like they believe it is," he said. Hester said that he wants to encourage the free market. "I'm sure that our big grocery stores and our big box retailers don't like that everything is moving online, but it is. The world is changing every day, and that's why we come down here to try to be as flexible as possible." On Feb. 8, the 35-member Senate voted 18-11 to approve the legislation, sending it to the House. The House's initial 48-24 vote fell three votes short of the 51 required for approval before the House later voted 53-34 for the bill. The Senate voted 18-14 to send the House-amended legislation to the governor last week. A House-approved amendment allows liquor stores to have "consumables and edible products that complement alcoholic beverages" and requires the Alcoholic Beverage Control agency to promulgate rules to facilitate the sale of complementary products. Several representatives switched their votes to allow the bill to clear the House. Among them was Rep. Charles Blake, D-Little Rock, who has said the grocers also promised not to push until after 2025 for legislation to allow them to also sell liquor. Under SB284, a grocery may apply to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board for a grocery-store wine permit that would allow the store to purchase and sell wine for off-premises consumption. Wine-inventory orders or purchases are required to be made by the store for delivery to a single, permitted location. Under the bill, an order for an inventory of wine is barred from being combined with an order for another store in a way that would result in bulk discounts. The grocery-store wine permit fee under SB284 would range from $1,000 for a permitted building space of less than 35,001 square feet to $5,000 for a permitted building space of more than 75,000 square feet. The fee revenue would go into the Arkansas Wine Grants Fund. Fifty percent of the money would be divided among wineries seeking grant payments, subject to certain limitations. The other 50 percent would go to operating and staffing a wine tourism facility and office space for the Arkansas Wine Producers Council in Franklin County.

I had no dealings with the big box stores until spring weather began breaking. Wife got a bee in her bonnet to do a little remodeling and updating in our den, around our old brick fireplace, which we do not use anymore. This involved hanging some drywall over the brick and moving electrical receptacles out even with the drywall edge, and also building a couple of small cabinets. I go to our local big box Lowes, but the name is very misleading these days. Nothing there is priced low. In fact, relative to previous prices of six months ago, the new bubble inflated prices are ridiculous. I went to the finish plywood, and was in for another shock. A small 4X4 x1/4 was $54. When it came to small items, everything was broken down in to small packs, screws, nails, hooks etc., and packaged so that you had to buy several packs to accomplish any kind of ordinary job. To get bulk prices, you had to buy a dozen packs of these items, and then, with only a very small savings. I needed some tiny plastic washers to move the wall receptacles out a bit. Now these little square washers are molded from maybe two cents worth of plastic material and were in packs of two sizes. One pack had two washers in it, and was priced at $5.98. The other pack had six washers in it and was priced for $7.98, and the production costs of material in both packs, including molding, could not have been more than .25 cents. Talk about profits and gouging consumers. Then, wife and I go to the paint department, and we are among the paint racks looking for a good grade of flat white paint to paint our den. The kid mixing paint tries to lead us to the most expensive paint, but we find what we want, but the kid does not accept our choice and goes into something of a critique of our choices of paint. Wife and I paint rental properties, and we know paint, so we let the kid have his say and go to choose the color swatch for mixing. We find a nice light gray color, and carry the paint we chose, and wife points out the color on the swatch. The kid mixes the paint while we continue shopping. When we open the paint, the kid has mixed a much lighter color from the swatch wife chose. So, we will have to return the paint. And then, there is Wal-Mart auto service. Daughter drove across a railroad track and something there cut a rear tire on her car. She put on the spare and made it to Wal-Mart. They replaced the tire, and added an automatic tire disposal fee to get rid of the old tire, of $8.00 per tire, that was not mentioned in the up front price. They claimed that this disposal fee was a requirement when buying tires. Why was that not mentioned in the up-front price? More slick deceptive dealing. Then, when two weeks later, the tire they sold daughter failed, Wal-Mart service manager refused to replace it because she had not bought the additional warranty on the tire. I noted that the theme at the automotive repair center at this Wal-Mart appeared to be to gouge the consumer at every turn. But, overall, in building materials and many items at Wal-Mart and other big box stores, I note that consumer prices have increased by a third and much more on many high value items. We can suspect that we are going to endure yet another round of price inflation in USA, while the Fed increases interest rates to tighten the money supply that gets into the hands of poorly paid consumers, who cannot afford the prices they are paying nowadays. Service in the communications industry is terrible, and Corporate mergers and cost cutting is making service nearly impossible to obtain. Our Internet and cable provider, yes, the one with the cute commercials, is a good example. Back in October, we began having trouble getting HBO on-demand. The movie would begin, but then break up soon and end with a message telling us to try again. Wife called the provider, and they assured her that they would be out promptly to fix the problem. In December, after wife went to the cable provider and we switched out the cable box ourselves, with no improvement, a technician finally arrived after wife called 5 times to remind them of our needs. The tech hooks up his analyzer and announces that our signal is too weak for some channels to be received. Our cable line is old and corroded or damaged, and the line will be replaced as soon as a bucket truck is repaired. This is in December. Wife calls twice in January, and twice in February and once in March. Today, another tech shows up with a long ladder on his pickup, no doubt, a paid contractor. The guy does have some cable with him and he has to use his long ladder to climb to the cable and electrical lines beside the roadway to hook up his new cable standing 30 feet teetering on the top of a long ladder. He is alone, and so I stay with him in the event he falls. He has to climb yet another light pole and some trees to string the long line through the trees to a pole in my back yard. He finally gets the line hung their, but then notices that his cable is about 30 feet short of reaching my house. He announces that he will be back within a few days to bring some more cable to splice to the short cable so it will reach my house. Now the above is a top brand cable and Internet provider, that just was bought up by another corporation. I note with the above that employees and contractors and consumers are at the tender mercy of a big corporate outfit that simply does not care about service or customers or employees. Everything done on the cheap to maximize profits. Cheap labor, cheap, outdated equipment, but then only thing expensive is the price of the service provided. A real crap outfit, just bought up by another crap outfit. My hometown bank was just sold out to an out of state big bank, and already we are having to juggle the money in one of our accounts to avoid more banking fees. To make matters worse, the bank employees are having difficulty explaining to customer what needs doing. Big Corp and Big Banking, with little oversight from government is the rule nowadays, and Big Money only cares about gouging and scamming consumers at every angle and opportunity. Prices are increasing on many essentials too, This is somewhat of a repeat of the Hoover administration when there were calls to cut inflation and government spending while the nation and its people slipped into poverty. I note items that I remember selling for just under a hundred dollars when I was young, are now selling for just under a thousand dollars. If you ever have occasion to get your hands on one of those reprints of those old early 1900s Sears and Roebuck catalogs, just look at the prices, and do a little math. The rate of US inflation over the years is simply amazing. One particular item in the 1902 catalog listed for $7.00. That same make and model of this high value manufactured item is presently listed for $1199.99. That is an inflation rate of 17,143% on this particular item since 1902. This indicates that many inflation bubbles have come and gone since 1902. Expanding the money supply to inflate USA out of debt is a standard way of doing things. However, starving the population while doing this and holding back the money supply while increasing prices of everything, appears to be a return to past hard capitalism that sent many Americans to the poor houses and sent USA into the Great Depression. And another thing I see in the Big Box stores besides increased prices, is a strange, odd assortment of high priced items that will probably sit on the shelves unless more money gets into the hands of consumers than appears to be happening nowadays. I think the importers are expecting those few gilded age have mores to buy some of those high dollar items, but unless wages increase for most people, I fear that such stuff will sit there and be discounted before it ever sells. No real happy days for US consumers until there is more money in their pockets. And with GOP in charge, that is not likely to happen these days. _______ About author Writer and news commentator, head-scratcher, retired teacher,logger, mechanic, Vietnam veteran, and continuing student of society and human nature.

By Evan Clark on March 16, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Kate Hudson models a look from Fabletics. The boomlet of niche-y e-commerce companies that once struck fear in the heart of traditional retail is going bust, deflating into a category that is also subject to the laws of economics. Already the go-go start-ups that got big-time funding from Silicon Valley types, but could never really make their businesses work, have started to run into the wall. Nasty Gal was just the beginning, having spent heavily and taken money from former Apple Retail and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. chief Ron Johnson only to find its intellectual property sold off to Boohoo for $20 million in a bankruptcy auction last month. Now others are expected to see the same fate. The stronger concepts, meanwhile, maybe finding themselves better off but are stuck making a tricky shift, looking for additional funding in a world that suddenly wants not just growth, but also profits. The brands said to be navigating this landscape and in the market for capital include Bonobos, which is working with Citi, and Birchbox. And some companies could do more than just bring in a new investor. Fabletics owner TechStyle Fashion Group is said to be working with J.P. Morgan as it looks to raise additional money or even find a buyer. The company already toyed with the idea of an IPO last year as it tried to solve the typical tech company problem of how to satiate its investors. “It’s always a possibility at a company our size and with the money that we have invested into it,” said Kimberly Tobman, vice president of global communications, of a potential IPO in May. “Of course, the investors want some kind of strategic exit. That’s what the end goal is when you’re putting that kind of money into a business.” Others are finding themselves swept up into more traditional retail businesses. So far, Wal-Mart’s been the most active, having bought up Jet.com for $3 billion last year, adding Shoebuy.com in January and outdoor apparel site Moosejaw for $51 million last month. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. might well be hungry for more and experts see potential for the company to continue buying e-commerce companies as it squares off for a battle royale with Amazon, the undisputed U.S. e-commerce king. Observers said more companies, from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton to Kering to Fast Retailing, could ultimately jump into the game and look to grow online via acquisition as the shakeout continues. “It’s a natural economic cycle,” said apparel veteran Ari Bloom, chief executive officer of tech firm Avametric, which builds virtual fitting room software that’s being put to use by Gap Inc. Bloom said business school graduates from the 2009 and 2010 period found themselves starting their own companies as jobs were hard to find, ultimately building e-commerce businesses that found a favorable funding environment in the years that followed. “It was a time when people were a little bit more forgiving because they were looking for places to put their capital,” he said. “If [start-ups] were seeing growth, even if they weren’t seeing profit, it was encouraging enough for them to keep receiving funding.” But times have changed as more players struggle just to keep their heads above water. “We’re going to see a lot of M&A in the next year or two and I think we’re going to see a lot of companies go out of business or fold and sell their [intellectual property] like a Nasty Gal or a One Kings Lane,” Bloom predicted. “It’s destined to happen and it doesn’t mean that good businesses aren’t going to fail, that’s a tough thing to happen and that’s a good lesson.” An executive at a prominent private equity firm that plays in the fashion space said investors are scrutinizing valuations much more closely than they were and that the key question today is: “What’s your path to profitability?” “So many of these businesses start raising capital and it’s in this very West Coast model,” said the executive, noting that fresh funds went toward customer acquisition to drive growth with no profits in sight. While some e-commerce companies that have taken venture money and built up complementary store businesses are said to be driving profits, most seem to find themselves in some version of this bind of having to pay back investors who bought in at a lofty valuation. Negative Underwear went a different route and has never taken outside funding, which cofounder Lauren Schwab said has helped the business learn how to be careful with its money. “Certainly lots of our peers are continuing to take money and generally the idea is that this is to fuel additional growth and I think it has to do with, customer acquisition is expensive and getting a brand out into the ether is expensive,” Schwab said. “Up until this point, we have not invested at all in paid advertising and in order for us to do that in a meaningful way, we would likely have to take on some funding. We have managed our customer very smartly and have been able to thoughtfully experiment and really focus on ROI, so we weren’t able to frivolously invest large amounts of money in potential big mistakes.” Negative is profitable and reinvests those profits in its business. It’s a form of corporate modesty the high-flyers of the digital age are increasingly looking to adopt.

The Super Center is located on Grand Avenue and some residents fear the big chain will destroy the small business community. “I believe small businesses are going to feel a hit. Because they have everything and sometimes they offer it at a lower price,” said a Yazoo Resident. “We feel regardless of what comes to Yazoo City, they are longtime customers of long time businesses of Yazoo.  Competition is good. It makes businesses provide better services and goods,” said Yazoo resident Zelle Delaware. Walmart’s store manager Michael Lofton said the goal of the store is to enhance not take away from the town. “Let me tell you, 250 jobs in a small town then it actually helps for other businesses to want to come into town. According to economic development here, there are businesses now that they're all looking forward to coming to Yazoo City since Walmart has come to town.  We actually like to work together with small businesses to see how we can fit the community,” said Lofton. Yazoo’s more than a decade Mayor, Diane Delaware, says the city has been working to attract a big box store. “In Yazoo City, this is the first new business we have gotten in for a very long time, so it offers opportunities for jobs, people don’t have to drive up and down the road, and clearly it is a breath of new economic development and we are very happy about that,” added Mayor Delaware. Thelma Brown couldn't agree more. She wants to see all the businesses, especially Walmart, have success in her city. “Walmart is the best thing that ever happened to Yazoo since the invention of the indoor toilet.” Copyright 2017 MSNewsNow.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.89 -0.55 -0.78% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 852.31 -1.11 -0.13% According to Jezebel fashion blog, Jet.com on Thursday will ink a deal with Modcloth, an eclectic women's fashion brand known for serving curvy customers. Jezebel obtained a recording of Modcloth CEO Matthew Kaness telling employees about the deal, which will be announced publicly on Friday, the publication said. A spokesman for Wal-Mart, Jet's parent, declined to comment on the story. A representative for Modcloth did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Yet if a deal for the were to go through, it would be the latest in a spate of purchases by Wal-Mart. In a bid to close the gap with Amazon (AMZN), the world's largest retailer began its buying spree with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet last year. Shortly after, Jet purchased Shoebuy for $70 million. And last month, Wal-Mart snapped up outdoor apparel retailer Moosejaw for $51 million. "Assortment is driving a lot of these acquisitions," CEO Doug McMillon said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer & Retail Technology Conference Tuesday. "We can pick up some of these companies that are great in terms of the assortment and the service they provide, but they don't have enough money to lose, to go market their brand and scale it." McMillon's comments were made in relation to the company's recent acquisitions and included no mention of a potential deal with Modcloth. Wal-Mart's acquisition strategy opens it up to a new set of shoppers. Jet's typical customer, for example, is younger, more urban and more affluent than a traditional Wal-Mart shopper. The plan appears to be working. Wal-Mart's domestic online sales increased 29 percent during the holiday quarter. Founded in 2002, Modcloth sells its own merchandise and products from hundreds of independent designers. The company had previously raised nearly $79 million in seven rounds of funding, according to Crunchbase.

By John Kimelman Biography March 15, 2017 7:35 p.m. ET Getty Images Amazon has what might be called a high-class problem. The company is frighteningly good at its core business, which is selling goods of all kinds online – even groceries now -- to consumers who are happy to forfeit a trip to a store. As a result, the company generated $136 billion in revenue last year and now reportedly has a 43% share of all online retail sales in 2016, according to Slice Intelligence.

But Amazon’s hypersuccess has led to a common belief that the company’s better mousetrap – a great technological interface, reliable fulfillment, and customer service that puts most others to shame -- is almost single-handily destroying the brick-and-mortar retail industry. And that perception has drawn a certain amount of unwanted attention. During the president’s campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump argued that the company had an “antitrust problem,” though Trump’s criticism was also tied into his personal animus for CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was quite tough on him during the election. More From Barron’s The Future of ETFs Ball Corp.: A Can-Do Can Maker What Fund Flows Really Say About the Market Since Trump was elected president, Amazon has taken steps to deal with its high-class problem. In January the company announced that it would hire more than 100,000 people in the U.S. in the next 18 months. And Trump has lightened up on his criticism of Amazon and other large tech companies – at least for now. But that hasn’t stopped press accounts that tend to view Amazon’s gains as coming at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailing ranging from electronics to food. For example, a recent piece on the Cheat Sheet Website profiles four traditional retailers – Macy’s, Best Buy, Office Depot, ODP 2.1459227467811157% Office Depot Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD4.76 0.1 2.1459227467811157% /Date(1489784400423-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 7247256 AFTER HOURS USD4.76 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 826650 P/E Ratio 6.898550724637682 Market Cap 2450548001.13395 Dividend Yield 2.100840336134454% Rev. per Employee 290026 More quote details and news » ODP in Your Value Your Change Short position and grocery chains -- “that are getting destroyed by Amazon.” The piece, for example, writes that Amazon “is set to unseat Macy’s as the biggest seller of clothing in the U.S., which is bad news for the struggling department store. Sales are down at the mall chain and the retailer plans to shutter stores across the country.” Perhaps most remarkable in Amazon’s emerging role in groceries, a business that might have seem like a bridge too far for the online retailer just a few years ago. “Amazon may only control 1% of the grocery business in the U.S., but it’s poised to take a much bigger piece of the pie, threatening both small and large supermarket chains in the process,” writes Cheat Sheet. “Amazon is already the number one online grocery retailer in the country, Investor’s Business Daily reported, and it’s starting to expand its Amazon Fresh offering to more cities. The company’s offered grocery delivery for years, but it seems newly committed to making the service work, even though it presents logistical challenges. If enough people get on board with buying their canned goods, fresh produce, and meat online, it could spell big trouble for traditional supermarkets.” But some publications seem troubled by this characterization of Amazon as a company that is laying waste to entire industries. Tech publication Wired, for example, has run at least two articles recently that amount to full-throated defenses of the company. In January, Wired ran a piece that argued that Amazon has done nothing to deserve the label, monopoly. “So far, experts say Amazon’s dominance is just that: a company outdoing the competition in capitalism’s grand tradition,” the article adds. “But it may be on the verge of becoming the kind of monopoly that Trump’s top techie, Peter Thiel, says all companies should strive to be: ’the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.’ ” A more recent Wired article goes deeper in its defense of Amazon’s practices, arguing that it’s wrong to view the success of online retailers like Amazon and brick-and-mortar retailers as mutually exclusive. In fact, Amazon is partly a platform to help small retailers who now have access to more customers through Amazon’s online platform. Also, Amazon’s success, while killing certain traditional retail jobs, is also creating new types of employment tied to Amazon’s complex logistical system. “If e-commerce platforms continue to appeal to buyers and sellers, this may mean fewer traditional retail jobs —or it could simply mean a shift in the types of activities performed by people in retail occupations,” says the piece, written by Geoffrey A. Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, and Jennifer MacLean, director of operations at ICLE. “It might also mean more jobs in manufacturing, transportation, advertising, coding, and logistics, to name a few. And while online distribution and automation may present certain challenges to traditional retailers, they also create significant opportunities. In fact, almost half of retail sales on Amazon’s platform are from third-party merchants who have chosen to sell their wares online instead of (or often, in addition to) through brick-and-mortar stores.” The piece adds that “while many are quick to disparage Amazon’s effect on local communities, these arguments fail to recognize that by reducing the costs associated with physical distance between sellers and consumers, e-commerce enables even the smallest merchant on Main Street, and the entrepreneur in her garage, to compete in the global marketplace.” Of course, it’s always troubling when the authors of a piece admit that their organization is receiving financial support from the company they are writing about, in this case Amazon. One wonders how differently the article might have been if Amazon wasn’t a benefactor. Still, if Amazon follows through on its commitment to hire 100,000 workers over the next 18 months, it will go a long to mitigating the criticism.

By John Kimelman Biography March 15, 2017 7:35 p.m. ET Getty Images Amazon has what might be called a high-class problem. The company is frighteningly good at its core business, which is selling goods of all kinds online – even groceries now -- to consumers who are happy to forfeit a trip to a store. As a result, the company generated $136 billion in revenue last year and now reportedly has a 43% share of all online retail sales in 2016, according to Slice Intelligence.

But Amazon’s hypersuccess has led to a common belief that the company’s better mousetrap – a great technological interface, reliable fulfillment, and customer service that puts most others to shame -- is almost single-handily destroying the brick-and-mortar retail industry. And that perception has drawn a certain amount of unwanted attention. During the president’s campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump argued that the company had an “antitrust problem,” though Trump’s criticism was also tied into his personal animus for CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was quite tough on him during the election. More From Barron’s The Future of ETFs Ball Corp.: A Can-Do Can Maker What Fund Flows Really Say About the Market Since Trump was elected president, Amazon has taken steps to deal with its high-class problem. In January the company announced that it would hire more than 100,000 people in the U.S. in the next 18 months. And Trump has lightened up on his criticism of Amazon and other large tech companies – at least for now. But that hasn’t stopped press accounts that tend to view Amazon’s gains as coming at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailing ranging from electronics to food. For example, a recent piece on the Cheat Sheet Website profiles four traditional retailers – Macy’s, Best Buy, Office Depot, ODP 2.1459227467811157% Office Depot Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD4.76 0.1 2.1459227467811157% /Date(1489784400423-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 7247256 AFTER HOURS USD4.76 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 826650 P/E Ratio 6.898550724637682 Market Cap 2450548001.13395 Dividend Yield 2.100840336134454% Rev. per Employee 290026 More quote details and news » ODP in Your Value Your Change Short position and grocery chains -- “that are getting destroyed by Amazon.” The piece, for example, writes that Amazon “is set to unseat Macy’s as the biggest seller of clothing in the U.S., which is bad news for the struggling department store. Sales are down at the mall chain and the retailer plans to shutter stores across the country.” Perhaps most remarkable in Amazon’s emerging role in groceries, a business that might have seem like a bridge too far for the online retailer just a few years ago. “Amazon may only control 1% of the grocery business in the U.S., but it’s poised to take a much bigger piece of the pie, threatening both small and large supermarket chains in the process,” writes Cheat Sheet. “Amazon is already the number one online grocery retailer in the country, Investor’s Business Daily reported, and it’s starting to expand its Amazon Fresh offering to more cities. The company’s offered grocery delivery for years, but it seems newly committed to making the service work, even though it presents logistical challenges. If enough people get on board with buying their canned goods, fresh produce, and meat online, it could spell big trouble for traditional supermarkets.” But some publications seem troubled by this characterization of Amazon as a company that is laying waste to entire industries. Tech publication Wired, for example, has run at least two articles recently that amount to full-throated defenses of the company. In January, Wired ran a piece that argued that Amazon has done nothing to deserve the label, monopoly. “So far, experts say Amazon’s dominance is just that: a company outdoing the competition in capitalism’s grand tradition,” the article adds. “But it may be on the verge of becoming the kind of monopoly that Trump’s top techie, Peter Thiel, says all companies should strive to be: ’the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.’ ” A more recent Wired article goes deeper in its defense of Amazon’s practices, arguing that it’s wrong to view the success of online retailers like Amazon and brick-and-mortar retailers as mutually exclusive. In fact, Amazon is partly a platform to help small retailers who now have access to more customers through Amazon’s online platform. Also, Amazon’s success, while killing certain traditional retail jobs, is also creating new types of employment tied to Amazon’s complex logistical system. “If e-commerce platforms continue to appeal to buyers and sellers, this may mean fewer traditional retail jobs —or it could simply mean a shift in the types of activities performed by people in retail occupations,” says the piece, written by Geoffrey A. Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, and Jennifer MacLean, director of operations at ICLE. “It might also mean more jobs in manufacturing, transportation, advertising, coding, and logistics, to name a few. And while online distribution and automation may present certain challenges to traditional retailers, they also create significant opportunities. In fact, almost half of retail sales on Amazon’s platform are from third-party merchants who have chosen to sell their wares online instead of (or often, in addition to) through brick-and-mortar stores.” The piece adds that “while many are quick to disparage Amazon’s effect on local communities, these arguments fail to recognize that by reducing the costs associated with physical distance between sellers and consumers, e-commerce enables even the smallest merchant on Main Street, and the entrepreneur in her garage, to compete in the global marketplace.” Of course, it’s always troubling when the authors of a piece admit that their organization is receiving financial support from the company they are writing about, in this case Amazon. One wonders how differently the article might have been if Amazon wasn’t a benefactor. Still, if Amazon follows through on its commitment to hire 100,000 workers over the next 18 months, it will go a long to mitigating the criticism.

X Mike Hanrahan’s Jet.com works well with Walmart Irish man’s US ecommerce operation plans to double its technology team Thu, Mar 16, 2017, 01:00 Ciara O'Brien Jet.com’s Mike Hanrahan (left) at the launch of Career Zoo with Jackie Slattery and David Ryan: “One of the big assets for Jet was the culture, the technology, the people.” Photograph: Marc O’Sullivan         When Irishman Mike Hanrahan moved to New Jersey seven years ago, it was to work with a start-up that sold soap and nappies. The start-up was founded by Marc Lore and the pair had worked together in London at Credit Suisse before Lore set up Diapers.com, later renamed Quidsi. It’s hardly the stuff of high tech yet it would prove to be a lucrative move for Hanrahan, who is originally from Co Wexford. Lore sold Quidsi to Amazon for $545 million and Hanrahan took a couple of years out of the workplace after his family expanded from two children to four, with the birth of twins. “We had four kids under the age of five and no real support network. My parents came over as much as they could, but that was three times a year. We needed it,” he says. “I was lucky to be in a situation where I could do that. We said there was no point leaving the money in a will, why not spend the money now. I’m glad I did it.” While living off savings may be nerve-wracking for some, Hanrahan always had a back-up plan. “The technology sector was booming. I was lucky in that I was never going to be short of a job,” he says. “Worst-case scenario , I had worked in banking and finance in London for a long time, and they were clamouring for people like that in New York.” It wasn’t needed. When he returned to work, it was to a new start-up, ecommerce firm Jet.com. The company had one aim – to reinvent ecommerce with a new model that would see the prices of items drop as consumers shop. The businessman found himself in the headlines last year when Walmart paid more than $3 billion for the company he cofounded with Marc Lore and Nate Faust. ADVERTISEMENT Getting started Hanrahan is currently chief technology officer for Jet.com, which was founded in 2014. He doesn’t say how much the Walmart deal netted him personally, but he has no plans to retire just yet. There’s a lot more to do, he says, and Jet is just getting started. It’s a role he has relished from the start, with about 14 months to get the technology ready before its launch. “We knew it was going to be a big splash, coming out of the gate all guns blazing. There was a lot late nights, a lot of weekends getting the technology ready, load testing and seeing how we would scale it,” he says. “It was a lot of fun. As an engineer, as a CTO, it was a dream job. I was being given the remit to run a multibillion-dollar marketplace, starting with a completely clean slate, and you’re being told that it needs to scale massively on day one. To build the technology to match those requirements was a real blast.” Among the tools Jet.com used was the public cloud – specifically Microsoft’s Azure. Luckily, it all went smoothly on launch day, despite some unexpected events. “Marc got himself on to Good Morning America on the day of the launch, which wasn’t factored into our estimates for traffic and we ended up with a 8x spike over our best estimates while he was on air,” he says. “Everything held up beautifully. We were nervous though.” It wasn’t long before the company came to the attention of Walmart – which Hanrahan says was surreal – and the rest, as they say, is history. Company culture Despite becoming part of the behemoth that is Walmart – it also owns Asda in the UK – Hanrahan says that not a lot has changed at Jet.com since the acquisition. Not in the company’s culture anyway; it’s inevitable that being part of a larger entity would bring some benefits to the business, and Walmart certainly has that end covered. Before the acquisition, Jet.com was estimating it would be profitable by 2020. While Hanrahan isn’t talking about the current estimates – Walmart is a publicly listed company so he is conscious of talking out of turn – he says the scale of the company makes things a little easier. “As part of Walmart you get access to better cost of goods from suppliers, so margins are inevitably going to improve,” he says. “In terms of the goals we set ourselves in terms of customers and gross merchandise value sales, we were – and are – flying.” Ecommerce in the US is a funny game. While Irish shoppers are used to having access to online grocery deliveries from the local supermarket, the size and geographical footprint of the US makes that a little more difficult. Then there’s the Amazon factor to deal with. “If you want to play in the ecommerce space in the US, you have to have a value proposition that is up there with Amazon,” explains Hanrahan. “That costs a lot of money. Amazon has scale, so they get huge leverage out of everything they do, in terms of technology and fixed overheads. You have to hit that level of scale to eat really.” The financials aside though, you would expect Walmart to impact the culture of Jet. But the brand operates as a standalone entity within the group, and it has been left largely untouched, despite initial fears the acquisition would see a gradual melding of the two brands and workforces. On own terms “One of the big assets for Jet was the culture, the technology, the people. They’re being very careful not to disrupt that or be seen to Walmart-ise Jet in any way, shape or form,” says Hanrahan. “They [Walmart chief executive Doug McMillan and Marc Lore] have been very deliberate and careful in making sure they don’t upset the apple cart at Jet. Obviously there was apprehension and nervousness when the deal was going on, about whether we would be inundated with Walmart people, was there going to be this bureaucracy etc, and it really hasn’t played out like that at all. The remit is that we can do that on our terms.” ADVERTISEMENT Between warehouse staff, call centre and support, Jet.com employs about 2,000 people, growing from 15 in 2015, and has 8,000 suppliers, its own distribution centres and 22 million stock items. It even has a small staff in Ireland who work on the technical side of things – about 20 people currently, but the company is always hiring, and had a presence at the recent career Zoo event in Dublin to prove it. But before you get visions of another low-cost alternative to Amazon or the regular grocery firms in Ireland, Jet.com is solely focused on the US and Hanrahan says there are no plans to change that. Time zone Having development staff in another time zone makes sense, he says. It means things can be tested at a time when it’s unlikely customers will be trying to make purchases in large numbers, and if something goes drastically wrong, it can be rolled back before most of the customer base wakes up – usually that means testing it at 4am. The company is in recruitment mode for Dublin. “It’s going to be an engineering centre for us,” says Hanrahan. “The initial impetus for the idea was because all our engineers were in Hoboken [New Jersey] they were basically getting woken up a lot at night. they were starting to experience burnout. “On the flip side, we didn’t want to have just an operations ‘keep the lights on’ centre. We wanted to extend the working day.” Then there was the chance to expand its hiring pool away from the competitive New York environment. Dublin was a natural choice for the company, Hanrahan says. “It’s been hugely successful for us,” he says. “When we meet great people, we want to hire them. We’re going to roughly double the technology team at Jet over the coming year; the mix of Dublin and Hoboken. We’ll see how that plays out.”       Read More This week we’re talking about . . .

ST. LOUIS >> A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple’s seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell’s home, including some “domestic-related situations,” but he declined to elaborate. “The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,” Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. "Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes," Lakin said. "Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this." Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. "He definitely saved the child's life," Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some "domestic-related situations," but he declined to elaborate. "The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house," Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

RBR Meat Company Inc. recalled its Marketside supreme frozen pizza, which may have been “adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes,” according to FSIS. The pizzas were sold at select Walmart stores in a 50.6-oz. box containing single shrink-wrapped 16-inch pizzas labeled as “Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza,” with lot code 20547. The pizzas were shipped to Walmart distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington. During routine sampling, FSIS discovered the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. “There are no confirmed reports of adverse reactions from consumption of the pizzas at this time,” according to the recall announcement. This recall is a Class I recall, which means it is “a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death,” according to the USDA. FSIS urges consumers who have bought the product to not eat it. They advise throwing away the pizzas or returning them to the place of purchase. Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating contaminated food and can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and older people. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches and sometimes diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1,600 cases are reported in the United States every year, with 260 resulting in death, according to the CDC. Last week federal health officials announced an unrelated recall of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery due to a listeria outbreak responsible for six cases of illness including two deaths. Last month Sargento Foods announced its own recall of several cheeses due to potential listeria contamination, which prompted the company to cut ties with one of its suppliers.

(Westfield Police Department) Print Email Lucas Ropek | lropek@repub.com By Lucas Ropek | lropek@repub.com The Republican on March 16, 2017 at 8:58 PM comments WESTFIELD - The Westfield Detective Bureau has admitted to using a picture of an "innocent shopper" in a social media press release regarding a criminal suspect.  On Wednesday, Westfield detectives announced that the man pictured above was suspected of using a stolen credit card to buy an electrical snow blower at a local Walmart. However, the pictured used Wednesday is apparently of the wrong man, according to police.  "We would like to apologize to the male party depicted in the pictures from the Walmart stolen credit card incident and our followers," reads a statement from the Bureau's Facebook page. "There was a mix-up in the information we received about the transaction from Walmart and the pictures of the male party we posted as the suspect, was actually an innocent shopper," the statement continues.  According to the new press release regarding the incident, Westfield detectives say the stolen credit card had the same last four numbers as the man captured in the published surveillance images. Police also said that the man who was used in the press release bought the same item at roughly the same time on the same day as the suspect who used the stolen credit card. "We are working on getting the correct information," the statement concludes.  MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive on YouTube Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

Beth DeLaurentis says she went back to the store on George Washington Memorial Highway twice and called three times, but never had any luck. "I just totally gave up hope," she says. For that reason, when she got a letter that she had a package waiting for her at the post office, she says she didn't think anything of it. The package, with a return address to only "Parsons, Yorktown, VA" had a note on the back saying, "This was found in a cart @ Walmart :)" Inside the "priority mail" package, she found her wallet inside, untouched. "I was ecstatic I was so happy, then I came to terms with it, that there's really good people out there," says DeLaurentis. "You've just got to find them." So that's what she did. DeLaurentis posted about what happened on Facebook in the hopes that it could connect her with the Good Samaritan. The post got 1,100 likes and was shared hundreds of times. Laura Parsons spotted it while scrolling through Facebook on Wednesday. "I didn't want anyone to really know it was me because I was just making sure she got her wallet," she says, while laughing, calling the situation embarrassing. Parsons says she didn't even realize the wallet was in her cart until after she checked out and loaded her bags into the car. "I took it back in to take it to customer service, but the line was really long in customer service, so I just thought, it's probably just easier for me to do the right thing rather than turn it over to someone else to do the right thing." Parsons responded to DeLaurentis' post, saying: "You are welcome! I recently misplaced my driver's license and the fine folks at CVS took their time to check the security video to see that I had put it back in my wallet after picking up prescriptions...I later found it in the floorboard of my car. It meant a lot that they cared. I'm glad you got your wallet. Pay it forward!" The two are now friends on Facebook, sending a powerful message to the hundreds that saw their story. "When you see an opportunity to do something nice, it doesn't take a whole lot of extra effort," says Parsons. "So, you should."

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. "Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes," Lakin said. "Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this." Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. "He definitely saved the child's life," Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some "domestic-related situations," but he declined to elaborate. "The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house," Lakin said.

LOUIS -- A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived, nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. "Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes," Lakin said Thursday. "Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this." Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. "He definitely saved the child's life," Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some "domestic-related situations," but he declined to elaborate. "The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house," Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

A fast-thinking paramedic found the baby floating inside, pulled him onto the hood of the vehicle and administered CPR. The child was then taken to a hospital where he is expected to make a full recovery. A body, identified as his mother, was later recovered from the lake. The infant was found hours after a person thought to be his father was killed in a house fire where his six siblings all survived.   Scroll down for video  A body is recovered near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, on Thursday after a car with an infant was pulled from the lake Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The children at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said The chain of events all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, about 30 miles east of St Louis, when a fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Six children, ranging up to age 14, all escaped.      Cristy Campbell's body was identified as having drowned in the same river where her infant son was found submerged in an SUV  Surveillance video obtained from a neighbor showed an SUV's headlights switching on in the driveway of the house around 4:50 a.m., and several minutes later it backed out of the driveway.  About three minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house could be seen on the side of a nearby house, according to STL today.   Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Police could not enter the house until the fire was fully put out, and the body was removed mid afternoon on Thursday.   Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's infant son. At 5:31 a.m, a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body, identified as the mother, recovered from the lake where the baby was found A neighbor, Sherry Ricker, said she believed that Justin Campbell was living in the house, and that the family was always busy with a variety of activities RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Girl, 10, dies following house fire caused by an exploding...

Share this article Share Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found the baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist (pictured) arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released on Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. He added: 'Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes. Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.' Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. 'He definitely saved the child's life,' Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m.  While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. A gun was also found inside the SUV, a source told STL today.  A neighbor, Sherry Ricker, said she believed that Justin Campbell was living in the house, and that the family was always busy with a variety of activities.  She said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago, and that she seemed happy.   Firefighters and other emergency workers at the scene near Silver Lake where the submerged SUV was found Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's infant son Police could not enter the house until the fire was fully put out, and the body was removed mid afternoon on Thursday Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship.  In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they married on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later.  Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship The infant is being treated at a St. Louis hospital after the car the child was in rolled into the lake Conservation police search Silver Lake in Highland, Ill., on Thursday, March 16, 2017, after a car with an infant was pulled from the lake earlier in the morning In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he 'abuses me on a weekly basis,' including punching and choking her. 'He has told me that I'm a no good wife,' Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Despite these reports, a manager at Bob Evans restaurant in Collinsville, where Justin Campbell was an employee, said the staff is distraught, and told STL today that Campbell was 'an outstanding guy who loved his kids'. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some 'domestic-related situations,' but he declined to elaborate. 'The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,' Lakin said.   Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

The infant is being treated at a St. Louis hospital after the car the child was in rolled into the lake. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........ST. LOUIS — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. But Thursday was still a tragic day in Madison County, Illinois, where one person died in a house fire and a second died in the lake in what authorities say are cases connected to the child in the SUV. The tangled chain of events began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Advertisement Continue reading Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived, nor was the couple’s seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. “Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,” Lakin said. “Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.” Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist’s actions were heroic. “He definitely saved the child’s life,” Wilson said. Advertisement Continue reading After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell’s home, including some “domestic-related situations,” but he declined to elaborate. “The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,” Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ AP reporter Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

(WISH) — Police in Franklin are looking for a man they say cloned credit cards and used them all over town. Credit card cloning is a problem that too many are experiencing. “It’s happened to people I know and people in my family,” said Raeann Moore, who lives in Franklin. Kelly Glover added, “Somebody cloned mine last year and used it up at Walmart in Carmel. I think it’s ridiculous.” Franklin police say it’s happening so often that they’re investigating new cases on a regular basis. On Wednesday on the department’s Facebook page, investigators posted a picture taken from surveillance video at Walmart in Franklin. It shows the suspect purchasing food and about $200 in gift cards using a cloned card, according to Detective Pete Ketchum. “He was trying at least a dozen different credit cards until he found one or more that worked,” said Ketchum. The card that was eventually approved belonged to a Carmel man, who called police after noticing five unauthorized purchases on his statement. All purchases were around $200. All were made at Walmart stores in Indianapolis and Franklin. Altogether, the suspect spent more than $1,000. “I would say in most cases the suspects and victim do not know each other. The possibilities are endless as to where it occurred, why it occurred,” said Ketchum. According to Ketchum, the information is typically stolen in one of three ways: credit card skimmers, crooks hacking into computers or somebody writing down the information, at a restaurant, for example. Detective Ketchum advises people to check bank statements on a regular basis. Contact the Franklin Police Department with any information at 317-736-3670.

About 6,700 pizzas sold under Wal-Mart's Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative of the supplier said on Thursday. RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547. Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas. The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose & Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR. The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam's Club was not affected. People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible listeria contamination during routine sampling. Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacterium, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems. An estimated 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. In an unrelated case, the CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to the consumption of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery that has led to two deaths.

Observer file photo 1 of 2 i By Adam Bell abell@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A State Auditor report found an N.C. animal shelter director spent more than $67,000 on 2,200 questionable expenses ranging from online dating services to capri pants from WalMart and WWE pay-per-view. State Auditor Beth Wood released the investigative report Thursday for the Carteret County Humane Society and Animal Shelter. The report did not name the director, a woman who no longer works at the shelter. The audit also said the former director excluded more than $44,000 in cash receipts from bank deposits. The audit stated its findings were referred to the local district attorney to determine if criminal charges are warranted. The audit cited questionable expenses from 2,243 purchases on the shelter’s credit card over a 2 1/2 year period. The card had been issued with a $500 limit to purchase medicine for the shelter. Questionable purchases cited by the report included: ▪  $15,617 at convenience stores, including cigars, alcohol, candy and dairy products. ▪  $8,496 at Walmart, including baby back ribs, baby supplies and an Easy Bake Oven. ▪  $950 in entertainment expenses including the pay-per-view event and online dating as well as Xbox Live and Netflix services. ▪  $3,200 in daycare costs. ▪  And a total of $558 for four deposits to inmate prison accounts. The nonprofit shelter accepts all stray and owner-surrendered animals for county residents, and received $210,000 in county funding last year. The report recommended that the humane society’s board provide adequate oversight of shelter operations, seek reimbursement from the former director for personal or unnecessary credit card purchases and attempt to recover the missing cash.

The San Francisco Bay area company would mark Wal-Mart’s third acquisition in less than three months. Walmart.com has not yet confirmed the deal which is slated for a Friday (March 17) announcement, according to fashion Blog Jezebel that reported ModCloth employees were told of the deal Wednesday (March 15). The deal is likely valued somewhere around $75 million, according to Techcrunch. The e-tailer has struggled to make a profit in recent years. ModCloth has been around for 15 years and has survived on venture capital funding. ModCloth reportedly had apparel sales of $150 million in 2015. Two years ago Matt Kaness of Urban Outfitters joined ModCloth as CEO and began to trial physical stores via pop-up stations before setting a permanent store in Austin, Texas. News of the pending acquisition spread during the past 24 hours and there has been mixed sentiment on the deal. ModCloth is a trendy fashion retailer with a mantra to offer “Style for All” which includes vintage fashion for women of all sizes. This inclusive mission is a plus for the retail giant who also claims to be in business for everyone. The fashion retailer sells everything from wedding dresses to swimsuits. Financially it seems Wal-Mart likely got a good deal for the fashion expertise and the retailer will want to maximize the apparel expertise management at ModCloth. Retail executives discussed what this type of acquisition could mean for Wal-Mart in a RetailWire blog posting Thursday (March. 16). “Smart move by Walmart — buying ModCloth at a discount will add to the company’s growing lineup of e-commerce offerings. Walmart management knows it must diversify. Rather than struggle to find innovation within, it’s easier to acquire it,” noted Max Goldberg, CEO of Goldberg & Associates. FutureProof Retail President DiDi Chan expects to see more acquisitions and technology plays by Walmart.com and Amazon in a race to brand themselves as the default “one-stop” shopping center for most consumers. The cultures of ModCloth and Wal-Mart are quite different, but it seems Wal-Mart management is content to let the startups operate as they wish while also getting access to deep category experience that perhaps it can use for own legacy operations. The ModCloth customer is most likely an urban Millennial who wants vintage clothing at value regardless of their size. ModCloth has even dabbled with some private label efforts to try and grow profits in the past few years and most recently worked a deal with Wrangler. Most think ModCloth is a smart buy for Jet.com who is also largely serving the urban customer. But it’s also a win for Wal-Mart if they can set up some type of shop within a store concept at its stores. Retail strategist Jasmine Glasheen said Walmart is ensuring their longevity by picking up brands that speak to the next generation. “Walmart’s success in these acquisitions will be determined by their ability to allow each brand, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to continue the fun, customer-centric and slightly irreverent marketing campaigns that put them on the map,” she added. Not everyone is happy of the about the deal. Some disgruntled ModCloth fans shared their dislike of the pending deal on the retailer’s Facebook page. ModCloth’s store in Austin posted a “Buy 1 Get 50% off all tops” notice on its Facebook page Thursday. One customer, Kelly Brown Kiver of Oakland, Calif., asked if ModCloth was going to make a comment on its “recent sell-out to the most notoriously anti-employee company in the country?” Jodi Greig, of Ann Arbor, Mich., replied, “If this is true, I also will not be purchasing from Modcloth anymore. This was hard news, because a large percentage of my wardrobe is from Modcloth, but I have already found a number of alternatives that look fantastic and are not owned by Walmart or other companies that treat their employees like dirt.” Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon recently told Wall Street analysts that the part of the company’s mission is to be a “trusted retailer.” Ethical sourcing, sustainability initiatives, hiring veterans, raising worker pay, expanding training opportunities and responding to disasters are all part of the retailer doing what is right. Analysts also asked McMillon about the strategy behind the recent acquisitions. He said access to new product assortments was a deciding factor in the recent deals for ShoeBuy and Moosejaw. He said the Jet.com model also draws in consumers from the more upscale urban areas as do the other recent acquisitions. “We can pick up some of these companies that are great in terms of the assortment and the service they provide, but they don’t have enough money to lose, to go market their brand and scale it,” McMillon told analysts. Wal-Mart is expected to make the news public on Friday.

Michael Franklin, Digital Producer @CTVMFranklin Published Thursday, March 16, 2017 12:22PM MDT Airdrie RCMP is hoping the public will be able to help them track down a pair of suspects who were involved in an assault on a pair of Walmart employees on Tuesday. Police say that at around noon, they were called to the Walmart Supercentre on Main Street S. in Airdrie for reports of a theft and assault. A pair of loss prevention officers had detained a female suspected of stealing merchandise from the store. “They tried to stop the woman and she resisted. One of the employees was injured during the incident,” said Constable Jennifer Weedmark with Airdrie RCMP. At that point a man, related in some way to the female suspect, arrived and pushed both of employees violently, freeing the woman. Both suspects then ran to a red, four-door Chevrolet Cruze bearing Alberta licence plate BMZ 1479. The woman is described as: thin build dyed blonde with dark roots black pants black top sunglasses The man is described as: stocky build red beard black ball cap grey hoodie blue jeans white shoes The loss prevention officers suffered just minor injuries in the incident and were not transported to hospital. Anyone with information is asked to contact Constable Nathan Fehr at 403-945-7200. Anonymous tips can also be submitted to Crime Stoppers by calling 1-800-222-8477 or going to www.tipsubmit.com.

To do so, the chain is taking a few pages straight out of Wal-Mart's playbook. Following another slowdown in sales growth at its established shops, Dollar General on Thursday outlined its strategy to drive the business forward. While that plan includes the addition of 1,000 locations this year, it also incorporates investments that should boost performance at its existing stores. Here's what the company is doing. Doling out pay increases to managers It's no longer enough for retailers to compete on price alone. To improve the cleanliness and availability of products in its stores, Dollar General will take a 16 cents per share hit to boost compensation for its managers and ramp up their training. In the stores where it's already rolled out these changes, Dollar General has seen lower turnover among managers and hourly employees, CEO Todd Vasos said on the company's earnings call. It's also seen higher sales in those locations. This decision follows Wal-Mart's $2.7 billion investment into better training and pay for its employees, which it has credited for higher customer service scores. Investing in lower prices There's an all-out price war happening across retail. That includes both Dollar General and Wal-Mart. Shortly after Wal-Mart said it would move faster to lower prices, Dollar General rolled out price cuts on hundreds of items across 17 percent of its stores. These locations have performed better than the chain average ever since, Vasos said. While the company will continue monitoring prices, it doesn't anticipate further price cuts at this time, the CEO said. Bringing in fresh produce Dollar General's food offering has traditionally skewed toward packaged goods. But as its customers ask for healthier options, the retailer sees more opportunity in perishable items. The company is already testing fresh produce in some of its stores, including the 41 locations it purchased from Wal-Mart last year after it shuttered the Express format. Dollar General will now expand that pilot to some of its smaller shops. Wal-Mart has made fresh produce a key piece of its turnaround plan, as it drives more frequent visits from shoppers. While Vasos acknowledged there's stiff competition in fresh food, he said the company's massive fleet and small shops give it a competitive advantage. Going smaller Dollar stores are already a fraction the size of a Wal-Mart Supercenter. But as Dollar General peppers the U.S. with new shops, it's making those locations smaller. The company plans to open an additional 160 small shops this year. At 6,000 square feet, these locations cater to central metropolitan and rural areas. That will bring the total number of these shops to 250. Meanwhile, Dollar General is testing an even smaller 3,600-square-foot store that serves millennials living in urban areas. The expansion of these stores comes as Wal-Mart grows its Neighborhood Market footprint. Making a bigger bet on digital Dollar General lags much of the retail industry when it comes to digital commerce, but the chain is putting a bigger emphasis on technology. Though Vasos was mum on specifics, the decision comes as more low-income consumers purchase mobile devices, the CEO said. Becoming more digitally savvy should also help Dollar General attract millennial shoppers, whom Vasos says are playing a bigger role in its sales. Wal-Mart has also been rolling out upgrades to its website and mobile technologies, including the ability for shoppers to pay directly from its app. Krystina GustafsonEditor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change DG --- WMT --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

How large marketing organizations can overcome the hurdles keeping them from being as nimble as category disruptors. By Josh Kolm 3 days ago Larger companies often struggle with the question of innovation and how to fit new ideas into large operations that might not be set up to handle them. But when speaking about how they’ve tried to tackle the processes that have helped them overcome those barriers, three execs have honed in on one factor that can help even the biggest company be more nimble: communication. Jessica Weisz, chief customer officer at SoapBox, a software platform that facilitates communication of new ideas between employees and management, says innovation processes need to be attacking from two ends. “You need one team that’s doing something different,” says Weisz, a panellist at the recent Dx3 conference in Toronto. “It might not necessarily fit in your one- or two-year strategy, but is aligned to your vision of what you want your company to be. But another team needs to be attacking the internal antibodies that kill the ability to progress. When you try to launch that new service or product, it’s hard enough to think about the actual product, but also get finance to approve and get distribution channels to line up. So you need to be thinking about both of those at the same time.” Weisz adds that both those teams need to be “connected to the whole body” of the organization. Rick Neuman, EVP of ecommerce and technology at Walmart Canada, agrees, especially when it comes to making innovation part of a long-term vision. Going fast or going far? “It’s about leaning in with your partners and figuring out the difference between going fast and  going far,” Neuman says. “The innovation part of the organization needs to be the quickening agent that increases the pulse of the entire organization. If you’re building an innovation strategy that is just about doing something neat, you’re missing the point.” Communication and culture are at the core of facilitating that. “The challenge with innovation at a corporation the size of Walmart is we are really good at operationalizing and getting [stuff] done when it’s part of our normal processes,” Neuman says. “But when you try and insert something new, it gets rejected because it’s going to disrupt the regular order of things. So when you speak with the rest of the organization, you have to keep it so simple as to how it plugs in and operates so the organism accepts and embodies it. You don’t slow down to meet the slowness in the group. You set expectations and celebrate the winners and the success stories.” Don’t get tied up in the business case “A lot of people get caught up in the business case when trying to do that,” adds Ewan McNeill, director of interactive customer experience at the LCBO. “But business cases are an abstraction of what you actually want to do. We’ve found it’s more fruitful to show, two or three years down the line, how it is going to affect customers. When you can relate it to how the customer interacts with us, it’s a lot easier to get it going and align it with what you’re doing as a larger organization.” Even things that seem like the kind of red tape that would stand in the way of innovation – like legal and compliance – don’t need to be a hurdle, even at an organization like the LCBO that needs to be very aware of regulatory factors. “I see legal and compliance as a part of the regular process, because it’s known,” McNeill says. “They are also partners in the organization, so if you bring them in the loop early on and communicate what you’re trying to do, you’ll find they feel it’s going to thrust the organization forward as much as you do.” Change to work with startups, not the other way around Many organizations have turned to the startup community to help foster innovation, but Weisz says it’s important for organizations to not throw their weight around and let their own processes “corrupt” the startup’s product or working process. To that end, Neuman says it might take a change within the organization if they really want to get the most out of working with startups. “We redesigned our non-disclosure agreements and our contracting process to allow for quicker and less painful entry points for startups to work with us,” he says. “Startups work a lot faster than we are used to, and one of the pain points we were finding was that the approval process took months of time, and that kind of thing is not going to work if we’re going to move at the speed we need to in order to make these relationships to pay off.” Conquering the budget hurdle One of the biggest hurdles to innovation, especially in Canada, is budgets and being able to justify the larger organization taking a risk on using its funds on a new initiative that may not pay off. “The whole process is broken,” Weisz says. “You can’t plan 18 months in advance where you are going to need to spend your money. It needs to be chunked out quarter by quarter.” But pending a large-scale change of the entire budget process, Neuman suggested working closely with the finance team, setting aside a small chunk to be put towards innovations and new projects, and using the long-term value addition to the customer to justify getting that chunk, as opposed to a short-term business or sales case. He added that as a retailer known for “everyday low prices,” a lot of cost savings at Walmart ends up being put back into keeping those prices low, but he says rewarding the innovation group for helping that goal can go a long way to funding further innovations. “I tell my team that I’m going to take 50% of any savings you bring back to me and put it back into innovation, because one innovation is going to drive the next innovation after that,” he says. “It still means you have to, philosophically, take a chunk of those saving and put it into price so we are living our message, but if my team knows it’s going to have a payoff for them as well and get rewarded for living our values, it makes their work feel much more valuable.” Tags: Ewan McNeill, Jessica Weisz, LCBO, Rick Neuman, SoapBox, Walmart, walmart canada Related Articles SapientRazorfish stakes a claim in consultancy space Tech in Action: Levi’s smart jacket Brita uses VR to show the impact of clean water Brand Doctors: Beyond Samsung’s tricky launch RBC launches transfers through Siri Popular Recent Featured Keurig heats up the competition General Mills brings back ‘Bring Back the Bees’ Koodo goes deeper into ‘Choose Happy’ McDonald’s breaks the rules Agropur launches first-ever masterbrand campaign Careers » Screening Room » Dairy Farmers gets cheesy to sell milk Koodo goes deeper into ‘Choose Happy’ Check it out: A slightly threatening invitation Keurig heats up the competition Twitter Tweets about "from:StrategyOnline OR @StrategyOnline OR strategyonline.ca" Follow @StrategyOnline Facebook About Strategy strategy™ uncovers and shares the "bold vision, brand new ideas" of Canada’s national marketing community.

 Walmart manufacturer recalls more than 21,000 pounds of pizza that may have been contaminated with listeria Mary Hanbury Mar. 16, 2017, 1:15 PM 4,526 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Rick Wilking One of Walmart's most popular frozen pizzas might be contaminated with listeria. The Marketside Extra Large Supreme 16-inch pizza, produced exclusively for Walmart and sold for $7.93, was recalled by its manufacturer on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that 21,200 pounds of the frozen pizza product, which is made by RBR Meat Company and sold at Walmart, may be contaminated with L. monocytogenes. This bacteria causes listeriosis, a serious infection that can be fatal for older adults, pregnant women, and people with weaker immune systems.  There have not yet been any reported cases of illness or bad reactions to the product. The issue was discovered during a sampling test conducted by the manufacturer.  Walmart Listeria symptoms, such as high fever, stiffness, and nausea, typically appear a few days to a few weeks after eating the contaminated item. Consumers are advised to seek medical attention if these flu-like symptoms continue.  The FSIS has warned customers to throw out any of these frozen pizzas immediately.  This week Whole Foods pulled soft cheeses made with raw, unpasteurized milk by Vulto Creamery from its stores in the Northeast after a listeria outbreak in the creamery's cheese was linked to two deaths and six illnesses.  Get the latest Walmart stock price here.

Discount retailer Dollar General reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and said it would raise wages for store managers, replicating similar moves by larger retailers such as Wal-Mart. Dollar General said on Thursday it would hike compensation and provide more training for its store managers, a move that it hopes will improve service quality in stores over time but will pressure earnings this year. Wal-Mart in 2015 had said it would spend $2.7 billion on wages, benefits and training, a move that it said had improved service quality and boosted sales last year. Other retailers have also hiked manager salaries in the past year in response to a tight labor market and also to comply with a rule change that extended mandatory overtime pay to more workers. Dollar General said it had earmarked about $70 million in 2017, mainly for the pay hikes. The company said sales rose 13.7 percent to $6.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, helped by higher average spending at its stores, even as store traffic declined slightly. Analysts had expected sales of $5.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Dollar General and larger rival Dollar Tree face stiff competition from Wal-Mart and Target Corp, which have been discounting aggressively, even amid falling grocery prices, to boost store traffic. Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based Dollar General forecast earnings of $4.25 to $4.50 per share for the year ending February 2018, largely below the average analyst estimate of $4.39. Net income rose to $414.2 million or $1.49 per share in the fourth quarter, from $376.2 million or $1.30 per share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.41 per share. Dollar General's shares were slightly lower before the bell after rising 6 percent earlier. Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change DG ---

Recall: 21,220 Pounds Of Supreme Pizza Sold At Walmart For Potential Listeria Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Recall: 21,220 Pounds Of Supreme Pizza Sold At Walmart For Potential Listeria March 16, 2017 10:59 am EDT By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup bakes fresh in minutes frozen pizza marketside pizza supreme pizza walmart marketside pizza Did you recently pick up an extra large supreme frozen pizza at Walmart, and stash it in your freezer? Did you pick one up in the last few weeks for your family pizza night? If so, you’ll want to check your freezer or monitor your family members for illness: Those pizzas may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The affected pizzas were sold under the Marketside brand, and the variety is an Extra Large Supreme Pizza. They’re 16″, and the lot code is 20547. Look for establishment 1821 on the round USDA inspection mark that appears on all foods with meat in them. Listeria is one of the sneakiest foodborne illnesses, since it can wait around in your body for as long as 70 days without making you sick. For healthy adults, the infection may pass unnoticed or as only a brief gastrointestinal illness. The infection can be more serious and even deadly for pregnant women, senior citizens, and people with compromised immune systems, though. It manifests as brief flu-like symptoms in pregnant women, but can cause serious illness in the fetus, which can lead to miscarriage, premature birth, or stillbirth. Invasive Listeriosis can cause life-threatening meningitis in other patients, and symptoms to watch for include fever, body aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. If you have questions about products you’ve purchased or about the recall, call RBR Meat Company at 323-826-2144 Ext. 190.

The dollar store chain said on Thursday it would hike compensation and provide more training for its store managers, a strategy that it hopes will improve service quality in stores over time but will pressure earnings this year. Wal-Mart in 2015 had said it would spend $2.7 billion on wages and training, a move it said has helped improve service quality and boost sales. A tight labor market and rule changes related to overtime pay have made other retailers raise wages as well. Dollar General said stores where it had already introduced pay hikes for managers had seen higher sales and greater employee retention. The moves come as Dollar General and larger rival Dollar Tree Inc face stiff competition from Wal-Mart and other grocery retailers, which have been discounting aggressively, even amid falling food prices, to win customers. "We don't see a further (price reduction) needed because we are priced very, very aggressively in most of our areas today, if not all," Dollar General Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a post-earnings call with analysts. The company said it had slashed prices on about 450 best-selling products in less than a fifth of its stores starting in mid-2016, which helped lift sales. "They are doing the right thing ... they are not going to be the low-price leader, but they're going to be in a range that is acceptable to their customer that doesn't cause them to lose to the competition," said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Dollar General's sales rose 13.7 percent to $6.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, helped by higher average spending at its stores, even as store traffic declined slightly. Analysts had expected sales of $5.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company said it expects earnings of $4.25 to $4.50 per share for the year ending Feb. 2, 2018, largely below the average analyst estimate of $4.39. The forecast includes about $70 million earmarked mainly for the wage hikes. Net income rose 10 percent to $414.2 million or $1.49 per share in the quarter, beating the average estimate of $1.41. Dollar General's shares were up 3 percent at $74.96 in midday trading. Up to Wednesday's close, they had fallen 1.7 percent this year.

From staff and wire reports Lanxess profits beat estimates German plastics and chemicals maker Lanxess said fourth-quarter adjusted income jumped by 21 percent while sales rose by 6 percent. The company has its North American base in Findlay. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were 183 million euros ($194 million) beating analysts’ estimates of 178 million euros. Sales were 1.9 billion euros. Net income fell by 87 percent to 2 million euros. Chairman Matthias Zachert said the company has made significant progress in a reorganization that has included some cutbacks and acquisitions. Excela Health’s income swings into the black Net income for Greensburg-based hospital system Excela Health swung into the black for the six months ending Dec. 31 to $17 million, compared with a loss of $2.6 million for the same period in 2015, according to quarterly financials released Tuesday. The gain lifted the system’s operating income margin to 2.1 percent from 0.5 percent for the same period in 2015. PNC: Pittsburgh’s economy to limp ahead this year The Pittsburgh economy is expected limp ahead in 2017, continuing the trend of the last two years, according to a report from PNC Financial Services Group. “New job creation has been virtually nonexistent since 2013, with only 11,000 jobs being added” in the last three years, the report said. Longer term, Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling and high-tech operations are expected to be the bright spots in the local labor market, PNC said.  Report: Modcloth has been acquired by a division of Wal-Mart Modcloth, an online clothing retailer with roots in Pittsburgh, has been acquired by e-commerce company Jet.com, according to a report by the women’s news blog Jezebel. Jet.com is owned by Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the country. Modcloth was launched in 2002 by two alumni of Carnegie Mellon University, Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger. The company, an indie-darling known for vintage and quirky styles, eventually moved its corporate base to San Francisco. It has 350 employees across offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. Messages to ModCloth and Wal-Mart were not immediately returned. Pennsylvania's Zippo lighter factory lays off 38 workers Pennsylvania’s iconic Zippo lighter factory has laid off 38 workers, blaming a slowdown in the company’s North American business and a glut of inventory in China. Zippo is based in Bradford, Pa. Mark Paup, Zippo Manufacturing Co.‘s president and CEO, says the company used to ship its product to China through a Hong Kong importer. But the company stopped doing that because of problems with black market and gray market lighters in China. The company took over importing to China and last year had a boom in production to fill that demand, but now the company has determined it has too much inventory there. GoPro camera maker cuts jobs again in search of profitability GoPro Inc. unveiled a second round of job cuts to reduce costs in the face of growing skepticism from Wall Street that the action-camera maker can return to growth and make a profit. The company said it’s eliminating about 270 full-time and open positions. In November, it chopped 15 percent of its workforce and shut down its entertainment division. GoPro had 1,552 employees at the end of 2016, according to a regulatory filing. The latest cuts are expected to reduce full-year adjusted operating expenses to less than $495 million. That’s about 18 percent below the company’s previous projection of $600 million. Americans spent slightly more at retail stores last month Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January’s gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven’t yet lifted spending. But last month’s sluggish pace could prove temporary.

(DG) Stock Is Only Good When Things Are Bad Dollar General is a good bet for those expecting a recession By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 15, 2017, 10:14 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: United Continental Holdings Inc: The Worst Airline Stock You Can Buy Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Is a Zombie You Need to Avoid Will Valeant Shareholders Get ANYTHING? (VRX) Recent Posts: Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Is a Zombie You Need to Avoid Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock Is in a Gold-Plated Doghouse An Uber IPO Will Be a Down Round View All Posts Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG), the store for people who can’t get to a Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) regularly, has gone nowhere in the three months since it last reported earnings. The fourth-quarter report, due Mar. 16, is expected to show improvement, $1.41 per share of earnings on $5.98 billion in revenue, but whether that ends the carping for DG stock remains to be seen. Source: Shutterstock Since hitting an all-time high of $96.71 per share last July, Dollar General has lost nearly 20% of its value. Its top line seemed to stall at $5.3 billion, and its performance over the last year trails low-cost retailing rivals Fred’s, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRED), Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE:BIG) and even Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR), which won a bitter takeover battle against it for Family Dollar. If the Dollar General earnings meet expectations, DG stock could gap up, just as it gapped down after the July earnings disappointed. DG Stock: A Contrary Bet Analyst views on Dollar General tend to run contrary to their views on the economy. If you think happy days are here, you may not like DG stock. If you’re worried, like Richard Band, you may like it a lot. The trend among analysts, however, has been to move Dollar General from a buy to a hold, as they think the recovery will continue. DG is a very misunderstood company. Some analysts lump it in with Dollar Tree, whose dollar stores fit well in middle-class strip malls. Others class it alongside Walmart, whose stores are too big to serve Dollar General’s niche. Simply put, DG serves poor people. Most of its outlets tend to be in the food deserts of big cities or in towns too small to use a bigger store. For many people, it’s a retailer of last resort, one reason it had a growth runway during the low, slow climb out of the last recession. Dollar General serves these customers well. The stock is customized for the location. You will find pork rinds only where there are customers who like pork rinds. Where it’s legal,the company sells tobacco, beer, wine and even hard liquor. These innovations kept sales, and DG stock, rising throughout the recovery. Dollar General averages 30% gross margins on its inventory, against 25% for Walmart and a miniscule 13% for Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The margins are still smaller than small merchants can live with, the stores smaller than any Walmart can profitably build, and this gives Dollar General a nice business.

James DeLapp and Jimmy Lyons lfs.jpg U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Col. James DeLapp, left, and Alabama State Port Authority Director Jimmy Lyons, right, answer media questions about a study on enlarging the Mobile ship channel on Thursday, March 16, 2017. (Lawrence Specker/LSpecker@AL.com) Print Email Lawrence Specker | lspecker@al.com By Lawrence Specker | lspecker@al.com Press-Register Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 16, 2017 at 9:29 PM, updated March 16, 2017 at 9:45 PM comments The concerns were close to the surface Thursday evening as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held a public meeting in Daphne on a study that could lead to enlargement of the Mobile Ship Channel. The worries weren't aired in the style of a town hall meeting in the Bayfront Park pavilion. It wasn't that kind of meeting. Instead it was an open house pitched as "an opportunity for the public to obtain information about the ongoing study of the Mobile Harbor Channel, speak with subject matter experts and ask questions about the project." It also was a chance for the public to receive repeated assurances: that the outcome of the study wasn't a foregone conclusion, that the process was complex in part because it the Corps was trying to be as transparent as possible, that public input was considered not only welcome but essential, that the Corps' final recommendation would carefully consider potential harm to the environment and ecosystems of Mobile Bay. The process began in 2014, when the Alabama State Port Authority asked the Corps to consider the project. That initiated a four-year, $7.8 million study, which the Corps' Mobile District Commander, Col. James DeLapp, said should be completed in late 2019. The motivation to enlarge the channel is straightforward: "The ships are getting bigger," said Port Authority Director Jimmy Lyons, and consequently the port is facing "congestion issues and capacity issues." Global developments such as improvements to the Panama Canal mean that ever-bigger container ships are plying the seas, bound for Mobile and competing U.S. ports. The biggest ones can't come up the Mobile channel fully loaded, because it's not deep enough, or pass each other on the way in and out, because it's not wide enough. Improving the channel to better serve those ships wouldn't bring a direct windfall to the port, Lyons said. But it would bolster the area's ability to serve and attract developments such as the new Walmart distribution center being built west of Mobile. But some fear that the existing channel, and the dredge spoil from its creation and maintenance, already has hurt the ecology of the bay. Avery Bates, Vice President of the Organized Seafood Association of Alabama, was part of a group who'd set up shop in the parking lot outside the Corps' open house, to make sure they got a chance to share their viewpoint with interested members of the public. Bates said that while most people don't see it that way, the bay is "farming land" to shrimpers, crabbers and fishermen. "We know it's going to be devastating to the bay," he said of spoil from work to expand the channel. "The damage here is going to be magnified." "We're not so much against digging the channel, but it's what it's going to do to these people," he said, gesturing to some of the seafood industry workers on hand. "This is something crucial to people trying to keep their way of life." On another front, some say the existing channel contributes to erosion of Dauphin Island and that a wider, deeper channel would do even more harm to the fragile barrier island - especially if the Corps doesn't commit to depositing dredged sand where it can replenish the shoreline. Plan to enlarge Mobile Ship Channel raises environmental issues Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier was on hand, and said a number of other islanders were among the dozens of people who turned out for the meeting. "I don't know how much good it'll do us, but we're here," Collier said. "I've been dealing with this stuff for two decades, and it's frustrating." Collier submitted a letter focusing on the issue of dredged sand, saying that an alternate disposal site would address a "longstanding inadequacy" in channel management and would give Dauphin Island "the quality and quantity of sand it needs to insure long-term sustainability." Both in the letter and speaking in person, Collier argued for a common-sense approach. "I just can't believe we just can't find a way to do what's right," he said. Col. DeLapp said the study process "absolutely" was weighing impacts such as those feared by Bates and Collier. "We're going to look at alternatives," he said. The goal of the study process is to come up with a recommendation for the best way to proceed with the channel enlargement, Col. DeLapp said. Ideally, it'll be an approach that minimizes harm while making the most efficient use of the money spent on the project. Even when the study is finished in 2019, "It does not mean the work will start at that point," DeLapp said. The political question of whether to proceed and the economic question of how to fund the project will remain. The channel currently has a nominal depth of 45 feet and a width of 400 feet for most of its run, widening as it opens into the Gulf of Mexico. While dimensions of the planned enlargement haven't been finalized, it likely would be increased to 55-foot depth and 550 feet or more in width. The work would end about a mile downstream of the Wallace and Bankhead tunnels, which limit depth to about 40 feet where they cross the Mobile River. That would be far enough for big ships to reach three terminals designed to handle containers, coal and steel, Lyons said. A Corps spokeswoman said the next public meeting likely will be held later this year, as the study process continues to advance through a series of milestones.

Security researcher Troy Hunt from Have I Been Pwned? worked with Zack Whittaker of ZDNet to get to the bottom of the matter. In analyzing a 52.2GB CSV file containing JSON data, Hunt found a total of 33,698,126 records containing detailed contact information including first and last names, job titles, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, employers, job functions and more. The data, described as “very corporate” and “perfect” by Hunt, is limited to those working in the US. The top 10 entities on the list according to Hunt are as follows: DOD Cce : 101,013 United States Postal Service : 88,153 AT&T Inc. : 67382 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. : 55,421 CVS Health Corporation : 40,739 The Ohio State University : 38,705 Citigroup Inc. : 35,292 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association : 34,928 Kaiser Foundation Hospitals : 34,805 International Business Machines Corporation : 33,412 Hunt and Whittaker were able to confirm that the data is indeed from Dun & Bradstreet and that it is database information that they sell to clients (for marketing purposes). That said, Dun & Bradstreet said they don’t believe the data came directly from one of their systems. With thousands of customers purchasing from the data set, it could be next to impossible to learn who ultimately leaked it – intentionally or not. 4 comments 190 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Spammers accidentally expose database of 1.4 billion addresses Cloudflare bug leaked encryption keys, passwords and more Popular 121 comments Microsoft now blocks Windows 7 and 8.1 updates on Kaby Lake, Ryzen systems 33 comments AMD Ryzen 5 processors detailed, launching April 11 Load Comments 4 ...

(WOFL FOX 35) - Orange County’s top law enforcement officers expressed their frustration over State Attorney Aramis Ayala announcement on Thursday to no longer pursue the death penalty in capital murder cases.  They also expressed relief over a decision by Florida Gov.Rick Scott to reassign the high-profile case of Markieth Loyd to another state prosecutor, Brad King.   Loyd is accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixo,n and her unborn child in December of last year.  After a weeks-long manhunt, authorities said Loyd gunned down Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton outside an Orlando Walmart.  "We support the actions of Gov. Rick Scott to appoint Brad King to decide this case," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. "To put it bluntly, law enforcement officers throughout Florida are outraged over the decision that was made in this case." OPD's Deputy Chief Robert Anzueto agreed, "This decision by the State Attorney has law enforcement nationwide questioning her actions. The members of the Orlando Police Department are in total disagreement in her decision." Anzueto argued that the death penalty helps prevent crime, adding, "It can be a deterrent to crime that never happened. It would be difficult to tally up those kinds of preventable stats". Family members of the victims in the Markeith Loyd case were outraged over Ayala’s decision. As far as closure, the husband of fallen officer Debra Clayton, Seth Clayton, said, "To me, my closure will be when Markeith Loyd is six feet under."  Clayton thanked the governor for taking Ayala off the case. "The decision whether some should live or die in a case like this should be in the hands of a jury, not one person to decide."    false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent APD officer goes beyond call of duty to help teen Florida court defines sexual intercourse Snake slithers from vent in woman's car Dramatic police chase comes to a deadly end 'No indication' Trump Tower was surveilled Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

The baby was flown to a St. Louis Hospital. clibbra@bnd.com 1 of 3 i By Kelsey Landis klandis@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A sleepy suburban subdivision in Glen Carbon, Illinois, woke before sunrise on a chilly March morning to fire trucks and police cars surrounding a home engulfed in flames. Sixteen-and-a-half miles away, Cristy Campbell drove a blue-gray Nissan Armada SUV, with a 3-month-old baby inside, off a two-lane highway and into Silver Lake near Highland, Illinois. A mystery surrounding the two events and their possible connections began unfolding shortly after 5:30 a.m. Thursday morning and continued through the day. Questions mounted as officials worked to identify a person who died in the fire and Cristy Campbell’s body, found hours later in the lake. Many questions were still unanswered Thursday evening. The home at 15 Dogwood Lane where seven children lived had burned beyond a liveable state by 7 a.m. Neighbors said the children’s parents lived there, too. One person died in the fire, but Madison County Coroner Stephen Nonn said he had not determined a positive identity as of Thursday evening. “It’s my understanding the body was very badly burned,” Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said in a Thursday afternoon news conference. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:13 Marlins pitcher Dan Straily talks about preparing for first season with Marlins Pause 2:17 Spoonbills indicator for health of Florida Bay 1:06 FHP trooper critically hurt in Dolphin Expressway accident 1:31 Prison guards respond to a collapsed Darren Rainey 6:39 Miami Dolphins GM Chris Grier talks free agency at combine 0:46 Florida House Speaker Corcoran addresses Tiger Bay Club in Pensacola 3:36 Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announces Venezuela sanctions 2:55 Goran Dragic addresses Dion Waiters injury 0:36 Video shows Darren Rainey being taken out of cell by prison staff 1:35 Miami plastic surgeon discusses his work Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Fire badly damages home on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon; coroner called The Madison County coroner was called to a house fire Thursday morning in Glen Carbon. klandis@bnd.com An autopsy was scheduled for Friday morning. Six of the children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, escaped the burning home, which is owned by Cristy Campbell, 32, according to property records. Two of the children fled to a nearby Walmart for help. Chilling surveillance footage from a neighbor’s home shows the children tottering down the street in the dark. The seventh child was later found floating inside the gray SUV in Silver Lake. A passerby saw the vehicle drive into the lake and called 911. That’s when paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived at the lake and became a hero. He dived into the 46-degree water, swam more than 50 feet and pulled the baby to safety. Zobrist then performed CPR on the baby while on the hood of the partially-submerged SUV. The baby was then flown to a St. Louis hospital. “Todd Zobrist saved that child’s life today,” the sheriff said. Zobrist was recovering and “trying to stay warm” as of Thursday afternoon, Highland Fire-EMS Chief Brian Wilson said. “When everyone heard someone jumped in the water, there was no question of who it was,” Wilson added. The child was in good condition as of Thursday evening, Lakin said, and was expected to be released from the hospital Friday. The other children were placed in the care of a relative. After the vehicle went into the lake, conservation police with a sonar-equipped boat searched the water, while police with dogs searched in the woods near Silver Lake. Glen Carbon police had issued a search alert Thursday morning for Cristy Campbell, describing her as a “person of interest” and “possibly endangered.” Todd Zobrist saved that child’s life today. Madison County Sheriff John Lakin Hours after Zobrist saved the baby, Cristy Campbell’s body was found in the lake not far from where the vehicle sank. Police had been called to 15 Dogwood Lane about 50 times since 2010 for various reasons, including barking dogs, 911 hangups and other calls for service, the sheriff said. Neighbors said while the Campbell home was a little chaotic with so many children running around and playing, they seemed like a “normal” family. The Country Meadows subdivision where they lived is the kind of neighborhood with street names like “Red Bud Lane” and “Meadow Lane.” It’s tucked away behind a busy shopping area. “They were nice people,” said Sherry Ricker, who has lived across the street from the Campbells’ house since 2004. Ricker said Cristy Campbell lived there with her children and husband, though it could not be independently verified Thursday that Cristy Campbell’s husband or ex-husband lived there. Mitchell Langenhorst has lived across the street from the house for two years. “They were normal people,” Langenhorst said. “The kids were pretty hectic.” Langenhorst watched the story unfold on televised news. When he saw the Nissan Armada pulled from Silver Lake, he said he recognized it right away. “I recognized that car,” he said. “I saw it parked out front (of 15 Dogwood Lane) all the time.” Court records show Cristy Campbell and her ex-husband Justin Campbell’s marriage was rocky. They had their first child in 2002, when Cristy Campbell was still a teenager, and they married in 2006. In 2005, Justin Campbell was charged with aggravated domestic violence, a felony, for allegedly slapping his wife, who was pregnant at the time. The charge was reduced to a misdemeanor as part of a plea bargain, and he paid a $500 fine and was placed on probation for a year. The couple filed for divorce in 2010, but changed their minds and ended the proceedings. Cristy Campbell requested an order of protection against Justin Campbell in April 2012, but requested that it be allowed to expire 15 days later. She filed for divorce again in September 2012. Justin Campbell failed to respond to the filing before the court date in 2013, according to court records, and it was finalized without his participation. The divorce included provisions for child support and visitation. “When everyone heard someone jumped in the water, there was no question of who it was.” Highland Fire-EMS Chief Brian Wilson A search of Cristy Campbell’s records turned up mostly parking tickets, though she was charged in 2014 with allowing her 5-year-old child to leave their home unattended. The charges were dropped after she completed parenting classes. Cristy Campbell’s posts on social media depict a happy motherhood. Her Facebook profile picture showed her receiving a kiss from a dolphin. One post showed pictures of a child posing with a “Do the Right Thing” award. Family portraits and pictures of her then-newborn baby dot the mother’s Facebook profile. Whether Cristy Campbell’s ex-husband died Wednesday was unclear as of Thursday evening, but the sheriff pointed out the death toll could have been nine instead of two if it weren’t for the bravery of emergency responders and police. &nbsp; facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:06 FHP trooper critically hurt in Dolphin Expressway accident Pause 2:13 Marlins pitcher Dan Straily talks about preparing for first season with Marlins 1:31 Prison guards respond to a collapsed Darren Rainey 6:39 Miami Dolphins GM Chris Grier talks free agency at combine 0:46 Florida House Speaker Corcoran addresses Tiger Bay Club in Pensacola 3:36 Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announces Venezuela sanctions 2:55 Goran Dragic addresses Dion Waiters injury 0:36 Video shows Darren Rainey being taken out of cell by prison staff 1:35 Miami plastic surgeon discusses his work 4:08 Video: Miami doctor performs plastic surgery (Graphic Content) Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Body recovered from Highland, IL, lake A body was recovered from Silver Lake in Highland about six hours after a Glen Carbon mother of seven's SUV went into the lake nearby.

Scott had asked Aramis Ayala to recuse herself from the case and when she refused he removed her. 'Earlier today, I called on State Attorney Ayala to immediately recuse herself from this case,' Scott said in a statement.  'She informed me this afternoon that she refuses to do that. She has made it clear that she will not fight for justice, and that is why I am using my executive authority to immediately reassign the case,' he said.   Orange-Osceola State Attorney Aramis Ayala announces that her office will no longer pursue the death penalty as a sentence in any case brought before the 9th Judicial Circuit of Florida Florida Governor Rick Scott (above) removed Ayala from the Markeith Loyd case after she announced that she will not pursue the death penalty in any case under her administration Scott gave the case to Lake County State Attorney Brad King, citing a Florida law that allows the governor to appoint a different prosecutor if they find a 'good and sufficient reason' to take it away from the original prosecutor.  Ayala, who took office in January, issued a statement Thursday, saying that she will cooperate with Scott's decision.    'Upon receipt of any lawful order, my office will follow that order and fully cooperate to ensure the successful prosecution of Markeith Loyd,' she said.  Ayala pointed to time, resources and cost to taxpayers as reasons why she will not pursue the death penalty for Loyd or any accused criminal, CBS News reports.  Loyd, 41, is accused of fatally shooting Orlando Lieutenant Debra Clayton on January 9 outside a Walmart as she tried to apprehend him over the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon, 24, on December 13.  Loyd, 41, (pictured) waves to family members as he arrives to a court hearing in March He is accused of fatally shooting Orlando officer Debra Clayton, 42,on January 9 outside a Walmart as she tried to apprehend him over the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend He is also accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon, 24, (pictured) in December In Ayala's surprise announcement, she referenced a bill passed Tuesday that will require a unanimous jury recommendation before judges can impose the death penalty.   'By choosing to seek life sentences over death, we can assure that violent offenders will never be released,' said Ayala. 'They will never continue to drain resources from this state with decades of appeals.'   She highlighted the recent problems with the death penalty in Florida, which had been one of the nation's most active proponents of the practice.  The US Supreme Court struck down Florida's death-sentencing scheme last year that reduces the jury's role to an advisory one and gives judges too much power, the Washington Post reports.  The court's decision halted executions in Florida, which has not carried out a lethal injection since January 2016.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Pictured: The 17-year-old obsessed with comic books and guns...

'To put it bluntly, the law enforcement officers of Central Florida are outraged,' said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings at a press conference Thursday afternoon.  Orlando Police Chief John Mina told WESH 2 News that the crimes Loyd is accused of are the reason for having the death penalty.   Attorney General Pam Bondi called the announcement "a blatant neglect of duty and a shameful failure to follow the law".   State attorneys, which ensure that laws are properly interpreted and enforced, have wide discretion on who they charge with a crime, what charge to file and what penalty to seek, according to the Orlando Sentinel.  Florida law does not require state attorneys to seek the death penalty.     Read more: Fla. prosecutor removed from cop-killing case over death penalty decision - CBS News Man finds alligator in his garage After Florida prosecutor says she won¿t seek death penalty, governor reassigns case of slain police officer - The Washington Post Gov.

American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Editor’s note: We’ve all heard of the great divide between life in rural and urban America. But what are the factors that contribute to these differences? We asked sociologists, economists, geographers and historians to describe the divide from different angles. The data paint a richer and sometimes surprising picture of the U.S. today. 1. Poverty is higher in rural areas Discussions of poverty in the United States often mistakenly focus on urban areas. While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While these rural-urban gaps have diminished markedly, substantial differences persist. In 2015, 16.7 percent of the rural population was poor, compared with 13.0 percent of the urban population overall – and 10.8 percent among those living in suburban areas outside of principal cities. Contrary to common assumptions, substantial shares of the poor are employed. Approximately 45 percent of poor, prime-age (25-54) householders worked at least part of 2015 in rural and urban areas alike. The link between work and poverty was different in the past. In the early 1980s, the share of the rural poor that was employed exceeded that in urban areas by more than 15 percent. Since then, more and more poor people in rural areas are also unemployed – a trend consistent with other patterns documented below. That said, rural workers continue to benefit less from work than their urban counterparts. In 2015, 9.8 percent of rural, prime-age working householders were poor, compared with 6.8 percent of their urban counterparts. Nearly a third of the rural working poor faced extreme levels of deprivation, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty line, or approximately US$12,000 for a family of four. Large shares of the rural workforce also live in economically precarious circumstances just above the poverty line. Nearly one in five rural working householders lived in families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty line. That’s nearly five percentage points more than among urban workers (13.5 percent). According to recent research, rural-urban gaps in working poverty cannot be explained by rural workers’ levels of education, industry of employment or other similar factors that might affect earnings. Rural poverty – at least among workers – cannot be fully explained by the characteristics of the rural population. That means reducing rural poverty will require attention to the structure of rural economies and communities. – Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University 2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t. Rural communities still haven’t recovered the jobs they lost in the recession. Census data show that the rural job market is smaller now – 4.26 percent smaller, to be exact – than it was in 2008. In these data are shuttered coal mines on the edges of rural towns and boarded-up gas stations on rural main streets. In these data are the angers, fears and frustrations of much of rural America. This isn’t a new trend. Mechanization, environmental regulations and increased global competition have been slowly whittling away at resource extraction economies and driving jobs from rural communities for most of the 20th century. But the fact that what they’re experiencing now is simply the cold consequences of history likely brings little comfort to rural people. If anything, it only adds to their fear that what they once had is gone and it’s never coming back. Nor is it likely that the slight increase in rural jobs since 2013 brings much comfort. As the resource extraction economy continues to shrink, most of the new jobs in rural areas are being created in the service sector. So Appalachian coal miners and Northwest loggers are now stocking shelves at the local Walmart. The identity of rural communities used to be rooted in work. The signs at the entrances of their towns welcomed visitors to coal country or timber country. Towns named their high school mascots after the work that sustained them, like the Jordan Beetpickers in Utah or the Camas Papermakers in Washington. It used to be that, when someone first arrived at these towns, they knew what people did and that they were proud to do it. That’s not so clear anymore. How do you communicate your communal identity when the work once at the center of that identity is gone, and calling the local high school football team the “Walmart Greeters” simply doesn’t have the same ring to it? Looking at rural jobs data, is it so hard to understand why many rural people are nostalgic for the past and fearful for the future? – Steven Beda, Instructor of History, University of Oregon 3. Disabilities are more common in rural areas Disability matters in rural America. Data from the American Community Survey, an annual government poll, reveal that disability is more prevalent in rural counties than their urban counterparts. The rate of disability increases from 11.8 percent in the most urban metropolitan counties to 15.6 percent in smaller micropolitan areas and 17.7 percent in the most rural, or noncore, counties. While rural-urban differences in disability have been analyzed previously, researchers have had little opportunity to further explore this disparity, as updated data on rural disability were unavailable until recently. Fortunately, the census released updated new county-level disability estimates in 2014, ending a 14-year knowledge gap. The release of these estimates has also allowed us to build a picture of geographic variations in disability across the nation. Disability rates vary significantly across the U.S. Although the national trend of higher disability rates in rural counties persists at the regional and even divisional level, it is clear that disability in rural America is not homogeneous. Rates of rural disability range from around 15 percent in the Great Plains to 21 percent in the central South. Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America. American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY A variety of factors may be behind these regional and rural differences, including differences in demographics, economic patterns, health and service access and state disability policies. While this survey provides a glimpse into the national prevalence of disability and reveals a persistent rural-urban disparity, it is important to note its limitations. Disability is the result of an interaction between an individual and his or her environment. Therefore, these data do not directly measure disability, as they measure only physical function and do not consider environmental factors such as inaccessible housing. – Lillie Greiman and Andrew Myers, Project Directors at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities at the University of Montana; Christiane von Reichert, Professor of Geography, University of Montana 4. Rural areas are surprisingly entrepreneurial The United States’ continuing economic dominance is perhaps most attributable to the very smallest elements of its economy: its entrepreneurial start-ups. Nearly 700,000 new job-creating businesses open each year. That’s almost 2,000 every day, each helping to create new market niches in the global economy. Most people mistakenly believe these pioneering establishments occur in overwhelmingly in metropolitan areas, such as in the now-mythic start-up culture of Silicon Valley. Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is in fact nonmetropolitan counties that have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors than their metropolitan counterparts. Furthermore, the more rural the county, the higher its level of entrepreneurship. Some of these counties have a farming legacy – perhaps the most entrepreneurial of occupations – but farmers represent less than one-sixth of business owners in nonmetro areas. Even for nonfarm enterprises, rural entrepreneurship rates are higher. The reality is that rural areas have to be entrepreneurial, as industries with concentrations of wage and salary jobs are necessarily scarce. Start-up businesses have notoriously difficult survival prospects. So it is perhaps even more surprising that relatively isolated nonmetropolitan businesses are on average more resilient than their metro cousins, despite the considerable economic advantages of urban areas, which boast a denser networks of workers, suppliers and markets. The resilience of rural start-ups is perhaps due to more cautious business practices in areas with few alternative employment options. This resilience is also remarkably persistent over time, consistently being at least on par with metro start-ups, and regularly having survival rates up to 10 percentage points higher than in metro areas over 1990-2007. – Stephan Weiler, Professor of Economics, Colorado State University; Tessa Conroy and Steve Deller, Professors of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison Economy Urban US politics Rural Rural America Inside Rural America Tweet Share Get newsletter You might also like A family dairy farm in Gilmanton Ironworks, New Hampshire.

Tim Vizer tvizer@bnd.com 1 of 5 i By Kelsey Landis klandis@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A sleepy suburban subdivision in Glen Carbon woke before sunrise on a chilly March morning to fire trucks and police cars surrounding a home engulfed in flames. Sixteen-and-a-half miles away, Cristy Campbell drove a blue-gray Nissan Armada SUV, with a 3-month-old baby inside, off a two-lane highway and into Silver Lake near Highland. A mystery surrounding the two events and their possible connections began unfolding shortly after 5:30 a.m. Thursday and continued through the day. Questions mounted as officials worked to identify a person who died in the fire as well as Cristy Campbell’s body, found hours later in the lake. Many questions were still unanswered Thursday evening. The home at 15 Dogwood Lane where seven children lived had burned beyond a liveable state by 7 a.m. Neighbors said the children’s parents lived there, too. One person died in the fire, but Madison County Coroner Stephen Nonn said he had not determined a positive identity as of Thursday evening. “It’s my understanding the body was very badly burned,” Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said in a Thursday afternoon news conference. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:32 Baby pulled from car that went into lake Pause 2:48 Chuck Berry's rock ’n’ roll legacy 3:33 Edwardsville and Glen Carbon collect donations for orphaned kids 0:51 Children fleeing fatal fire, reflection of flames, caught on surveillance video 21:17 Watch entire press conference on Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash, and mom drowning 2:05 Sheriff confirms police had been to Glen Carbon home about 50 times 2:19 Neighborhood helps 7 children who survived fire, mom's drowning 0:12 Body recovered from Silver Lake in Highland 2:58 Authorities talk Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash into Highland lake 0:53 Search of Silver Lake in Highland continues Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Fire badly damages home on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon; coroner called The Madison County coroner was called to a house fire Thursday morning in Glen Carbon. klandis@bnd.com An autopsy was scheduled for Friday morning. Six of the children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, escaped the burning home, which is owned by Cristy Campbell, 32, according to property records. Two of the children fled to a nearby Walmart for help. Chilling surveillance footage from a neighbor’s home shows the children tottering down the street in the dark. The seventh child was later found floating inside the gray SUV in Silver Lake. A passerby saw the vehicle drive into the lake and called 911. That’s when paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived at the lake and became a hero. He dived into the 46-degree water, swam more than 50 feet and pulled the baby to safety. Zobrist then performed CPR on the baby while on the hood of the partially-submerged SUV. The baby was then flown to a St. Louis hospital. “Todd Zobrist saved that child’s life today,” the sheriff said. Zobrist was recovering and “trying to stay warm” as of Thursday afternoon, Highland Fire-EMS Chief Brian Wilson said. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:32 Baby pulled from car that went into lake Pause 2:48 Chuck Berry's rock ’n’ roll legacy 3:33 Edwardsville and Glen Carbon collect donations for orphaned kids 0:51 Children fleeing fatal fire, reflection of flames, caught on surveillance video 21:17 Watch entire press conference on Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash, and mom drowning 2:05 Sheriff confirms police had been to Glen Carbon home about 50 times 2:19 Neighborhood helps 7 children who survived fire, mom's drowning 0:12 Body recovered from Silver Lake in Highland 2:58 Authorities talk Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash into Highland lake 0:53 Search of Silver Lake in Highland continues Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Glen Carbon Police provide details on fatal house fire A house fire on Dogwood Land in Glen Carbon IL killed one adult, though six children escaped. klandis@bnd.com “When everyone heard someone jumped in the water, there was no question of who it was,” Wilson added. The child was in good condition as of Thursday evening, Lakin said, and was expected to be released from the hospital Friday. The other children were placed in the care of a relative. After the vehicle went into the lake, conservation police with a sonar-equipped boat searched the water, while police with dogs searched in the woods near Silver Lake. Glen Carbon police had issued a search alert Thursday morning for Cristy Campbell, describing her as a “person of interest” and “possibly endangered. Todd Zobrist saved that child’s life today. Madison County Sheriff John Lakin Hours after Zobrist saved the baby, Cristy Campbell’s body was found in the lake not far from where the vehicle sank. Police had been called to 15 Dogwood Lane about 50 times since 2010 for various reasons, including barking dogs, 911 hangups and other calls for service, the sheriff said. Neighbors said while the Campbell home was a little chaotic with so many children running around and playing, they seemed like a “normal” family. The Country Meadows subdivision where they lived is the kind of neighborhood with street names like “Red Bud Lane” and “Meadow Lane.” It’s tucked away behind a busy shopping area. “They were nice people,” said Sherry Ricker, who has lived across the street from the Campbells’ house since 2004. Ricker said Cristy Campbell lived there with her children and husband, though it could not be independently verified Thursday that Cristy Campbell’s husband or ex-husband lived there. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:33 Edwardsville and Glen Carbon collect donations for orphaned kids Pause 0:51 Children fleeing fatal fire, reflection of flames, caught on surveillance video 2:05 Sheriff confirms police had been to Glen Carbon home about 50 times 21:17 Watch entire press conference on Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash, and mom drowning 2:19 Neighborhood helps 7 children who survived fire, mom's drowning 0:12 Body recovered from Silver Lake in Highland 0:29 Fire badly damages home on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon; coroner called 0:32 Baby pulled from car that went into lake 4:10 Glen Carbon Police provide details on fatal house fire 0:53 Search of Silver Lake in Highland continues Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Press conference on Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash into Highland lake Multiple fire crews were on the scene of a fatal house fire Thursday morning in Glen Carbon IL in Southern Illinois near St. Louis MO.

When he saw the Nissan Armada pulled from Silver Lake, he said he recognized it right away. “I recognized that car,” he said. “I saw it parked out front (of 15 Dogwood Lane) all the time.” Court records show Cristy Campbell and her ex-husband Justin Campbell’s marriage was rocky. They had their first child in 2002, when Cristy Campbell was still a teenager, and they married in 2006. In 2005, Justin Campbell was charged with aggravated domestic violence, a felony, for allegedly slapping his wife, who was pregnant at the time. The charge was reduced to a misdemeanor as part of a plea bargain, and he paid a $500 fine and was placed on probation for a year. The couple filed for divorce in 2010, but changed their minds and ended the proceedings. Cristy Campbell requested an order of protection against Justin Campbell in April 2012, but requested that it be allowed to expire 15 days later. She filed for divorce again in September 2012. Justin Campbell failed to respond to the filing before the court date in 2013, according to court records, and it was finalized without his participation. The divorce included provisions for child support and visitation. “When everyone heard someone jumped in the water, there was no question of who it was.” Highland Fire-EMS Chief Brian Wilson A search of Cristy Campbell’s records turned up mostly parking tickets, though she was charged in 2014 with allowing her 5-year-old child to leave their home unattended. The charges were dropped after she completed parenting classes. Cristy Campbell’s posts on social media depict a happy motherhood. Her Facebook profile picture showed her receiving a kiss from a dolphin. One post showed pictures of a child posing with a “Do the Right Thing” award. Family portraits and pictures of her then-newborn baby dot the mother’s Facebook profile. Whether Cristy Campbell’s ex-husband died Wednesday was unclear as of Thursday evening, but the sheriff pointed out the death toll could have been nine instead of two if it weren’t for the bravery of emergency responders and police. &nbsp; facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:33 Edwardsville and Glen Carbon collect donations for orphaned kids Pause 0:51 Children fleeing fatal fire, reflection of flames, caught on surveillance video 2:05 Sheriff confirms police had been to Glen Carbon home about 50 times 21:17 Watch entire press conference on Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash, and mom drowning 2:19 Neighborhood helps 7 children who survived fire, mom's drowning 2:58 Authorities talk Glen Carbon fatal fire, car crash into Highland lake 0:29 Fire badly damages home on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon; coroner called 0:32 Baby pulled from car that went into lake 4:10 Glen Carbon Police provide details on fatal house fire 0:53 Search of Silver Lake in Highland continues Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Body recovered from Highland, IL, lake A body was recovered from Silver Lake in Highland about six hours after a Glen Carbon mother of seven's SUV went into the lake nearby.

The White House said President Donald Trump intends to nominate the Boeing executive to become deputy defense secretary. (Pierre Verdy/AFP/Getty Images) March 16 AEROSPACE Boeing executive is Pentagon nominee President Trump has nominated a Boeing executive to serve as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ second-in-command, the White House said Thursday in a news release. If confirmed by the Senate, Patrick Shanahan, the senior vice president of supply chain operations for Boeing, will succeed Robert Work, who had agreed to stay on as deputy until his replacement was nominated. Although Shanahan’s recent job at the aeronautics giant was on the commercial side, he also served as vice president and general manger of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and the military rotorcraft division in Philadelphia. Trump has met multiple times with Boeing executives since he was elected, leaning on the company to reduce the cost of the replacement for Air Force One and also as leverage to do the same for Lockheed Martin’s massive F-35 program. — Thomas Gibbons-Neff PETA members gather outside the NYSE to protest as Canada Goose makes its initial public offering in New York.

The markets were anticipating an increase in a key interest rate by the Federal Reserve, which the Fed announced Wednesday. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the rate on 30-year, fixed-rate loans climbed to 4.30 percent from 4.21 percent last week. The benchmark rate stood at 3.73 percent a year ago and averaged 3.65 percent through 2016, the lowest level in records dating to 1971. The rate on 15-year mortgages increased to 3.50 percent from 3.42 percent last week. The average fee for 30- and 15-year mortgages was unchanged this week at half a point. — Associated Press Also in Business ● McDonald’s said Thursday that it has been notified by Twitter that its account was “compromised” after it appeared to send a message calling President Trump “a disgusting excuse of a President.” The tweet to Trump from the official account for McDonald’s Corp. said it would love to have Barack Obama back in the White House. “Also you have tiny hands,” the tweet said. ● Hyundai is recalling nearly 978,000 cars in the United States because the front seat belts could detach in a crash. The recall covers Sonata midsize sedans from the 2011 through 2014 model years, and the Sonata hybrid from 2011 through 2015. Hyundai says in government documents that a fastener for a seat belt anchor may not have been fully latched during assembly. If that happens, the belts can detach. ● A federal judge in Detroit on Thursday refused to set bond for a German Volkswagen executive who was arrested in the company’s U.S. emissions scandal.

About 6,700 pizzas with the product code 20547 sold under Walmart’s Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative for RBR Meat Company said Thursday. RBR recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizzas shipped to distribution centers in Utah, Washington, California and Nevada, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday. ● U.S. builders broke ground on new homes at a faster pace in February, a sign that developers expect solid sales growth this year. The Commerce Department said Thursday that housing starts rose 3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 million. Most of the gains came from construction of single-family houses, which rose 6.5 percent. ● A financial adviser who pleaded guilty to orchestrating a $21 million Ponzi scheme was sentenced to seven years in prison. Patrick Churchville of Rhode Island was sentenced Thursday in U.S. District Court in Providence on charges of wire and tax fraud.

Dr. Ben Carson A Threat to the Left. March 16, 2017 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Politics, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 3 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Dr. Ben Carson, in a speech before employees of Housing and Urban Development, the department he now runs, likened slaves to “immigrants”: “That’s what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder, for less. But they, too, had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.” Dr. Ben Carson got hammered. Late-night comic Trevor Noah said: “It makes them sound like they work at Wal-Mart. … Calling slaves ‘immigrants’ is like saying: ‘It’s not kidnapping. That person just got a free vacation in a basement.’ … Slaves weren’t immigrants. Because an immigrant has choice. They choose the country they’re going to because they hope it will bring them a better life. Saying that slaves are just another group of immigrants erases how black people were uniquely oppressed in America. It helps justify blaming African-Americans for their hardships.” Actor Samuel L. Jackson tweeted: “OK!! Ben Carson … I can’t! Immigrants? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAF–– PLEASE!!! #d–-headedtom.” Actress Whoopi Goldberg said: “Were the slaves really thinking about the American dream? No, because they were thinking, ‘What the hell just happened?!’ You know, when people immigrate, they come with the idea that they’re going someplace for a better life. … It’s voluntary. … How does he miss what slavery is?! How does he miss that no slave came to this country willingly? … Ben, ‘Roots.’ Watch ‘Roots.’” TV personality Star Jones tweeted: “No way in the world he is that friggin ignorant.” Using the pile-of-excrement emoji, she called the renowned neurosurgeon “(expletive) for brains.” She ended the tweet: “#UncleTom thy name is #BenCarson.” Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., insists that Carson’s “slave equals immigrant” perspective means he is unqualified to lead HUD because Carson “doesn’t know how urgent it is to confront racism” in housing: “It’s disturbing to me, and it should be to every American, not just black Americans. … For him, the HUD secretary, to have a stunning misunderstanding of history like that, is really, really striking. … And so for the HUD secretary not to get that means that he doesn’t know how urgent it is to confront racism and discrimination in housing, which is a very scary thing for the HUD secretary to not understand.” Following the uproar, Carson posted this clarification on Facebook: “The slave narrative and immigrant narrative are two entirely different experiences. … The two experiences should never be intertwined, nor forgotten, as we demand the necessary progress towards an America that’s inclusive and provides access to equal opportunity for all.” One slight problem. The “insensitive” and “demeaning” slave-equals-immigrant argument was made on a number of occasions by President Barack Obama: “It wasn’t always easy for new immigrants,” Obama said at a 2015 naturalization ceremony for new citizens. “Certainly it wasn’t easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily, and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves. There was discrimination and hardship and poverty. But, like you, they no doubt found inspiration in all those who had come before them. And they were able to muster faith that, here in America, they might build a better life and give their children something more.” Even “Daily Show” host Noah admitted, “President Obama said something similar in 2015.” But, said Noah, “You could tell before (Obama) said that part he was thinking, ‘Damn, my speechwriter f–-ed up.’” In fact, according to the Federalist, Obama likened slaves to immigrants on 11 different occasions. “Whether our ancestors landed on Ellis Island,” said Obama, “or came here on a slave ship or crossed the Rio Grande, we are all connected to one another. We rise and fall together.” Goldberg, Noah, Jackson and Ellison were obviously occupied the 11 times Obama showed he “doesn’t know how urgent it is to confront racism.” Why the silence over Obama’s many slave-equals-immigrant comments versus the desk pounding by the same critics when Carson says the same thing? Dr. Ben Carson represents an existential threat to the left. He is deadly to their cause – a black man, raised in poverty by a hardworking, welfare-abstaining single mom who taught her children to embrace hard work and education. The left believes that blacks are perpetual victims of slavery, Jim Crow and racism. It is vital for the existence of the Democratic Party to convince blacks to vote like victims in need of protection from the racist, sexist retrogrades known as Republicans. So black conservatives like Dr. Ben Carson, who argues that welfare creates dependency, who demands choice in K-12 education and who believes hard work wins, must be attacked, marginalized and dismissed as “against their own people.” Written By Larry Elder Official website; http://www.larryelder.com Share Post Twitter Facebook Google +1 Email More Articles: Meet: Jackie Ormes, The First African American Cartoonist...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 March 2017 by Military News Points of Light Expresses Deep Concern Over President Trump’s Budget Proposal and the Potential Impact on Volunteering and Service SOURCE: Points of Light DESCRIPTION: ATLANTA, March 16, 2017 /3BL Media/ – Points of Light, the world’s largest organization dedicated to volunteer service, is deeply concerned over President Donald Trump’s budget blueprint and the broad impact the non-defense discretionary program cuts would have on the nonprofit sector’s ability to engage Americans in volunteer service. Specifically, the proposed elimination of the Corporation for National and Community Service would devastate community-based organizations that serve children and families, respond to natural disasters, support military families, and generally serve as the backbone of community efforts to address pressing challenges. CNCS was created by Congress to be a public-private partnership that would decrease dependency on government and empower citizens to tackle tough issues and problem-solve together at the local level. Analyses have shown that for every $10 invested in CNCS by the federal government, another $15 is raised from private sources to fund the agency’s important programs that address community challenges. In 2015, CNCS generated $1.26 billion in outside resources from private businesses, foundations, and other sources, including investments from companies like Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Cisco, CSX and Citigroup that increase the return on taxpayer dollars. And, for every $1 the federal government invests in national service, there is a nearly $4 return on investment. “National Service has a longstanding history of bipartisan support for being a cost-effective way to engage citizens, strengthen communities, create jobs, and bring people together,” said Neil Bush, Points of Light Chairman of the Board of Directors. “Coupled with major support and investments from the private sector, the impact of national service is far-reaching and deep in communities across our America.” Across the country, 80,000 AmeriCorps members and 270,000 Senior Corps members are currently serving local communities. In 2015, through the Points of Light network of local affiliates more than 11,000 national service members contributed to the organization’s effort to mobilize volunteers. The results include more than 17 million hours of volunteer time given, more than 100,000 service projects completed, and more than $400 million in economic value. A 2014 survey from Points of Light’s AmeriCorps Alums, called “Untapped Potential,” found the benefits of the year of service long surpass the time in service. Alums agreed that national service solidified their commitment to community and country, and that through national service, they developed skills to be better students, employees and citizens. AmeriCorps Alums is the only national network that connects the nearly 1 million alumni of all AmeriCorps programs who have served since 1994 to the people, ideas, and resources that support their commitment to a lifetime of service. About Points of Light Points of Light – the world’s largest organization dedicated to volunteer service – mobilizes millions of people to take action that is changing the world. Through affiliates in 250 cities and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and corporations, Points of Light engages 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service each year.

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. "Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes," Lakin said. "Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this." Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. "He definitely saved the child's life," Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some "domestic-related situations," but he declined to elaborate. "The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house," Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

Researcher Troy Hunt published details of the leak Tuesday, explaining that he recently received a large 52.2 GB file from an unnamed source. The file contains the records of 33,698,126 people living in the U.S., he said. Records include individuals’ names, job titles, corporate emails and phone numbers, as well as employers’ addresses. MCDONALD'S TWITTER ACCOUNT HACKED, BLASTS TRUMP The identifier “netprospex contact id” that appears on every record provided a clue to the database’s origin, according to Hunt. Data management specialist NetProspex was acquired by business services giant Dun & Bradstreet in 2015. Employees from a number of large corporations, including AT&T, IBM, Citigroup and Wal-Mart stores are listed in the database, although the Department of Defense is the most heavily represented organization. “Obviously seeing over 100k military personnel piqued our attention,” Hunt wrote on his blog. “There are over 10k unique job titles in there too, titles such as ‘Soldier’ (which was the most common with 2.7k entries), but also titles like ‘Ammunition Specialist’ (91 people) and ‘Chemical Engineer’ (32) along with the sorts of roles you'd expect in the army such as "Intelligence Analyst" (715) and ‘Platoon Sargent’ (670).” The Department of Defense has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from Fox News. HACKERS HIJACK TWITTER ACCOUNTS WITH SWASTIKAS, 'NAZI HOLLAND' MESSAGES It is not clear how and when the data came to be exposed, although the leak does not appear to be the result of a hack. “Based on our analysis, it is our determination that there has been no exposure of sensitive personal information from, and no infiltration of, our system,” explained Dun & Bradstreet, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “The information in question is data typically found on a business card. As general practice, Dun & Bradstreet uses an agile security process and evaluates and evolves security controls to protect the integrity of our data.” Nonetheless, experts warned that the data could potentially be harnessed for a spear phishing attack that could come, for, example, via a personalized spam email. FOR THE LATEST TECH FEATURES FOLLOW FOX NEWS TECH ON FACEBOOK “This database will be a rich source of information for the bad guys to create very compelling, targeted spear phishing attacks and increases the likelihood of recipients opening email attachments, which renders them, and their respective organizations, highly exposed to attack,” said Simon Taylor, vice president of products at email security specialist Glasswall, in an email to Fox News. These sentiments were echoed by Varun Badhwar, CEO of cloud security specialist RedLock. “Even if the data that was leaked is mostly publicly available, having one large data dump makes it easier for attackers to run attack campaigns where they send mass phishing emails to the 33.7 million unique email addresses at the impacted organizations,” he told Fox News, via email. “So while it’s important to quickly investigate this specific breach and find the root cause, it’s even more important for the impacted organizations to ensure that they have tools to be able to monitor their networks for anomalous activity and stay vigilant.” Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers Advertisement TRENDING IN TECH 1 Warning: Dangerous new Gmail phishing attack can easily steal your Google login 2 Man, 32, reportedly dies while charging iPhone in the bath 3 How ambulances could help prevent dirty bombs 4 How to do a free online background check 5 How to block spam on your phone See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

She announced she would not be seeking the death penalty in any of her cases and was soon after removed from the case of accused cop-killer Markeith Loyd by Governor Rick Scott. WKMG Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email ORLANDO, Fla. - Just hours after Florida State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced Thursday that she will not seek the death penalty in any case under her administration, including the case of a man accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend and a police officer, the state’s governor asked her to recuse herself from the Markeith Loyd case, reports CBS affiliate WKMG.  Play Video CBS This Morning Two Florida officers killed in manhunt for murder suspect A manhunt is underway for the suspect accused of gunning down a Florida police sergeant. Police say Markeith Loyd shot and killed Master Sgt. Deb... When Ayala refused, Governor Rick Scott removed her. “I completely disagree with State Attorney Ayala’s decision and comments,” Scott said. “She has made it abundantly clear that she will not fight for justice for Lt. Debra Clayton and our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day.” Ayala is the State Attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. Ayala cited time, resources and cost to taxpayers in her decision to not pursue the death penalty for Loyd or any other accused criminal. Loyd, 41, is accused of shooting and killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24, on Dec. 13 at her home in Pine Hills. Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times outside an Orlando Walmart in January after she received a tip that Loyd was at the store.  “By choosing to seek life sentences over death, we can assure that violent offenders will never be released. They will never continue to drain resources from this state with decades of appeals,” Ayala said. Orlando shooting suspect Markeith Loyd, whose police-released photograph is seen superimposed on the scene of the shooting of an Orlando police officer.  Orlando Police Department/WKMG/CBS News Law enforcement leaders in central Florida were also disheartened by the decision and urged Ayala to reconsider. “I have seen the video of Markeith Loyd executing Lt. Debra Clayton while she lay defenseless on the ground. She was given no chance to live. A cop killer -- who also killed his pregnant girlfriend -- should not be given that chance,” Orlando police Chief John Mina said in a statement posted to Twitter. “The heinous crimes that he committed in our community are the very reason we have the death penalty as an option under the law.” In making her announcement, Ayala referenced a bill passed Tuesday that will require a unanimous jury recommendation before the death penalty can be imposed. “I have determined doing so is not in the best interest of this community or in the best interest of justice,” Ayala said. “By choosing to seek life sentences over death, we can assure that violent offenders will never be released. They will never continue to drain resources from this state with decades of appeals.” Ayala told reporters that she understands that members of the law enforcement community may be upset. She said she reached out to Clayton’s husband on Wednesday, but has not yet spoken to every victim’s family. WKMG reports that Gov. Scott assigned State Attorney Brad King to the Loyd case in an executive order issued Thursday afternoon. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The budget proposal he unveiled Thursday would slash discretionary spending at many agencies, with the exception of defense and border enforcement. While the document doesn’t specify how many jobs would be cut, experts say tens of thousands of government jobs could be eliminated if Congress approves this budget. “It’s ironic since President Trump says he cares about American jobs,” said Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers. She said these jobs are critical to minorities and veterans, who make up a bigger percentage of the federal work force than in the private sector. “[Federal jobs] are a very important means to gaining middle class status for women and minorities, as is has been for generations,” Simon said. The U.S. government has just over 2 million civilian employees, not including the Postal Service, which is an independent agency that is not funded by taxpayers. Walmart, the nation’s largest private sector employer, has 1.5 million U.S. employees. Federal workers earn an average of $81,665, according to the Office of Personnel Management. That’s more than the average pay in manufacturing, which is $67,000, or construction, which is $60,000. But Simon says that federal workers are paid more because of the skills and educational requirements necessary for many of the positions. “There are scientists, and engineers, lawyers and accountants, doctors and nurses,” she said. “There’s a tremendous proportion of the federal work force who are highly educated professionals.” Simon says when those job skills are taken into account, federal workers are paid less than their private sector counterparts, especially after a federal pay freeze that was in effect from 2011 to 2013. But benefits are better for many federal workers, said Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank that advocates sharply reduced federal spending. “Private sector workers do not have such gold plated pensions.” Most federal workers can still count on a traditional pension plan that pays a set amount every month they live in retirement, but those are fairly rare in the private sector. While Trump and other critics of the federal government often complain about a bloated federal work force, the numbers don’t bear that out. In fact, the number of federal workers in 2016 was virtually unchanged from where it stood 40 years ago, despite dramatic growth in the nations’ population force since then. Only about 1.5% of the U.S. workforce is employed by the federal government today, compared to 2.2% in 1988, Ronald Reagan’s last year in office. Trump’s proposed budget wouldn’t just put federal employees out of work — a lot of the spending cuts in spending will affect state and local governments, which may have to slash jobs as a result. “You’ve got millions of people in state and local governments depending on the flow of federal dollars,” said Edwards. “I would say it will eliminate classic bureaucratic positions and functions — paper shufflers at the federal level, the state, and local governments.” Sources: Sean Hannity once pulled a gun on Juan Williams Chicago opens a new door to foreign entrepreneurs Related Posts Merkel: Greece needs to make ‘harsh reforms’ China posts weakest annual economic growth in 26 years Netflix CEO: No big deal if Apple makes TV Trump taps Carl Icahn for regulations busting post Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

By Chris Isidore NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- President Donald Trump is taking aim well-paying jobs with attractive benefits at the nation's largest employer -- the federal government.

The incident occurred last Friday, March 10, when a car was broken into outside the CGI Holistic Fitness & Spa. An iPhone and personal information were taken from the vehicle. Aiello said the suspects then used a credit card to make purchases at a Wal-Mart in Teterboro.   In December, the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office said they were investigating a number of car break-ins at gyms, parks, day-care centers and YMCA locations tied to Felony Lane Gang.   The organized burglary and theft crew broke into unattended cars to steal identification and financial documents, Prosecutor Gurbir Grewal said. The crew then used the information to withdraw money from bank accounts or make purchases on credit cards.  The gang, based out of South Florida, allegedly use rental cars to drive across the country to spots popular with women. One part of the scheme involves the use of a female decoy, often a drug addict or prostitute, to dress up as the victim and cash checks or use credit cards.  Mahwah police arrested a 24-year-old Fort Lauderdale woman who was found with several wigs at a local hotel and associated with the gang.  Aiello said police hadn't tied the crime to Felony Lane Gang due to the absence of the female element of the scheme.  Earlier this month, Police in Madison said they suspected the gang was responsible for two car break-ins outside a Walgreens.   The Bergen County Prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to requests asking about a possible Felony Lane Gang investigation.  Anyone with information is asked to call the Closter Detective Bureau at 201-768-7144.

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. "Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes," Lakin said. "Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this." Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. "He definitely saved the child's life," Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some "domestic-related situations," but he declined to elaborate. "The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house," Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. "Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes," Lakin said. "Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this." Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. "He definitely saved the child's life," Wilson said. After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some "domestic-related situations," but he declined to elaborate. "The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house," Lakin said. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

Elias O'Neal March 16, 2017 0 Several tenants have opened at the Eastgate Town Center development at 4869 Nine Mile Road. (J. Elias O’Neal) The first new tenants have opened their doors at a revamped mall property in eastern Henrico. Arizona-based Bromont Investment Group last month welcomed the initial wave of retailers at its redeveloped Eastgate Town Center, a 300,000-square-foot shopping center being built on the site of the former Fairfield Commons mall at 4869-4919 Nine Mile Road. Bromont’s Josh Rector said Dunkin’ Donuts, Hibbett Sports, Citi Trends and Planet Fitness have opened, while anchor tenant Wal-Mart, which owns its property in the development, is set to open a 182,000-square-foot store this summer. Conn’s, Shoe Show, Metro PCS, DaVinci Pizza and Nu Look Hair are set to open in coming months, Rector said, while leases are pending for Empire Nail and America’s Best Wings. Westward near the city line, Bromont also is mulling ideas to purchase and redevelop the former Azalea Mall property at the intersection of Dumbarton Road and Azalea Avenue. Citi Trends and Planet Fitness are two of the shopping center’s first-to-open tenants. (J. Elias O’Neal) The company put the long-dormant site under contract six months ago, but Rector would not specify when it would close the deal. “We’re pursuing it actively,” Rector said. “But we have no big announcements at the moment.” Atlanta-based Dewberry Capital owns the Azalea Mall site, which covers 39 acres in Henrico County and another 9 acres over the Richmond city line. The company bought the property in 1998 and razed the mall in 1999. John and Doug Dewberry with Dewberry Capital could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon. Since its demolition, the Azalea property has been the topic of several redevelopment proposals, including a plan made in 2014 to transform it into a mixed-use development with 300,000 square feet of retail and 200 apartment units. Martin’s also was eyeing the site for an 84,000-square-foot grocery store, but momentum was halted after the massive merger of the parent companies of Martin’s and Food Lion. Both the Eastgate and Azalae sites sit in Henrico’s enterprise zone, a designation created to fuel job growth and redevelopment by offering investors tax credits and grants, such as seven-year property tax exemption based on the increase in assessed value on rehabbed properties. Rector said his firm is eyeing other redevelopment sites across the region. “The shopping center business is evolving in the Richmond area,” Rector said, without disclosing the sites’ locations. “We have several sites that we have been pursuing, but nothing that we can announce at this time.” POSTED IN » Commercial Real Estate, Featured, News About the author: J.

In the first scam, the callers offer loans with low interest rates, but require a down payment. The second scam informs people that they won a large sum of money by using their credit card at common locations such as Walmart, Target, CVS, etc. The scammers identify themselves as lawyers or government agents and request a payment fee (either for taxes or entry fee) via Green Dot cards or Western Union. The public is reminded to never provide any personal information (to include birthdates / social security numbers / credit card information / and Bank information etc.) to anyone.

A woman said she left her purse unattended in a shopping cart, and when she returned, the purse was missing. She and her husband saw a man placing an item in his jacket while walking away. They followed the man and confirmed he took the purse. The woman’s husband demanded the return of the purse. A struggle ensued, and the woman’s husband tackled the man to the floor. During the struggle, a handgun fell from the thief’s pants. The suspect retrieved his gun, pointed it toward the woman’s husband, left the purse and ran out of the store. He was described as a 5 foot 4 inch black man in his 20s to 30s and was wearing glasses, a black hat, a forest green jacket and dark pants. Surveillance video showed the suspect exiting a white Toyota passenger vehicle and entering Walmart at 8:40 p.m. Anyone with information should call the Sugar Land Police Department at (281) 275-2540 or Fort Bend County Crime Stoppers at (281) 342-TIPS (8477).

Previous locations debuted in Russellville in January and in Conway last July. The company advertises that a price tag within a 10BOX store is indicative of how much was spent to get the item onto the shelf, and the 10% at the register goes toward running the store. The concept is based on stores seen in other states, said Harps President and CEO Kim Eskew. During its first week open in February, the Springdale store sold, for example, boneless skinless chicken breasts for 97 cents a pound and green grapes for 88 cents per pound. An 8-ounce package of Dole Baby Spinach was $2.65, compared to $3.29 that week at Harps. Size 4 Luvs brand diapers were $14.26 for an 88-pack at 10BOX, compared to $20.98 at Harps. An 11.5-ounce bag of Snickers Easter candy was $1 cheaper at 10BOX, at $2.92. The 10BOX prices do not, however, include the 10% added cost at checkout. The store offers a variety of name brands, in addition to generic brands like Best Choice. The idea is low cost, no frills. “To operate with this cost-plus strategy requires us to also have the lowest cost structure possible,” Eskew said. BREAK FROM THE HARPS NAME 10BOX stores are usually based in older buildings — former Price Cutter or Harps locations so far — with basic signage and equipment. Harps also has saved money on 10BOX by not hiring designated grocery bagging staff or offering service departments like bakeries or delis, which have high labor and supply costs. “The stores are not fancy. All of this combined lowers our operating costs which in turn allows us to have lower gross margins,” Eskew said. “Our buyers look for deals and buy in large quantities, and we pass along the savings to our customers.” Eskew said 10BOX has approximately the same number of items on sale as a typical Harps or Price Cutter store, but the assortments are different because “under-performing” flavors or varieties of certain products have been removed and the number of sizes offered has been reduced. Also, there are larger quantities of items, both on the sales floor in dump bins and in the back room. The model is a departure from the Harps brand, which offers a broad range of services and “focuses on freshness and quality,” Eskew said. That’s why the company did not use Harps in the name. “If we called it 10BOX by Harps, people would think it was another Harps store, and it’s really something completely different,” Eskew said. “Our goal in the 10BOX stores is to have the lowest prices possible.” EDLP STRATEGY Dr. Dinesh Gauri, professor and Walmart Chair in marketing at the University of Arkansas’ Sam M. Walton College of Business, said Harps’ entree into using an Every Day Low Pricing (EDLP) strategy could be a result of the company feeling pressure from competitors like Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi. He pointed to a rise in the number of Walmart Neighborhood markets in recent years, in addition to bag-your-own grocery stores like Aldi, where the quality of its private label items was called into question at first but now has wide acceptance. Harps Chairman Roger Collins said sales were down in 2016 “because of the number of Walmarts opened in our trade area.” Sales were $692 million in the fiscal year that ended in August. That’s down from $708 million in 2015 and marks the second consecutive year revenue has fallen, according to the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal’s list of private companies. Harps reached a high in 2014 with revenue of $713 million, after increasing each year since $440 million in 2008. Collins said Harps will turn things around in 2017, with sales projected to increase about 10%. Gauri said 10BOX could be a smart move for Harps. “Any company has to think about how to get people in the doors,” he said, noting the various ways to do that because there are different types of people in the market. For example, Whole Foods Market shoppers are willing to pay a premium for a certain assurance of quality and to know more about an item’s sourcing, he said. Harps is able to reach a certain segment of the population at its Harps grocery stores, where the company employs a high-low pricing strategy where items are discounted after they become less popular. Overall, Gauri said 10BOX is a “good experiment” for Harps. Bryan Aguiar, professor of business at NorthWest Arkansas Community College, said the 10BOX concept is an easy model for the company because of the simplicity of one, flat mark-up, where there are usually a wide range of them within the average grocery store. At the same time, although Aguiar said he has not studied the 10BOX model, his “gut feeling” is that it’s not much of a deal for customers. While overall the prices are lower than Harps, they might not be lower than its other competitors. In fact, Aguiar believes the cost-plus idea is a gimmick. “From a consumer side, I don’t really see any advantages,” he said. Dean Payton, 10BOX district manager, disagrees. He said, “I’ve done the math and the research, and it’s really a good deal.” The 10BOX store growth plan is uncertain. The company would like to continue to expand the concept but wants to see how the stores do, Eskew said. Harps had 85 grocery stores and 4,000 employees as of August 2016.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady JPMorgan Chase purchases CurrentC, looks to develop technology for further use Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 13th, 2017, 05:07 Category: Apple Pay, Finance, iOS, News, retail If you were curious as to what happened to CurrentC, the intended mobile payment service that was intended to compete with Apple Pay a few years ago, there’s an answer: JPMorgan bought it out. Oddly enough, Chase Bank played both sides and was one of a few major banks to partner with Apple when Apple Pay launched back in the fall of 2014, but several retailers including CVS and Walmart blocked or denied plans to accept Apple Pay due to an upcoming CurrentC app and commitments to MCX, the company developing CurrentC. Some CurrentC backers including Rite Aid and Best Buy eventually changed their course and added Apple Pay as a payment option in stores, and last summer efforts to bring CurrentC to market finally ended. Chase currently remains an Apple Pay backer, although its in-house payment service, knows as “Chase Pay”, is based on MCX technology. Although CurrentC is dead, JPMorgan Chase says it has acquired MCX to help bring Chase Pay to more retailers. MCX’s members were already connected to MCX payments technology, which made it seamless to connect to Chase Pay. Chase executives wanted to acquire the technology to use in lieu of building separate parallel technology to serve non-MCX members. At present, only a few retailers currently accept CurrentC, especially given its QR code-based payment option. Best Buy and Starbucks, for example, accept both Apple Pay and were launch partners for Chase Pay, while JPMorgan Chase says Walmart, Shell, or other MCX members will start accepting Chase Pay in the future. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

With Amazon and other e-commerce giants transforming the B2C customer experience, B2B buyers are also demanding rapid, accurate order cycles, agility and competitive pricing. As a result, we’re seeing this major shift in customer expectations put significant pressure on the traditional distribution model. In 2017, distributors are searching for new strategies to drive operational efficiency and optimize processes to stay ahead of the competition in the customer service race. Meanwhile, with the infrastructure already in place, they are also looking towards mega e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart Marketplace to help accelerate their reach into new markets. This more aggressive business approach, however, is putting further stress on their order cycles, meaning technology and automation will take on a new role this year to drive productivity and eliminate the costly errors inherent in legacy systems: No.1 - Goodbye OCR Not all automation solutions are created equal. Technology which relies on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to capture critical data is significantly less accurate than its non-OCR counterpart. Characters like a straight line (i.e. “l”) may be interpreted as the letter I, the letter i, or the number 1. With an average accuracy rate of 95 percent at best for OCR solutions, the chance that your customer receives the wrong part, color, quantity or even pricing for their order, is simply unacceptable if you want to retain customer loyalty. While some distributors may have the staff on hand to verify orders before they’re finalized, smart companies should explore less error-prone sales order automation in the coming year.   No. 2 - Leverage E-commerce No one wants to burden customers with extra effort. But that’s exactly what you will do if you insist they use your e-commerce platform for ordering. With the majority of B2B buyers still preferring email ordering over other methods, distributors must look towards new approaches to drive online transactions and justify e-commerce investment in 2017.  Integrating sales automation with your e-commerce technology allows you to direct email order data through the same channel as online orders. In this way, customers can keep their preferred ordering method and you can package the two technologies together, attributing the benefits of their combined powerful features into one spend. No.3 - Predict the Future In 2017’s tough economic climate, data will be king. From order flow to customer behaviour, clear visibility across your organization and competitive landscape is now key to maintaining customer satisfaction and sustainable business growth. Tracking and analysing order data through your automation solution, you will be able to identify peak order periods for your products to ensure sufficient stock and optimized marketing. You will also be able to pinpoint order flow bottlenecks and error rates as well as customer order placement preferences, ensuring you implement the correct technology or staffing solution to resolve your problem. Ultimately, this year, data will take the guesswork out of your decision-making. No. 4 - Meet Machine Learning It’s the age-old question for the C-suite: how do you do better and more with less? Technology advances such as sales and invoice automation have already delivered substantial benefits for the B2B business, including 95 percent faster processing speeds and an 80 percent reduction in processing costs. But what more can we do? In 2017, there is a new game changer on the horizon — robotic process automation. Using machine learning to map vast quantities of data, cloud-based RPA solutions will be able to take over time-intensive, error-prone tasks such as purchase order reconciliation without the need for significant IT investment or development. They will also be able to cross-reference and analyze long-term historic order data to identify trends and provide prescriptive recommendations for your sales team, including buying trends and patterns, and new products which are gaining traction. All without the need for human intervention or explicitly programmed instructions. With this new technology approaching, we are going to see ground-breaking innovations in efficiency and cost savings for back office, rules-based workflow in the near future. In the end, 2017 will be a customer-centric year. Globalization and fierce market competition is going to continue to drive us all to discover new strategies for increasing our efficiency, delivering greater value at lower cost to our customers. By reducing outlay, accelerating processing speeds and eliminating inaccuracies, technology innovation, data analysis and automation are what we must look towards to drive us forward and ahead of the competition in 2017.

Food & Dining Unleash your inner food critic. Vote daily in the Dining Awards. News Local news Breaking News Suburban doctor suspended for allegedly overprescribing pain pills Robert McCoppinContact ReporterChicago Tribune Illinois regulators have suspended a McHenry doctor whom they've termed "an immediate danger to the public" for allegedly overprescribing pain medications. Following a sting operation in which officers posed as patients, state authorities this week temporarily suspended the medical license of Dr. Raman Popli, asserting that he was "inappropriately prescribing" pain and anti-anxiety medication, including more than 167,000 doses of hydrocodone-based drugs and more than 86,000 doses of Xanax in a two-year period, according to a petition seeking the suspension. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Chicago office, which is leading the investigation, obtained information from a source who claimed to have purchased controlled substances from one of Popli's patients, according to the petition filed by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The patient told the source that the doctor would give the source "anything he/she wants" if the source provided the doctor with a "fake story," the petition states. Last summer, the DEA also received a complaint from a local pharmacist about the doctor's volume of prescriptions, according to the document. The DEA then sent two undercover investigators to see the doctor, and both received prescriptions for controlled substances during initial office visits, despite presenting multiple "red flags," the petition states. One undercover agent, a North Chicago police officer, went to the doctor's office reporting "tenderness" in his shoulder and said he'd been getting Norco, an opioid pain medication that can be highly addictive, for more than a year from a "buddy." The officer was prescribed 30 tablets of Norco, officials said. Then a DEA task force officer, also pretending to be a patient, went to Popli and reported having taken Norco, purchased online, for three months for elbow soreness. The doctor prescribed 20 325-milligram tablets of Norco, the records state. Suburban Chicago arrest photosOpen link A review of the Illinois Prescription Monitoring Program showed that between June 2014 and May 2016, Popli prescribed more than 350,000 doses of controlled substances, the petition states. Besides the tens of thousands doses of both hydrocodone and Xanax, that included 50,000 units of oxycodone-based painkillers and 28,000 doses of the sedative Klonopin, authorities contend. The DEA also identified about 30 patients for whom Popli prescribed a "Holy Trinity" cocktail of drugs that "gives users the effect and euphoria of heroin use," the petition states. Last August, the DEA interviewed multiple pharmacists in the doctor's area and found at least two — one at a CVS in McHenry; the other a Walmart in Johnsburg — who said the doctor prescribed a high amount of controlled substances, according to the petition. The Walmart pharmacists told authorities that the store keeps a corporate list of such doctors, that Popli was notified that he was on it and that he was told that, as a general practitioner, he should refer patients to a pain specialist, the petition states. DEA agents interviewed the doctor last month and reported that he initially denied ever have prescribed hydrocodone on a patient's initial visit, despite having done so for the two undercover agents, authorities said. When asked why he was prescribing a large amount of hydrocodone when he wasn't a pain specialist, the doctor "did not have a response except to continually ask if his prescribing was high for a doctor," the document states. Brian Zachariah, the chief medical coordinator of the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, signed an affidavit that Popli's practice of medicine "presents an immediate danger to the safety of the public." During questioning by federal agents, Popli began to perspire, with sweat dripping from his forehead, the agents reported. Authorities assert that one patient alone received more than 4,000 tablets of morphine sulfate painkillers, more than 3,000 tablets of the muscle-relaxant Soma, 3,000 tablets of oxycodone, more than 2,000 tablets of anti-anxiety drug Xanax, and 180 tablets of Valium over two years, which the doctor told authorities was for a back problem.

(Austin Berg) Popli also denied having ever been notified by a pharmacist about the volume of his prescriptions, officials said. Regulators have asked that Popli's license be suspended, revoked or that he is otherwise disciplined. He is scheduled for a hearing Friday before an administrative law judge. Popli could not be reached for comment. Online, he was rated 5 stars out of 5 by 23 Google users, with glowing reviews describing him as caring and attentive. His web site, poplimd.com, states that he has been serving the McHenry area for more than 14 years, with the motto, "My family taking care of your family." He notes on the site that there would be a charge for any medical consultation or new prescription prescribed over the phone. The site states that he is is board certified in internal medicine. Popli has not been charged with a crime. A DEA spokesman said it would "inappropriate to discuss the current investigation" involving the doctor. According to figures provided by the DEA, 271 people died from prescription opioids in Illinois in 2015, a 7 percent increase from the previous year, according to the DEA. Nationally, federal records show deaths from prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and in 2014, the number of deaths from prescription drugs exceeded the number of deaths from heroin. rmccoppin@chicagotribune.com Twitter @RobertMcCoppin Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune A version of this article appeared in print on March 17, 2017, in the News section of the Chicago Tribune with the headline "State suspends doctor who allegedly overprescribed pills" — Today's paperToday's paper | Subscribe Drugs and Medicines Sports Breaking Trending RedEye Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Advertising 31°

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 16, 2017 10:13 AM PT Credit: AMD More like this AMD packs more horsepower into GPUs with new Radeon ReLive software AMD tries to drum up support for 32-core Zen server chip AMD introduces branded memory modules for desktops Video Mingis on Tech: Videoconferencing arrives, and what's up with 'digital... AMD's Radeon memory business has slowed down, with fewer products available in the U.S. and no new product releases since the introduction of the Polaris GPUs last year. Products are not being sold by key partners like Newegg, Best Buy or TigerDirect, and some products are out of stock or almost out of stock at Amazon.com. Some Radeon DRAM is still being carried on Walmart's website and at specialist tech retailers at discounted prices. When asked if AMD was exiting the DRAM business and why the memory was out of stock at retailers, a company spokesman said some DRAM stock is being moved around. "Those are mostly distributed in Eastern Europe, only small quantities are diverted to North America, but we didn’t exit the business," the AMD spokesman said. The company did not respond to request to questions on whether new Radeon DRAM modules would be released. The DRAM is designed more for older AMD GPU architectures. AMD last introduced new Radeon-branded DDR4 memory modules in 2015 but hasn't released new memory since Polaris GPUs were released last year. The DRAM business isn't critical for AMD, which relies more on its CPUs and GPUs. The Radeon DRAM modules are an ancillary business to support enthusiasts using AMD's Radeon GPUs. AMD also sells Radeon SSDs. GPUs from AMD and Nvidia are packing in more advanced and faster memory like HBM2 and GDDR5X, and there is a declining need for external DRAM to supplement graphics applications, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. AMD wasn't making the memory, but instead attaching the Radeon brand to modules manufactured by other companies. But the DRAM business is a highly volatile business, and it's better for resource-strapped AMD not to play in it, McGregor said. It was more of an opportunity to leverage the Radeon brand, which is one of the longest lasting tech brands alongside GeForce, McGregor said.

Products are not being sold by key partners like Newegg, Best Buy, or TigerDirect, and some products are out of or almost out of stock at Amazon.com. Some Radeon DRAM is still being carried on Walmart's website and at specialist tech retailers at discounted prices. When asked if AMD was exiting the DRAM business and why the memory was out of stock at retailers, a company spokesman said some DRAM stock is being moved around. "Those are mostly distributed in Eastern Europe, only small quantities are diverted to North America, but we didn’t exit the business," the AMD spokesman said. The company did not respond to request to questions on whether new Radeon DRAM modules would be released. The DRAM is designed more for older AMD GPU architectures. AMD last introduced new Radeon-branded DDR4 memory modules in 2015 but hasn't released new memory since Polaris GPUs were released last year. The DRAM business isn't critical for AMD, which relies more on its CPUs and GPUs. The Radeon DRAM modules are an ancillary business to support enthusiasts using AMD's Radeon GPUs. AMD also sells Radeon SSDs. GPUs from AMD and Nvidia are packing in more advanced and faster memory like HBM2 and GDDR5X, and there is a declining need for external DRAM to supplement graphics applications, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. AMD wasn't making the memory, but instead attaching the Radeon brand to modules manufactured by other companies. But the DRAM business is a highly volatile business, and it's better for resource-strapped AMD not to play in it, McGregor said. It was more of an opportunity to leverage the Radeon brand, which is one of the longest lasting tech brands alongside GeForce, McGregor said. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Two simple, silly words —“pink slime” — could cost ABC Broadcasting billions of dollars. That’s because J. Erik Connolly, the lawyer for Beef Products Inc., alleges that comments by ABC’s Diane Sawyer cost his South Dakota based client billions in damages, not to mention “hundreds of lost jobs,” and that the broadcasting network had "engaged in a disinformation campaign against a company that produces safe and nutritious beef.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture has stated that BPI's product is safe, but after ABC’s reports, many retailers including Wal-Mart halted the sale of ground beef products with which it is associated. Related Donald Trump Deposed in Lawsuit Against José Andrés The Science Behind Letting Meat Rest After Cooking Welcome to the Era of Plant-Based Meat Luckily for Sawyer, she can personally breathe easy: Judge Cheryle Gering of the Union County Circuit Court in Elk Point, South Dakota, has dismissed charges against her, claiming that her role as an anchor meant she had less to do with the actual research behind the unflattering commentary. Still, representatives of ABC as well as the reporter behind the reports, Jim Avila, will have to go to court. What makes this case particularly tough on ABC are South Dakota’s “veggie hate crime” laws, a colloquial reference to laws which allow distributors to receive three times the initial damages if they can prove that the safety of their product was incorrectly slandered. That means ABC risks paying up to $6 billion. During a hearing on February 8th, Gering commented, “A jury could determine that there is clear and convincing evidence that ABC Broadcasting and Mr. Avila were reckless, that defendants had obvious reason to doubt the veracity of informants, and that they engaged in purposeful avoidance of the truth.” The jury trial is scheduled for June 5. ABC said in a statement that they’re glad the court decided to dismiss claims against Sawyer, and that they “welcome the opportunity to defend the ABC News reports at trial and are confident that we will ultimately prevail."

By Paul Skeldon March 16, 2017 - 4:35 pm Share: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Google+ Email According to data from market research firm Dynatrace, a majority of consumers – 61% – expect pages within mobile retail apps to download completely in four seconds or less. Anything longer than that, and retailers risk frustrating their users and having them abandon  the app or perhaps uninstall it completely. And yet, most retail apps fall well short of this goal. By including too many requests or making the total file size too large, and by not optimizing their app’s overall performance, most major retail apps take at least two or three times that desired amount of time to download the main page. PacketZoom’s Mobile App Retail Index benchmarks the performance of selected popular retail applications. The Index focuses on the most frequently visited page of each app and ranks them by average download time. The variability in download time is a result of both app infrastructure and design methodology. Brands that are ranked high are likely to use either advanced mobile acceleration technologies or minimal design approach (or both). In addition to the current performance, the Mobile App Retail Index lists the download time of each app using PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane technology. As seen in the charts above, Sephora is the only major retail app we looked at that kept the download time for its main screen under the four second threshold. Walmart came close at 4.1 seconds. Both Sephora and Walmart adopted a design that promotes more requests while keeping the page lightweight (low KB), thereby ensuring faster load times. However, major retailers such as Zappos, Home Depot, Kohl’s and others failed to follow best practices, and their apps’ download times suffered accordingly, with download times of their app’s main screens approaching 30 seconds or longer — an insufferably long time for today’s consumers. Similar to web pages, mobile pages represent essentially a collection of content elements that are fetched from the server and rendered on the user app. From a networking point of view the communication back and forth is very similar between the two platforms, and as such the size of the content download combined with the number of elements that has to be fetched will affect the number of network round trips that will take place to download the entire page. Other than the app design itself, other factors that affect the app performance are the network conditions, which may vary from one geo-location to the other. The CDN utilized by the app publisher also plays a role in app performance, and a recent PacketZoom report reveals that indeed Mobile app publishers have moved away from traditional CDN’s and are adopting newer ones (such as Amazon Cloudfront) that were created with mobile developers in mind. In order to optimize app page download times, we recommend proper testing and monitoring using real devices to take place during the design stage and not after the fact. Too many mobile departments are “driving blind” by not having real time access to user experience data. Real user monitoring for mobile apps is not difficult to employ and is offered by PacketZoom along with our Mobile Expresslane in-app technology.

At a press conference, Ayala said she had studied the issue and decided her office would not seek the death penalty in any cases, saying capital punishment in Florida had led to “chaos, uncertainty, and turmoil.” She argued that evidence showed the death penalty was overly expensive, slow, inhumane and did not increase public safety. Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including murder, firearm and other charges in the December 13 death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon and the January 9 death of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton. He was captured January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. In a statement Wednesday night, Orlando police Chief John Mina said he was “extremely upset” to learn that prosecutors will not seek the death penalty against Loyd. “I have seen the video of Markeith Loyd executing Lt. Debra Clayton while she lay defenseless on the ground,” the police chief said. “She was given no chance to live. A cop killer — who also killed his pregnant girlfriend — should not be given that chance. The heinous crimes that he committed in our community are the very reason we have the death penalty as an option under the law.” Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since her fatal shooting at an Orlando residence. Clayton received word January 9 that Loyd was near a Walmart and tried to confront him. Mina said the suspect “basically opened fire on” Clayton as soon as she told him to stop and continued to shoot even after she was down. Backlash to the decision The decision by Ayala, a Democrat, not to pursue death penalty cases in Florida’s 9th Judicial Circuit sparked a sharply negative reaction from several Republican officials in the state. In a statement, Gov. Rick Scott said he “completely disagree(s)” with the move and called on Ayala to recuse herself from the Loyd case. “She has made it abundantly clear that she will not fight for justice for Lt. Debra Clayton and our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day,” Scott said. Similarly, state Attorney General Pam Bondi, also a Republican, said it “sends a dangerous message” not to seek the death penalty. “It is a blatant neglect of duty and a shameful failure to follow the law as a constitutionally elected officer,” Bondi said. Shawn Dunlap, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Orlando Lodge 25, slammed the decision as an “epic injustice.” “The death penalty is the law of the land in the state of Florida, and I believe that if there ever was a case for its use this would be the one,” Dunlap said. Capital punishment has been in limbo in Florida recently. The US Supreme Court ruled in January 2016 that the state’s death penalty process was unconstitutional, and the state’s high court ruled against a proposed fix to that law late last year. On Tuesday, the governor signed a new death penalty bill, which was crafted to stand up to those legal challenges. ‘I’m a human being’ When asked to enter a plea this month, Loyd responded: “For the record, I want to state that I am Markeith Loyd. Flesh and blood. I’m a human being. I’m not a fictitious person. I’m not a corporation,” he said. Chief Judge Frederick J. Lauten entered a not guilty plea on Loyd’s behalf. Loyd had a series of verbal outbursts when he questioned why the court placed charges against him. “The state of Florida has charged you with these offenses, not the court,” Lauten explained. Loyd repeatedly insisted on representing himself. He was found competent to make that decision, but the judge ordered a public defender be assigned as standby counsel. Court documents indicate Loyd has not been diagnosed with a mental issue, has 10 years’ worth of schooling and has a GED certificate. Charges dropped for Loyd associates In other news related to the Loyd case, charges of accessory after the fact against Zarghee Mayan and Jameis Slaughter were dropped, according to a review of an Orange County court docket. Authorities said Mayan did not contact officials after meeting with Loyd, who allegedly told him he had killed Dixon. Slaughter was accused of collecting money to give to Loyd, a former boyfriend, while police were searching for him, authorities said. The court filing said the case is not suitable for prosecution. Slaughter still faces a misdemeanor charge of giving police false information. She’s accused of lying about her communication with Loyd while he was on the run. Trials set Heavily armed officers arrested Loyd at an Orlando house in January. At the time, Loyd said the full story had not been told about the fatal shooting of his former girlfriend. A pretrial hearing for the Dixon case is set for April 17, Lauten said. Jury selection for that trial will begin on May 1. The case is expected to last about two weeks. On June 19, Loyd will stand trial, accused of killing Clayton. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for June 12. The next status hearing is scheduled for Monday.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com A family tragedy unfolded Thursday in a series of dramas in Glen Carbon and Highland: a deadly house fire, an infant saved from a sinking SUV, a body recovered in a lake. A woman's body was pulled from the lake. The body was later identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon. She was the mother of the infant. A body found in the Glen Carbon house was a man, a source said. The baby boy was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. He was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. "Fortunately there is something good that can come of this," Lakin said of the child's survival. Authorities were notified about 5:15 a.m. that a house on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon was burning. Six children who were in the house when the fire began escaped. Some of those children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart to call 911, said Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White. The caller said there was a possible victim inside, White said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter until they had put the fire out. The body was removed midafternoon Thursday. An autopsy will be done. A surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows an SUV's headlights switching on in the driveway of the house about 4:50 a.m. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. Around 5:30 a.m. about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon house, a 911 caller notified the Madison County Sheriff's Office that a vehicle had driven into Silver Lake, off Route 143. Highland EMS made it to the lake first and paramedic Todd Zobrist rushed into the cold water and searched the vehicle.  Lakin lauded Zobrist as a "hero," saying he swam out 50 to 75 feet into the lake, did a sweep of the car and found the three-month-old baby floating inside the vehicle with about six or eight inches of air space. The baby was lifeless when Zobrist pulled him from the SUV and Zobrist began CPR on the roof of the vehicle, which was partly submerged, Lakin said. The infant was rushed to a St. Louis hospital. At the same time, authorities launched a boat to search for the driver. They issued a plea for the public's help in finding Cristy Lynn Campbell, a "person of interest." +12  Police have released his photo of Cristy L. Campbell, 32, who is a person of interest in the house fire that killed one person in Glen Carbon, Ill., Thursday morning.  Glen Carbon police Cristy Campbell's body was found around 11:15 a.m. about 400 feet from where the vehicle went into the water, Lakin said. It was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. A gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. Cristy Campbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, according to court records. She identifies Justin Campbell on Facebook as being the father of her children. The divorce was granted by default when he failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. Cristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. A neighbor, Sherry Ricker, said she believed that Justin Campbell was living at the house, a split level on a street of well kept ranch and two-story houses. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. She said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. "She was happier than I had seen her in a long time," Ricker said. All seven children, "to include the infant child rescued from the submerged vehicle," are accounted for and safe, the Madison County Sheriff's Office said in a press release. They are with family members, Lakin said. Court records point to a tumultuous relationship between Cristy and Justin Campbell. In 2005, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse. Prosecutors said he caused bodily harm to Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy L. Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was 16 weeks pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to a year of probation and fined $500. The couple, who by this time had three children, was married on Nov. 3, 2006, at the Madison County Court House. Justin Campbell's probation was revoked when he failed to pay on time and appear in court, and he was arrested in October 2007. The case was closed again in December 2007. In 2010, Cristy Campbell sued her husband for divorce, but withdrew the suit. On April 24, 2012, she alleged abuse again. "He has choked me, he has pushed me several times, he has slapped me in my head, he has pushed me into bricks,” she wrote. A judge granted an emergency order of protection on April 25, 2012, and Cristy Campbell sued again for divorce. On May 10, 2012, the couple appeared in court together and Cristy Campbell asked for the protection order to be dismissed; it was. The divorce was finalized on July 27, 2012. She was awarded custody, he was granted visitation rights. In February 2014, Cristy Campbell requested supervised visitation, alleging that one of the children told her his father had pinched and punched him, and another child said he had been choked. The court ordered that Justin Campbell’s visitation take place at a court-approved neutral location. In May 2014, Glen Carbon Police cited Cristy Campbell after she allegedly allowed a 5-year-old child to leave their home on Dogwood Lane and “wander around the streets of Glen Carbon unattended.” She attended parenting classes in exchange for prosecutors dropping the charge. Authorities said at the news conference that they had answered about 50 calls at the house since 2010, including hangup 911 calls, barking dog calls and some domestic calls. The house stood Thursday with melted siding and a charred roof line. A Spiderman bicycle was propped against a wall, near an angel statue. A manager at Bob Evans restaurant in Collinsville, where Justin Campbell was employed and worked on Wednesday, said the staff is distraught. Campbell was "an outstanding guy," he said, who "loved his kids." Silver Lake is about 16 miles east of the Glen Carbon home that burned. Jeremy Kohler, Ashley Jost and Robert Cohen of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this article. Here's our earlier coverage: A deadly house fire early Thursday in Glen Carbon and an SUV carrying only an infant rolling into a lake in Highland are connected, authorities said. The body of a man was found in the Glen Carbon house, and a woman's body was pulled from the lake, a source said Thursday afternoon. The woman was identified as Cristy L. Campbell, 32, of Glen Carbon, according to the Madison County Sheriff's Office. The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital for treatment after being pulled from the SUV in Silver Lake around 6 a.m. The baby was expected to make a full recovery and to be released Friday, Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. The body was pulled from the lake around 1:15 p.m. It was found in a brushy area near the edge of the lake. A gun was found inside the SUV, a source said. An ID found inside a purse in the SUV belonged to a female who lived at the address where the fire occurred in Glen Carbon, the press release said. The man's body found at the house has not yet been identified. Law officers had launched a boat to search the lake and the coroner was called shortly after 11 a.m. Police in Glen Carbon, where one person died in the house fire early Thursday, had asked for help in finding the owner of the home. Cristy Campbell was a "person of interest," police said. By the time of the press conference Thursday afternoon, authorities said they were no longer looking for Cristy Campbell. Six children who were in the home when the fire began all escaped, authorities said. Cristy Campbell has published photos of herself with seven children, including a baby boy, Julian, born in December. The four boys and two girls range in age from 4 to 14. "We believe the infant in the lake at Highland could be the seventh in the family," said Glen Carbon Fire Chief Ralph Well. A paramedic went into the water to search the vehicle and found a baby floating in water with about 6-8 inches of air space inside the SUV. The baby was unresponsive when the paramedic pulled him out and the paramedic began CPR on the hood of the SUV, Lakin said. The baby was taken to a St. Louis hospital, said Fire Department Capt. Brad Menz. Menz said the SUV appeared to have rolled down a hillside into the lake around 6 a.m. near Illinois Route 143. No one else was in the vehicle, and it was not immediately clear how the car wound up in the water. At least 20 police officers were seen at the house next to where the car went into the lake. It was unclear if there was a connection between the home and the SUV. Detectives at the scene did not answer questions. Campbell was divorced in Madison County in 2012 from Justin Campbell, whom she identifies on Facebook as being the father of her children, according to court records. The divorce was granted by default when Justin Campbell failed to appear in court. Cristy Campbell was awarded custody of the children. Months prior to the divorce, Cristy Campbell sought and obtained an order of protection from the father, alleging abuse. The order was dismissed about two weeks later at the request of Cristy Campbell.  In a news conference earlier Thursday, Glen Carbon Police Lt. Wayne White said two of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart and called 911 after the fire broke out about 5:15 a.m. The caller said there was a possible victim inside, Well said, but the house was fully involved and firefighters could not safely enter it until they had put the fire out. Police informed firefighters that it was a crime scene and possibly related to the Highland incident, Well said. The body inside the house was removed about 3:40 p.m. A surveillance video obtained from a neighbor shows the headlights turning on in an SUV parked in Campbell's driveway about 4:50 a.m. Thursday. Several minutes later, the SUV backs out of the driveway and two small children can be seen in the headlights. About 3 minutes later, a reflection from the flames of the burning house can be seen on the side of a nearby house. Four children run across the street, heading in the direction of Wal-Mart. The smallest child is carrying a blanket. About 5:01 a.m., a black sedan pulls into the frame and parks across the street from the house. Two men walk in the direction of the Wal-Mart. A few minutes later, the men return to the car, turn around in the cul de sac and sit there as a fire truck comes down the street. The car leaves when the fire truck passes it. Sherry Ricker lives across the street from the Campbell residence. She said the family was always busy because the kids were involved in a variety of activities, and that the house was filled with trophies. She said she saw Cristy Campbell and held the baby three days ago. "She was happier than I had seen her in a long time," Ricker said.

Please assign a menu Submit a Post News Videos Features Opinion Entertainment Sports Politics Lifestyle Biz Tech Shop Entertainment Writer and Director Castille Landon Creates a ‘Game of Thrones’ for Kids A ‘Game of Thrones’ for Kids created by writer and director Castille Landon. Christina Jeter 3 days ago Share Tweet +1s Reddit Pin Comments Castille Landon is a 25 year old Harvard and Oxford-educated director, writer and actress whose film, “Albion: The Enchanted Stallion”, will soon be released on VOD. “Albion: The Enchanted Stallion” follows a thirteen year old girl, tasked with the responsibility of caring for her disabled father, who is transported by a magical black stallion to the mystical world of Albion, where she discovers that she is the key to saving an entire race of people. The film includes acting icons Debra Messing (“Will and Grace”), Oscar-nominated John Cleese (“Monty Python”) and Jennifer Morrison (“Once Upon A Time”). VOD and Pay Per View release dates are April 2, 2017, and on May 2, 2107 you will be able to purchase the movie at Walmart. What inspired you to create the film ‘Albion: The Enchanted Stallion’?   My initial inspiration was thinking about a “Game of Thrones” for kids. I wanted to do something really cool that would’ve spoken to me — seeing a young girl who relies on her own innate abilities, rather than superheroes, to fight the enforcers of the status quo in order to forge a more balanced society; that’s inspiring to me and I think it has universal appeal. As I started really diving in, I realized that the films that shaped me most were those I watched as a young person: the classics like Princess Bride, Grease, and Dirty Dancing and kids films like Mulan, Hercules, and Black Beauty. I literally watched those films on repeat. You have such an incredible opportunity to impart messages when you’re making family films. Congratulations on your film ‘Apple of My Eye’ being sold to Sony Pictures Worldwide! Tell us what it was like to take that film from start to finish, and then have it sold to a major company like Sony. Thank you! As a young female filmmaker, it’s a dream come true to be able to sell to a company like Sony. It really validates you and gives you an extra confidence boost and lets you breathe. You don’t feel like you’re hustling the entire time. Well, let me clarify— you don’t feel like that AS MUCH when you know your investors, those people who took a risk on your vision, are going to have their money returned. And it feels amazing to know that you’re not just making something in a vacuum. People are going to see this film, and that’s the point of it all, right? The entire experience of making “Apple” was insane because it was written, cast, shot, sold, went through post (editing, sound, color, etc), and was out on shelves at Walmart across the country all in about a year. As a director, what say do you have in the casting process? What is the most challenging thing about casting a film? Because I’m currently doing independent film, I’m able to choose every actor for every role. That being said, the majority of the roles end up being cast through offers, meaning they go to “name” actors, or those who have recognizable credits because the more actors like that you have, the higher the likelihood the film gets distribution and makes money. For the roles where I’m able to cast whoever I want (i.e. it doesn’t have to be a name actor), I’ll usually write the roles for specific actor friends. When I’m looking to fill a role where I don’t already have someone in mind, my preferred process is to have actors go on tape and then I like to meet with my top picks over coffee to talk about the character and script. So it’s not a traditional casting process. To me, someone either “is the role” or they’re not, and I’d rather get to know the actor as a person as I think it says considerably more about them. What do you enjoy more: writing or directing?  Directing is my main passion because it involves an entire community of people coming together for a common goal. I’m a pretty introverted person on a day-to-day basis, but when I’m on set directing, I get this rush of endorphins from being able to connect with my cast and crew. Every day is different and I’m continually surprising myself, doing things and communicating in ways that I don’t get to in everyday life, and collaborating with incredible humans to achieve the greatest results possible. That being said, I do also love writing and over the last year, I’ve been able to really dive in and branch out. I’m currently getting my Master’s in Creative Writing, so it has been forcing me/allowing me to experiment in a variety of genres and media. I just started writing poetry a few months ago and LOVE doing that. I randomly wrote and submitted a poem to an anthology commemorating 100 years of Ella Fitzgerald and it got chosen for the book, so I’m going to be published now. It’s very fun! As a writer, what do you do when you get writer’s block and need some inspiration? I read a ton, about everything. Memoirs about addiction and mental illness are my absolute favorite, and they stir up a lot for me. I also watch a lot of TED Talks, particularly about mental health, neuroscience, behavior and social psychology. And I’ve recently discovered how much focusing on positivity and gratitude helps me get through any of the funks I get myself into, which I think is a common thread amongst creative types (and probably all types, really). You have made more than one film about horses — what is it about horses that you love? Horseback riding runs through my blood. I’m a fourth generation equestrian, and riding horses was something my grandma, mom, and I did together all through my youth. My grandma competed in show jumping at Madison Square Gardens when she was younger (she also raced cars, so she’s an all-around badass). I sat on a horse for the first time when I was a baby, and got my first pony when I was two or three. It taught me to be tough and when you’re competing at a world-level, as I started doing when I was six. You learn the value of respect— for your coaches, animals, your fellow barn-mates, your competition, and the value of winning and losing. It taught me so many life lessons and, for me, there’s no greater feeling in the world than being on the back of an insanely talented five-gaited horse who is on the verge of being out-of-control, but you’ve got a sort of pact with him/her, so you’re this single entity. It’s the best. As a filmmaker, why did you decide to attend Harvard?  It was the only program to which I applied. I honestly was so tunnel-visioned about acting, I didn’t necessarily intend to go to college, but it was a requirement of my mother’s for her to continue helping me on my journey, so I applied. Now, I am so extraordinarily grateful that I did it and actually graduated. I count it as one of my great accomplishments thus far, so any time I’m doubting myself, I’m able to say “you did that, you’re capable of doing this too”. For what it’s worth, I didn’t study film there— my BA is in English. After graduating from Harvard, what inspired you to further your education at Oxford University? Why did you select Oxford? I’m a life-long learner. I have this sort of insatiable curiosity, so I will literally sit and listen to a great lecturer speak on any subject about which they’re passionate, if they’re able to explain it in a way that is dynamic and accessible. And yes, I realize those are big “ifs”. As far as Oxford, it was also the only program to which I applied and I honestly did not think I’d get in. I did a study abroad program there in high school and ever since, it has been one of my dreams to attend such an incredibly gorgeous and historic institution. I applied without much hope with an entrance essay entitled “Life is Short (And So Am I)”— I really didn’t think I’d be able to swindle my way in. If you could pick one actor/director/writer to work with on a film, who would it be? What kind of film would you collaborate on? I’m absolutely in awe of the artistic ability and integrity of the director Julian Schnabel, so I’d love to work with him— though he doesn’t seem like the type who would be into collaboration. As far as actors, since Bette Davis and Lucille Ball aren’t options, I’d most like to work with Christopher Plummer or Jeff Bridges. I’d just love to sit on set with them and hear their stories in between takes. That’s what has been so great about getting to work with legends like John Cleese and Burt Reynolds— they aren’t just actors, they’re storytellers. And I love stories. You enjoy hot power yoga. What else do you do to stay fit and healthy? I’m a bit obsessive about my healthy lifestyle. I do a minimum of two hours of cardio a day and, when I’m home or somewhere that has hot yoga, I go to Corepower and do at least a class, if not two, per day. I also eat a diet consisting of 95% organic fruits and veggies, though I do have a sweet tooth and I’ll try a bite of anything if I’m traveling, to have the experience. Probably the most beneficial thing for me has been intermittent fasting. I came upon it after struggling for years with different diets, and started narrowing the window in which I ate, and come to find out, it’s actually a real thing that has been scientifically researched (and termed intermittent fasting, which I picked up after I started doing it).

This Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2016, file photo shows a Costco store in North Miami Beach, Fla. Alcohol sales have surged at the warehouse-club chain, lifted in part by the cult status of Costco’s Kirkland Signature-branded liquors. (Wilfredo Lee / Associated Press) By Molly Smith Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The holidays didn’t go well for Costco Wholesale, whose profit during the period missed analysts’ projections by the most in at least a decade. But there was something to raise a glass to: booze. Alcohol sales have surged at the warehouse-club chain, lifted in part by the cult status of Costco’s Kirkland Signature-branded liquors. Many customers swear by the private-label products, and some are even convinced that the spirits are actually top-shelf liquors such as Grey Goose and Tanqueray hidden behind Costco packaging. That’s helped set Costco’s beverages apart from other private-label fare, said David Schick, lead retail analyst at Consumer Edge Research. “They use very high-end producers – premium all the way up to super-premium and beyond,” he said. Alcohol brought in $3.8 billion for Costco in its latest fiscal year, with wine sales accounting for almost half of the total. The category has grown 46 percent during the past five years, outpacing the company’s broader food and sundries segment, according to Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti. Kirkland Signature has been key to its success. The retailer began selling wine under the brand in 2003, followed by spirits in 2007. It also has a line of craft beers. Emphasizing private-label products has lowered Costco’s average retail prices, but surging demand has offset that impact on sales, Galanti said. “Private label continues to grow as a dominant strategy in retail – especially when it migrates from being a ‘label’ to more of a ‘brand,’ which Kirkland has done,” said David Bassuk, managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners in New York. “Now it’s a well-known name and gives the consumer a perception of value and a good deal.” The sources of the beverages remain a mystery. Kirkland Signature items are produced by “various manufacturers,” said Annette Alvarez-Peters, who manages Costco’s beverage alcohol division, without naming providers. Schick and other analysts calculate that Costco’s markup on its alcohol is in the range of 10 percent to 14 percent – extremely low by industry standards. In contrast, most retail liquor stores add from 25 percent to as much as 45 percent, especially for premium items, according to Schick. “They’re doing the opposite of looking to cut corners,” he said. “They’re looking for maximum quality and minimum markup to drive value for the member.” It’s a bright spot at a challenging time for Costco. The company posted earnings of $1.17 a share last quarter, far short of analysts’ projections for $1.36. Industrywide food deflation and higher gas prices have brought a double-whammy to the retailer. Gross margin, another closely followed benchmark, missed estimates by the most in more than four years. Even a highly anticipated membership fee increase did little to placate investors, with the shares tumbling after the results were released. Of Costco’s 508 locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, it can sell beer and wine in more than 80 percent of them, according to Alvarez-Peters. Hard alcohol is less common, due to tougher local restrictions. About 60 percent of the stores offer spirits. By comparison, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, sells wine and/or spirits in about two-thirds of its 4,700 stores. While Wal-Mart doesn’t break out those sales in its quarterly results, Piper Jaffray Cos. senior retail analyst Sean Naughton said he’d be surprised if Costco wasn’t the leader. “They’re taking share away from everyone because they can offer the lowest price.” Other retailers and grocers are trying to mimic Costco’s success. In 2003, Target Corp. introduced a private label – Target Wine Cube – to tap into premium boxed wines, and it’s currently exploring private label opportunities in other alcohol categories. Adult beverage was the fastest-growing division at the company last year. Whole Foods Market Inc. launched its Criterion Collection wines in 2015 and now has 10 varieties of reds and whites. To boost the brand, the company brought Devon Broglie on as a global beverage buyer. He is one of 236 experts around the globe with the designation of “master sommelier.” While alcohol laws vary by state, Issaquah, Washington-based Costco has faced some of its toughest liquor legal battles in its own backyard. The retailer was the largest backer of an almost $23 million initiative to privatize Washington state liquor stores in 2011. That ballot measure succeeded, after revisions were made to a previous initiative that failed, and inspired grocers in other states to oppose state-run alcohol sales. “There’s a lot of politics involved for each state,” Naughton said. Even so, “there’s a very consistent demand that doesn’t fluctuate that much as we believe alcohol is a nondiscretionary purchase for many consumers – regardless of economic conditions.” With an average of 250 items across the three alcoholic beverage categories, Costco is selective in what it chooses to stock. It rotates items in and out of the system in what it calls a treasure hunt. “With the limited-item assortment, we constantly evaluate,” Alvarez-Peters said. “Every item must perform in volume.” The treasure hunt – along with the economics of bulk purchasing – are what keeps Costco members happy, Schick said. “When they buy something, they buy a lot,” he said. “This becomes quite powerful in alcohol.” Published: March 16, 2017, 8:30 a.m.  Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Since launching the organization in 2011, Ms. Zellous said she has applied for funding from all kinds of sources, but the only funds Zellous Hope ever received were a few sporadic gifts of $500 from Wal-Mart to underwrite wellness information programs. So the recent $8,000 award from The Pittsburgh Foundation caught her off guard. “I was floored,” she said. “I was having lunch with a friend at Fifth Avenue Place, Downtown, and asked her to read the email because I wasn’t sure it was true.” While the amount is relatively tiny coming from a community foundation with assets totaling around $1 billion, channeling it to Ms. Zellous’ modest nonprofit that has limited resources is exactly what the Pittsburgh Foundation envisioned doing through its new Small and Mighty Grants Program. The foundation Thursday announced the program has provided funding of $235,000 to 18 small nonprofits in the Pittsburgh region that provide basic needs to people at risk for poverty. Small and Mighty is a direct outgrowth of the foundation’s 100 Percent Pittsburgh initiative that highlights why significant pockets of the region’s population are living in or at-risk of falling into poverty. It targets assistance for people in two specific groups: single women raising children and youth ages 12-24. “Our 100 Percent Pittsburgh organizing principle is grounded in the idea that we should turn to affected communities for solutions,” said Michelle McMurray, the foundation’s senior program officer who leads Small and Mighty. “But in reviewing our own grant-making history, we realized we could do much more to fund small community-based nonprofits that don’t just serve a community; they are of the community.” The foundation, one of the largest in the city, handed out $35 million in grants in 2015. Among its biggest awards last year were $875,000 to the Pittsburgh Promise scholarship fund and $735,000 for an endowed chair at the University of Pittsburgh for the Richard S. Caliguiri Endowed Chair in Amyloidosis and Heart Failure. Small and Mighty targets a different type of recipient. To qualify, a nonprofit’s operating budget must be under $600,000 a year. Maxwell King, the foundation's president and chief executive, acknowledged that many small nonprofits in the region don’t even pursue grants because they are “crowded out by larger nonprofits that have more resources and contacts in going for financial support.” Zellous Hope, based out of Ms. Zellous’ home in McKees Rocks, has an annual budget of $21,500 generated mainly from fundraising and federal community development block grants. The nonprofit has no employees. Ms. Zellous, 62, is retired and relies on a team of about 12 volunteers to assist her in providing clothes, household goods and other support to homeless people moving into permanent housing. She plans to use the $8,000 award to expand the number of individuals and families Zellous Hope serves from 19 last year to possibly 100 in the future. In addition to the “hope chests” it assembles that are filled with dishes, cookware, bedding and other items, the organization makes available “hope vouchers” to its low-income clients for one-time expenses such as enrolling children in sports or activities, or making car repairs. “They are emergency vouchers, but for some of our people, an emergency isn’t what other organizations would consider an emergency. Our job is to deter those people from using [illegal] ways of getting that money.” While her organization has focused on helping women, she also hopes to provide more resources for men including clothes for job interviews. Ms. Zellous’ passion for her work is rooted in decades she spent as a drug addict, including 11 years when she was homeless. After entering a rehabilitation and recovery program, she became involved in Dress for Success Pittsburgh, which helps women who need a professional wardrobe as they transition to the workforce. When the national organization of Dress for Success tapped her to create a program that would help those women with other needs, Zellous Hope was born. In 2012, Ms. Zellous received a Jefferson Award of Public Service for her accomplishments as a volunteer. After the Pittsburgh Foundation last August alerted 450 regional nonprofits about the Small and Mighty grants, 43 submitted proposals — including Ms. Zellous. Through the application process, the foundation worked closely with her to answer questions and offer assistance. “They made me feel like my dream could really be a reality,” she said. “They didn’t make me feel any different than any big organizations that were there.” Now that she’s won her first major grant, “I have the confidence to apply for any grant anywhere because of the knowledge I’ve gained,” she said. Others who received grants include the following: • Allegheny Youth Development, $10,000 for after-school programs; • Coraopolis Youth Creations; • $15,000 to help recruit board members and a paid director for its youth enrichment programs; • Orange Arrow, $10,000 to expand its sports-themed leadership curriculum for pre-teen male athletes; • Prevention Point Pittsburgh, $15,000 for relocation and expansion of its legal syringe and counseling programs; • Isaiah Project, $15,000 to expand and formalize the program for high-school youths in Hilltop neighborhoods including Allentown, Knoxville and Arlington; • Western PA Community of Hope, $5,000 for programs that help children, young adults and families make healthy choices; • Western Pennsylvania Diaper Bank, $15,000 for warehouse and delivery expansion and awareness campaigns; • 5A Elite Youth Empowerment, $15,000 for a pilot program from the Peacebuilders Institute for Social Justice; • Acculturation for Justice, Access, Peace Outreach, $15,000 for immigration services for youth refugees; • Casa San Jose, $15,000 for a Saturday program that supports low-income Latino youths; • Open Hand Ministries, $15,000 for programs that help clients become homeowners; • Proud Haven, $13,000 to hire a part-time case manager and train staff and board members on mental health and crisis management; • Rainbow Kitchen Community Services, $15,000 for anti-hunger programs; • Recovery United Pittsburgh, $15,000 to support women in a program for transitional living; • Fight for Lifers West, $9,000 for education and advocacy for juveniles serving life prison sentences; • Steel Smiling, $15,000 for mental health services for low-income residents of Arlington Heights; • Youth Opportunities Development, $15,000 to support Stay Positive Clairton, which aims to reduce detentions and suspensions in the Clairton City School District.

(Photo Credit: Ms. Cherish Gilmore (AMC)) VIEW ORIGINAL HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- The Army's senior logistician urged nearly 200 cadets to be competent, committed and of high character at AUSA's culminating event, March 15. Gen. Gus Perna, Army Materiel Command's commander, closed out the 2017 AUSA Global Force Symposium sharing words of wisdom at the AUSA ROTC luncheon with cadets from more than ten local high schools and two universities. Perna called his journey to ROTC "divine intervention or maybe pure luck." After an unsuccessful semester at one school and realizing he would not play professional football, he ran into a friend enrolled at Valley Forge. "I took the test and I got in," said Perna. "And it changed my life." Today, as a four-star general, Perna leads an organization with a presence or impact in all 50 states and 144 countries and nearly 120,000 Soldiers, civilians and contractors supporting the warfighter around the world. Perna reminded the young cadets of the numerous career paths ahead of them. "You don't have to join the military full time," said Perna. "You could grow up to be a Supreme Court judge; you could grow up to own Walmart or you could grow up to be a four-star general." Justice Sam Alito and Sam Walton are both products of ROTC programs. "Your destiny is in front of you," said Perna. "What ROTC does whether you are a junior or a senior is to provide you opportunity." Perna left the students with three important traits, which he visualizes as a triangle that must be equal at all times to be successful professionally. Those traits were: competence, commitment and character. "At no time can you sacrifice one for the other. You must always be competent; you must always be committed; and you must always be of high character," said Perna. "If you are going to be in our Army or a senior leader in our community, these three things are unyielding to one another." Competence, he said, in the profession is critical. "We are responsible for training Soldiers and sending them to combat," said Perna. In regards to commitment, Perna reminded the audience of how all Soldiers take the oath. "Our responsibility, when we raise our hand and swear our oath to the Constitution of the United States, is about defending what we believe against all enemies foreign and domestic," said Perna. "There is no option there. It is a commitment -- a commitment to your team and commitment to your country." And lastly, he stressed the importance of character. "At all times your character must be beyond reproach," said Perna. "In our profession, the responsibility that we have to our Soldiers and country requires 100 percent character -- all the time." In closing, Perna encouraged the cadets. "You will do well, if you put your mind to it," he said. "You will do well, because the leaders that are here today sitting at your table willing to spend time with you. You will do well, because of the great organizations that will bring us together to teach each other. You will do well, because you want to make your parents proud and you want to take care of your future families. I have a lot of confidence in what our Army will be in 10 to 20 years from now and that's because of you." Perna also individually acknowledged Lt. Col. David Wood, the Professor of Military Science at Jacksonville State University. Wood, who was a captain at the time, served as Perna's battalion S3 or operations officer, when Perna commanded the deployed battalion in 2003. "This leader led my formation into the invasion with the advance party. He planned it and executed it. We lost one vehicle and no Soldiers, and it is a direct reflection of this officer," said Perna. The ROTC program was founded by President Woodrow Wilson 101 years ago. The institution has produced more than 650,000 officers.

Macy's announced last year it would shutter 100 stores and eliminate more than 10,000 jobs. (Benjamin Chasteen/Epoch Times) The last few quarters haven’t been the best for U.S. retailers. Department stores like J.C. Penney, Sears, and Macy’s announced thousands of layoffs and hundreds of store closures. The layoffs and closures will likely rise as traditional retailers continue to struggle with weak sales and profits, and some may even face bankruptcy. “The losers are retailers that are stuck in the middle—the department stores that are trying to be all things to all people and some traditional apparel retailers,” said Steven Barr, a partner and consumer products leader at PwC Consulting. They include some of the most well-known names in American corporate history. J.C. Penney announced last month it would close 130 to 140 stores and offer early retirement to nearly 6,000 employees. Sears also said it would shutter 108 Kmart stores and 42 Sears stores, cutting the total number of stores by 60 percent from its 2011 high. Macy’s is continuing with its planned closure of approximately 100 stores, of which 66 were scheduled to be closed by the end of March. The company said it would eliminate more than 10,000 jobs through these store closures and by restructuring its management. Some other household names are faring even worse. Electronics chains RadioShack and Hhgregg, women’s apparel chain BCBG Max Azria, and outdoor retailer Gander Mountain recently filed for bankruptcy. But while some traditional companies are struggling, others are ahead of the curve. “What is happening right now is an absolute separation between winners and losers,” said Barr. The retailers that are offering an extraordinary digital and omnichannel experience are still thriving. Omnichannel retailers have effectively integrated their in-store and online channels and are now gaining market share. Traditional brick and mortar company Wal-Mart is one of them. The retail giant acquired shopping website Jet.com last year and became the second-largest online retailer by traffic after Amazon, according to a PwC research. Traditional retailers are losing foot traffic and sales to online stores as consumers increasingly shift to online shopping. The e-commerce giant Amazon is the biggest winner, even though total digital commerce makes up only around 10 percent of total retail sales, said Barr. So it is not all Amazon’s fault. In addition to digital and omnichannel winners, retailers with lower price points and fast-fashion chains are also doing exceptionally well, according to Barr. The off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and Ross Stores and fast-fashion brands like Zara and H&M are increasingly attracting middle-class shoppers and are gaining market share.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) Retailers that haven’t mastered the digital transition yet have often committed strategic blunders that left them with a heavy debt load. “The retailers that I define as ‘stuck in the middle’ have been acquired over the years, or taken private through private equity transactions, or in an effort to survive, have merged with another retailer. And they funded these acquisitions or business combinations through debt,” Barr said. According to a recent report by Moody’s Investors Service, this debt is now putting many companies at the risk of bankruptcy. The number of retailers with a very high credit risk (Caa rating) or near default territory (Ca rating) has tripled over the past six years, according to the report. “Today, 13.5 percent of our portfolio is comprised of distressed names—the largest showing since the Great Recession,” said Moody’s Vice President Charlie O’Shea, in a press release. The retail stores listed in the report include Sears, Nine West, True Religion Apparel, Claire’s Stores, Fairway Group, and Payless. If credit conditions tighten, companies with weak liquidity would be the most vulnerable, according to Moody’s. To make matters worse, these distressed retailers pose challenges to retailers that have healthy balance sheets because they may use irrational pricing to boost sales. “Highly promotional, sometimes irrational, pricing activity can force the stronger retailer into a race to the bottom or to forfeit sales to preserve margin,” O’Shea said. Underinvestment Problem Distressed retailers cannot generate enough cash flow to pay down their debt, as they have to invest in technology, distribution, and their in-store experience to stay in the game. “Currently many retailers are not making money in their digital offerings. While they are achieving high growth rates, they still have not achieved optimal profitability rates because of the significant investment that is required,” Barr said. Most stores did not invest enough over the last decade and now lack the financial resources to make those big investments. A potential reduction in federal corporate taxes planned by President Donald Trump’s administration is positive news for the retail sector. However, the potential implementation of a border adjustment tax, which could make imports more expensive, will be a major blow to the troubled sector, as most retailers are importers. “I think we are going to see more bankruptcies, more store closures, and higher volumes of mergers and acquisitions in the retail sector,” Barr said.

In an email Wednesday afternoon, the chamber said Bernard’s resignation was effective immediately. “While we cannot comment on this personnel matter, we want to assure our members and the public that this chamber has already begun taking steps towards filling the position,” the chamber said. The chamber did not say why it could not comment on the matter. Bernard, a Fayetteville native, came to the chamber from an executive role with Walmart. He had also been a regional general manager for Walmart and formerly worked with the U.S. Departments of Labor and Housing and Urban Development. Bernard attended the Air Force Academy and later received his bachelor’s degree from N.C. Central University in Durham, where he played football. He met his wife, Kenly native Thess Bernard, while attending NCCU, and while he was earning his law degree from Florida Coastal in Jacksonville, she earned her doctorate from Iowa State.

The NBCUniversal-owned company next month will launch another extension to its core online movie-ticketing business with Fandango FanShop, an ecommerce site that will sell a selection of T-shirts, hats and other apparel, prop replicas and collectibles, and even access to special events tied to theatrical releases. FanShop’s initial menu will include merch from a handful of upcoming theatrical releases, including Disney-Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”; Warner Bros.’ “Wonder Woman”; and Universal-Illumination’s “Despicable Me 3.” In some cases, Fandango will be the exclusive licensee for products that will be available only through FanShop, according to president Paul Yanover. The ecommerce portal is rolling out as a standalone site, FandangoFanShop.com, but the point isn’t to compete with sector giants like Amazon.com and Walmart, Yanover said. “This is tactical — we want to surprise and delight people,” he said. “The mission here is, How do we create a programmed fan experience through merchandise? We are going to curate the best products, working with studios and filmmakers, and present those in conjunction with movie titles.” FanShop may or may not turn into a significant new revenue stream. Regardless, for Fandango the move into merchandise sales gives it a toehold in yet another aspect of a movie’s lifecycle. The company is best known for its movie-ticketing service, which covers 28,000 screens nationwide. To complement that, Fandango has steadily built out properties covering both sides of a film’s theatrical run. Last year it bought Rotten Tomatoes and Flixster from Warner Bros., after acquiring the Movieclips YouTube channel in 2014. To grab post-theatrical consumer dollars, it bought transactional video-on-demand service M-Go in early 2016, and rebranded it as FandangoNow.   FanShop could at some point include DVDs or Blu-ray discs, but the core products will be apparel like T-shirts and hats and collectibles. Yanover also called out Fandango’s plans to offer exclusive events, like attending a movie premiere, a celebrity meet-and-greet, or a set visit. The company is still figuring out how such “scarce events” will be offered; for example, shoppers may be entered into a sweepstakes with a product purchase. In the next few months, FanShop will also feature dedicated hubs for popular movie franchises. Fandango plans to promote FanShop across the company’s network of sites. Eventually users will be able to purchase movie tickets and merchandise in the same transaction on Fandango, as well as buy merchandise with Digital HD movies on FandangoNow. The company also plans to offer bundles that include movie tickets and merchandise as special promotions. In addition to bulking up U.S. operations, the company has also expanded into Latin America. In December 2015, Fandango acquired Brazil’s biggest online ticketer, Ingresso.com, and last December acquired Peru-based Cinepapaya (which it has rebranded with the Fandango name).

By Jake Bleiberg, BDN Staff Follow on Twitter Posted March 16, 2017, at 8:44 a.m. Last modified March 16, 2017, at 12:28 p.m. In 2015, Maine law enforcement arrested minors 3,547 times. While many of these arrests never led to a courtroom appearance, they all generated an arrest tracking number, marking the creation of a juvenile criminal record. In Maine, these paper trails can continue to affect people for the rest of their lives — even when they believe the documents are blocked from public view. Unlike many other states and contrary to popular belief, Maine does not automatically seal the juvenile criminal records of young people when they turn 18. Leaving these documents open by default means that youthful lapses in judgment can follow a young Mainer into their adult lives and fetter efforts to find work, get an education or secure housing, according to a new report from the University of Southern Maine’s Muskie School of Public Service. Pervasive confusion about the process, even among those who administer it, means juvenile records are infrequently sealed in Maine, the report found. And the messy records system can make it hard for people to move past crimes committed when they were young, according to the authors, USM researchers Susan Hawes and Erica King. “There are clear collateral consequences and continued punishment that comes just because of their juvenile record,” Hawes said in an interview. While most juvenile misdemeanors are confidential in Maine, records of felony-level offenses are public and remain so unless the person persuades a judge to seal them. Criminal justice reform advocates on the left and right have in recent years contended that treating a criminal history as a black mark undercuts the rehabilitative goal of the corrections system. With national campaigns such as “ban the box,” they’ve pushed companies to stop asking job applicants about their criminal histories. And while massive businesses including Koch Industries, Wal-Mart, Target and Home Depot have signed on, many employers, banks and landlords still look at these records. Maine is one of 24 states where juvenile felony records are never automatically sealed, but the Muskie report found that many Mainers — including some who work in criminal justice — believe the opposite to be true. This confusion is driven by a set of messy juvenile records statutes and the inconsistent way that “sealed” is used in Maine’s criminal justice system, said Christine Thibeault, who has headed the Cumberland County District Attorney’s juvenile unit since 1996. In Maine, juvenile records can only be sealed by a judge after a person goes through the sometimes long and costly process of petitioning the court. Although they remain available to the courts and law enforcement, once sealed the records won’t show up on a standard criminal background check and legally don’t need to be disclosed even if a person is asked by a potential employer or landlord. “Essentially, it’s a license to lie,” Thibeault, who was involved in researching the Muskie report, said. Under Maine law, “sealed” and “confidential” records are not the same thing — the second designation being open to some people and institutions — but court clerks frequently conflate the two, according to the report, which is based on focus groups, surveys and interviews with more than 200 people, including past and present juvenile prisoners, their families, defense lawyers and various state employees. The report recounts the experience of a man referred to as Ryan, who spent five years unable to get stable work after his juvenile record was supposedly sealed. Recently, after losing a job fixing computers for the state, Ryan called a court clerk who told him his record was sealed. But when Ryan, whose real name was withheld, insisted it wasn’t, the clerk took another look and eventually realized the court never actually sealed the documents. “We didn’t realize we had to go submit to have it sealed,” the clerk is reported to have said. Thibeault brought up that same incident but declined to say which court it happened in because she didn’t want to single out someone for a problem common in Maine’s justice system. Ten of the 17 court clerks surveyed for the Muskie report incorrectly said that all juvenile records in Maine are automatically sealed. “I believe there are people who are missing out on opportunities because of this, but it’s difficult to measure,” Thibeault said. One place where a juvenile record might affect a young person’s prospects is in the military. “Seventy percent of 17- to 24-year-olds are ineligible for military service,” according to Brig. Gen. Douglas Farnham, adjutant general for the Maine National Guard and commissioner of the Maine Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management. This is partially because of police records, Farnham said. Criminal background checks are also used by landlords, banks and employers. In Maine they often return inconsistent results and sometimes include things such as arrest records that they seemingly shouldn’t, Hawes said. The example of a young person with a criminal record looking to join the military highlights how balancing the public’s right to know with a juvenile’s right to privacy becomes difficult, Thibeault said. Automatic sealing of youth records may create difficulties for a military recruiter rightly concerned with whether someone has a violent criminal history, she said. The prosecutor also said, however, that Maine has missed the “sweet spot” in balancing public safety and privacy. She stressed the need to educate lawyers, judges and people in the corrections system on how the records actually work. King likewise said there is a clear lesson for parents in the confusion over how private Maine’s juvenile records are: A brush with the law may mark their child indelibly. A panel discussion about the Muskie report is scheduled for 4:45 p.m. Thursday at the University of Maine School of Law at 246 Deering Ave. in Portland.

CDT March 16, 2017 70-year-old Michael Chambers (Photo: Hunt County Sheriff's Office) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HUNT COUNTY, Texas. -- A Quinlan family is desperate for any tips that could lead them to finding 70-year-old Michael Chambers, missing since Friday, March 10th.  "My kids want their 'PaPaw' back," said his daughter Suzy Losoya. "The kids, the grandkids, the great grand kids. They don’t know what to think." Neither she or her sister Cheri Hanes do either. "The dogs and the helicopters…that makes the situation seem a little too real," said Hanes.  The Hunt County Sheriff's Department says Chambers spoke to his wife around 8 a.m. Friday morning. He was last seen shopping that afternoon at Walmart in Quinlan, and he vanished sometime later. It doesn't add up for a man who was a creature of habit and order.  "I’m just trying to sort out the details of what we know and come up with any narrative that it could fit," said Hanes. Chambers is an active. He is healthy, of sound mind and has no known enemies. "No!" said Losoya. "He has a million friends!" Dozens of them showed up Wednesday to comb through Hunt County brush to find him. "We had a lot of briars to go through, and ravines, it’s thick," said Vince Aloi, who joined the search. "It was hard to stay in a straight line." Aloi worked 36 years with Dallas Fire. That's the same number as Chambers. Still, they never met. That doesn’t matter. "We just worked on the other ends of the town from each other, but he’s part of the fire department family, and that’s why I’m out here," said Aloi. Investigators don’t have much to work with. Drops of blood were found in Chamber’s shed, that's on the property at his Quinlan home. But what they lack in evidence, they have in manpower, with an army of fellow public servants ready to keep searching. "It makes us optimistic," said Losoya. "At the same time, it’s incredibly disturbing to see a search for your father." Friends have started a GoFundMe to raise money to offer as a reward for information. Anyone with information is asked to call the Hunt County Sheriff at 903-453-6838.

Dollar General Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2016 Financial Results; Company Provides Financial Guidance for Fiscal 2017 March 16, 2017 06:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter (14 weeks) and fiscal year (53 weeks) ended February 3, 2017. Note: Dollar General’s fiscal 2016 and 2016 fourth quarter results contain an additional, non-comparable week, or the "53rd" week, when compared to fiscal 2015 and 2015 fourth quarter results, which included 13 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively, and fiscal 2017 guidance which includes 52 weeks. By definition, the Company's same-store sales growth calculations do not include the non-comparable 53rd week in the 2016 periods. Unless stated otherwise, financial metrics discussed in this release such as operating income, net income and earnings per share (“EPS”) are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and therefore include the 53rd week. Key Fiscal 2016 Highlights Fourth Quarter Net Sales Increased 13.7%; Fourth Quarter Same-Store Sales Increased 1.0% Fourth Quarter Diluted EPS Increased 15% to $1.49 Fiscal Year Net Sales Increased 7.9% to $22.0 Billion; Fiscal Year Same-Store Sales Increased 0.9% Fiscal Year Diluted EPS Increased 12% to $4.43 Cash From Operations for the Fiscal Year Increased 15% to $1.6 Billion Company Provides Fiscal 2017 Diluted EPS Outlook of $4.25 to $4.50, Including Approximately $70 Million in Planned Investments Primarily for Store Manager Pay Board of Directors Declares Increased Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 per share “We are pleased with our fourth quarter 2016 financial results, and believe that during the quarter many of our initiatives continued to gain traction. For the year, we effectively managed through what proved to be a challenging retail environment to deliver same-store sales growth of 0.9% and diluted earnings per share growth of 12%, while returning nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s chief executive officer. “Dollar General is well-positioned to serve our customers with value and convenience given our plans to open approximately 1,000 new stores in 2017. To strengthen our position for the long term, we are making significant investments, primarily in compensation and training for our store managers given the critical role this position plays in our customer experience, as well as strategic initiatives. While these investments are expected to put pressure on our 2017 earnings, we believe they will strengthen our market share position over time and are positive steps to further support sustainable growth for our shareholders over the long term.” Fourth Quarter 2016 Highlights The Company’s net income and diluted EPS for the 2016 fourth quarter were $414 million and $1.49, respectively, compared to net income and diluted EPS of $376 million and $1.30, respectively, in the 2015 fourth quarter. Net sales increased 13.7 percent to $6.0 billion in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $5.3 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter. Net sales for the 53rd week of 2016 were $398.7 million. Same-store sales increased 1.0 percent from the 2015 fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in average transaction amount, partially offset by a slight decline in traffic that moderated from the second and third quarters. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables and home products categories, partially offset by negative results in the seasonal and apparel categories. The net sales increase was positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores. The Company’s gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 31.6 percent in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to 31.8 percent in the 2015 fourth quarter, a decrease of 19 basis points. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, driven mainly by promotional activities and inventory clearance, and a greater proportion of sales of consumables. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $1.22 billion in the 2016 fourth quarter, compared to $1.07 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 6 basis points as a percentage of sales. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor costs which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these costs were a reduction in incentive compensation expenses and administrative payroll costs which were essentially unchanged. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a reduction in SG&A of $4.5 million due to the sale or assignment of leases for 12 store locations that previously were closed in connection with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations. The effective income tax rate in the 2016 fourth quarter was 36.8 percent compared to 36.1 percent in the 2015 fourth quarter. The effective income tax rate for the 2016 fourth quarter was higher than the 2015 quarter due primarily to the one-time benefit recorded in the 2015 fourth quarter related to the retroactive extension of federal jobs tax credit programs to the 2015 tax year (principally the Work Opportunity Tax Credit). For the first time in several years, these tax credits were not retroactively renewed in the Company’s fourth quarter but instead were available throughout fiscal 2016 and thus already reflected in the Company’s income tax rate for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. Full Year 2016 Financial Results Full year 2016 net sales increased 7.9 percent to $22.0 billion compared to net sales of $20.4 billion in 2015. Same-store sales increased 0.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in average transaction amount accompanied by traffic that was essentially unchanged as compared to the prior year. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables and home products categories partially offset by negative results in the apparel and seasonal categories. The Company’s gross profit rate was 30.8 percent of sales in 2016 compared to 31.0 percent in 2015, a decrease of 11 basis points. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, driven mainly by promotional activities and inventory clearance, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups and lower transportation costs. Full year SG&A was 21.5 percent of sales in 2016 compared to 21.4 percent in 2015, an increase of 3 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to retail labor costs which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales, partially offset by reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs. The 2016 results also reflect an increase in disaster-related expenses of $12.2 million over 2015, much of which was hurricane-related. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 36.3 percent compared to a rate of 37.1 percent for 2015. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2016 due to the adoption of an amended accounting standard related to employee share-based payments requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement rather than in the balance sheet, as reported in prior years. The Company reported net income of $1.25 billion, or diluted EPS of $4.43, for fiscal year 2016 compared to net income of $1.17 billion, or diluted EPS of $3.95, for fiscal year 2015, an increase in diluted EPS of 12.2 percent. The increase in diluted EPS includes an estimated impact of the 53rd week of approximately two percentage points. Merchandise Inventories As of February 3, 2017, total merchandise inventories, at cost, were $3.26 billion compared to $3.07 billion as of January 29, 2016, a decrease of approximately 0.7 percent on a per store basis. Capital Expenditures Total additions to property and equipment during fiscal 2016 were $560 million, including approximately: $201 million for distribution and transportation related projects; $168 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $120 million for new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements; $38 million for stores purchased or built by the Company; and $26 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 2016, the Company opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 906 stores. Share Repurchases The Company repurchased $990 million, or 12.4 million shares, under its share repurchase program in 2016, at an average price of $80.17 per share. Since December 2011 through the end of fiscal 2016, the Company has repurchased 74.4 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $4.6 billion, at an average price of $61.41 per share. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases was approximately $930 million at the end of the 2016 fiscal year. The authorization has no expiration date. Dividend On March 15, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an increase of four percent in its quarterly cash dividend to shareholders. The first quarter dividend of $0.26 per share will be payable on April 25, 2017 to shareholders of record of the Company’s common stock on April 11, 2017. While the Board of Directors intends to continue regular cash dividends, the declaration and amount of future dividends are subject to the Board’s discretion. Fiscal 2017 Guidance For the 52-week fiscal year ending February 2, 2018 (“fiscal 2017”), the Company expects its fiscal 2017 net sales to increase four to six percent with same-store sales growth to be slightly positive to up two percent and diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50. The Company's fiscal 2017 net sales guidance includes an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping the 2016 53rd week. The Company’s fiscal 2017 diluted EPS guidance includes an anticipated negative impact totaling approximately $0.34 per share, lowering the fiscal 2017 EPS growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points as follows: approximately $0.16 per share relating to anticipated store manager compensation and training and other strategic investments, approximately $0.09 per share due to lapping of the 53rd week in 2016, and approximately $0.09 per share for the combined impact from the early adoption of income tax changes for stock-based compensation in 2016, lower estimated share repurchases in 2017 and an anticipated charge related to the retirement of debt. Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $450 million. The Company plans to open approximately 1,000 new stores and relocate or remodel 900 stores in fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be in the range of $650 to $700 million. The information in this “Fiscal 2017 Guidance” section of this press release constitutes the only guidance issued by the Company with respect to its fiscal 2017 performance, operating results or financial condition. The Company undertakes no obligation, and specifically disclaims any duty, to update any of the information set forth in this section except as may be required by law. Long-Term Growth Model The Company’s fiscal 2017 financial guidance contemplates results that do not fall within the ranges contained in its long-term growth model that was announced on March 10, 2016. The Company expects to continue to use the long-term growth model internally to assess and benchmark its results and strategic plans; however, the Company does not intend to discuss fiscal 2017 guidance or results in the context of the long-term growth model. Over the longer term, the Company’s goal is to grow diluted EPS at a 10 percent or higher rate on an adjusted basis. GAAP EPS may include the impact of certain discrete items, which may be excluded in calculating adjusted EPS. In the past these discrete items have included restructuring costs, legal settlements and certain other items that are discretely managed. The Company is not currently aware of any such discrete items. Conference Call Information The Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. CT/10:00 a.m. ET, hosted by Todd Vasos, chief executive officer, and John Garratt, chief financial officer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 March 2017 by Military News Dollar General Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2016 Financial Results; Company Provides Financial Guidance for Fiscal 2017 GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter (14 weeks) and fiscal year (53 weeks) ended February 3, 2017. Note: Dollar General’s fiscal 2016 and 2016 fourth quarter results contain an additional, non-comparable week, or the „53rd” week, when compared to fiscal 2015 and 2015 fourth quarter results, which included 13 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively, and fiscal 2017 guidance which includes 52 weeks. By definition, the Company’s same-store sales growth calculations do not include the non-comparable 53rdweek in the 2016 periods. Unless stated otherwise, financial metrics discussed in this release such as operating income, net income and earnings per share (“EPS”) are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and therefore include the 53rdweek. Key Fiscal 2016 Highlights Fourth Quarter Net Sales Increased 13.7%; Fourth Quarter Same-Store Sales Increased 1.0% Fourth Quarter Diluted EPS Increased 15% to $1.49 Fiscal Year Net Sales Increased 7.9% to $22.0 Billion; Fiscal Year Same-Store Sales Increased 0.9% Fiscal Year Diluted EPS Increased 12% to $4.43 Cash From Operations for the Fiscal Year Increased 15% to $1.6 Billion Company Provides Fiscal 2017 Diluted EPS Outlook of $4.25 to $4.50, Including Approximately $70 Million in Planned Investments Primarily for Store Manager Pay Board of Directors Declares Increased Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 per share “We are pleased with our fourth quarter 2016 financial results, and believe that during the quarter many of our initiatives continued to gain traction. For the year, we effectively managed through what proved to be a challenging retail environment to deliver same-store sales growth of 0.9% and diluted earnings per share growth of 12%, while returning nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s chief executive officer. “Dollar General is well-positioned to serve our customers with value and convenience given our plans to open approximately 1,000 new stores in 2017. To strengthen our position for the long term, we are making significant investments, primarily in compensation and training for our store managers given the critical role this position plays in our customer experience, as well as strategic initiatives. While these investments are expected to put pressure on our 2017 earnings, we believe they will strengthen our market share position over time and are positive steps to further support sustainable growth for our shareholders over the long term.” Fourth Quarter 2016 Highlights The Company’s net income and diluted EPS for the 2016 fourth quarter were $414 million and $1.49, respectively, compared to net income and diluted EPS of $376 million and $1.30, respectively, in the 2015 fourth quarter. Net sales increased 13.7 percent to $6.0 billion in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $5.3 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter. Net sales for the 53rd week of 2016 were $398.7 million. Same-store sales increased 1.0 percent from the 2015 fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in average transaction amount, partially offset by a slight decline in traffic that moderated from the second and third quarters. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables and home products categories, partially offset by negative results in the seasonal and apparel categories. The net sales increase was positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores. The Company’s gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 31.6 percent in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to 31.8 percent in the 2015 fourth quarter, a decrease of 19 basis points. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, driven mainly by promotional activities and inventory clearance, and a greater proportion of sales of consumables. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $1.22 billion in the 2016 fourth quarter, compared to $1.07 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 6 basis points as a percentage of sales. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor costs which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these costs were a reduction in incentive compensation expenses and administrative payroll costs which were essentially unchanged. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a reduction in SG&A of $4.5 million due to the sale or assignment of leases for 12 store locations that previously were closed in connection with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations. The effective income tax rate in the 2016 fourth quarter was 36.8 percent compared to 36.1 percent in the 2015 fourth quarter. The effective income tax rate for the 2016 fourth quarter was higher than the 2015 quarter due primarily to the one-time benefit recorded in the 2015 fourth quarter related to the retroactive extension of federal jobs tax credit programs to the 2015 tax year (principally the Work Opportunity Tax Credit). For the first time in several years, these tax credits were not retroactively renewed in the Company’s fourth quarter but instead were available throughout fiscal 2016 and thus already reflected in the Company’s income tax rate for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. Full Year 2016 Financial Results Full year 2016 net sales increased 7.9 percent to $22.0 billion compared to net sales of $20.4 billion in 2015. Same-store sales increased 0.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in average transaction amount accompanied by traffic that was essentially unchanged as compared to the prior year. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables and home products categories partially offset by negative results in the apparel and seasonal categories. The Company’s gross profit rate was 30.8 percent of sales in 2016 compared to 31.0 percent in 2015, a decrease of 11 basis points. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, driven mainly by promotional activities and inventory clearance, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups and lower transportation costs. Full year SG&A was 21.5 percent of sales in 2016 compared to 21.4 percent in 2015, an increase of 3 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to retail labor costs which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales, partially offset by reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs. The 2016 results also reflect an increase in disaster-related expenses of $12.2 million over 2015, much of which was hurricane-related. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 36.3 percent compared to a rate of 37.1 percent for 2015. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2016 due to the adoption of an amended accounting standard related to employee share-based payments requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement rather than in the balance sheet, as reported in prior years. The Company reported net income of $1.25 billion, or diluted EPS of $4.43, for fiscal year 2016 compared to net income of $1.17 billion, or diluted EPS of $3.95, for fiscal year 2015, an increase in diluted EPS of 12.2 percent. The increase in diluted EPS includes an estimated impact of the 53rd week of approximately two percentage points. Merchandise Inventories As of February 3, 2017, total merchandise inventories, at cost, were $3.26 billion compared to $3.07 billion as of January 29, 2016, a decrease of approximately 0.7 percent on a per store basis. Capital Expenditures Total additions to property and equipment during fiscal 2016 were $560 million, including approximately: $201 million for distribution and transportation related projects; $168 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $120 million for new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements; $38 million for stores purchased or built by the Company; and $26 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 2016, the Company opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 906 stores. Share Repurchases The Company repurchased $990 million, or 12.4 million shares, under its share repurchase program in 2016, at an average price of $80.17 per share. Since December 2011 through the end of fiscal 2016, the Company has repurchased 74.4 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $4.6 billion, at an average price of $61.41 per share. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases was approximately $930 million at the end of the 2016 fiscal year. The authorization has no expiration date. Dividend On March 15, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an increase of four percent in its quarterly cash dividend to shareholders. The first quarter dividend of $0.26 per share will be payable on April 25, 2017 to shareholders of record of the Company’s common stock on April 11, 2017. While the Board of Directors intends to continue regular cash dividends, the declaration and amount of future dividends are subject to the Board’s discretion. Fiscal 2017 Guidance For the 52-week fiscal year ending February 2, 2018 (“fiscal 2017”), the Company expects its fiscal 2017 net sales to increase four to six percent with same-store sales growth to be slightly positive to up two percent and diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50. The Company’s fiscal 2017 net sales guidance includes an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping the 2016 53rd week. The Company’s fiscal 2017 diluted EPS guidance includes an anticipated negative impact totaling approximately $0.34 per share, lowering the fiscal 2017 EPS growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points as follows: approximately $0.16 per share relating to anticipated store manager compensation and training and other strategic investments, approximately $0.09 per share due to lapping of the 53rd week in 2016, and approximately $0.09 per share for the combined impact from the early adoption of income tax changes for stock-based compensation in 2016, lower estimated share repurchases in 2017 and an anticipated charge related to the retirement of debt. Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $450 million. The Company plans to open approximately 1,000 new stores and relocate or remodel 900 stores in fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be in the range of $650 to $700 million. The information in this “Fiscal 2017 Guidance” section of this press release constitutes the only guidance issued by the Company with respect to its fiscal 2017 performance, operating results or financial condition. The Company undertakes no obligation, and specifically disclaims any duty, to update any of the information set forth in this section except as may be required by law. Long-Term Growth Model The Company’s fiscal 2017 financial guidance contemplates results that do not fall within the ranges contained in its long-term growth model that was announced on March 10, 2016. The Company expects to continue to use the long-term growth model internally to assess and benchmark its results and strategic plans; however, the Company does not intend to discuss fiscal 2017 guidance or results in the context of the long-term growth model. Over the longer term, the Company’s goal is to grow diluted EPS at a 10 percent or higher rate on an adjusted basis. GAAP EPS may include the impact of certain discrete items, which may be excluded in calculating adjusted EPS. In the past these discrete items have included restructuring costs, legal settlements and certain other items that are discretely managed. The Company is not currently aware of any such discrete items.

The woman told officers that her 13-year-old son and his friend took her Chevrolet Cruze for a joyride at 11 p.m. and she wasn't sure where they went or when they would be back. Fuming Police responded to a Walmart on E. Independence Blvd. after employees there caught a man on tape inhaling fumes from a compressed air can in the parking lot. When officers arrived, they watched the footage of the man and then went to confront him, as of course he was still in the parking lot and in no rush to leave. The officers found four empty bottles of compressed air in the back of the man's SUV and charged him with inhaling toxic fumes, an inherently bizarre and dumb crime in itself. The Chips Are Down A criminal with the munchies took desperate measures last week in order to get a few bags of chips. Police responded to a Frito Lay warehouse in the University area after someone cut through the chain used to secure the fence. Rather than steal truck equipment, as is often the case in incidents like this, the suspect instead went for the snacks. The thief made off with six cases of Frito Lays chips, worth $300 total, and nothing else. Silly Toys A man made a big scene in a University area sex shop last week after he deciding he really wanted to go fuck himself. According to the report, the man walked into The Red Door on North Tryon Street and grabbed a Pipedream Extreme "Fuck Me Silly Mega Masturbation" toy and made for the door. Before anyone could even confront him about the fact that he was blatantly stealing, he began threatening that he had a gun and that nobody should try to stop him from leaving the store. Force Field A young child's mother went to police last week after being rightfully concerned about the tactics her son's teacher was using to keep him in line in class. The woman told officers that the Westerly Hills Academy teacher assaulted her 10-year-old son by spraying Febreze air freshener directly into his face in an attempt to stop him from approaching her desk. That's one way to get some peace and quiet while also keeping the classroom fresh, I guess. Bucket All A 26-year-old man in the Belmont neighborhood called police last week after a prized possession went missing, despite the fact that he found it shortly thereafter. The man told police that someone stole a bucket off his front porch at some point in the morning, and that he later spotted the bucket and recovered the bucket from a known suspect. Although it would seem this episode had ended, the man felt the need to get police involved and wanted the suspect charged with theft. Special Delivery Police stumbled across a rather remarkable drug bust during a traffic stop in southeast Charlotte last week, and it even came with a corporate sponsor. Officers stopped a car for a traffic violation on Monroe Road, and the suspects inside made a mistake by giving them permission to search the vehicles. During the search, police found a digital scale with powder residue on it, nearly six grams of cocaine in two separate bags and - jackpot - a bag of 83 blue ecstacy pills with UPS emblems on them. The drug bust was worth $1,365 in total, but we're still bothered by the fact that the UPS X pills weren't even brown. Hulk Smash Police arrested a man in east Charlotte last week after an argument escalated quickly between he and a group of people. According to the report, the suspect showed up and began an argument with a woman at her home, and as he left the residence he slammed the storm door so hard that a glass piece came out of the center of the door and smashed on the ground. The woman then chased him up the street, but he had other things on his mind. For a reason that is unclear in the report, the suspect then jumped on the hood of a Honda Accord that two men were driving up the street. The men began arguing with the suspect, who then shattered the rear windshield of the Honda. He then tried to get in his own car and drive away, but officers arrived on the scene and arrested him before he could do so. In the Buff An east Charlotte man had quite a surprise waiting for him when he got out of the shower last week, and it was not an afternoon delight. The man later told police that he exited the bathroom with just a towel on only to find a strange man in his bedroom, hovering over his fiance's jewelry drawer. With no time to put on pants, the still-wet man went at it with the cat burglar, pushing him up against the wall and then literally throwing him out of the house. The man wasn't able to snatch any of the jewelry and the police were able to find him quickly as he walked down a nearby road, and a then-clothed victim identified him.

That's when the new Rural King store at US-23 and M-59 in Hartland, between Ann Arbor and Flint, welcomed its first customers. The farm and home store was set for a "soft" opening on March 13, but it opened its doors several days earlier when the storms caused massive power outages. The store already had generators, flashlights and oil for heaters in stock, so it set up a display and opened the doors. Since then, "we've been working 24 hours a day, nonstop, to get our shelves stocked," said store manager Mike Butler. Rural King is the type of retailer that builds a following. It's a big-box farm store, with specialized equipment, hardware items and feed - and also home items, work-type apparel and garden supplies. The product mix, along with things like a house brand, free popcorn at the door and the pricing seem to combine to create loyalty among shoppers. The store in Hartland is the chain's 99th as it expands from Indiana and the Midwest to the south, like Tennessee and North Carolina, to the east in Pennsylvania and to Florida. It's in a portion of a former Walmart, which the company bought and divided. A second, 70,000-square-foot space remains available for lease. "Our store is probably one of the bigger stores in the company," Butler said. "We've got a lot of room to be creative in our store." As an example, the Hartland store will feature all of the available furniture as part of a display near the entrance. And the farm area of the store, which features animals like baby chicks and turkeys, is spread out a bit to show off feed and equipment. Finding merchandise like live animals may be a new experience for some customers who've never shopped at Rural King. Butler said it was new to him, too, since his previous retail experience includes big box stores that carried typical product lines. "One store even sells goats," he said of another Rural King. Hartland, Michigan Rural King store tour Butler has spent about two months setting up the store. And unlike at many other retailers, that doesn't mean getting the format from corporate and following directions. The creativity that he mentions extends to how the store is laid out, and how much of certain merchandise is displayed. Both are up to him, and with that he says, "I want it to tell a story." Customers, he said, should find it logical but also entertaining. He wants them to feel like they're discovering items in the store, even if they just came for something practical. That's how the stuffed chicken toys ended up near tractor oil. And how the hummingbird feeders are near BBQs. And why the kids colorful rain boots fill an endcap near the Melissa and Doug toys. Butler watches metrics for guidance. In the first few days of the soft opening, a few trends emerged - like how the camouflage patio cushions were hot sellers, compared to other patterns. He also gets to talk to his staff to get their read on what should be sold and how it should be displayed. The best part about opening, he said, is getting to watch and talk to customers, who also already are sharing feedback. Merchandise is still arriving at the 110,000-square-foot store ahead of the opening. A garden center will be set up outdoors once the weather allows it, and in the meantime staff will be doing things like building chicken houses, setting up the big farm equipment and fine-tuning displays. The store will have firearms, "which is going to be a big thing for us," Butler said. "We're also going to  carry canoes, paddle boats, fishing boats, kayaks," he said. "This store is going to be based off of the market that we're in." In Hartland, he said, that means farmers, horse owners and many people with large lots or lake access. Hiring involved about 100 new employees, a mix of full-time and part-time. Two moved from other stores, including an assistant store manager who came from Paducah, Kentucky. Rural King often hires its customers, Butler said. With no other store nearby - the only other one in Michigan is in Niles, southwest of Kalamazoo - that wasn't feasible in Hartland. The chain ran a job fair with the Hartland Area Chamber of Commerce, while other employees responded once the sign went up in February. The store is now open daily 7 a.m.-9 p.m. The official grand opening celebration is March 23. Butler and other employees will do a ribbon-cutting with the chamber at 9 am, and store specials will last all weekend. Butler said he wants customers to feel like the store is part of the community. A farmer's market will be set up in the parking lot in spring and summer, while fund-raisers will be held for local groups, like the 4-H Club.

Flipkart, the country's number one online marketplace firm, may soon seal a deal with US-based eBay and China's Tencent to get a fund infusion of around $1.5 billion. As part of the deal, the Indian arm of US-based eBay may get into the fold of Flipkart, The Economic Timesreport said. Flipkart is also holding talks with one more investor for another round of fund raising initiative. Before this, the company had held talks with Alibaba and Walmart for a fund raising exercise, but the talks failed. The company has so far raised more than $3 billion in funding, mostly from international investors. The fresh fund infusion likely to come at a time when the company is already facing stiff competition from the US ecommerce giant Amazon and China's Alibaba. Reuters “Talks with eBay are at an advanced stage, and a strategic deal may include Flipkart acquiring or merging their India operations,” The Economic Times report said. With no shortage of cash to spend, both these overseas e-tail giants have been making fast inroads into the country's multi-billion dollar online retail industry estimated to be around $15-$16 billion, and also threaten to dislodge Flipkart's number one position. The Bengaluru-headquartered company could be valued between $10-$12 billion after the fund raising exercise, after being valued at $15.2 billion when it last raised capital in July 2015. In the recent past, Flipkart's valuation was consistently marked down by its overseas investors. In the current month, a mutual fund managed by Morgan Stanley had marked down the value of its holding in Flipkart for the fifth straight quarter, valuing the e-commerce major at $5.37 billion. Last year, Morgan Stanley had marked down the value of its shares in Flipkart for the September quarter to $52.13 per share from $84.29 per share in March. Throughout last year, the Bengaluru-based firm has seen several markdowns by its investors like Valic Co, Vanguard, Fidelity and T Rowe Price. Meanwhile, in a view to strenthen its position, Amazon India received Rs 7,000 crore in fund infusion from its US parent for 2017, while Alibaba entered the Indian market by acquiring a majority stake in payments provider Paytm’s online marketplace. Earlier this month, Alibaba, along with investment firm SAIF Partners, said it will pump in $200 million in Paytm's online marketplace unit. India's third largest online marketplace firm Snapdeal is also holding talks with its largest shareholder SoftBank Corp, which may invest $100-150 million in tranches.   #Alibaba#Amazon#Ebay#Ecommerce#Etail#Flipkart#Newstracker#Online marketplace#Saif partners#Snapdeal#Tencent Published Date: Mar 16, 2017 03:51 pm | Updated Date: Mar 16, 2017 06:23 pm Top Stories Sexual harassment at the workplace: Amid the grey noise, remember safety should trump speculation Jat Agitation: Metro to Curtail Service in NCR From Sunday Night LIVE India vs Australia, 3rd Test, Day 4, cricket scores and updates: Pujara, Saha put hosts in command at lunch Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath: BJP has made its boldest ideological statement Reviewing portfolio regularly: A comparison of SIP performance Donald Trump and Angela Merkel: Stark differences in full view during icy first meeting An officer and a gentleman: Why people in Burhan Wani's Tral backyard love Major Rishi Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's father Krishnaraj Rai passes away Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 34 runs Australia in India, 4 Test Series, 2017 South Africa in New Zealand, 3 Test Series, 2017 South Africa beat New Zealand by 8 wickets Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 2 Test Series, 2017 Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 30 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 28 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 17 runs (D/L method) England in West Indies, 3 ODI Series, 2017 England beat West Indies by 186 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 6 wickets Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 22nd, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 24th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST South Africa in New Zealand, 3 Test Series, 2017 NZ vs SA - Mar 25th, 2017, 03:30 AM IST Australia in India, 4 Test Series, 2017 IND vs AUS - Mar 25th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Mar 25th, 2017, 02:30 PM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Mar 26th, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Mar 28th, 2017, 02:30 PM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Mar 30th, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Apr 1st, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Apr 1st, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Site Index हिंदी फर�?स�?टपोस�?ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Cartoons Video Room eBooks Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India Budget 2017 Assembly Election Results 2017 Weather E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

Elias O'Neal March 16, 2017 1 Several tenants have opened at the Eastgate Town Center development at 4869 Nine Mile Road. (J. Elias O’Neal) The first new tenants have opened their doors at a revamped mall property in eastern Henrico. Arizona-based Bromont Investment Group last month welcomed the initial wave of retailers at its redeveloped Eastgate Town Center, a 300,000-square-foot shopping center being built on the site of the former Fairfield Commons mall at 4869-4919 Nine Mile Road. Bromont’s Josh Rector said Dunkin’ Donuts, Hibbett Sports, Citi Trends and Planet Fitness have opened, while anchor tenant Wal-Mart, which owns its property in the development, is set to open a 182,000-square-foot store this summer. Conn’s, Shoe Show, Metro PCS, DaVinci Pizza and Nu Look Hair are set to open in coming months, Rector said, while leases are pending for Empire Nail and America’s Best Wings. Westward near the city line, Bromont also is mulling ideas to purchase and redevelop the former Azalea Mall property at the intersection of Dumbarton Road and Azalea Avenue. Citi Trends and Planet Fitness are two of the shopping center’s first-to-open tenants. (J. Elias O’Neal) The company put the long-dormant site under contract six months ago, but Rector would not specify when it would close the deal. “We’re pursuing it actively,” Rector said. “But we have no big announcements at the moment.” Atlanta-based Dewberry Capital owns the Azalea Mall site, which covers 39 acres in Henrico County and another 9 acres over the Richmond city line. The company bought the property in 1998 and razed the mall in 1999. John and Doug Dewberry with Dewberry Capital could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon. Since its demolition, the Azalea property has been the topic of several redevelopment proposals, including a plan made in 2014 to transform it into a mixed-use development with 300,000 square feet of retail and 200 apartment units. Martin’s also was eyeing the site for an 84,000-square-foot grocery store, but momentum was halted after the massive merger of the parent companies of Martin’s and Food Lion. Both the Eastgate and Azalea sites sit in Henrico’s enterprise zone, a designation created to fuel job growth and redevelopment by offering investors tax credits and grants, such as a seven-year property tax exemption based on the increase in assessed value on rehabbed properties. Rector said his firm is eyeing other redevelopment sites across the region. “The shopping center business is evolving in the Richmond area,” Rector said, without disclosing the sites’ locations. “We have several sites that we have been pursuing, but nothing that we can announce at this time.” POSTED IN » Commercial Real Estate, Featured, News About the author: J.

The theft occurred about 9:50 p.m. on Feb. 24 at the store at 40130 10th St. West, according to Deputy Jodi Wolfe of the sheriff’s Palmdale Station. The men allegedly entered the store, loaded up a shopping cart with miscellaneous bedding items and proceeded to checkout. The suspects used the self-checkout register, only paying for half of the items in the cart, Wolfe said. The suspects then wheeled the shopping cart out of the store with the unpaid items, she said. One suspect, seen on camera, was described as a black man in his 20s wearing a gray sweater, a gray beanie and black pants, Wolfe said. The second suspect was identified as a black woman in her 20s wearing a green jacket with a pink shirt. Anyone with information on the identity of these suspects were asked to contact Detective Halvorsen at 661-272-2479.

Alfred Peet founded Peet’s Coffee and Tea back in 1966. The bespectacled Dutch immigrant worked in the coffee trade before moving to San Francisco after World War II. This was long before the haute coffee trend hit the mainstream and your friends started gushing about French presses and cold brews. In the ’60s, Americans were drinking low-grade mud. Needless to say, Peet was appalled. When he opened his first coffee shop in Berkeley, California, his brews were unlike anything patrons had ever tasted. The idea quickly took off, and Peet’s became a cult favorite among what was one of America’s hippest consumer groups. Peet’s now operates storefronts in eight states plus Washington, D.C. And its coffee is available in cafes across the country as well as mainstream retailers like Target, Walmart and Giant. It was acquired by JAB Holding Co., the same firm now behind Keurig Green Mountain, for $974 million in 2012. But like many in the social good space, Peet’s was given autonomy to keep its operations consistent under the new parent company’s umbrella. With roots in a place and time like 1960s San Francisco, it’s likely no surprise that social consciousness was a part of Peet’s story from the start. Some of the same artisanal coffee growers who worked with Alfred Peet over 40 years ago are still part of the company to this day. One of those growing collectives is the Falla family in Guatemala. “The longevity of the relationship stems from the superior quality of their beans, and also because of the care they show for the environment, their workers and the surrounding community,” Doug Welsh, VP of coffee and ‘Roastmaster’ for Peet’s, said of the Fallas. He recently paid a visit to their farm, which the company shared on Instagram: Our Roastmaster, Doug Welsh, at Finca San Sebastián in Guatemala. Morning sun, volcanic slopes and meticulous care-everything about this farm is perfect for producing coffee of superlative quality. Discover our Direct Trade Guatemala San Sebastián coffee. Learn more via the link in our profile. A post shared by Peet’s Coffee (@peetscoffee) on Feb 13, 2017 at 10:42am PST “As our relationship has evolved over the years, we wanted to do more than buy coffee from the Fallas,” Welsh told TriplePundit. “We started donating to the school the farm sponsors as well as to the clinic the family hosts, which provides basic medical care at no cost to their workers and family members.” The company’s four decades of work with the Falla family helped inspire its social mission. Its latest effort, People and Planet, features curated coffees that highlight the brand’s heritage of working collaboratively with farming communities. The line includes nine coffees, such as Guatemala San Sebastián, a sharp and sweet blend that comes from the Fallas farm in Guatemala’s Antigua Valley. Through the effort, Peet’s is looking to engage consumers and connect them with the people and places behind their cup of coffee. The effort focuses on promoting three practices already near and dear to the company’s heart: Direct Trade: Peet’s prides itself on personal relationships with farmers. It negotiates prices directly and collaborates with these suppliers on projects that support the people, communities, and natural environment surrounding their farms. Farmer Assistance: The company also trains coffee farmers in agronomy and business skills — with the aim of helping them improve product quality, obtain higher crop yields and secure premium prices. Certification: Peet’s focuses on sourcing coffees that carry USDA Organic, Fair Trade and/or Rainforest Alliance certifications. That all sounds great. But with the number of so-called ‘sustainable’ coffee labels on the market, what really sets Peet’s apart? If anyone would know, it’s Doug Welsh. Welsh once worked at Peet’s first store on Vine Street in Berkeley. Nearly 25 years later, he’s now the third person to hold the esteemed title of Roastmaster. We spoke with him further to find out what really makes a socially-conscious cup of Joe. Doug Welsh, the ‘Roastmaster’ of Peet’s Coffee. Direct Trade builds on longstanding relationships Most of Peet’s People and Planet coffees bear an environmental certification, if not several. But beyond certification, Peet’s introduced its Direct Trade business model to build upon its longstanding relationships with farmers. Direct Trade was also partially inspired by the Falla family, Welsh said. “[Working] with coffee growers like the Fallas is an integral part of how we source coffee,” Welsh told us of the Direct Trade model. “It’s rooted in our belief that quality is correlated to the well-being of those who produce our coffee and to the natural environment.” Through the program, Peet’s invests in a project in each coffee-growing community where it does business. But the real task is directly engaging with these communities to find out what they need, Welsh said. “Our Direct Trade producer relationships are based on constant dialogue and continuous improvement over time,” he told us. “Coffee farming is hard work. And we believe we are being the most supportive when we listen to our farmers, learn what works and what does not, and work together to make improvements.” Farmer Assistance programs drive community impact Alfred Peet opened that first shop with one goal in mind: Bring better coffee to the American market. The close-knit relationships that followed were initially based on product quality, and the company’s motto is still “coffee first.” But the business structure that formed around these relationships — now called corporate social responsibility (CSR) but once known quaintly as “the right thing to do” — helped Peet’s survive where others failed. “We want to help farmers move from producing average-quality coffee to producing high-quality coffee, and to grow more of it,” Welsh said. “There is growing appetite, literally, for high-quality coffee. And we want to help farmers take advantage of this opportunity.” Through its Farmer Assistance program, the company supports smallholders with lessons in farming practices, as well as business development. As they become more empowered entrepreneurs and their quality and yield increases, coffee farmers can earn far more for their crops and give their entire families a better quality of life. Fostering a genuine connection with suppliers Take Peet’s longstanding partnership with international nonprofit TechnoServe — which informed another People and Planet coffee, the Uzuri African Blend. “TechnoServe was working with coffee cooperatives across East Africa to help them improve crop quality and yield as part of a multi-year program funded by the Gates Foundation,” Welsh recalled. The java gurus at Peet’s were initially tasked with giving farmers feedback on their product. “As the coffee produced by these cooperatives increased in quality, we were inspired to create our first blend of African-only coffees and source directly from these hardworking farmers,” Welsh told us. “This created a mutually beneficial and reinforcing relationship that we continue today.” The modernization of coffee farms in Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia meant a tasty new blend for Peet’s and upward mobility for thousands: The company pays a premium price for the high-quality coffee, allowing farmers to improve their financial conditions and that of their entire communities. “We’ve seen many farmers — through their cooperatives — decide to build schools and install power lines, among other community improvements,” Welsh said. The company’s supply chain in Nicaragua tells a similar story. There, Peet’s sources coffee from a group of 200 women farmers, which its team calls Las Hermanas. “Since we started purchasing their coffee in 2003, the women of Las Hermanas have transformed their own lives, the lives of their families, and the quality of life in their communities,” Welsh told us. For over 15 years, we have been buying coffee from Las Hermanas, a sisterhood of 200 women in Nicaragua who are part of SOPPEXCCA, a co-op leading gender equality in coffee farming. This beautiful Fair Trade coffee is highlighted in our Los Cafeteros Blend.

The bottom line Are we sensing a pattern here? Each of these success stories, like so many in the sustainable business community, stems from a genuine relationship with the people that make up Peet’s supply chain. And communicating this connection to customers — an effort it hopes to increase with the People and Planet line — allowed the company to foster a genuinely authentic brand that continues to compete in what is now a woefully crowded marketplace. Additional People and Planet coffees will be announced throughout the year, as well as events where Peet’s will invite its customers to engage around the initiative.

Yarnell, left, and his son Rogers Yarnell II attend the United Way of White County’s annual Bonnie Schaff Victory Luncheon. Albert was on hand to present the Albert R. Yarnell Spirit Award to this year’s recipient, CenterPoint Energy. Albert was one of the founding members of the United Way of White County and the award was named after him in recognition of his service to the organization and the community. SEARCY  The United Way of White County welcomed six new board members at its annual Bonnie Schaff Victory Luncheon on March 7. “Bonnie was the first director [of the United Way of White County], and they named the luncheon after her,” said Pat Downs, executive director of the United Way of White County. Downs said the event is sponsored yearly by Unity Health and is held in the Hubach Conference Center, 3214 E. Race Ave. in Searcy. Ray Montgomery, Unity Health President/CEO, gave the opening welcoming remarks, as well as the invocation. “They are very generous to the United Way,” Downs said of Unity Health. Outgoing United Way of White County President Glen Metheny spoke about the importance of thinking about the needs of others and how we all need to take advantage of each opportunity to help one another. Downs said one of the greatest strengths of the United Way is how different people and organizations across the county come together for a positive cause like a United Way campaign. “When they come together to work on the campaigns, it’s so interesting and so rewarding to watch the camaraderie between them,” Downs said. “That’s what really makes a difference in a campaign, when they all pull together for a common cause.” Metheny also thanked the board members who were retiring for their service to the United Way. Those members were Julie Baker, Letain DeVore, Donna Rippey, Adam Hart, Bonnie Miller, Clay Simpson and Kieth Williams. Metheny then passed the gavel to the new president, Donny Grey. In addition to recognizing the retiring board members, the new board members were introduced. “We are so excited about our new members,” Downs said. The new board members are as follows: • Buck Gibson, city attorney for Searcy: Gibson attended the University of Arkansas Dale Bumpers College of Food, Agriculture and Life Science, where he received a degree, with honors, in domestic and international agricultural marketing. He earned his juris doctor degree, also with honors, from the William H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Gibson has practiced law in Searcy since 2001, and his practice emphasizes business and commercial matters, along with real estate, probate and related issues. He is married to DeAndra, a speech language pathologist, and helps raise their two children, Tate and Joseph. • Donald Shull, CEO and founder of NorthStar EMS Inc.: NorthStar is a Searcy-based company that provides 911 emergency and nonemergency services to all of White County, southern Cleburne County and a small portion of Faulkner County. Founded in 2000, the company has 62 full-time employees and approximately 20 part-time employees. Shull is married to Stephanie, and they have five children and two grandchildren. • L. Felipe Barahona, general manager for Wal-Mart Logistics: Barahona is based in Searcy. He received a Bachelor of Design degree from the University of Florida and a master’s degree in architecture design from Florida International University. Barahona is an active member of the Hispanic Latino Associate Resource Group and a local sponsor for Mi Futuro, a youth mentoring program for at-risk students sponsored by Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club. He is married to Kindann, and they have three children in college: Erika, Fernando and Alessandra. • Jim Swensen: He grew up in Minnesota and has a bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in industrial relations and industrial organizational psychology. He earned a master’s degree in industrial relations from the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Swensen and his wife have two grown children, a son and a daughter. When not working, Swensen enjoys domestic and international travel, as well as attending various cooking schools around the globe. • Orin P. Wilson, with Hamilton, Cherry, Spradlin & Mandrell, LTD: Wilson was raised in Monroe, Louisiana, and moved to Searcy with his family in 2015. Prior to joining the firm in 2012, he served in a variety of senior accounting and finance positions in industries such as lumber and building materials, telecommunications, technology and analytics. Wilson is the current president and chairman of the Arkansas Central Chapter of the Institute of Management Accountants and a member of the Searcy Lion’s Club. He enjoys spending time with his family through Searcy youth athletic and other outdoor activities. • Tom Martin, a pastoral minister for the Downtown Church of Christ: Martin transitioned to his current position in 2016 after serving as body life minister since 2006. Wilson found his calling working with and serving kids while a counselor at Camp Wyldewood in Searcy. That is also where he met DeeAnn, his partner in life and in ministry. They married in 1974 and have two daughters and four grandsons. The Martins helped start the youth group at the newly formed Cloverdale Church of Christ in 1976. They served there until 2006, when Tom joined the Downtown Church of Christ staff. The United Way also introduced this year’s Albert R. Yarnell Spirit Award winner, CenterPoint Energy. Downs said the award is given to the company that has shown the most spirit. “It doesn’t necessarily mean who raises more money,” Downs said. “It’s that they’ve shown the enthusiasm and the spirit for the United Way. CenterPoint Energy has had 100 percent participation for many, many years.” The award was created by some of the founding fathers of the United Way of White County, including Albert R. Yarnell of Yarnell’s Ice Cream. Yarnell was on hand to present the award to CenterPoint Energy. Downs said giving to the United Way of White County allows people to help others in many different ways because the group works with so many agencies, including the Child Safety Center, White County Domestic Violence Prevention and Rape Crisis Center, Special Olympics, Jacob’s Place and many other local agencies and groups. The United Way of White County helps 16 agencies in the county. “When you contribute to the United Way, you are changing the lives of thousands and thousands of men, women and children throughout White County,” Downs said. “Our community and our county are so giving. We are grateful for their generosity. They always come through for us.” Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More News Cabot High School band director prepares for ...

Related Stories Boy who nearly drowned rescued from hotel pool Successful ULA launch at Cape Canaveral Musician Chuck Berry has died at age 90 Acupuncturist arrested on sexual battery charges ORLANDO, Fla. (WOFL FOX 35) - The top prosecutor for metropolitan Orlando says she is no longer going to seek the death penalty in first-degree murder cases after conducting a review. State Attorney Aramis Ayala, representing Orange and Osceola counties, on Thursday said there is no evidence of improved public safety for citizens or law enforcement with the death penalty, and that such cases are costly and drag on for years. The most visible case immediately affected by Ayala's decision is that of Markeith Loyd. Loyd was the subject of a weeks-long manhunt following the fatal shooting of his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon, 24, and her unborn child.  Loyd is also accused of killing Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton, 42, as she approached Loyd outside an Orlando-area Walmart. A grand jury indicted Loyd on two first-degree murder charges in February.  Additionally, he faces charges of killing of an unborn child by injury to the mother and attempted first degree murder with a firearm.  The attempted murder charge stems from the shooting of Dixon's brother, who was left critically injured following an alleged altercation with Loyd at the home of Dixon's parents.   Ayala's decision comes just days after Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill requiring a unanimous jury recommendation before the death penalty can be imposed.  Scott has been very vocal in his criticism of Ayala's decision, saying she should recuse herself from handling Loyd's case. Later in the day, he  Another law enforcement officer, Orange County Deputy Norman Lewis, died after being struck by a vehicle while particiapating in the search for Loyd.    The decision to not seek the death penalty, as it pertains to Loyd, has received mixed reactions from community and state leaders, with many expressing shock and dismay, especially among law enforcement officers.  Orange County Sheriff Jerry L. Demings said, "While it is her decision to make, the heinous nature of Loyd's crimes resulted in the murder of Sade Dixon, an unborn child, and Lt. Clayton.  Also, because of Loyd's actions, we lost Deputy Norm Lewis. I urge her to consider the wishes of the victims' families and try these cases with death as the penalty." Orlando Police Chief Mina said, "I am extremely disappointed in the decision. I personally have seen video of Markeith Loyd executing Lt. Clayton while lying defenseless on the ground.  This heinous crime is why we have the death penalty in the first place." "I believe in and support the use of the death penalty," said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer.  "The law in the State of Florida provides for the death penalty for the most heinous crimes.  The crimes committed by Markeith Loyd are horrific and the death penalty is the appropriate consequence." "State Attorney Aramis Ayala's decision today sends a dangerous message to residents and visitors of the greater Orlando area-furthermore, it is a blatant neglect of duty and a shameful failure to follow the law as a constitutionally elected officer," said Bondi.  However, others have come out in support of the decision. "As pastors, we recognize that this is a difficult and sensitive matter and are committed to finding holistic healing alternatives," said Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, President, National Latino Evangelical Coalition. "By naming a broken program, Ms. Ayala creates hope in the community for working together to find better alternatives." "State Attorney Aramis Ayala's decision sets a powerful example of reform that others must heed," Rashad Robinson, spokesperson for Color Of Change PAC said. "Every day more and more Americans of all races are waking up to realize the warped incentives in our criminal justice system, and in 2016 many went to the polls to vote out prosecutors working from a failed and inhumane playbook." "While State Attorney Ayala and I likely disagree on a host of ideological issues, as a conservative Republican, I applaud her decision to avoid seeking death sentences during her term," said Brian Empric, Past Vice-Chairman Florida Federation of Young Republicans.  "I believe that we should value life and ensure that tax dollars are spent efficiently, but the death penalty does neither. It inherently devalues life, risks killing the innocent, and costs far more than the alternatives."         false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent APD officer goes beyond call of duty to help teen Florida court defines sexual intercourse Snake slithers from vent in woman's car Dramatic police chase comes to a deadly end 'No indication' Trump Tower was surveilled Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next DENVER -- Mitch Uhland had no idea his life was about to change, when he went outside on February 12, to warm up his car. "It was parked right here," Uhland said, pointing to handicapped spot in front of his apartment at the Breakers. "Forty seconds later, it was gone." Uhland learned firsthand why police warn against "puffing," the act of leaving your car running unattended. He said he went back into the house to get his dog and when he came back out, his car, a 2009 Chevy Cobalt, was no where to be seen. "I didn't even hear the car take off," he said.  Stolen car spotted multiple times Uhland told Denver7 that it was bad enough having his car stolen just a few feet away from his front door, but what is even worse is that he's seen the suspected thief driving it four times and is powerless to do anything about it. "It's kind of upsetting," he said. "I saw the car in the Walmart parking lot (at South Parker Road and Florida) and called police." The 911 call apparently went to Arapahoe County dispatch.  "I was on the phone with police and I was like, 'I'm going to go over there and they're like, no, no, no, don't. Stay there.'" He said the last time he saw the vehicle, the suspect was driving "100 miles an hour" down Valentia Street. "The officer told me he got away." Uhland said his girlfriend saw the suspect entering the Breakers complex once and saw him leaving once. He said she called police both times. Denver Police say their records show only two calls were made from Uhland's phone. One when the car was reported stolen and one when it was spotted several weeks later. Department spokesman Doug Schepman said there are three jurisdictions in that general area: Denver, Aurora and unincorporated Arapahoe County, so the various 911 calls apparently went to different jurisdictions. "We absolutely understand this gentleman's frustrations," Schepman said.  Schepman added that it's easier to recover a stolen car if it's parked and more difficult if it's actually being driven. "We stress how important it is, to make it as hard as possible, if not impossible for someone to steal your car," he said. "Don't leave your car running." Schepman said DPD is part of the Metro Area Auto Theft Task Force. "Officers get lists of vehicles reported stolen and we use license plate reader technology to help recover stolen cars," he said.  Some cars are recovered quickly, while others take much more time. "Each case is different," he said. Suspect description When asked to describe the individual he saw driving his car, Uhland said he was a tall, gangly white man. "He looks my age," he said, "In his 20s or maybe 30s." Because the Breakers is a gated community, Uhland said he can't help but wonder if the thief lives there too, and whether he's keeping an eye on him. "I feel caged," he said. "I feel like I'm being poked with a stick and it's really frustrating." Schepman said Uhland's car, a silver Cobalt, is listed in the stolen auto database, but added he can't predict when it might be recovered. "We want the public to be the eyes and ears," he said. "If you see a vehicle that seems out of place in the neighborhood, or one that appears to have been broken into, call police." Auto theft statistics Statistics from the Auto Theft Intelligence Coordination Center show that 14,859 motor vehicles were stolen in 2015. That was a 29 percent jump from the previous year. Denver Police released these statistics late Wednesday showing how many cars were stolen last  year and how many have been recovered: --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Feldman Magazine Library of Congress Thurgood Marshall in the Supreme Courts lounge after successfully arguing a school integration case in 1958. Appointed to the Court himself in 1967, Marshall would take up the case against monopoly long championed by Justice Louis Brandeis, whose portrait hangs in the background. Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email At the new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., a hallway of glass display cases features more than a century of black entrepreneurial triumphs. In one is a World War II–era mini parachute manufactured by the black-owned Pacific Parachute Company, home to one of the nation’s first racially integrated production plants. Another displays a giant time clock from the R. H. Boyd Publishing Company, among the earliest firms to print materials for black churches and schools. Although small, the exhibit recalls a now largely forgotten legacy: by serving their communities when others wouldn’t, black-owned independent businesses provided avenues of upward mobility for generations of black Americans and supplied critical leadership and financial support for the civil rights movement. This tradition continues today. Last June, Black Enterprise magazine marked the forty-fourth anniversary of the BE 100s, the magazine’s annual ranking of the nation’s top 100 black-owned businesses. At the top of the list stood World Wide Technology, which, since its founding in 1990, has grown into a global firm with more than $7 billion in revenue and 3,000 employees. Then came companies like Radio One, whose fifty-five radio stations fan out among sixteen national markets. The combined revenues of the BE 100s, which also includes Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions, now totals more than $24 billion, a ninefold increase since 1973, adjusting for inflation. A closer look at the numbers, however, reveals that these pioneering companies are the exception to a far more alarming trend. The last thirty years also have brought the wholesale collapse of black-owned independent businesses and financial institutions that once anchored black communities across the country. In 1985, sixty black-owned banks were providing financial services to their communities; today, just twenty-three remain. In eleven states that headquartered black-owned banks in 1994, not a single one is still in business. Of the fifty black-owned insurance companies that operated during the 1980s, today just two remain. Over the same period, tens of thousands of black-owned retail establishments and local service companies also have disappeared, having gone out of business or been acquired by larger companies. Reflecting these developments, working-age black Americans have become far less likely to be their own boss than in the 1990s. The per capita number of black employers, for example, declined by some 12 percent just between 1997 and 2014. What’s behind these trends, and what’s the implication for American society as a whole? To be sure, at least some of this entrepreneurial decline reflects positive economic developments. A slowly rising share of black Americans now hold white-collar salaried jobs and have more options for employment beyond running their own businesses. The movement of millions of black families to integrated suburbs over the last forty years also is a welcome trend, even if one effect has been to weaken the viability of the many black-owned independent businesses left behind in historically black neighborhoods. But the decline in entrepreneurship and business ownership among black Americans also is cause for concern. One reason is that it largely reflects not the opening of new avenues of upward mobility, but rather the foreclosing of opportunity. Rates of business ownership and entrepreneurship are falling among black citizens for much the same reason they are declining among whites and Latinos. As large retailers and financial institutions comprise an ever-bigger slice of the national economy, the possibility of starting and maintaining an independent business has dropped. The Washington Monthly has addressed the role of market concentration in suppressing opportunity and in displacing local economies in depth (see, for example, “The Slow-Motion Collapse of American Entrepreneurship,” July/August 2012, and “Bloom and Bust,” November/December 2015). Other studies, including a report published last year by President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, have substantiated these developments. The role of market concentration in depressing black-owned businesses is also troubling because of the critical role that such enterprises have played in organizing and financing the struggle for civil rights in America. In the 1950s and ’60s, black Americans employed by whites, including professionals like teachers, often faced dismissal if they joined the civil rights movement, whereas those who owned their own independent business had much greater freedom to resist. This is a largely forgotten history, but one that is gaining new urgency for all Americans in the age of Donald Trump. It shows the crucial way in which advancing and protecting basic civil rights can depend not only on moral and physical courage, but also on possessing the economic independence to stand up to concentrated power. The decline of black-owned independent businesses traces to many causes, but a major one that has been little noted was the decline in the enforcement of anti-monopoly and fair trade laws beginning in the late 1970s. Under both Democratic and Republican administrations, a few firms that in previous decades would never have been allowed to merge or grow so large came to dominate almost every sector of the economy. This change has hurt all independent businesses, but the effects have disproportionately hit black business owners. Marcellus Andrews, Bucknell University professor of economics, says that pulling back on anti-monopoly enforcement was a “catastrophic intellectual and political policy mistake,” and that for the black community, the “presumed price advantages of concentration often do not translate into better economic opportunities.” A case in point is the decline of black-owned financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies. “Mainstream insurers went after black insurance companies for their top personnel to sell their products,” says Wichita State professor Robert Weems Jr. When MetLife bought United Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1993, this was the end of the sixty-three-year existence of the last black-owned insurance company in the Northeast. Black Enterprise called the 1990s “a virtual bloodbath” for the black insurance industry, noting that from 1989 to 1999, the number of black-owned insurers declined by 68 percent. Parks Sausage—which many readers of a certain age may remember for its jingle “More Parks Sausages, Mom, please”—also serves as an example of how market concentration led to the decline of black-owned independent businesses. Founded in 1951 by Henry Parks Jr., the Baltimore-based company grew into a multimillion-dollar operation, selling pork products from New England to Virginia. In 1969, Parks took the company public, making the 200-employee firm the first black-owned business on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet by the 1990s, after a turbulent series of ownership changes, the company had fallen into bankruptcy. In 1996, two black Americans, the former football stars Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell, attempted to revive the company, but faced an increasingly consolidated meatpacking industry in which the four largest meatpackers controlled 78 percent of the market. As Harris put it, before selling out, “it’s been hard to get distribution.” Much the same story occurs with black-owned grocers. In 1969, J. Bruce Llewellyn grew ten Bronx supermarkets into the nation’s largest minority-owned retail business. By the 1990s, however, a retreat from antitrust enforcement and other fair trade laws permitted a few giant corporations like Walmart to engage in anticompetitive behaviors that in previous decades would have resulted in civil and criminal prosecution. These included undermining the pricing power of suppliers and loss leading, or the practice of selling below cost in order to drive competitors out of business. In 1999, Llewellyn sold his last remaining stores to the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, now known as the Target Corporation. In 1986, a top executive at Revlon made a prediction about the future of the beauty and hair care industry. “In the next couple of years,” he told Newsweek, “the black-owned businesses will disappear. They’ll all be sold to white companies.” The prediction proved accurate. In 1993, IVAX Corp. purchased Johnson Products Co., the thirty-nine-year-old maker of Ultra Sheen, beginning a decade-long series of acquisitions that wiped out remaining black ownership in the hair care industry. One consequence was fewer new hair care products for black customers. Funds once channeled into research and development, University at Buffalo professor Robert Mark Silverman explains, now were accrued as profits by the larger firms. Much the same has happened to black-owned firms in the entertainment, communications, and publishing sectors. In response to the merger wave, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, Robert Johnson, told an audience at an investment conference in 1997, “You cannot get big anymore by being 100 percent black-owned anything.” Four years later, Viacom bought out BET for $2.34 billion. In 2005, Time Warner acquired Essence Communications Partners, the publisher of the then-leading black women’s magazine, Essence. Meanwhile, “small enterprises,” writes the business scholar John Sibley Butler, “could not compete with the expansion of larger retail chains, shopping malls, and franchises which developed.” Black-owned funeral homes are a prime example. During the civil rights era, writes author Suzanne Smith in her book To Serve the Living, “funeral directors were usually among the few black individuals in any town or city who were economically independent and not beholden to the local white power structure.” Yet, today, black-owned independent funeral homes are an imperiled institution, as national chains like Service Corporation International muscle out more and more businesses. Charlotte Clark, a black funeral home owner in Roanoke, Alabama, explains that these companies “buy local folks’ funeral parlors but leave up the signs and play it off like there’s been no change, but call the shots from elsewhere.” The National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, which represents black funeral directors, has seen its membership decrease by 40 percent since 1997. Reflecting on the past three decades, Bob Dickerson, CEO of the Birmingham Business Resource Center in Alabama, says, “Had our institutions and businesses been maintained, had that money been plowed back into our communities, it could have meant a world of difference.” The role of market concentration in driving down the number of black-owned independent businesses becomes all the more concerning when one considers some mostly forgotten history. In principles, people, and tactics, the fight for black civil rights, going back to before the Civil War, was often deeply intertwined and aligned with America’s anti-monopoly traditions. An early example is the Free Soil Party. Emerging in the 1840s, its members opposed slavery on moral grounds. They also opposed all forms of monopoly power as a threat to liberty, including its most terrible manifestation: the monopoly of slave owners over slaves. Marching under the banner of “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men,” the movement focused on granting equal citizenship to all Americans, in large part by promoting the then-radical idea of giving black freedmen and slaves the right to own the land on which they labored. Courtesy Black Enterprise No more Parks Sausages: Former National Football League star Franco Harris made the cover of Black Enterprise magazine in 1996 when he tried to rescue the first black-owned business listed on the New York Stock Exchange. A rapidly monopolizing meat processing industry doomed the effort. Free Soilers proposed breaking up land monopolies and dividing western lands into 50-to-100-acre homesteads that would grant white and black families independence. As the antebellum history scholar Jonathan Earle explains, “Opponents of aristocracy, land monopoly, and slavery saw yeoman farming and inalienable landownership as the true opposites of servitude.” It was therefore no surprise when Helen Douglass, the wife of the Free Soiler and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, wrote that his opposition against any type of coercion “not only made him a foe to American slavery, but also to all forms of monopoly.” After the Civil War, passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which outlawed racially discriminatory laws like the Black Codes, depended in no small part on white supporters who saw it as a means of prohibiting all grants of monopoly or class privilege. An 1866 article in the Boston Daily Advertiser said it “[threw] the same shield over the black man as over the white, over the humble as over the powerful.” In fact, one of the earliest applications of the law was by a group of independent Louisiana butchers who argued that a state-sanctioned twenty-five-year slaughterhouse monopoly violated the Fourteenth Amendment. During Reconstruction, the relationship between black political enfranchisement and economic independence gained strength. Abolitionists in Congress passed the Southern Homestead Act, which promised to replace the monopoly of slavery with the creation of a black yeomanry secured with grants of free land. Like General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Special Field Order No. 15, with its promise of “forty acres of tillable ground” to newly freed slaves, it fell victim to white backlash and sectional compromise, and was rescinded. Nevertheless, by the 1890s, black Americans who owned or aspired to own their own land joined with independent white farmers in the multiracial Populist Party, in states including Georgia and Texas. Library of Congress Keeping it in the community: During the mid-twentieth century, anti-monopoly laws, particularly fair trade legislation, contributed to an increase in the number of black-owned, independent businesses like this one in Harlem. The natural alliance between supporters of black civil rights and opponents of monopoly, though strained by race-baiting demagogues, especially during the darkest days of Jim Crow, would endure. As a 1913 editorial by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) put it, the Emancipation Proclamation and the legacy of the Free Soil movement “gave black men not simply physical freedom, but it attempted to give them political freedom and economic freedom and social freedom. It knew then, as it knows now, that no people can be free unless they have the right to vote, the right to land and capital, and the right to choose their friends.” To be sure, many black leaders during this era recognized that economic independence was a necessary but not sufficient condition for securing full rights as citizens. Unlike their white counterparts, independent black business owners were vulnerable to the brutality of lynching, to voter suppression at the polls, and to the plundering of black business districts by white supremacists. Yet many black leaders nonetheless saw that the fight for racial justice also required expanded economic independence, which in turn depended on containing market concentration. In the early twentieth century, groups like the National Negro Business League, for instance, supported anti–chain store legislation as a way to preserve black Americans’ economic self-sufficiency and freedom. As an editorial in the black newspaper New Journal and Guide bemoaned, “Chain stores are constantly draining every dollar, every week, from all of our Southern communities . . . never putting any of it back so that the communities can use it again.” Indeed, many black leaders supported these laws, even though the Ku Klux Klan and many racist white populists also championed them for their own reasons. In 1928, W. E. B. Du Bois validated the black community’s embrace of anti-monopolism when he wrote, “To ask the individual colored man . . . to sell meat, shoes, candy, books, cigars, clothes or fruit in competition with the chain store, is to ask him to commit slow but almost inevitable economic suicide.” In 1932, the Associated Negro Press and the National Negro Business League, with the cooperation of the U.S. Department of Commerce, printed a newspaper column called “Business and Industry.” One article in the series noted that “an embarrassing problem confronts the 70,000 or more Negro-owned individual enterprises in the U.S. today[:] . . . Big Business, which so perceptibly handicaps the small industrial business units in which category Negro enterprise unquestionably belongs.” Coming into the New Deal era, the federal government adopted many policies that enormously benefited whites but did little or nothing to help black Americans. The Federal Housing Authority engaged in redlining, the destructive practice of refusing to issue mortgages in predominately black neighborhoods. The Wagner Act left black workers still unable to join unions. Black agricultural and domestic laborers couldn’t reap the benefits of Social Security. “Roosevelt’s New Deal,” Ta-Nehisi Coates has argued, “rested on the foundation of Jim Crow.” But the expansion of anti-monopoly laws that also occurred during this period provided one important exception to this pattern. These measures included stepped-up antitrust enforcement, along with new fair trade laws, like the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 and the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937, that prevented dominant firms from exploiting their market power. Combined with anti–chain store measures passed in twenty-seven states, the new legal and regulatory constraints on market concentration benefited independent enterprise, including black-owned independent businesses. Between 1935 to 1939 the number of black-owned retail stores increased by 31 percent and the number of black employees hired by black-owned retail stores grew by 14.5 percent. Into the 1940s, black leaders battled segregation while continuing to advocate for anti-monopoly laws. In August 1941, the student organization Negro Youth published a list of demands from the National Defense Program, including “that the Attorney General investigate and prosecute all violations of the Sherman Antitrust laws.” In response to a 1947 New York fair trade law that prohibited loss leading, a coalition of black wholesale grocers declared that the law “will afford additional protection to the small businessman, be he Negro or white.” Independent business owners also played a key role in financing civil rights protests, especially during their peak in the 1950s and ’60s. In Tallahassee, black grocery store owner Daniel Speed bankrolled a bus boycott similar to that in Montgomery, and his shop served as a meeting ground for black leaders. In Biloxi, Gilbert R. Mason, owner of Modern Drug Store, led a “wade-in” against the whites-only section of a federally funded Gulf Coast beach. In his autobiography, Mason wrote, “Pharmacists represented an economically independent class of black businessmen who might have been thought difficult for the white establishment to control. In many cases, the black-owned pharmacy was itself a nexus in black communities.” Funeral home owners emerged as another powerful bloc of civil rights activists. In 1956, funeral home owner William Shortridge cofounded the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, a group that sought to end employment discrimination and abolish segregation in public accommodations. A. G. Gaston, who built his business empire as the owner of the Smith and Gaston Funeral Home, threatened to transfer his accounts from a white-owned bank unless it removed a “Whites Only” sign from a water fountain. In 1963, he lent Martin Luther King Jr. a room at his Gaston Motel. Soon known as the “War Room,” it was there that King decided to submit himself to arrest in Birmingham, a galvanizing moment in the civil rights movement. King himself connected part of the civil rights movement with the struggle against market concentration. While giving a talk in 1961 to students at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, King drew parallels between the Sherman Antitrust Act and discrimination in public accommodations, noting, “This is what is said in the Sherman [Antitrust] Act, that if a business is in the public market it cannot deny access . . . [a]nd I think the same thing applies here . . . that a man should not have the right to say on the basis of color or religion, one cannot use a lunch counter that is open to everyone else in another racial group but not to these particular people; he has an obligation to the public.” In this era, support for the civil rights movement and opposition to monopoly were political stands often advocated by the same person. For instance, Justice Felix Frankfurter, who made anti-monopoly policy one of the causes of his life, served on the NAACP’s National Legal Committee while also being the first member of the Supreme Court to hire a black law clerk. New York Representative Emanuel Celler sponsored the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950, a major anti-monopoly law, and also introduced the Civil Rights Act in the House. Sargent Shriver, the architect of Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty program, said at a dinner reception describing his vision for anti-discrimination laws and programs like Head Start, VISTA, and Job Corps, “The day may well come when Congress enacts a new Sherman Act for the social field—an antitrust law to ensure that . . . monopoly power is not used to expand and perpetuate itself.” Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy similarly drew a link between civil rights and anti-monopoly policy. “The principles of free enterprise which the antitrust laws are designed to protect and vindicate,” he said in 1961, “are economic ideals that underlie the whole structure of a free society.” Two years later, King, in his sermon “On Being a Good Neighbor,” echoed Kennedy’s vision when he said, “Our unswerving devotion to monopoly capitalism makes us concerned about the economic security of the captains of industry, and not the laboring men whose sweat and skills keep the wheels of industry rolling.” Black Americans employed by whites, including professionals like teachers, often faced dismissal if they joined the civil rights movement, whereas those who owned their own independent business had much greater freedom to resist.A seminal moment in the history of the civil rights movement came on a bloody Sunday in 1965 when Alabama state troopers attacked John Lewis and hundreds of others marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in support of voting rights. Here, too, the important link between black-owned independent businesses and civil rights was operating behind the scenes. Civil rights leader Amelia Boynton and her husband, Sam, for example, dedicated half the office space of their real estate and insurance company in Selma to host organizers from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Bernard LaFayette also set up an office in Selma because he knew that the black commercial class would provide a measure of protection for activists. Betty Boynton, the wife of Sam and Amelia’s son Bruce, explained in an interview, “School administrators fired teachers and workers who were sympathetic to the movement.” Indeed, one of the reasons so much of the activity of the civil rights movement was centered in Selma is that its strong community of black business owners offered critical logistical, financial, and other forms of support. The link between civil rights and anti-monopoly policy also was a matter of tactics. In 1961, the owners of ten independent medical practices used the Sherman Antitrust Act against sixty-one local hospitals and medical organizations in Chicago that barred black Americans from the medical staff. The suit claimed that the hospitals, which provided more than 75 percent of the city’s private hospital beds, discriminated against black physicians. The settlement slowly helped integrate black citizens into the medical profession. In 1964, Reginald Johnson, secretary of the National Urban League, encouraged the use of antitrust laws to break up housing segregation in the nation’s cities. Of the twenty million dwellings built since World War II, only 3 percent had been open to black families. “Widespread conspiracies in flagrant restraint of trade,” Johnson said, “have confined millions of the nation’s Negro citizens to lives of squalor, misery, and privation.” Antitrust actions taken by the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and other organizations helped force desegregation of neighborhoods and realty boards in cities including Trenton, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Akron, and New York City. Bruce Boynton even sought to join the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to combat discrimination and fight for greater equality. In a 1964 interview with Jet he said, “I purposely picked Antitrust instead of the Civil Rights section because we have to get involved in other areas, too. . . . Negroes have to learn how to operate stores, as well as boycott them.” He never made it to the Justice Department but made history anyway. The Alabama Bar Association refused to grant him his law license because of his previous arrest for refusing to leave a “Whites Only” lunch counter. Boynton’s protest led to the Supreme Court case Boynton v. Virginia, which helped desegregate interstate bus travel. NAACP lawyer Thurgood Marshall, who was already famous for having successfully argued Brown v. Board of Education, represented Boynton in that case. As it happens, Marshall later became the nation’s first black Supreme Court justice and one of the Court’s last great defenders of anti-monopoly laws. Marshall grew up in the largely middle-class Druid Hill neighborhood of Baltimore, the grandson of two grocery owners, and as a young boy worked in their stores. Marshall’s philosophy, his biographer Juan Williams writes, “was the result of being the child of a proud, politically active, black, middle-class family that owned successful businesses and lived in an integrated neighborhood.” His greatest defense of the anti-monopoly vision came in the majority opinion he authored in United States v. Topco Associates, in which he argued that “antitrust laws, in general, and the Sherman Act, in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise.” After the late 1970s, both Democrats and Republicans generally retreated from the long-standing tradition of using anti-monopoly laws to foster economic and political equality. Since then, successive administrations have evaluated mergers only for their “efficiency,” and by and large have resisted antitrust actions except in the most egregious instances of collusion and price fixing. The subsequent three decades of merger mania have brought steep increases in both market concentration and inequality. Some members of the black community applauded these changes. In a 1986 interview, Dr. William Bradford, chairman of the University of Maryland Finance Department, said, “Selling out will result in gaining future expansion opportunities. . . . [Black businesses] will move up the hierarchy and control more resources.” But other voices expressed worry. An editorial in the Atlanta Daily World noted, “Mergers don’t always make for better service or lower prices to the consumer, and one certain result of weakening the antitrust laws is more and more mergers.” Indeed, the number of mergers did keep growing, and in most instances involved smaller black-owned companies being bought out by larger firms controlled by whites. In 1988, MCA and Boston Ventures bought Motown Records for $61 million. In 1995, Shorebank Corporation acquired Chicago’s black-owned Drexel Bank. In 1999, the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe acquired 49 percent of the black-owned marketing firm Burrell Communications Group. In 2005, a group of white investors purchased the nation’s oldest black-owned bank, Consolidated Bank & Trust Co. The process continues today. Indeed, one of the legacies of Obama’s economic policies has been a particularly sharp drop in the number of black-owned banks. This is not only the result of lessened enforcement of the anti-monopoly laws but also an unintended side effect of measures like the Dodd-Frank Act. In the process of attempting to keep big banks from failing, Dodd-Frank created regulatory burdens that small banks could not meet. These policy changes contributed to a 14 percent decrease in the number of community banks between 2010 and late 2014. Particularly hard hit were black-owned banks, which decreased by 24 percent during this period. Black-owned financial institutions and the businesses that depend on them for credit were also deeply damaged by the misallocation of bank bailout funds. Referring to the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), former Atlanta banker George Andrews says, “If there ever was a crime committed to our community it was in the way the government handled TARP funds.” According to a 2013 study of TARP investments, black-owned banks were ten times less likely to receive bailout money than nonminority-owned banks. Black Americans suffered disproportionately from the predatory lending practices of big banks and from the reform measures put in place to contain banks that had become too big to fail. The story of how the struggle for civil rights intertwined and intersected historically with the struggle against monopoly provides a lesson for the future. It suggests that going forward we also should consider how political independence connects with economic independence in the struggle for social justice. Without freedom from domination in one sphere, there is no freedom in the other. Allowing the powerful to corner markets erodes the democratic spirit that makes America great. Brian S.

Dr. Ben Carson, in a speech before employees of Housing and Urban Development, the department he now runs, likened slaves to "immigrants": "That's what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder, for less. But they, too, had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land." Carson got hammered. Late-night comic Trevor Noah said: "It makes them sound like they work at Wal-Mart. ... Calling slaves 'immigrants' is like saying: 'It's not kidnapping. That person just got a free vacation in a basement.' ... Slaves weren't immigrants. Because an immigrant has choice. They choose the country they're going to because they hope it will bring them a better life. Saying that slaves are just another group of immigrants erases how black people were uniquely oppressed in America. It helps justify blaming African-Americans for their hardships." Actor Samuel L. Jackson tweeted: "OK!! Ben Carson ... I can't! Immigrants? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAF---- PLEASE!!! #d---headedtom." Actress Whoopi Goldberg said: "Were the slaves really thinking about the American dream? No, because they were thinking, 'What the hell just happened?!' You know, when people immigrate, they come with the idea that they're going someplace for a better life. ... It's voluntary. ... How does he miss what slavery is?! How does he miss that no slave came to this country willingly? ... Ben, 'Roots.' Watch 'Roots.'" TV personality Star Jones tweeted: "No way in the world he is that friggin ignorant." Using the pile-of-excrement emoji, she called the renowned neurosurgeon "(expletive) for brains." She ended the tweet: "#UncleTom thy name is #BenCarson." Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., insists that Carson's "slave equals immigrant" perspective means he is unqualified to lead HUD because Carson "doesn't know how urgent it is to confront racism" in housing: "It's disturbing to me, and it should be to every American, not just black Americans. ... For him, the HUD secretary, to have a stunning misunderstanding of history like that, is really, really striking. ... And so for the HUD secretary not to get that means that he doesn't know how urgent it is to confront racism and discrimination in housing, which is a very scary thing for the HUD secretary to not understand." Following the uproar, Carson posted this clarification on Facebook: "The slave narrative and immigrant narrative are two entirely different experiences. ... The two experiences should never be intertwined, nor forgotten, as we demand the necessary progress towards an America that's inclusive and provides access to equal opportunity for all." One slight problem. The "insensitive" and "demeaning" slave-equals-immigrant argument was made on a number of occasions by President Barack Obama: "It wasn't always easy for new immigrants," Obama said at a 2015 naturalization ceremony for new citizens. "Certainly it wasn't easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily, and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves. There was discrimination and hardship and poverty. But, like you, they no doubt found inspiration in all those who had come before them. And they were able to muster faith that, here in America, they might build a better life and give their children something more." Even "Daily Show" host Noah admitted, "President Obama said something similar in 2015." But, said Noah, "You could tell before (Obama) said that part he was thinking, 'Damn, my speechwriter f---ed up.'" In fact, according to the Federalist, Obama likened slaves to immigrants on 11 different occasions. "Whether our ancestors landed on Ellis Island," said Obama, "or came here on a slave ship or crossed the Rio Grande, we are all connected to one another. We rise and fall together." Goldberg, Noah, Jackson and Ellison were obviously occupied the 11 times Obama showed he "doesn't know how urgent it is to confront racism." Why the silence over Obama's many slave-equals-immigrant comments versus the desk pounding by the same critics when Carson says the same thing? Carson represents an existential threat to the left. He is deadly to their cause -- a black man, raised in poverty by a hardworking, welfare-abstaining single mom who taught her children to embrace hard work and education. The left believes that blacks are perpetual victims of slavery, Jim Crow and racism. It is vital for the existence of the Democratic Party to convince blacks to vote like victims in need of protection from the racist, sexist retrogrades known as Republicans. So black conservatives like Carson, who argues that welfare creates dependency, who demands choice in K-12 education and who believes hard work wins, must be attacked, marginalized and dismissed as "against their own people."

Devin Wenig, the current president & CEO of eBay has been under pressure from his board to sketch out a presence in emerging markets. | TNN | Updated: Mar 16, 2017, 08.16 AM IST BENGALURU: E-commerce major Flipkart is learnt to have racked up $1 billion in its latest financing round, bringing on board investors like American online auction site eBay, Chinese internet giant Tencent and Microsoft, multiple people in the know told TOI. The latest fund-raise values the Bengaluru-based firm at $11 billion post the investment, these people said. Flipkart's much-anticipated and widely discussed fund-raise, when announced, would come after a slew of valuation markdowns by existing investors in the backdrop of Jeff Bezos-led Amazon snapping at its heels with a gargantuan war chest. The Indian e-tailer was valued at $15.2 billion when it last raised capital from existing investors in July 2015. When completed, the raise will be the largest capital infusion for an Indian internet startup after Flipkart mopped up $1 billion in July of 2014. Flipkart's been on a fundraising trail since last year when it held talks with strategic players like Alibaba and Walmart. However, those discussions did not conclude in a deal. A spokesperson for the San Jose-based eBay said that the company does not comment on rumour or speculation. Microsoft and Tencent did not respond to queries sent by TOI. A spokesperson of Flipkart said, "As a company policy, we do not comment on market speculations." A source said, "There's been talk of eBay India folding up into Flipkart post the investment. Devin Wenig, the current president & CEO of eBay has been under pressure from his board to sketch out a presence in emerging markets and backing Flipkart seems like a viable bet to take. However, the contours of the deal are yet to be detailed." eBay has a small shareholding in Snapdeal, an investment that hasn't worked out and their own India operations never really took off. Coming in even at this valuation holds promise for eBay considering the potential of the Indian e-commerce market is still huge, said another source. PhonePe, Flipkart's payments business, is also separately in talks to raise funds and has held discussions with PayPal, which is subsidiary of eBay, as reported by TOI in its February 8 edition. Kalyan Krishnamurthy, an ex-Tiger Global MD who took over the reins at Flipkart in June last year, is an ex-eBay executive. Flipkart started stabilising its performance under Krishnamurthy as its sales pipped Amazon's during the Diwali season last year, generating interest from a new set of investors after talks failed with Walmart. New York-based Tiger Global is the largest investor in Flipkart, having pumped in $1billion. Sources said an announcement of Flipkart's funding is likely to come soon.The web retailer's shipments and gross merchandise value, or GMV , has also gone up marginally over the past six months. Sources said, along with Myntra and Jabong, the Flipkart group clocked $4 billion in annual GMV run rate compared to $3 billion by Amazon. Online marketplaces earn anywhere between 5% and 15% -depending on a category -as commission from sellers. "Under Krishnamurthy, Flipkart has gone back to shoring up its smartphone sales once again which is helping it gain momentum in monthly gross sales. The likes of Motorola have made a come back to Flipkart due to the sheer volumes it gets from the platform compared to what these brands got on Amazon," said a person directly aware of the developments. Flipkart inched up its share of mobile phones sold online to 51% in October-December last year compared to Amazon which registered a 33% market share, as per Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Interestingly, Alibaba has also firmed up its India plan by putting $177 million in the Noida-based Paytm to build its commerce business setting the stage for a three-legged battle between Flipkart and the global biggies. Industry insiders said the fresh capital will help Flipkart take on Amazon which has been investing heavily behind its Indian business burning at least $80 million monthly here. The e-commerce juggernaut has not only been discounting on its platform but has launched a slew of products like the subscription-based service Prime.

The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January’s gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven’t yet lifted spending. But last month’s sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Coming soon: an app to pay your bar tab NEW YORK — The payment app Qkr backed by Mastercard plans an update that will let bar patrons open, manage and close their tabs. It would all be through the app, so there’s no handing a credit card to a bartender. Restaurants and bars would have to opt in, though, unlike payment apps such as Venmo or Square Cash that let friends settle bills among themselves. Sea pollution research points to microfibers KEY LARGO, Fla. — Researchers say cozy clothes are emerging as a source of plastic that’s increasingly ending up in oceans and possibly contaminating seafood. Microfibers from synthetic fabrics are being found at a much higher rate than the brightly colored plastic spheres the U.S. government banned from rinse-off cosmetic products, the researchers say. The findings suggest that manufacturers of washing machines may need to be targeted next in efforts to reduce plastic waste in oceans. World EU approves proposed AT&T-Time Warner deal BRUSSELS — The European Union has given its blessing to AT&T’s proposed $85 billion purchase of Time Warner, saying that it raises no competition concerns in Europe. The EU’s executive Commission said Wednesday that there are no overlaps between the companies’ activities in the European Economic Area, which includes the 28-nation EU and three other countries. It noted that while AT&T is active in global telecommunications and digital entertainment, it only provides telecommunications services to business customers in the EEA. The deal still needs approval from U.S. regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate .

The latest fund-raise values the Bengaluru-based firm at $11 billion post the investment, these people said. Flipkart's much-anticipated and widely discussed fund-raise, when announced, would come after a slew of valuation markdowns by existing investors in the backdrop of Jeff Bezos-led Amazon snapping at its heels with a gargantuan war chest. The Indian e-tailer was valued at $15.2 billion when it last raised capital from existing investors in July 2015. When completed, the raise will be the largest capital infusion for an Indian internet startup after Flipkart mopped up $1 billion in July of 2014. Flipkart's been on a fund-raising trail since last year when it held talks with strategic players like Alibaba and Walmart. However, those discussions did not conclude in a deal. A spokesperson for the San Jose-based eBay said that the company does not comment on rumour or speculation. Microsoft and Tencent did not respond to queries sent by TOI. A spokesperson of Flipkart said, "As a company policy, we do not comment on market speculations." A source who did not want to be named said, "There's been talk of eBay India folding up into Flipkart post the investment. However, the contours of the deal are yet to be detailed." Kalyan Krishnamurthy, an ex-Tiger Global MD who took over the reins of the company in June last year, is an ex-eBay executive. Flipkart started stabilising its performance under Krishnamurthy as its sales pipped Amazon's during the Diwali season last year, generating interest from a new set of investors after talks failed with Walmart. New York-based Tiger Global is the largest investor in Flipkart, having pumped in $1 billion. Sources said an announcement of Flipkart's funding is likely to come soon. The web retailer's shipments and gross merchandise value, or GMV, has also gone up marginally over the past six months. Sources said, along with Myntra and Jabong, the Flipkart group clocked $4 billion in annual GMV run rate compared to $3 billion by Amazon. Online marketplaces earn anywhere between 5% and 15% - depending on a category - as commission from sellers. Under Krishnamurthy, Flipkart has gone back to shoring up its smartphone sales once again, which is helping it gain momentum in monthly gross sales. "The likes of Motorola have made a comeback to Flipkart due to the sheer volumes it gets from the platform compared to what these brands got on Amazon," said a person directly aware of the developments. Flipkart inched up its share of mobile phones sold online to 51% in October-December last year, compared to Amazon which registered a 33% market share, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

(GME) Stock Is the Next Blockbuster — Time to Sell Microsoft's Game Pass isn't a killer for GameStop, but it's another cut to GME By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 15, 2017, 11:30 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: How to Trade Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NFLX) and Opko Health Inc. (OPK) How to Trade Lululemon Athletica inc. (LULU) Stock After Earnings View All Posts It’s time to face the facts. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is this generation’s Blockbuster. Earlier this month, Xbox manufacturer Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced Game Pass, a Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)-style monthly online video game rental service similar to Sony Corp (ADR)’s (NYSE:SNE) Playstation Now. Source: Shutterstock While Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass by itself is not enough to tank GME stock and put GameStop out of business, it is the latest in a growing trend toward digital downloads and online offerings, and away from GameStop’s bread and butter of video game disks and physical media. Combine this with continued pricing competition from the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), and the future of GameStop’s bottom line is increasingly in jeopardy. Essentially, GME stock is dying the death of a thousand cuts. Click to Enlarge It’s a trend that you can see just by looking at price action for GameStop stock. GME has been in decline for the better part of the past three years. Since November 2013, the stock has shed more than 55%, with losses accelerating since October 2015 when digital downloads began to gain considerable traction with current-generation gamers. While GME stock has found some price support in recent months due to projections of improving physical media sales following the successful launch of Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)’s (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Switch console, one system won’t be enough to same GameStop’s bottom line. And, if you’ve frequented a GameStop lately, you can see the company realizes this fact as well, with pop culture and video game wearables and collectables now lining many shelves in a move reminiscent of mall-based F.Y.E. stores. Despite the declining stock price and threats to GameStop’s bottom line, Wall Street analysts have yet to catch on. According to Thomson/First Call, only four of the 13 brokerage firms following GME stock rate it below a “buy.” Among those four, there is only one “underperform” designation — and even that was a recent development. But the time for more downgrades may be just around the corner for GME stock. GameStop will step into the earnings confessional on Thursday next week. The consensus is expecting a profit of $2.28 per share, down from earnings of $2.40 per share in the same quarter last year. Revenue is seen slipping 11.7% to $3.11 billion. In yet another sign of optimism from the brokerage community, EarningsWhispers.com reports a whisper number of $2.31 per share for GameStop’s fourth quarter. Failure to live up to these elevated expectations could prompt downgrades or price-target cuts that could send GME stock lower. Looking at the rest of GameStop’s sentiment backdrop, it appears that the brokerage community is the last bastion of bullish sentiment. For instance, short sellers are loaded for bear … literally. Following a 2% increase during the most recent reporting period, the number of GameStop shares sold short now stands at roughly 24 million — representing 28% of the stock’s total float.

See Offers Business Posted March 15 Updated March 15 increase font size Retail sales fail to reflect boost in confidence Economists blame delays in tax refund payments for holding back consumer spending in February. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article WASHINGTON — Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January’s gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven’t yet lifted spending. But last month’s sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January’s sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. The Fed announced its third rate hike in 15 months Wednesday. Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans’ finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Barack Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump’s election. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

The company said it has earmarked about $70mln in 2017, which will be used mainly to hike compensation and provide more training for store managers. “While these investments are expected to put pressure on our 2017 earnings, we believe they will strengthen our market share position over time and are positive steps to further support sustainable growth for our shareholders over the long term,” said chief executive Todd Vasos. The company reported sales of US$6.0bn in the fourth quarter, compared to US$5.3bn the same period a year earlier, supported by higher average spend at its stores. Same-store sales grew 1.0%. Net income increased to US$414.2mln, or US$1.49 per share, from US$376.2mln, or US$1.30 per share, the previous year. Analysts had been expecting sales of US$5.97bn and earnings of US$1.41 per share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Dollar General estimates earnings per share (EPS) between US$4.25 and US$4.50 for the year ended 2 February 2018. It reported EPS of $4.43 in the year to 3 February 2017, compared to US$3.95 the prior year. The figures come as Dollar General and its rival Dollar Tree contend with fierce competition from Wal-Mart and Target Corp, which have been discounting heavily to attract customers. In 2015 Wal-Mart also invested US$2.7bn on wages and training, which it claims lifted sales last year and improved its service. Shares in Dollar General rose 1.83% to US$74.14 in early US trading.  » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Fortune - 3 days ago< > Embed Dollar General Is Giving $70 Million in Raises to Its Store Managers 00:45 Dollar General is trying to improve service by giving a big raise to its store managers.

AP An Illinois woman’s body found in a lake Thursday is linked to a nearby house fire that turned deadly earlier in the day, according to authorities. Cristy CampbellGlen Carbon Police Cristy Campbell, 32, was discovered drowned in Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, where an SUV carrying an infant was found submerged at around 6 a.m. on Thursday, according to the St. Louis-Dispatch. A fast-acting paramedic rescued the baby from the vehicle. The 3-month-old was brought to a nearby hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a series of tragic events that left Campbell and an adult male dead. The other person, who has not been identified, died in a fire at Campbell’s home that broke out around 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois. The six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped the fire. Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, according to police. Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said Campbell’s estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for.

Disposable razor blades make rich pickings for shoplifters. They fit into that group of products security experts in retail refer to as “craved”: concealable, removable, available, valued, enjoyed and disposable. Over the years US retailers increasingly have locked them away in glass cabinets — much to the irritation of many genuine customers, too. Dubin launched the business of selling razors because he was fed up of paying for disposable products in a market dominated by a couple of companies, mostly Procter & Gamble’s Gillette brand. The new business would offer its generally male customers easy access to good-quality razors via a subscription service. Dubin cannonballed into this deepening pool of consumer resentment with an amusing 2012 commercial video on YouTube. He has claimed to have done only some improvisational comedy course work but no stand-up. If that is true, it does not show: he touched a collective funny bone while generating demand for his razors. His pitch — the video’s title was “Our Blades Are F***ing Great” — played well to men annoyed by the rising cost and myriad features of disposable blades, and mocked the established brands while claiming to offer better value. Dubin touched a collective funny bone while generating demand The reaction made Dubin instantly famous: his video has so far had 24m views. The Dollar Shave Club’s own website could not cope with the sudden interest and crashed, so surviving this surge of publicity was his team’s next goal. “I have to give our small and relentless team credit for getting us through the days after the video went viral,” says Dubin. “It was a really hectic time.” Though not the first personal care subscription service — New York-based Birchbox launched one for beauty products in 2010 — Dollar Shave Club’s success has spawned an industry of such services. Whereas at the time of Dollar Shave’s launch, subscription services offered a surprise box of items based on what they felt were customers’ preferences, Dubin’s business was different. Dollar Shave sent exactly what was ordered. Initially, customers receive a razor handle and pack of cartridges. Each month thereafter, replacement cartridges arrive at their regular price of $1, $6 or $9. In addition, the company sells so-called “premium” products, such as shave butter and post-shave cream. Its One Wipe Charlies, so named, are designed specifically for men’s needs in the toilet. One of the most important factors in Dollar Shave’s success has been the shift during the past decade to shopping on mobile devices. A surge in the penetration of tablets following the launch of Apple’s iPad in 2010 has also boosted the take-up of subscription services, says Nicholas Micallef at market research house Euromonitor. Indeed, such is the volume of subscription services today that a new industry of comparison sites, such as Mysubscriptionaddiction.com, has sprung up to guide consumers. Replete with reviews and special offers, these sites channel even more web traffic to the subscription sites. Michael Dubin has displayed a sense of purpose that has been shown to be crucial to winning customers over As for Dubin, he did not stop with one video. Another witty skit followed, this time without him as the front man but involving a security guard with a stun gun shooting a customer who complains, albeit mildly, about lack of access to the blades locked away in the shop’s glass cabinets. Dollar Shave Club has not been the only underdog in its sector. In the UK, for example, King of Shaves, a male style and grooming range, started out as a challenger to the conglomerates 24 years ago. But it is Dubin’s connection with his customers via social media that has made the difference for his company. The impact on the industry leaders became noticeable as online sales took off. Market share for Procter & Gamble, owners of the Gillette brand, has hardly grown since 2011. Meanwhile, private-label brands have doubled their share. No brand has matched Dollar Shave Club’s rapid growth during the past seven years, however. Dubin’s 3m subscribers spent a reported $160m last year. Yet Gillette still held 64 per cent of the market at the end of 2015. The global number two, Edgewell, whose brands include Schick and Wilkinson Sword, has about a fifth of Gillette’s share, making it difficult for even a fast-growing near unicorn start-up to compete, at least on its own. Related article How Michael Dubin built Dollar Shave Club into a $1bn company Maverick approach by founder seen in hit YouTube video has changed the way razors are sold Sunday, 19 March, 2017 Dollar Shave Club attracted plenty of attention from venture capitalists. By the end of 2015 it was on its way to a $1bn valuation after raising $90m (up from an initial $75m) during the second half of that year. Eventually, another consumer giant, Anglo-Dutch Unilever, showed an interest. The group, which claims its brands are present in 98 per cent of households in the UK, had one significant gap in its portfolio, namely shaving products. An initial plan to take a stake in Dollar Shave Club turned into a full takeover last July for $1bn — hardly a steal at five times estimated 2016 revenues but reflecting Unilever’s expectations for this most basic of men’s grooming products. From nothing Dollar Shave Club had built a 1 per cent market share in just three years. Indeed, all of the alternative brands — including Dubin’s start-up — took nearly four percentage points of market share from Gillette and Edgewell during that time. The global market for men’s razors and blades is worth $15bn, according to Euromonitor, only about a fifth of which is in the US. At the same time, Unilever was looking to build on what Dubin seems to do almost effortlessly: connect directly to the consumer. For multinationals such as Unilever, the most obvious path to its customers has been via leading retailers such as Walmart. Unilever’s likely strategy will be to take Dollar Shave Club into as many markets as possible, including emerging economies such as Brazil and India, whose shaving products markets together are forecast to expand by $620m over the five years to 2020, according to Euromonitor, representing nearly half of the expected expansion globally. Among the key attractions for investors were Dubin’s irreverent marketing and sense of purpose with his back-to-basics approach. The latter point has been the subject of research by Harvard Business School. In conjunction with consultancy EY, it studied the efforts of 1,349 emerging entrepreneurs (their companies all less than five years old) during the past three decades, concluding that a sense of purpose is crucial to winning customers over. Simply surviving Dollar Shave Club’s early period in business also reflected well on Dubin. So rapid was its initial growth — frenetic weeks of furiously packing boxes to send out on time to customers — that the business could easily have wrecked its reputation just as it was starting out. Dubin’s effective management of early growth is another thing that will have attracted investors, including the multinational that ultimately took it over. Dubin’s gamble was that people would be prepared to pay for his blades in advance. He also felt that a delivery service would add value and convenience for his customers. “It was my idea from the beginning,” he notes when asked about the decision to go with his “SAAS” (shaving as a subscription) approach. Few businesses prosper in the long term by selling a single product Did the predictability of recurring revenues also give the business an advantage? Up to a point, he says, though he admits such revenues were not necessarily predictable. “A lot of entrepreneurs find subscriptions attractive because in theory you have a consistent cash flow,” he says. “But that’s not always sustainable if you’re selling something that people want and don’t need.” In Dollar Shave Club’s case, customers have both wanted and needed its service, and it has not reached that breaking point where customers do not renew subscriptions because they see the product simply as a luxury rather than essential. On Dollar Shave Club’s many imitators, Ken Cassar, principal analyst at online retail consultancy Slice Intelligence, suspects the personal care market is already saturated. “Unless more cost-effective models come up, there’s going to be a shakeout,” he says. Another key to survival is diversification of product lines — few such businesses prosper in the long term by selling a single product. Quite a few razor companies offer other skin care products. Edgewell, for example, bought the popular Bulldog line of men’s skin care products late last year. Dollar Shave Club, then, should find there is mileage in its One Wipe Charlies and other extras. Supported by another comically informative video, Dubin will no doubt be hoping the market backs his latest niche idea.

This bus also stops at the front door of Mission Hospital, saving seniors and others the walk up the steep hill to the hospital. On its way downtown, it stops at the Community Center and Susi Q, which saves participants a walk from Laguna Avenue or the bus terminal. High school students ride this bus, but so do workers, visitors, locals and seniors. It is an important service of the OCTA subsidized Laguna Beach transit system. The Sally’s van picks up many residents who live at Vista Aliso senior housing and takes them to the Susi Q senior center for classes, movies and senior lunch, and goes each week to Trader Joes, the 99 Cent store, Target and Walmart.  These seniors are not getting younger. Using Uber is a joke. The city’s taxi voucher program didn’t work and neither will an Uber program. It is preposterous to think the city would cut back trolley or bus service to the Ritz Carlton and Salt Creek Park because too many people want to go and return to Laguna Beach from that destination. The three trolleys running up to Top of the World, Bluebird Canyon and Arch Beach Heights are running empty or with one or two people on many “loops’. If any service is cut back, it should be this service. Most people who live in these neighborhoods think it’s an expensive joke and a waste of the city and OCTA’S Measure M money, which people voted in favor of in 2005. If you want to find out quickly how bungled the transit management is, try calling the city’s transit number, 497-0746. Like much of city hall, the transit department has seen a constant turnover of managers the past few years. What exactly is going on at our city hall?

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Family member confirms Noah Abbott's body found in California Aqueduct on Thursday Thursday Mar 16, 2017 at 3:56 PM Mar 17, 2017 at 11:49 AM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker HESPERIA — The body of Noah Abbott, who has been presumed dead since March 2, surfaced in the California Aqueduct on Thursday afternoon, according to a family member. The toddler apparently surfaced in the aqueduct south of Farmington Street and 7th Avenue in Hesperia, giving his family closure a day before they were scheduled to hold a celebration of life. San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department officials on scene acknowledged a body was found, but said they couldn't provide more details. However, Natalia Garcia, who is a cousin of the Abbott family, told the Daily Press the toddler was found Thursday afternoon.  In a statement released later that day, Sheriff's officials said dive team members recovered the body of a toddler "believed to be Noah Abbott" at 12:01 p.m. Thursday. "The Coroner's Office responded to the location and took possession of the victim," Sheriff's officials said. "Scientific positive identification is pending and will be determined by the Coroner's Office." The 2-year-old had been missing and presumed dead since the single-vehicle crash that claimed the lives of his brother Jeremiah Abbott, 3, and their mother Christina Eileen Estrada, 31, two weeks ago when their red Volkswagen convertible went through a fence on Main Street and plunged into the California Aqueduct. The celebration for Estrada and her two boys is expected to be held at Abundant Living Family Church, located at 17555 Mauna Loa Street, at 11 a.m. Friday. The public is invited to attend. Noah's brother Elijah Estrada, 10, was the lone survivor of the crash. Elijah was pulled from the water by Dustin and Rod DeYoung, who were driving by when they saw the Volkswagen crash into the aqueduct. Elijah was transported to Loma Linda University Medical Center and suffered a gash on his head, authorities said, while Estrada was pronounced dead at the scene after emergency personnel pulled her from the water. Emergency personnel also pulled Jeremiah from the water and transported him to Desert Valley Hospital. He was pronounced dead in the emergency department. Sheriff's officials on Tuesday said that deputies and volunteers from the Hesperia Sheriff’s Station continue monitoring the recovery area along the aqueduct, after responding to a report that something had been spotted floating in the aqueduct near Mesquite Street. But authorities confirmed it to be debris and nothing else was found during an aerial check. Sheriff’s personnel and volunteers, along with community members and aqueduct employees, had monitored a 7-mile stretch of the California Aqueduct, from the scene of the crash to south of a pump station, south of Summit Valley Road, since the March 2 crash. Community members organized a sight search last week and had dozens of people meet in the parking lot of Wal-Mart in Hesperia to take part in a sight search for Noah's body. The search was organized by several residents who have been following the story waiting to hear if "baby Noah" had been found. The sight search took several large groups of people to various points along the aqueduct. The organizers thought of the idea after authorities concluded the search due to zero visibility and unsafe water conditions for Sheriff’s dive team members. The dive team had been on standby in the event Noah’s body is found in the waters. The dive team searched the aqueduct for Noah from an area just north of the crash scene to roughly two miles south of Main Street. The team searched the aqueduct for Noah the night of the crash and also two days after. But their efforts were suspended due to darkness and low visibility. The search resumed the morning after the crash when authorities stopped the flow of a portion of the California Aqueduct. Sheriff's officials say there are no updates to their ongoing investigation into the crash and do not have a time frame for the completion.

Mecklenburg County jail i By Joe Marusak and Maria David jmarusak@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A former Civil Air Patrol cadet program volunteer in Charlotte was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison for molesting boys under his watch. David Greenberg, 35, of Charlotte, entered a guilty plea in Mecklenburg County Superior Court on Friday to two counts each of statutory sex offense with a minor and indecent liberties with a child and 10 counts of third-degree sexual exploitation of a minor, the Mecklenburg County District Attorney’s Office said. On Tuesday, Greenberg was found guilty in Cabarrus County Superior Court on two counts of felony indecent liberties with a child, court records show. The cases are tied to Greenberg’s former volunteer role with the cadet program, multiple media outlets reported when he was arrested on the Cabarrus charges in July 2016. He was arrested on the Mecklenburg charges in November, jail records show. The Civil Air Patrol is the civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force and helps with searches and rescues, disaster relief and aerospace public education. The mother of a 12-year-old boy told a Mecklenburg judge last week that Greenberg stole her son’s childhood by repeatedly sexually assaulting him over nine years and videotaping some of the attacks, WSOC-TV reported. “How could I not have seen this monster lurking inside this (man), and worse, how could I let my son be accessible to this man?” the mother asked, according to the station. “There were videos and pictures that should never have been seen by anyone, disgusting, immoral, depraved images. But the worst hit was finding that Greenberg would make my son watch those videos with him.” “I don’t expect forgiveness, because I know I will never forgive myself,” Greenberg said in court, WSOC-TV reported. In Cabarrus County, Greenberg was convicted of sexually assaulting two 14-year-olds. Both belonged to the cadet program Greenberg helped lead, the (Concord) Independent Tribune reported, citing court documents. Greenberg sexually assaulted one of the boys after returning to Cabarrus from the Carowinds theme park, Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Detective April Samples said in a search warrant affidavit, the newspaper reported. At Carowinds, Greenberg asked the boy to change clothes in a stall with him, according to the affidavit. When the youth declined, Greenberg offered him $50 and eventually $500, before the teen darted into numerous other stalls to get away from him. Greenberg also touched the teen about 10 times while waiting in line for rides, mostly around the teen’s chest and nipple, the Independent Tribune reported. In the car later, Greenberg insisted on playing “the nervous game,” where one person touches the other person’s leg, slowly moving up the thigh until they get nervous and say “stop,” according to the affidavit. Greenberg kept touching the teen’s leg when the teen said he didn’t want to play. They also stopped at a Walmart near Concord Mills mall for lotion for the teen’s sunburn, the affidavit said. “Greenberg kept trying to put the (lotion) on him and had him take his shirt off to do so, even though (the victim) wanted to wait until he got home to do so,” the affidavit said. “While this was happening, (the victim) believes that Greenberg was taking pictures of him. Also on the way home, Greenberg continued to grab (the victim’s) hand, trying to put it in his groin region. Greenberg then tried to get (the victim) to sleep over that night.” The second victim told investigators that Greenberg tickled him several times during his years in the cadet program. According to the affidavit, Greenberg asked him to send pictures of himself without a shirt or pants, the Independent Tribune reported.

Don't get discouraged. There are more than a few ways to save money on a trip to Disney World. From the time you book your tickets to the last fireworks show of your last day, here are tips you can use to make your trip more affordable. [See: 12 Frugal Ways to Save on Vacation.] 1. Visit in the off-season. When you're planning your trip, try to visit in the off-season. For Walt Disney World, that falls during late August, September and January. While theme park tickets are more of a challenge to find at a reduced rate, accommodations will be more affordable during these times. Late August and September is the back-to-school season, so if you have younger children, or aren't traveling with kids at all, this is a great time to visit. You'll find smaller crowds, more available dinner reservations and lower rates at hotels on Disney property. 2. Consider your priorities. Before you book a trip to Disney World, decide on the priorities of your trip. Are you looking for a chance to have a weeklong vacation with a stop at every theme park? Consider off-resort accommodations, but enjoy the perk of lower priced tickets (the longer you stay, the less you pay per day). Or is your family more interested in staying at a Disney hotel? Look into the lowest-priced "value" hotels and a budget-friendly meal plan. By deciding on the goals of your vacation first, you can plan where to splurge and where to save. If you're traveling in from out of town, it's very tempting to stay at a Disney resort. Not only is it convenient, with free shuttles running to and from the parks all day and plenty of dining options, but it seems like you're really part of the "magic" of Disney when you stay on property. However, there are a lot of options for those who are open to staying off property. If you are traveling in a large group, renting a vacation home will almost certainly be much easier on your wallet. Plus, you can share expenses, such as the cost of parking at the theme park, groceries and a rental vehicle, if needed. Keep in mind that Disney does offer a free transportation service, so taking advantage of that will save you a lot of money as well -- just make sure to look into pick-up and drop-off locations well in advance. [See: 10 Creative Ways to Cut Costs This Winter.] 3. Choose your meals wisely. You can purchase one of Disney's dining plans if you are staying at a Walt Disney World resort. They offer a quick-service, regular or deluxe dining plan. Consider your group or family's dietary preferences to figure out which plan might work best. There are a few simple strategies that you can use to save money on food during your trip. Eating breakfast at your vacation rental or hotel room can save you a lot of money in the long run -- coffee, fruit, milk, cereal and energy bars are inexpensive and can be stored in a small minifridge. This way, you can avoid the cost of theme park food for one meal of the day and save any dining plan meals for later in the day. Pack snacks and water bottles to keep you hydrated and full throughout the day. This can cut costs considerably over the course of your trip. [See: 12 Habits of Phenomenally Frugal Families.] 4. A few other tips. You don't have to do the Disney PhotoPass. Professional photos are nice, but not necessary, and the packages and prints are quite costly. You can always ask a Disney World employee to snap a photo of you and your group with your own camera. After you return home, order prints at Wal-Mart or Target for a fraction of the price. If you are a frequent traveler to Disney parks, you may want to open a Disney Rewards Visa card. The rewards you earn from everyday spending can be redeemed at Disney locations and stores. Before opening a new credit card, check your credit score and credit health and make sure it's a smart move financially. Lastly, buy souvenirs and gifts off-resort. You can save so much money by avoiding premium theme park prices. Plus, purchasing these items online allows you to use coupon codes and click through a cash back shopping website first. Now you're ready to book your next frugal Walt Disney World vacation.

Debra Clayton in January. By Faith Karimi and Eric Levenson CNN (CNN) -- The Florida state attorney expected to prosecute the murder trial of Markeith Loyd was removed from the case by Gov. Rick Scott on Thursday afternoon after refusing to seek the death penalty in the case. Aramis Ayala, the state attorney for the 9th Judicial Circuit Court of Florida, said earlier Thursday that her office would not seek the death penalty in any cases. Loyd faces 11 counts, including murder and firearm charges, for allegedly killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon and Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton. Loyd's arrest followed an extensive manhunt. He was captured January 17. Ayala's decision not to seek the death penalty for Loyd sparked immediate criticism from several Florida leaders, including Orlando Police Chief John Minda, who said he was "extremely upset" by it. Scott called on Ayala to recuse herself from the case midday Thursday. After she refused, Scott reassigned Loyd's case to 5th Circuit State Attorney Brad King, he said in a statement. "[Ayala] has made it clear that she will not fight for justice and that is why I am using my executive authority to immediately reassign the case to State Attorney Brad King," Scott said. "These families deserve a state attorney who will aggressively prosecute Markeith Loyd to the fullest extent of the law and justice must be served." Earlier Thursday, Ayala said capital punishment in Florida had led to "chaos, uncertainty, and turmoil." She argued that evidence showed the death penalty was overly expensive, slow, inhumane and did not increase public safety. Ayala said after "extensive and painstaking thought and consideration," she determined that pursing the death penalty "is not in the best interest of this community or the best interest of justice." "Some victims will support and some will surely oppose my decision," she said. "But I have learned that the death penalty traps many victims, families in a decadeslong cycle of uncertainty, court hearings, appeals and waiting." Capital punishment has been in limbo in Florida recently. The US Supreme Court ruled in January 2016 that the state's death penalty process was unconstitutional, and the state's high court ruled against a proposed fix to that law late last year. On Tuesday, the governor signed a new death penalty bill, which was crafted to stand up to those legal challenges. Several organizations sided with Ayala. "Today's announcement is on the right side of history as momentum against the death penalty in the United States continues to build," Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement. Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., said Ayala's "acknowledgment that the death penalty system is irreparably broken puts her at the forefront of smart-on-crime prosecutors," according to a statement. The stance is significant because Orange County, where Ayala is a chief prosecutor, is among four of Florida's 67 counties that has produced more than five executions since 1976, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said. The county is also among 10 Florida counties that together account for half the state's death row population, the organization said. Backlash to the decision "I have seen the video of Markeith Loyd executing Lt. Debra Clayton while she lay defenseless on the ground," Mina said. "She was given no chance to live. A cop killer -- who also killed his pregnant girlfriend -- should not be given that chance. The heinous crimes that he committed in our community are the very reason we have the death penalty as an option under the law." Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since her fatal shooting at an Orlando residence. Clayton received word January 9 that Loyd was near a Walmart and tried to confront him. Mina said the suspect "basically opened fire on" Clayton as soon as she told him to stop and continued to shoot even after she was down. State Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican, said it "sends a dangerous message" not to seek the death penalty. "It is a blatant neglect of duty and a shameful failure to follow the law as a constitutionally elected officer," Bondi said. Shawn Dunlap, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Orlando Lodge 25, slammed the decision as an "epic injustice." "The death penalty is the law of the land in the state of Florida, and I believe that if there ever was a case for its use this would be the one," Dunlap said. Charges dropped against 2 accused accessories Charges of acting as accessories after the fact against Zarghee Mayan and Jameis Slaughter were dropped, according to a review of an Orange County court docket. Authorities said Mayan did not contact officials after meeting with Loyd, who allegedly told him he had killed Dixon. Slaughter was accused of collecting money to give to Loyd, a former boyfriend, while police were searching for him, authorities said. The court filing said the case is not suitable for prosecution. Slaughter still faces a misdemeanor charge of giving police false information. She's accused of lying about her communication with Loyd while he was on the run. Trials set When asked to enter a plea this month, Loyd responded: "For the record, I want to state that I am Markeith Loyd. Flesh and blood. I'm a human being. I'm not a fictitious person. I'm not a corporation," he said. Chief Judge Frederick J. Lauten entered a not guilty plea on Loyd's behalf. Loyd had a series of verbal outbursts when he questioned why the court placed charges against him. Court documents indicate Loyd has not been diagnosed with a mental issue, has 10 years' worth of schooling and has a GED certificate. A pretrial hearing for the Dixon case is set for April 17, Lauten said. Jury selection for that trial will begin on May 1. The case is expected to last about two weeks. On June 19, Loyd will stand trial, accused of killing Clayton. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for June 12. The next status hearing is scheduled for Monday.
