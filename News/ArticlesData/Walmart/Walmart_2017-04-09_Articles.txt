(Published Sunday, April 9, 2017) Fresh Express recalled some of its prepackaged salad mix after a dead bat was found inside a bag sold in a Florida Walmart, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The company on Saturday announced a recall of a limited quantity of its 5-ounce Organic Marketside Spring Mix packages. The salads were sold in a clear container with production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of April 14, 2017. The announcement said the recalled packages were only distributed to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States.

As a precaution, the pair who ate the salad were recommended to undergo rabies treatment. However, the CDC said transmission of the disease by eating a rabid animal is "extremely uncommon."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two customers had eaten some of the product before finding the decomposed creature in a 5-ounce clear container. On Saturday, Fresh Express issued a recall of the products that were sold in a clear plastic container.  Fresh Express announced a recall of a "limited distribution" of its prepackaged Organic Marketside Spring Mix, after two people from Florida found a bat in one container The production code was G089B19 and it had a best-if-used-by-date of April 14 on the front label.  'Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation and initiate product removal and recall procedures,' Fresh Express said.  CDC officials said the salads were only distributed to Walmart stores in the Southeast.  'Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease. The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies,' the CDC said on its website.  The CDC said transmission of rabies by eating a rabid animal is uncommon and the virus doesn't live long outside of the infected animal, but anyone who thinks they may have eaten one of the salads that had animal products should contact their local health departments.

Health officials said anyone who purchased one of the salads should return it to the place of purchase. These salads went to Walmart stores in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia as well as Florida.

This ended up as a case for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because bats can carry rabies. The dead bat was found inside a container of Fresh Express Organic Marketside Spring Mix in Florida. The carcass was sent to the CDC for testing to see if it had rabies, but the bat was too deteriorated to rule out the disease. Despite the CDC claiming the consumers’ risk for contracting rabies was extremely low, the two people who ate the salad were recommended to undergo treatment for rabies. While the risk was low, it was not at zero, according to the report from CNN News. The packages of Fresh Express salad mix involved were recalled by the company. They were sold at Walmart stores in several states, which include Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. According to the CDC, the people are fine and show no sign of contracting rabies. Fresh Express Salad Recall The salad that is recalled has the production code G089B19 and a best-if-used-by date of April 14, 2017 on the front label of the container. It also has the UPC code 6 8113132897 5 on the bottom of the container. It was out of an abundance of caution that the Fresh Express people recalled the entire batch. Fresh Express released a statement which included: “Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation and initiate product removal and recall procedures.” According to the report from NPR News, the recall of the salad batch was announced on Saturday. The CDC reported that the two consumers had eaten some of the salad before noticing the “decomposed organism in a 5-ounce clear container of the Organic Marketside Spring Mix,” reports NPR. It was only out of an abundance of caution that Fresh Express recalled all Organic Marketside Spring Mix salads from the same production lot. The product was distributed “exclusively to Walmart stores.” Walmart has pulled the salad containers involved in the recall from their shelves. There are no other Marketside salads that are involved in this recall. An investigation into the matter is underway by the FDA and CDC in tandem. Despite many believing that bats are notorious for carrying rabies, according to Bat World.org, “bats contact rabies far less than other animals.” The statistics indicate that “less than 1/2 of 1% of all bats may contract the disease.” Bat World discussed many of the fallacies people have come to believe about bats through the years. One of those fallacies was that you can catch rabies from being near a bat with the disease, which is not true. You can’t catch rabies just from being near a rabid bat, as this disease is nearly always transmitted through a bite. According to Bat World, “although rare, exposures can also occur from contact between infected saliva or nervous tissues and open wounds or the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth.” This is more than likely why the CDC put the risk of contracting rabies very low for the two consumers who ate the salad. While it is thought by many that “hundreds of people die of bat rabies each year in the U.S.,” statistics show that there are only one to two humans that die from this yearly in this nation. Worldwide 300,000 people die from rabies every year and most contract rabies via a rabid dog. Due to the success of the rabies vaccination for pets in the U.S., contracting rabies from dogs and cats are rare in this country.

Chris Lee TNS Fresh Express recalled its Organic Marketside Spring Mix from Walmart stores in the Southeastern United States Saturday. 1 of 2 i By David J. Neal dneal@miamiherald.com Fresh Express recalled its Organic Marketside Spring Mix from Walmart stores in the Southeastern United States Saturday because a dead bat was found in a packaged salad in Florida. As the U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s recall chart notes, if there’s the possibility of bat body parts, there’s a “minimal risk of rabies contamination.” The CDC says it’s working with the FDA and the Florida’ Department of Health to investigate situation. While Fresh Express’ recall notice tiptoes around the batness — “Fresh Express was notified that extraneous animal matter was allegedly found in a single container of the salad” — the Centers for Disease Control indulges no such subtlety on its website: “Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease. The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies.” The CDC did say the risk of rabies transmission in this is very low, but not zero so the organization recommended the two eaters of the too-organic salad begin treatment as if they’d been exposed to rabies. Both report good health so far, according to the CDC. As for the recalled product, it comes in a five-ounce, clear container. The Best By date is Apr. 14, 2017 with production code G089B19. Customers can toss it or return it to the Walmart of purchase. Those with any questions can call the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center 1-800-242-5472 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time. These salads went to Walmart stores in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia as well as Florida. But only Florida’s managed to pull a bat out of the salad hat. David J.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 April 2017 by Military News Top WBENC Consumer Companies Join Together for the First Time in Collective Initiative to Source from Women-Owned Businesses BENTONVILLE, Ark., Mar. 30 /CSRwire/ – Walmart announced today that they are one of nine corporations joining in a collaborative effort to track and report sourcing from self-identified and certified women-owned businesses (WOBs) over the next five years. This marks the first time the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the largest third-party certifier of businesses owned, controlled and operated by women in the U.S., will launch a formal initiative to publicly report aggregated spending on WOBs. Walmart helped form this unified front of major corporations, including Campbell Soup Company, The Coca-Cola Company, ExxonMobil, General Mills, Johnson & Johnson, Mondelēz International, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, in order to create a more visible movement and raise awareness for the importance of sourcing from women-owned businesses. Walmart made the announcement on behalf of the other companies involved and WBENC at Walmart’s Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) Summit in Washington, D.C., a convening of leaders from business, government, NGOs and academia to discuss and celebrate the achievements of women’s empowerment. “Creating economic opportunity and growth is central to who we are as a company,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. “We are proud to be part of this important initiative, and together we can make an even bigger impact in elevating these successful women-owned businesses. Our customers care where products are sourced, and we believe supporting women-owned businesses helps us put innovative products on our shelves while helping these businesses thrive and grow.” “Campbell is proud to join this collaborative effort in order to raise awareness and foster more opportunities for female business owners,” said Denise Morrison, president and CEO, Campbell Soup Company. “One of the core values of our company is to ‘seek the power of different’ and we are committed to assemble a supplier base that reflects the diversity of the consumers and communities we serve.” “Empowering women entrepreneurs and women-owned firms is smart business and smart economics,” said Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. “Whenever you do the right thing and give businesswomen a real opportunity to compete, this creates a positive ripple effect that allows her to strengthen her company, her family and her community. And stronger families and communities help fuel more growth and opportunity.” “Women and minority-owned businesses are critical to both their communities and our company as they spur economic development and drive growth,” said Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz International. “We are proud to support this important initiative, as we continue to strive for inclusion and diversity in our company and women’s empowerment around the world.” „Supporting women-owned businesses and diversity across our suppliers is central to who we are at PepsiCo,” said Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. “Our commitment to diversity is not only a source of pride, it is a source of strength. And it’s part of our broader commitment to what we call Performance with Purpose, our approach to building a healthier, sustainable future for all our stakeholders — from our suppliers to our shareholders to our consumers, customers, employees, and the communities we serve.” „P&G is committed to Gender Equality,” said Carolyn Tastad, group president of P&G’s North America business. „Supplier Diversity has been an important business strategy at P&G in the United States for more than 40 years. We are proud to join this initiative to empower women-owned businesses, as we believe in the power of economic inclusion. When the ownership of our supply base reflects the diversity of our employees, consumers, and stakeholders, our business grows and our community thrives.” “By participating in this initiative, these companies will help fuel innovation and growth for women-owned businesses across the U.S.,” said Pamela Prince-Eason, president and CEO of WBENC. “With women-owned businesses currently supporting the creation or maintenance of 23 million American jobs, investing in their growth means investing in more opportunities for the workforce overall.” The initiative comes at a critical time when women entrepreneurs across a range of countries report having smaller and less diverse networks, leaving them at a disadvantage for growth, innovation and ability to be relevant to a global market (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor). Walmart helped to recruit this initial group of corporations to take part in this initiative and is encouraging others to join as well. This announcement comes on the heels of the culmination of Walmart’s five-year Global WEE Initiative, which included a set of goals to help empower women around the world through sourcing, training and supporting diversity and inclusion. As part of the WEE Initiative, Walmart sourced $20 billion from women-owned businesses in the U.S. and increased sourcing from women-owned businesses internationally. Additionally, in 2014, working with WBENC and WEConnect International, a global network that connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers around the world, Walmart helped fund the creation of the “Women-Owned” logo which can be used by any woman-owned supplier certified by those organizations at any retailer to highlight their products to consumers. Today, Walmart has more than 1,500 suppliers who identify as women-owned businesses, producing everything from apparel to produce. In addition to participating in this collective initiative, Walmart announced plans to launch a Knowledge Center that will house the key tools, resources, learnings and achievements of the WEE Initiative and help serve as a guide for any company or institution in their work to empower women.

Meanwhile, authorities continue to search for those responsible. The blaze occurred at the Wal-Mart at 20251 Highway 18 in Apple Valley and was quickly extinguished early Sunday. Apple Valley Fire Protection District officials said the fire was being investigated as arson, with fire investigators “working closely” with the Sheriff’s Department and “exhausting all leads." Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station spokeswoman Trish Hill told the Daily Press the Sheriff’s Bomb and Arson detail continues to investigate. She said three suspects, two men and a woman, were believed to be responsible. “It’s believed they started the fire to distract Wal-Mart employees in order to take items from the store,” said Hill, who added no merchandise appeared to be taken. The store was quickly closed Sunday morning and has remained closed since the fire. There was “significant smoke damage” to the store, according to a spokesman with Wal-Mart’s media relations team, and the length of the closure remains unknown. A Wal-Mart employee reached by phone Thursday afternoon said that pharmacy customers were "being taken care of," but that the rest of the store remained closed.

The store is in the 12700 block of Moreno Beach Drive in Moreno Valley. The fire, which reportedly began in the clothing section of the store, sent some shoppers scrambling out of the business. While store employees called 911 to report the fire and began evacuating the store, one Wal-Mart employee took charge of the situation and battled the small, but growing blaze with one of the store’s fire extinguishers. After the fire was reported, emergency first responders from multiple agencies rushed to the Wal-Mart just after 10 a.m. Twenty-five firefighters from six engine companies and one truck company from Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire and City of Moreno Valley Fire Departments responded to the reported blaze, according to Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire spokeswoman Jody Hagemann. They were later assisted by Riverside County Environmental Health officials. Authorities began arriving at the store within minutes of the initially dispatched call. “The first arriving company officer reported clothing on fire inside the store that was extinguished via fire extinguisher by an employee,” Hagemann explained. “All employees and patrons safely evacuated the structure prior to fire department arrival.” The employee who helped put out the fire, who was not identified, was transported to an area hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation and asthma-related symptoms. Thanks at least in large part to the fast actions of the employee who extinguished the fire, there were no other injuries reported from citizens or emergency personnel. Fire resources remained at the scene for about one hour and the store was temporarily closed after the incident to allow employees time to remove the charred debris, clean the store and quickly re-stock the shelves. The store reopened several hours later, about 3 p.m. Although many shoppers fled the store immediately after the first sign of fire, one frustrated Wal-Mart employee – who declined to be identified – later described how after the fire broke out some guests ignored the obvious fire danger and continued shopping as if nothing was happening. According to the employee, some other guests used the opportunity as a chance to shoplift from the store, while employees were distracted by dealing with the fire and trying to evacuate shoppers; some of whom had to be convinced or even told to leave the store. After the fire started, “many customers continued shopping and their daily business as if nothing was wrong,” the employee said. “Neglecting their own safety, they saw the fire and mandatory evacuation as an inconvenience. Only at the insistence of store employees and management did the shoppers leave their selections behind.” The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to Hagemann, who estimated the loss to be about $10,000 in product and property damage.

When the evacuation of the store began, customers continued shopping and their daily business as if nothing was wrong. Neglecting their own safety, they saw the fire and mandatory evacuation as an inconvenience and prime opportunity to try to shoplift. Only at the insistence of store employees and management did the shoppers leave their selections behind. The store re-opened at approximately 3:00 PM after employees rapidly cleaned and re-stocked the shelves. Reply Trevor Montgomery   April 8, 2017 at 7:14 pm Thank you for providing a first-hand accounting of this incident. I am glad you are OK and that nobody was injured. -TM Reply Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Levy My Other Blogs You are here: Home » General » Simplistic Solutions to Organized Labor’s Problems Simplistic Solutions to Organized Labor’s Problems [ 10 ] April 8, 2017 | Erik Loomis If you want to get published, a real good way is to write yet another version of “labor unions are doing it wrong. They should ORGANIZE and listen to REAL WORKERS instead of PLAYING POLITICS and DOING THE SAME OLD THINGS.” These articles come out all the time. Virtually all have some level of truth in them. Unions often do a lot of things wrong. But they inevitably make broad statements that erase all the complexity from the problems the labor movement faces while asserting a potential for working-class power that probably isn’t there in the way these writers want. There’s a new piece along these lines from Dan Schlademan, the co-director of a group called Organization United for Respect, a group made up of grocery store employees organizing in that industry. So you have to respect the work and I do not mean to say anything negative about that. But this is a good time to critique some of the arguments routinely made on the labor left, because a lot of them are really problematic. Working people in this country can not and should not underestimate their power. History, as well as emerging movements and organizations, show that working people are not facing a question of life or death. Rather, they are facing the opportunity for renewal. The US labor movement has reinvented itself repeatedly in the past. These rebirths have been crucial to the evolution of the movement’s power. We are now at another historical moment of rebirth. But it’s important to understand how we arrived here, so to best take advantage of the opportunity ahead. Given the Trump OSHA and EPA though, workers are literally facing a question of life or death. The Trump administration is not an opportunity for renewal. There’s no silver lining here. Yes, the labor movement writ large is not going away. Workers will always fight to improve their lives, or at least some workers will. But I really struggle calling the likelihood of Friedrichs II and right to work laws sweeping any state Republicans take over an “opportunity.” Today, too many people—inside the labor movement and out—wax nostalgic about mid-1950s movements that are still dominant in 2017. It’s understandable: union membership was over 30% of the workforce, GM workers were able to buy the cars they built, and the modern American Dream—where working hard meant getting ahead—emerged. In this period, unions played a huge role building the middle class and making America strong. But changes to global trade policies, technology, and the rise of other forces, like automation, mean that the organizations that thrived in 1955 are not necessarily equipped to build power for working people today. This is true. Emerging worker movements are winning hard fought victories with the painful recognition that the same methods for organizing don’t work inside America’s broken system of laws and traditions. New, emergent forms of organizing are gaining power despite the fact that corporations have unprecedented control over workplaces, politics, laws, and the economy. From OUR Walmart to the Fight for $15, National Domestic Workers Alliance, Restaurant Opportunities Center, the Better Banks Campaign, New York Taxi Workers Alliance, and the Freelancers Union, new forms of worker organizations are winning better pay and scheduling practices at major corporations. They’re providing access to benefits and services by using economies of scale. And they’re securing stronger public policy, winning paid sick days and higher minimum wages for entire communities. I would call all of this exceptions to the horrible things happening to American workers rather than a new model that is gaining power. Are these workers gaining power? Are they really winning? These movements have put the minimum wage back on the table and shown that raising it is a popular move, even in conservative states. All of these groups do really good and important work, but there’s little evidence that this is a model of the future per se. These models show that organizers must not be afraid of being catalysts that help workers build independent organizations and experiment. The decision about forming an organization can’t be left up to the government or employers. The presence of workers ready to initiate organization building should be the only prerequisite necessary for an organization to exist. Workers and organizers must also remember that who gets elected, and what they do in once in office, is a reflection of their power; until they build independent power, they will continue to lose. Some of the resources currently focused on politics needs to be focused instead on building organizations that give working people a voice, community, and vision for change, first. So this is a really common refrain on the labor left. Unions should stop with the politics and organize. The problem with this is that it’s totally disconnected from the reality of when and why unions succeed in this country. No, the decision on forming an organization can’t be left up to employers or the government, but giving up on the National Labor Relations Act is hardly a strategy, as limited as the NLRA is today. And it certainly may be that we need worker organizations that are not really unions so that they can operate outside the NLRA. But ultimately, those organizations are hard to run, they face enormous challenges that range from a lack of resources to the need for constant leadership building given the reliance on local people to do all the work. In reality, these are big tasks. Moreover, to give workers a voice, they need to have political power. The most important factor in the success or failure of the American labor movement is something that the labor left hates to hear. It’s not about organizing. It’s not about militancy. It’s not about worker activism. It’s not about radical union leadership. Through the whole history of American labor, the key deciding factor has been the position government takes in a strike or to labor’s demands. There has simply been very few strikes or other victories in American history where labor has succeeded in the face of the complete opposition of government. The Gilded Age provides the most prominent examples of this, not so much because of Pullman and Homestead and the Great Railroad Strike, but because the two big victories of the period–the Anthracite Strike and Cripple Creek–happened precisely because the government made exceptions to their usual anti-labor politics, with Theodore Roosevelt mediating the former and a Populist governor openly taking the side of the miners in the latter. Yes, the Memphis sanitation strike won in 1968 with the Memphis government in total opposition, but that required the death of Martin Luther King and AFSCME couldn’t even build on that in Atlanta less than a decade later when Maynard Jackson decided to side with the city’s business elites over the workers. Moreover, unions’ success not only required unprecedented interventions from the federal government (which would not have happened had workers not struck across the nation in the early 1930s) but their decline coincides with a newly hostile federal government that is most associated with Reagan destroying the air traffic controllers, but really began during the Carter administration. Unions do need to do more than just play the political game. But the political game is absolutely vital to any union victories. There is no way around this. We have well more than a century’s worth of evidence on this point. United for Respect @ Walmart (OUR Walmart) has been working on these issues since 2010. Worker-leaders choose not to wait for the government or Walmart to decide if it had the right to exist. The organization exists because Walmart workers decided to build it into a network of more than 100,000, who, in coalition with communities and allies, created pressure on Walmart sufficient to raise minimum pay, change national policies, and win thousands of store-level victories. By necessity, the organization has focused on developing new forms of building power. While the results may look unfamiliar to traditional labor unions, to date OUR Walmart is both resilient and on the route to building long-term sustainability. OUR Walmart was largely put together and funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers, even though that union has mostly pulled out of it. The Fight for $15 is a project of SEIU. Its not an either/or here. The problem though, as evinced by the UFCW turn away from it, is that these projects are incredibly expensive and there is very little chance of a pay off in terms of union dues. SEIU is facing this now with the fast food workers. When will this pay off? You might say that organizing should happen without worrying about this. But these organizations not only owe their current members proper representation, but if you have a declining membership, you need to focus on keeping your organization alive. Moreover, this supposedly alternative model required traditional unions already doing things that were nontraditional to get off the ground. Without UFCW support, Our Walmart has basically done nothing. Maybe it is resilient in the sense that a few people are still trying. And that’s great! But neither is Our Walmart some sort of alternative to unions that demonstrates that if unions QUIT PLAYING POLITICS AND ORGANIZE!!! that a new labor movement will flower. The essay concludes with an odd point: We live in an era where the opportunity to bring people together is in transformation, thanks to continued technological developments that allow for the democratization of connection, information, and media. We also live in a time when poverty and inequality are destroying the fabric of America and the world. We know that the labor movement won’t survive in its current state—a state that allowed for the election of Donald Trump. The question for those of us invested in the future of labor is this: Are we bold enough to build something different, and better, than what has come before? Social media is a great thing. But social media is not going to organize the working class. Period. If capitalist technologies that are easily monitored by the bosses and where infiltrators and provocateurs can easily screw up these campaigns is the great alternative to stodgy unions, we have a long ways to go to recreate the labor movement. The people struggling to fight for the rights of themselves and their fellow workers are heroes. The people keeping Our Walmart going are doing necessary and incredibly difficult work. But that doesn’t mean we can allow for simplistic narratives about the future of the labor movement or the problems of the contemporary labor movement to dominate our thoughts about working class movements. I know we all like a clear narrative that diagnoses problems and suggests solutions without muddying the waters too much. This is how you get published and these are the books that sell. But not facing the problems with our own narratives doesn’t help us overcome the huge obstacles anyone fighting for working class power faces.

Log in to Reply Murc says: April 8, 2017 at 9:02 pm So this is a really common refrain on the labor left. Unions should stop with the politics and organize. The problem with this is that it’s totally disconnected from the reality of when and why unions succeed in this country. Mmm… maybe there’s more to it than that? I mean, you clearly know a hell of a lot more about this sort of thing than I, Erik, but while a large part of this is clearly “if only we get all the politics out of politics” wishing for a unicorn, I have to wonder if there’s more at work there. And to be specific… politics is deeply polarizing, by which I mean deeply tribal. If unions want to wield political power, that means engaging with one of the two current political coalitions currently existing in this country, and realistically that means engaging with only one of them: the Democrats. And there are a shit-ton of people who wouldn’t politically engage with the Democrats if they were literally on fire and the Democrats were standing there with a bucket of water. My mom did union work for the teacher’s union here in New York for awhile before she became an administrator. Most of the membership recognized that it had damn well better be involved with the Democratic Party… but, well, a lot of these teachers skewed older, white, and suburban, which means there were a non-trivial number of conservatives and Republicans in it. And they were a constant, unending problem; it offended them, on a deep and incandescent level, that were “forced” to be part of an organization they viewed as an appendage of the tribe they hated. They liked the things the union could give them, they just loathed the Democrats. Basically they wanted the union, they just didn’t want the politics the union necessitated, and because of they were a millstone. I have to wonder if some of the “lets stop with the politics” rhetoric comes from people eager to avoid that problem, or from alt-left types who don’t understand why all this culture war nonsense is infecting the glorious class struggle. Log in to Reply sigaba says: April 9, 2017 at 11:09 am I hate all this politics. Why can't large numbers of powerful interests and actors use the Bully Pulpit and Horse Trading to find compromise solutions without having to drag yucky POLITICS into it. If a poltical party is just soemthing you vote for and maximize your preferred policies, people would probably resent politics a lot less. If a party essentially stands in for a sort of moral platform and social signifier then yeah, I can see why people would find compromise and “politics” corrupt and painful. Log in to Reply Murc says: April 9, 2017 at 11:50 am Well, the problem, such as it is, is that a persons preferred policies often have moral freight to them. Like, it isn’t quibbling over tax brackets. It’s about things like whether or not women are people and if its legal to hunt brown people for sport or not. Your party doesn’t “stand in” for a moral platform; much of its policy platform will be a moral platform. Log in to Reply pdxtyler says: April 8, 2017 at 9:07 pm I feel like the article is making an important point that shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand though. One of the weakest parts of American labor law is the nlrb election process, and unions have largely accepted that recognition is a prerequisite for membership. There’s nothing stopping unions from experimenting with other types of membership, most just aren’t familiar with anything except NLRB elections or their public sector equivalents. In other countries workers are able to join up individually. My understanding is that this is how most organizing is done in the UK, unions build work place committees to address workplace issues and then they attempt to sign their co-workers up as members. Once they have a sufficient membership percentage they will likely attempt for recognition, but if they don’t reach that point the organization doesn’t go away. That’s very different from the norm in the US which is that after a lost election most unions just give up and any organization structure built at that point is lost. One thing that UK unions can offer individuals is protection from unfair dismissal due to at will employment not being the norm. I’d love to see a U.S. union offer an associate membership that offers employment protections, training and other benefits in the state of Montana. It’s the only state in the country thats not at-will, and attempting to establish workplace committees that immediately took on workplace issues as a step toward full recognition would be a really interesting pilot program. If you kept the dues nominal I think you could get sufficient interest to get off the ground, there’s got to be some folks working in service sector jobs in Butte whose families have union backgrounds. Log in to Reply Erik Loomis says: April 8, 2017 at 9:10 pm There’s no question that the NLRA is no longer effective. Unions are trying to figure out what to do about that. That includes the UFCW’s attempts to support Walmart organizing that the author fails to mention. I think the real point of this article is angrily subtweeting UFCW’s pullout from that campaign. But in any case, it’s not that there aren’t good points in the article. It’s that he doesn’t offer any actual solutions and in fact, I think a lot of what he does offer is not really valuable. Log in to Reply Brett says: April 8, 2017 at 9:46 pm I’ve become more sympathetic to UCFW curtailing the campaign. Unions have to nourish their membership and spend their dues where it can enhance the union meaningfully. They can’t afford to be the financier for all the many, many cash-strapped progressive efforts out there. Right for $15 might be next. Remember that SEIU announcement about a 30% cutback one spending? Log in to Reply Jake Nelson says: April 8, 2017 at 11:25 pm So, I’m sure I’ve posted something like this before in an LGM thread or three, so apologies to those who’ve read it, but… I am extremely skeptical that the “shop model” of unionization can survive even in its current paltry state for much longer. Even aside from things like how the DeVos family is again circulating their years-old proposal to outright ban collective bargaining itself… When I was doing local party activism, it was so frustrating that union officers’ idea of how to join a union was: 1) get an existing union job or 2) unionize your workplace. When the only way to join your club is to bring either a unicorn horn or a pegasus feather, you’re not going to have a growing membership. Plus, even union-sympathetic, willing to join, workers are put off by the lack of direct benefit to them the times it’s an option. I did overnight stock at my local Target for 7 years. Dozens of my coworkers also worked, or had worked, at Cub Foods, a large regional discount chain grocery store. Cub is UFCW. But everyone who worked both would tell you Cub had worse pay, benefits (and this even after Target’s benefits went to hell), work hours, schedule flexibility, working conditions, jerkass supervisors, etc, etc, etc. Now there’s a lot of valid points to make about that’s hardly UFCW’s fault, but it’s hardly helpful to recruiting to be abstractly in favor of/advocating unsuccessfully for things people can get next door. The system seems to be permanently screwed in a way that breaks the existing idea of how a private-sector union works. I don’t know what to do about that, other than a solution will have to let people join on their own, not already be employees of a union shop. (Public-sector unions, while obviously facing their own challenges, are a very different beast, and I’m even less sure how to help them. My utterly horrible school years made siding with teacher’s unions all the time extremely unpleasant- I did it anyway, of course, because there isn’t a choice.) Anyway, to try to make a statement other than anecdote, my main takeaway from years of dealing with it is that union leadership have no understanding of the current realities of the world outside a union, and 90+% of workers have no understanding of unions. Both tend to have vague ideas based mostly on a surface understanding of how things were 20-40 years ago. Unless something drastic changes, I only see that getting worse.

Health officials report that a bat was found in a pre-packaged Fresh Express salad at Wal-Mart. (BOBBY COKER, ORLANDO SENTINEL) Janet Brindle ReddickContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Florida health officials are investigating reports that a prepackaged Fresh Express salad sold at a Wal-Mart store contained a dead bat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Florida Department of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration say the bat was sent to the CDC to be tested for rabies. According to the CDC, two people in the state reported eating some of the salad before they found the bat. On Saturday, Fresh Express issued a recall of the Organic Marketside spring mix that were sold in a clear plastic container. The production code was G089B19 and it had a best-if-used-by-date of April 14 on the front label. CDC officials said the salads were only distributed to Wal-Mart stores in the Southeast. The CDC said transmission of rabies by eating a rabid animal is uncommon and the virus doesn’t live long outside of the infected animal, but anyone who thinks they may have eaten one of the salads that had animal products should contact their local health departments. The two people who are known to have eaten the contaminated salads began post-exposure rabies treatment as a precaution, but “report being in good health,” according to the CDC. Health officials said anyone who purchased one of the salads should discard it and contact the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center at 800-242-5472.  jareddick@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5268 or Twitter @jbreddick Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 64°

Police responded to Walmart at about 11 p.m. Friday, April 7 for a report of an assault and theft of a motor vehicle, according to a notice sent out by Claremont Police Chief Mark Chase. An employee was leaving the store around that time and was assaulted by a man as they were getting into their vehicle. Police said the suspect then forcibly took the keys from the victim and drove away in the victim’s vehicle. The suspect is described as a white man with dark short hair, a goatee, and a dark-colored sweatshirt. Claremont police are currently reviewing video of the incident. The vehicle has since been recovered. Anyone with information can call the Claremont Police Department at (603) 542-9538 or the tip line at (603) 542-7026.

Boeing is one of several large businesses that would see a property tax cut under Republican lawmakers’ plan to fix how Washington state pays for schools. Drew Perine Staff file, 2009 i By Melissa Santos msantos@thenewstribune.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When it comes to taxing businesses to pay for schools, state lawmakers in Olympia remain of two minds. While Democrats are proposing business tax hikes, a Republican plan would give many of Washington’s largest corporations a sizable property tax cut. Those breaks would include a $7.4 million annual reduction for Boeing, a $6 million cut for Puget Sound Energy and a $1.8 million break for Alaska Airlines, according to new estimates from the state Department of Revenue. Other corporations projected to receive property tax breaks topping $1 million a year under the Republican plan include Walmart, CenturyLink, Avista, BNSF Railway Co. and Weyerhaeuser. Some other big Washington businesses, including Microsoft and Amazon, would see their property taxes go up under the Republican plan. Still, statewide the GOP proposal would result in a net tax decrease of $92 million a year for owners of nonresidential parcels worth $5 million or more. Costco, Comcast and the owners of the Tacoma Mall are among those that would see property tax cuts of several hundred thousand dollars a year if the Republican plan becomes law. “I have a retired grandmother in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle who’s going to see hundreds of dollars in tax increases so that Walmart can receive millions of dollars in tax reductions.” State Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle Democrats say the tax breaks show that the Republican plan is unfair, because it simultaneously would raise taxes for property owners in high-cost areas such as Seattle and Bellevue. “What that means in real-people language is I have a retired grandmother in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle who’s going to see hundreds of dollars in tax increases so that Walmart can receive millions of dollars in tax reductions,” said state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle. Republicans who control the state Senate say companies in rural and suburban areas could use the extra help, and that lowering their taxes is simply a byproduct of fixing how the state pays for schools. “It’s by no means the point of our bill, but it goes toward the inherent inequity in the levy system,” said state Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, referring to disparities in how much money rich and poor school districts can raise in local property-tax levies. “If we can not only fix the underlying levy system, but also bring our overall state economy closer together so we don’t have these two economies that change at the Seattle city line, then that’s a good thing for all of us,” said Braun, the lead Senate budget writer. In the McCleary school-funding case, state lawmakers are working to comply with a court order to fully fund basic education. To do that, the state must take on the full cost of teachers’ and other school employees’ salaries, part of which now are being paid unconstitutionally through local school district property-tax levies. Republican Senate leaders aim to solve that problem by enacting a new statewide property tax of $1.55 per $1,000 in assessed property value, while eliminating local school district levies starting in 2019. That means property taxes in some areas, including many rural and suburban school districts, would go down, because right now their local levy rates are higher than the GOP’s proposed flat rate. For that reason, Boeing’s facilities in and around Everett would get a cut in property taxes of about $2.9 million annually under the Republican plan, according to the Revenue Department’s estimates. The aerospace company already benefited from more than $300 million in tax breaks from the state in 2015. It goes toward the inherent inequity of the levy system. State Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia At the same time, areas with high property values and low levy rates — such as Seattle, Mercer Island and Redmond — would see big tax increases under the Republican proposal. That’s why companies in those areas, including Amazon and Microsoft, would see their taxes rise. David Schumacher, the budget director for Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, said others besides tech giants would have to pay more under the GOP plan. “The problem is that in Seattle, Mercer Island and Bellevue, you don’t have to be rich to see your property taxes going up,” he said. “Every business in Seattle is not Amazon.” The Revenue Department analysis didn’t consider the potential effects of new, more modest local levies that school districts could enact starting in 2020 under the GOP plan. If school districts enact those additional taxes, large companies in their boundaries wouldn’t necessarily see the same tax breaks. Democrats who control the state House are largely looking at options other than property-tax changes to solve the McCleary problem. Their budget proposal would raise about $3 billion in other taxes, without substantially altering local school-district levies. Under the House Democrats’ proposal, businesses with a taxable revenue of more than $250,000 would see a 20 percent hike in their business and occupation tax rates, a change that would bring the state about $1.2 billion in revenue every two years. While the Democratic plan would exempt many small businesses from paying B&O taxes and allow others a $100,000 deduction, about 72,000 companies that bring in more than $500,000 a year would feel the full brunt of the 20 percent tax increase. House leaders also want to enact a new tax on capital gains, such as income from the sales of stocks and bonds, which Republicans have sharply criticized as the first step toward enacting a general income tax in Washington. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the $7.4 million property break the company would receive under the Senate GOP plan, or which approach the company favors to solve McCleary. The Washington Roundtable, a business group, hasn’t taken a position on the House and Senate tax proposals, either, said Steve Mullin, the organization’s president. The roundtable’s members include executives from several businesses that would see property-tax reductions under the Senate Republican plan. Mullin said that although his group hasn’t weighed in on either tax package, he sees the Senate GOP’s plan as being more progressive than Democrats give it credit for. In promoting some of their tax proposals this year, including the capital gains tax, Democrats have talked about the need to make wealthy individuals pay their fair share. “When you look at the whole Washington system, this change would make it more progressive on average,” Mullin said of the GOP’s property tax plan. “Wealthy individuals and businesses in high-value areas are going to proportionally pay more taxes.” Melissa Santos: 360-357-0209, @melissasantos1 Tax changes for businesses under GOP plan An analysis by the state Department of Revenue looked at how a Republican plan to fix funding of Washington’s schools would affect nonresidential taxpayers with parcels valued at $5 million or more, based on the companies’ tax bills from 2016. The analysis looked at the effects of imposing the GOP’s proposed statewide property tax of $1.55 per $1,000 in assessed value, while eliminating local school district property tax levies starting in 2019. The analysis doesn’t account for potential tax increases that could come from districts enacting new, more modest local levies starting in 2020, as the GOP plan allows.

Get The Latest Food Newswire Dead bat found in Walmart salad as Gotham police struggle to capture Poison Ivy By Sam Barsanti @sambarsanti Posted yesterday at 9:14 p.m. Batman And Robin Batman And Robin In what is clearly a thinly veiled threat against the Batman, The Washington Post is reporting that two people in Florida recently discovered a decomposed bat in a Fresh Express salad mix that they purchased at Walmart. To make it worse, they discovered the bat’s remains after eating some of the Organic Marketside Spring Mix, and the animal was too decomposed for the local branch of the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention to determine whether or not it had rabies. Luckily, the two people who ate the salad are reportedly doing fine, but that’s probably a small consolation considering that there was a dead bat in the thing they ate. Fresh Express believes that this was an isolated incident, but it’s working with Walmart to pull all salads from this particular batch off of store shelves as a precautionary measure. No culprit has come forward yet, because things like this don’t typically have culprits, but it seems safe to assume that this is the work of Poison Ivy and her green thumb of villainy. Also, while Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon has not released a formal statement yet, sources within his department suggest that this is part of some elaborate scheme to punish people for the way they treat plants.

Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 70.34. The projected upper bound is: 74.90. The projected lower bound is: 71.14. The projected closing price is: 73.02. Candlesticks A white body occurred (because prices closed higher than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 8 white candles and 2 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 29 white candles and 21 black candles for a net of 8 white candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 56.2887.

Updated 4 hours ago As the Miami Herald would observe, the notice Saturday recalling an untold quantity of organic salad from Wal-Mart stores across the southeastern United States “tiptoes around the batness” of the situation. The very, very disgusting batness of it all. Fresh Express' recall notice says only that, despite “a range of stringent controls ... in place during growing and harvesting,” some “extraneous animal matter” found its way into a single five-ounce container of Organic Marketside Spring Mix, somewhere on the continent. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the other hand, will tell you possibly more than you wanted to know. “Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found,” reads the agency's notice of an investigation of the incident. The dead bat was turned over to the federal government. “The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies.” That sounds bad, though the CDC offers reassurance that the chance of a live rabies virus making its way into the salad is very small. And the two people who ate the salad appear healthy. “Immediately upon notification of the event, Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams worked in close coordination with Wal-Mart and regulatory authorities to launch an intensive investigation,” a spokesperson for the company, which is owned by Chiquita of bananas fame, wrote in a statement to The Washington Post. “Based on all available evidence, we are confident this is an isolated incident.” Fresh Express, like many food makers in the age of mass distribution, has issued a handful of recalls before. But those contamination scares - salmonella, almond allergens, errant packages of Parmesan cheese - did not resemble whatever horror greeted the salad eaters in Florida. Not that a little dead bat is the most dangerous thing you can find in a meal. A minimal chance of rabies in two people who seem fine pales in comparison to a batch of Listeria-tainted Blue Bell ice cream that sickened people in four states. And a cucumber contamination in 2015 killed two people and sickened hundreds. A Wal-Mart spokesperson didn't say in which store the bat was found, but said that as soon as the company learned of the incident, it told all stores selling salad from that batch to pull it off the shelves. There are no signs that the incident will lead to anything like the public relations crisis that Chipotle faced in 2015, when 80 college students fell ill after visiting a single restaurant. Or Taco Bell's E. coli-based financial catastrophe a decade ago. Or Jack in the Box before that. A decomposed bat is not even necessarily the grossest extraneous matter you can find in your dinner.

A dead bat found inside a bagged salad sold at a Florida Walmart has prompted a regional recall and an investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has warned Americans not to eat salad from such packages. Two people discovered the bat after they had already eaten some of the salad in a bag of “Organic Marketside Spring Mix”. They alerted authorities, who sent the bat to a CDC rabies lab. The animal’s decayed state prevented a definitive test of whether it had rabies. Transmission by eating an infected animal is “extremely uncommon”, the CDC said in a statement, but the two people were recommended for treatment out of an abundance of caution. Neither Floridian showed any signs of rabies and both reported good health, the CDC said, adding that there have been no other “reports of bat material found in packaged salads”. Experts with the Florida department of heath, the federal Food and Drug Administration and the CDC are all involved in an investigation into how the dead bat came to be packaged with the salad. Fresh Express, the food company whose product contained the bat, issued a limited recall for salads sold in a clear container, with a best-used date of 14 April and the production code G089B19. The recalled salads were only sold at Walmart stores in the south-eastern US, and the CDC said that all the remaining salad packages from the relevant lot had been removed from store locations. “Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it,” the CDC said. The agency said people who had eaten the salad and not found “animal material” were not at risk, and that customers could contact Fresh Express for a full refund. In a statement, Fresh Express said it “takes matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulation”. The CDC added a general recommendation: “Anyone who ate the recalled salad product and found animal material in it [should] contact their health department for evaluation.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Dead bat found in Florida salad Alan Gomez, USA TODAY Sunday, 09-Apr-17 20:01:44 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Florida diners made a disturbing discovery when they cracked open a prepackaged salad: a dead bat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says two people started eating the salad before noticing the decomposing winged mammal. The bat, which was found in a "deteriorated condition," was sent to a CDC lab to test for rabies as the manufacturer rushed to recall the batch of salads that were shipped exclusively to Walmart stores throughout the southeastern U.S. Fresh Express issued a recall for the lot of its Organic Marketside Spring Mix, with a production code of G089B19 that had a best-if-used-by date of April 14. In a statement, the company said it worked quickly and closely with Walmart officials to remove the entire batch from store shelves and offered a full refund to anyone who bought one. The company said the problem only affected the one line of its products. "Fresh Express takes matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulations including the proscribed Good Agricultural Practices," the company said in a statement. Fresh Express urged anybody who bought that specific lot to throw it out. The CDC said people who had already eaten salad from that lot and found "animal material" in their greens should contact their local health department immediately. Otherwise, "people who have eaten the recalled salad and did not find animal material are not at risk and do not need to contact their health department." The CDC is now working with the Florida Department of Health to determine whether the two people who ate some of the tainted salad are at risk. The CDC is checking for rabies, which can be found in bats, but said the two victims are doing fine. "Both people report being in good health and neither has any signs of rabies," the CDC said in a statement.

Jennifer Smith 15 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Google denies Labor Dept.'s pay disparity allegations Snapdeal founders move to calm employees amid takeover talk © Andrew Cullen for The Wall Street Journal Retailers and logistics companies have been opening warehouses at a record pace to ensure online orders reach customers as quickly as possible. Now they’re struggling to find workers to staff them. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 894.88 -3.40 -0.38% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 72.90 +1.47 +2.06% CBRE Group Inc CBG ▼ 32.94 -0.02 -0.06% XPO Logistics Inc XPO ▼ 47.29 -0.13 -0.27% Amazon.com Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other e-commerce giants rely on armies of “pickers” to grab items off warehouse shelves and prep them for shipment. For years they’ve drawn from a seemingly limitless pool of people willing to take these jobs, which can be grueling but require little training or education. But with the unemployment rate close to a 10-year low, competition for warehouse workers is fueling the biggest wage gains inside warehouses in at least a decade. Starting pay for warehouse workers rose 6% over the past year to $12.15 an hour in February, according to an analysis by ProLogistix, a logistics staffing firm. Hourly earnings rose 2.8% across all professions over the same period, according to the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The warehouse and storage sector expanded dramatically as more people shop online, and accounted for 945,200 jobs in March, up 5.3% over the year-earlier period, according to seasonally adjusted Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. Warehouse workers typically earn a few dollars an hour above minimum wage, though minimum-wage laws in places like California and Massachusetts could narrow the gap. Booming sales mean e-commerce operations have to ship more items faster, and pay increases are imposing new costs. E-commerce fulfillment centers require two to three times as many workers as traditional warehouses, says CBRE Group Inc., a real-estate brokerage. It estimates a $1-an-hour wage increase can raise labor costs by more than $2 million a year at “big box” warehouses employing as many as 1,000 workers. Many new facilities Amazon.com Inc. is opening around the country have 2,000 or more full-time employees, an Amazon spokeswoman said. The e-commerce giant, which has more than 90,000 full-time workers across its fulfillment network, said Thursday it plans to create 25,000 additional part-time warehouse jobs over the next year. Rising labor costs are speeding up the pace of automation and influencing where new warehouses are built. And as poaching becomes a bigger threat, employers are trying to make picker jobs more attractive, with perks like employee barbecues and holiday breakfasts, as well as more-flexible shifts. It doesn’t take much to lure workers away. “A guy who makes $10 an hour, you offer $10.25, he’s going to leave,” said Tom Landry, president of Allegiance Staffing, which supplies logistics and manufacturing workers. “That’s another tank of gas.” Some warehouse operators are adding part-time positions or compressed shifts that pack 36 hours of work into three days, in hopes of luring students, working parents or retirees. Some firms are tapping local organizations and community colleges. Incentives deployed each fall for the holiday rush, like performance pay, are becoming more common year-round. “It’s almost like peak [season] is never ending,” said Meghan Henson, chief human resources officer at XPO Logistics Inc., which operates warehouses for large retailers like IKEA. “If a warehouse is going up down the block, we want to find out what they’re paying.” Amazon.com and online furniture retailer Wayfair Inc. have opened warehouses near Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. The delivery companies FedExCorp., United Parcel Service Inc. and Deutsche Post AG’s DHL also have operations in the area. Average pay in 2015 for freight and stock employees, such as warehouse pickers, in the Cincinnati metro area shot up to more than $14 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Finding enough workers “is certainly a concern,” said Dan Tobergte, chief executive of Northern Kentucky Tri-ED, a regional economic development agency. We’ve got pretty low unemployment in the area,” he said, and the population isn’t “growing as fast as the jobs are.” Competition for labor is intense in areas such as Southern California’s Inland Empire and Central Pennsylvania, within a day’s reach of millions of consumers. Demand is heating up in Midwestern cities like Indianapolis and St. Louis, according to commercial real-estate services firm JLL. Radial, which handles e-commerce fulfillment for retailers like Kate Spade & Co. and DSW Inc., increased wages at eight U.S. locations in December, including raises of between 5% and 7% at a facility in Redlands, Calif. “Last year was really the tipping point for us,” said Robyn Jordan, senior director of human resources for Radial’s global operations. Luis Ramirez, 26 years old, ​joined Radial in 2014, after hearing it was paying $10 an hour at a new distribution center for Zara, a retail unit of Inditex SA. That was 50 cents an hour more than he earned at a warehouse job​he got through a staffing agency.​ Mr. Ramirez earned a $200 attendance bonus during the​recent holiday season​and said Zara gives out $100 gift cards at the end of the year. Employees also can​get paid more if they exceed targets during busy times, when apparel goes on sale. “For picking, the rate is 65 [clothing items] an hour,” Mr. Ramirez said. Workers who exceed 70​items an hour “get a dollar extra for every hour you hit that rate.” He said he plans to stay​at Radial for now. Raising pay can reduce employee turnover and save companies money on training. Experienced workers tend to be more productive, said David Caines, chief operating officer at logistics provider Kenco. Some companies are investing in automated systems so their facilities can handle more orders without hiring additional staff. Software can direct workers to the right shelf faster and reduce errors. A new Kohl’s Corp. e-commerce fulfillment center in Indiana will be “three times as productive as our existing fulfillment centers, given the level of automation,” the company said in February. “We used to do maybe one highly automated distribution center out of 10,” said Steve Osburn, a managing director at consulting firm Kurt Salmon, an Accenture subsidiary. “Now it’s 80% of the DCs that we’re dealing with.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Business U.S. Decomposed bat is found inside bag of organic salad from a Florida Walmart April 9, 2017 0 513 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet As the Miami Herald would observe, Saturday’s notice recalling an untold quantity of organic salad from Walmart stores across the southeastern United States “tiptoes around the batness” of the situation. The very, very disgusting batness of it all. Fresh Express’ recall notice says only that, despite “a range of stringent controls … in place during growing and harvesting,” some “extraneous animal matter” found its way into a single five-ounce container of Organic Marketside Spring Mix, somewhere on the continent. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the other hand, will tell you possibly more than you wanted to know. “Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found,” reads the agency’s notice of an investigation of the incident. The dead bat was turned over to the federal government. “The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies.” That sounds bad, though the CDC offers reassurance that the chance of a live rabies virus making its way into the salad is very small. And the two people who ate the salad appear healthy. “Immediately upon notification of the event, Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams worked in close coordination with Walmart and regulatory authorities to launch an intensive investigation,” a spokesperson for the company, which is owned by Chiquita of bananas fame, wrote in a statement to The Washington Post. “Based on all available evidence, we are confident this is an isolated incident.” Fresh Express, like many food makers in the age of mass distribution, has issued a handful of recalls before. But those contamination scares – salmonella, almond allergens, errant packages of Parmesan cheese – did not resemble whatever horror greeted the salad eaters in Florida. Not that a little dead bat is the most dangerous thing you can find in a meal. A minimal chance of rabies in two people who seem fine pales in comparison to a batch of Listeria-tainted Blue Bell ice cream that sickened people in four states. And a cucumber contamination in 2015 killed two people and sickened hundreds. A Walmart spokesperson didn’t say in which store the bat was found, but said that as soon as the company learned of the incident, it told all stores selling salad from that batch to pull it off the shelves. There are no signs that the incident will lead to anything like the public relations crisis that Chipotle faced in 2015, when 80 college students fell ill after visiting a single restaurant. Or Taco Bell’s E. coli-based financial catastrophe a decade ago. Or Jack in the Box before that. A decomposed bat is not even necessarily the grossest extraneous matter you can find in your dinner. NPR has an entire compendium of reports about fingers found in fast food.

Two people discovered the bat after they had already eaten some of the salad in a bag of “Organic Marketside Spring Mix”. They alerted authorities, who sent the bat to a CDC rabies lab. The animal’s decayed state prevented a definitive test of whether it had rabies. Transmission by eating an infected animal is “extremely uncommon”, the CDC said in a statement, but the two people were recommended for treatment out of an abundance of caution. Neither Floridian showed any signs of rabies and both reported good health, the CDC said, adding that there have been no other “reports of bat material found in packaged salads”. Experts with the Florida department of heath, the federal Food and Drug Administration and the CDC are all involved in an investigation into how the dead bat came to be packaged with the salad. Fresh Express, the food company whose product contained the bat, issued a limited recall for salads sold in a clear container, with a best-used date of 14 April and the production code G089B19. The recalled salads were only sold at Walmart stores in the south-eastern US, and the CDC said that all the remaining salad packages from the relevant lot had been removed from store locations. “Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it,” the CDC said. The agency said people who had eaten the salad and not found “animal material” were not at risk, and that customers could contact Fresh Express for a full refund. In a statement, Fresh Express said it “takes matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulation”. The CDC added a general recommendation: “Anyone who ate the recalled salad product and found animal material in it [should] contact their health department for evaluation.” Topics Florida Animals Wildlife Walmart Salad news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The recall affects stores in the Southeastern U.S., including Louisiana locations. There is a "minimal" chance of spreading rabies through dead animal body parts in food, the Herald reported, and the bat was being tested for the disease. The Herald reported that two people were eating the salad when they found the dead bat inside, but because of "the deteriorated condition of the bat," the CDC was unable to determine whether it had rabies. The Centers for Disease Control and the Florida Department of Health are investigating how the bat got inside the salad packaging. Because of the risk of rabies, both people have been recommended to begin rabies treatment, and both are in good health, the Herald reported. States affected by the recall include Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The product being recalled is in a 5-ounce, clear container with a "Best By" date of April 14, 2017. The Herald reported that anyone who bought the product should throw it away or return it to Wal-Mart. Anyone with questions can call the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center 800.242.5472 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Central time. You can read the full report here.

Partnering with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Florida Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are taking precautions with a bat found inside a package of Organic Marketside Spring Mix distributed by Fresh Express. The CDC is currently trying to determine if the bat had rabies. Fresh Express is recalling packages from Walmart locations in multiple states, including locations in Alabama. The other states in which Walmart is pulling the salads from their shelves are Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The CDC stated in a press release that anyone who has eaten from the brand product but haven’t found any “animal material” are in the clear. However, anyone who has purchased it should still discard it for safety’s sake. ‹ Previous Next › Comments Carl Crow says: April 9, 2017 at 5:52 pm The Caesar bat mix is the best Suzanne Williams Crosby says: April 9, 2017 at 5:54 pm Bats are organic.

(Source: Wikimedia Commons) WTVD Sunday, April 09, 2017 06:49PM FLORIDA (WTVD) -- Fresh Express is recalling a salad mix sold at Walmart stores in the southeast after a dead bat was found inside a package in Florida. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention said two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab, but experts couldn't determine if the bat had rabies because it had deteriorated. "Transmission of rabies by eating a rabid animal is extremely uncommon, and the virus does not survive very long outside of the infected animal. CDC is supporting Florida local and state health officials in evaluating the people who found the bat in the salad," the CDC stated on its website. Here's information on the recalled product from the CDC: Fresh Express issued the recall of Organic Marketside Spring Mix on Saturday. The salads were sold in a clear container with production code G089B19 and a best-if-used-by date of April 14, 2017 located on the front label. The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States. All remaining packages of salad from the same lot have been removed from all store locations where the salad was sold. Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it. A full refund is available where purchased or by calling the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center toll-free at (800) 242-5472 during the hours of 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time. People who have eaten the recalled salad product and did not find animal material are not at risk and do not need to contact their health department. CDC recommends that anyone who ate the recalled salad product and found animal material in it contact their health department for evaluation.

The touch screen gives customers a chance to sift through the retailer’s in-store and online catalog. ORLANDO, Fla. — James Schroder has been answering plenty of questions from customers in the two months since Wal-Mart Stores Inc. unveiled its newest supercenter in this 7,000-acre community known as Lake Nona. As manager of the 190,000-square-foot store promising innovative technology, an efficient layout and other customer-centric services, Schroder anticipated a flood of inquiries from curious shoppers. But he’s also confident customers are adjusting to Wal-Mart’s new digs and everything it has to offer. “I have customers tell me all the time they can get in and out so much faster,” Schroder said during a tour last week. “Not because of anything that we’re doing differently, but because of the technology that we’ve put into the store.” Lake Nona is one of two concept stores the retailer has opened this year along with a similar supercenter located in the Houston area. The Lake Nona store, which opened Jan. 25 and is located in a growing community within Orlando’s city limits, is being tested to determine whether the retailer will roll out the prototype at other locations across the country. There are a few tech-based features available in the store. The most prominent is Wal-Mart’s Scan & Go, which allows customers to scan items with their mobile phones as they shop and pay for them through a mobile app to skip the checkout line. A version using a hand-held device also is available. A Sam’s Club Scan & Go app was rolled out nationwide last year, but the two new stores — along with the supercenter in Rogers — are the only locations currently testing the Wal-Mart version. Wal-Mart also included an interactive table in Lake Nona’s electronics department, which allows customers to swipe their hand to learn about a product. Projectors located overhead sense hand movements and determine the direction a customer wants to go in their search for information. The store has a large touch screen in the toy department, giving customers a chance to sift through the retailer’s instore and online catalog. A series of questions — like a child’s age and gender — help narrow choices and selections are either on the store’s shelves or available online. If the selection is only available online, customers can purchase the product through the mobile app. “The great thing about the resources we have is ability to test,” Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said last month during the Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference in Orlando. “That’s how I would classify those stores. A lot of what you see in Lake Nona and [the Houston area] is we’re testing how to interact with the customer differently. We’re understanding better how they want to shop.” The tests come as Wal-Mart continues to build out its e-commerce offerings, snapping up online retailers like Jet.com, Hayneedle.com, ShoeBuy.com, Moosejaw and ModCloth in attempts to better compete with the likes of Amazon.com. But the company’s more than 4,600 U.S. stores remain critical to Wal-Mart’s strategy with most sales still occurring in its physical locations. So as a larger percentage of shoppers turn online to purchase goods, Wal-Mart must find ways to get customers to continue making trips into those stores by offering an enhanced experience. “There will be a lot of high tech involved and we’re definitely moving in that right direction,” said University of Arkansas associate professor Annibal Sodero, who pointed to Amazon.com’s tech-heavy Amazon Go convenience store in Seattle. The retailer believes its enormous supercenters can help meet those expectations, providing Wal-Mart with a brick-and-mortar tool to help marry online and in-store capabilities for customers. “We like the supercenter format, particularly in this country,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Consumer and Retail Technology Conference in New York last month. “It’s a very effective vehicle and we believe will drive traffic over time if run well.” In addition to the tech tools, Wal-Mart’s Lake Nona store offers a new layout intended to create a better flow. The health and beauty section has been remodeled and is located steps away from a hair salon. The pharmacy and vision center are nearby and connected by a waiting room area for customers. Baby, kids, apparel, shoes and toys have been grouped in one area of the store and arranged by age. An area designated for instore pickup is located just inside the front door. Outside, an integrated pickup service for general merchandise, groceries and medications is available for customers who don’t want to leave their vehicles. The retailer provides four checkout options inside the store, including a Scan & Go fast lane for customers that is only open during the busiest hours. Most of the options in Lake Nona are self checkouts. In fact, there are only six places for registers manned by employees, which initially concerned Schroder. “Not many of our transactions happen at the manned registers,” Schroder said. “I don’t know if they feel like taking it into their own hands will make it faster, but customers really like those options.” Overall, the Lake Nona store received high marks from Raymond James retail analysts, who published a research note last month titled “A visit to a really cool Walmart; C’mon man, really?” In addition to the new technology, layout and services, the research note also noted the store’s contemporary look, polished concrete floors, higher ceilings and additional natural light. “Is it a perfect Wal-Mart? No. Of course not,” the analysts wrote. “That will always be the goal — never attainable, but still sought. Was it, however, a really cool Wal-Mart? Yes, at least as we see it.” Print Headline: Wal-Mart tests store prototype Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Wal-Mart tests store prototype Nation's trailer parks in decline Ozark Beer raising the bar in Rogers Home upgrades part of retirement plans New NYC ferries born on the bayou Staples goes hip to increase sales U.S. margarine tastes slip; maker looks to sh...

The CDC is partnering with the Florida Department of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to look into whether the bat was infected with rabies. Two Florida residents reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The five-ounce containers of Organic Marketside Spring Mix were distributed to Walmart stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, according to the FDA. "The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease," the CDC said in a statement Saturday. "The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies." The CDC said transmission of rabies by eating an infected animal is "extremely uncommon, and the virus does not survive very long outside of the infected animal." Although the CDC considers the risk very low, the two people who ate the salad were recommended to start post-exposure rabies treatment. "Both people report being in good health and neither has any signs of rabies," the CDC said. "CDC is not aware of any other reports of bat material found in packaged salads." The product has the production code G089B19, a best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 on the front label, and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 on the bottom of the container. Fresh Express, which produces and distributes the salad for Walmart, said no other Marketside salads are included in the recall. The FDA said Walmart and Fresh Express deployed food safety and rapid response teams upon receiving notification of the bat and began working with regulatory authorities to launch "an intensive investigation" of the incident. All products were removed from store shelves. "Fresh Express takes matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulations including the proscribed Good Agricultural Practices," a statement reads on the FDA website. "In addition, a range of stringent controls are in place during growing and harvesting to mitigate against field material from entering the raw product system. In manufacturing, additional controls including thorough washing and filtration systems as well as visual inspections that are designed to eliminate unwanted debris." Consumers who have purchased the product may receive a full refund by calling the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center toll-free at (800) 242-5472. For more details, click here.

Organic Marketside Spring Mix marketed in a clear container with production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 located on the front label, and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 located on the bottom of the container. The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States. The recall was necessitated when Fresh Express was notified that extraneous animal matter was allegedly found in a single container of the salad. Out of an abundance of caution, all salads manufactured in the same production run are being recalled. No other Marketside salads are included in the recall.  Fresh Express salads are not subject to a recall.  Walmart acted quickly to remove the product from store shelves.   Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it.  A full refund is available where purchased or by calling the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center toll-free at (800) 242-5472 during the hours of 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time. Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation and initiate product removal and recall procedures.    Fresh Express takes matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulations including the proscribed Good Agricultural Practices.  In addition, a range of stringent controls are in place during growing and harvesting to mitigate against field material from entering the raw product system.  In manufacturing, additional controls including thorough washing and filtration systems as well as visual inspections that are designed to eliminate unwanted debris.  Recalled Product Details Organic Marketside Spring Mix -  5 oz. clear container Production Code of G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14 2017, located on the top label UPC Code of 6 8113132897 5 located on the bottom of the container next to the bar code  Recalled Product Distribution Fresh Express Precautionary Recall, 5 oz.

The 2016 estimate for total consumers within this retail trade area was 38,227 with an average household income of $64,907, according to Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. (TheRetailCoach / Courtesy map) Fort Morgan businesses draw from a "retail trade area" with a population of more than 38,000, according to the results of a retail analytics study commissioned by the city. The identified retail trade area is the geographical area where this community's businesses get about 85 percent of their business, explained Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. But of the $624 million in potential retail sales that trade area and its 38,000-plus customers could generate, the city is benefiting from an estimated $379 million in actual retail sales, according to Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. He called the difference between the potential and actual retail sales the trade area's "leakage" or "gap." There was no surprise as to the source of that leakage, with people reporting that they were heading out of town to visit national chain restaurants and clothing stores that were not available in Fort Morgan, Farmer told the Fort Morgan City Council Tuesday night while delivering his company's retail study findings. "We know that quite a bit of retail dollars are leaving the community and heading west," he said. "You just don't have all of the retail, all of the restaurants that people leave town for." Advertisement The findings Farmer presented were based on gathering and sorting through many different kinds of data, all with a goal to "really get a feel for the market and really understand where are consumers coming from that are shopping and eating here, that are coming from outside of Fort Morgan," he told the council. "We know you've got that city limits population, that town limits population, that is eating, shopping here on a regular basis. But we also know you are getting people from outside the community. We call that the retail trade area." How that was determined may sound "a little scary" or " a little Big Brother-ish," Farmer said, "but I think you'll understand the use of this." TheRetailCoach did a "cell phone analysis," he said. "If you're shopping at Walmart or you're shopping downtown, you get a phone call, an email or a text. We're actually able to track your home address based off of that," Farmer said. "We're not selling the information or doing anything like that. We're just using it to understand where your consumers are coming from." He showed the council a "heat map" that indicated the number of people coming from various areas in and outside of Morgan County and who had shopped at Walmart in Fort Morgan at least one time over the last year. "We can look at specific times of the year or just lunch time," Farmer explained, and the contractor had created many other maps and reports about where and when people were shopping or visiting the city's retail stores or restaurants. "38,227 people are shopping in Fort Morgan on a regular basis," he said. "We realize you're getting people from outside of this area." Of those people, average household incomes were nearly $65,000 and average ages were 37 to 38, and that is only a couple of the types of data in Farmer's report. "What we've done is we've literally put together hundreds of pages of reports," he told the council. "Hundreds of pages of demographic information that a retail developer or site selector would be interested in." Farmer also had some advice for the city. "When it comes to recruiting retail, when it comes to even working with your existing businesses, forget about the city limits population," he said. "Retailers want to know where are those consumers coming from. Going forward, focus on that trade area population, which is almost 39,000." Further, there could be opportunities for the city with recruiting large, chain restaurants or clothing stores, he said. "There's about $23.5 million in clothing dollars that are leaving on a yearly basis," Farmer said. "Probably why we already have a clothing store interested in looking at the market is they see that." Similarly, the city was leaking almost $21 million spent at sit-down chain restaurants. "That number of almost $21 million in leakage is going to interest some of those casual sit-down restaurants," he said. But now begins the work of actually recruiting new businesses and meeting with the existing ones to look for opportunities for expansion or change, according to both Farmer and Fort Morgan Community Services/Economic Development Director Josh Miller. "We've been working with TheRetailCoach now since November," Miller said. "It's been helpful, as we look to the future and where we need to focus our attention in retail attraction specifically and what that might look like. Aaron's work thus far has generated a variety of reports for us that have proven helpful to better understand our market area, what our retail market looks like, what our opportunities are." "Having these specific dollar amounts to take to these retailers I think is going to help," Farmer told the council. TheRetailCoach will continue to work with the Fort Morgan Economic Development Department on recruitment, retention and more, according to both Farmer and Miller. "Really there's a couple ways this gap analysis, this leakage analysis can be used," Farmer explained. "Number one, it's to recruit businesses in, to recruit retailers that are not here into the market. We want to work with existing businesses. That's the other way it can be used. We're going to be having a meeting with existing businesses, downtown merchants and some others in the next few months. If there's an opportunity for an existing store here to expand their business or expand and carry different items or brands that people are buying, that's another way. The third is obviously entrepreneur-ism, somebody coming into the market and opening up a business." City Manager Jeff Wells pointed out that the goal was not to bring in businesses to compete with the existing ones already here, but to capture the leakage to businesses in other trade areas. The city's contract with TheRetailCoach is for at least two years from last October, with an option for a third year. The contractor's services are being funded both by Fort Morgan capital improvement dollars and a grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

Perez recently passed away due to cancer. She was 15-years-old. (Aaron Rosenblatt/Daily Republic) Local News Family, friends bid farewell to Suisun girl at candlelight vigil By Susan Hiland From page A1 | April 10, 2017 0SHARES ShareTweet 0 SHARES ShareTweet SUISUN CITY — As the sun set Sunday, about 30 friends and family members gathered at the home of Isabel Perez to bid farewell to the 15-year-old. Dressed in Warriors gear – Perez’s favorite team – and holding candles, the home was surrounded with love from those who knew her. She was diagnosed at 4 years old with a rare but serious condition known as myasthenia gravis. Her mother, Lina Ruelas-Selby, brought Isabel to the emergency room several times after the young girl would choke on air, turn blue and pass out. After years of struggles, both with the disease and doctors, the disease was in remission. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the skeletal (voluntary) muscles of the body. The name myasthenia gravis, which is Latin and Greek in origin, literally means “grave muscle weakness,” according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes. “I just want people to know about this disease,” Ruelas-Selby said. “It’s so rare and no one knows about it.” They would go days and months without any attack. “We never knew when it was going to happen,” she said. Ruelas-Selby gave up her job to be with her daughter full time. The lack of income has put a considerable strain on the family. She and her husband, who works at Walmart, have started a GoFundMe account to help pay for the funeral expenses. “The candlelight vigil is for her classmates,” she said. “They are really struggling with this.” Crystal Middle School in Suisun City has brought in counselors to help students deal with the grief. For many this is their first experience with a death of a friend. “Teachers put fliers up and announcements went out over the intercom,” said Ariana Davis, 13, a classmate of Perez. “I was, like, ‘No, she can’t be dead.’ ” Perez’s friends sat at the kitchen counter at her mom’s house in the days before the vigil. Her friends have stopped in after school and stayed for hours since the news went out about Perez’s death on April 4. Some sat with cellphones in hand, others talking softly and others giving a quick hug and delivering a candle, cards or food and then leaving. “It’s been overwhelming,” said Ruelas-Selby. “Her boyfriend came and her friends and they just stayed all day. It was late so I said they should just stay the night.” “Isabel’s been Snapchatting since seventh grade,” said friend Rosie Lavelle, 14, a student at Crystal Middle School. “Most of the pictures are on her timeline.” Perez’s family hopes to gain access to her cellphone to download the pictures, videos and memories but it’s locked and Apple will not open a cellphone for anyone. “The Snapchat pictures are ones I’d like to keep,” said Alicia Ruelas, Perez’s sister. Lavelle and Davis shared memories of a birthday party where Perez started dancing, none of them knew that she was sick. She didn’t bring it up much with anyone. “She was a big Warriors fan, she loved Suicide Squad’s Harley Quinn,” said Davis. “She told me once she was sick but I never saw her have an episode.” Crystal Middle School students plan to hold a car wash next weekend, it’s just a matter of pulling everything together. Ruelas, who works at Wells Fargo, opened an account for donations. Her boss donated money, then more co-workers followed. Ruelas-Selby knew that most of the kids would not be able to attend the funeral so the candlelight vigil would give them a chance to say goodbye. “This was for them,” she said. Donations can be made to Isabel Perez Memorial Fund account at Wells Fargo, account number 7676167609, or to www.gofundme.com/help-us-send-isabel-off-to-heaven.

The bat was sent to the CDC after it was found in a bag of Fresh Express Organic Marketside Spring Mix. “The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies,” the Atlanta-based agency said. The CDC said the risk of rabies transmission was extremely low but not zero, so the two people who ate salad mix were recommended for treatment as a precaution. They are fine and show no signs of having rabies, the CDC said. Fresh Express has recalled packages of the salad mix that were sold at Walmarts in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The affected product has the production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of Apr 14, 2017 on the front label, and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 on the bottom of the container. “Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation and initiate product removal and recall procedures,” Fresh Express said. There have been no other reports of animal matter. The Florida Department of Health, US Food and Drug Administration and CDC are part of the investigation into the dead bat.

Vudu Disc-to-Digital goes mobile: scan your DVD collection and convert it to digital for a fee [Updated] Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/23 6:12am PDTMar 23, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Applications News Update 1: 2017/03/23 4:23pm PDT The app changelog is now up: WHAT'S NEW **Introducing Mobile Disc to Digital – Convert from your phone!** Use your mobile device to convert your Blu-ray and DVD discs into Vudu has offered a Disc-to-Digital service for a while for those who wanted to convert their physical DVD and Blu-Ray movie collection to digital. However, the service either required you to pop into a Walmart with all of your discs in hand or download the app on your computer and insert discs one by one to verify that you own them. Now, the option is available on mobile. Through an update to the Vudu app, which doesn't seem to be live yet, Vudu users will be able to scan the barcode off their DVDs and Blu-Rays and let the app offer them the digital version in return. There are a couple of catches though plus a fee to pay. First, the service only has about 8000 movies in the catalogue now, so you may run into one or many that aren't yet supported. For example, Disney's movies aren't available, but you shouldn't have problems with Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, or Warner Bros. Second, you have to physically be at your billing location because the app will request a GPS verification to make sure you're at home scanning your own collection and not strolling through a store and scanning everything on the shelves. Third, there's a limit of 100 titles per year per account, which seems like a reasonable way to avoid potential abuse from those who manage to get around the location limitation. As for the price, it costs $2 to convert a DVD to SD or a Blu-Ray to HD, but $5 to upgrade a DVD to HD. One complimentary conversion will be offered for Vudu users to try out the service. If neither the catches or prices turned you off, the feature should go live today so keep your eye on an update to the Vudu app if you're interested. Update 1: 2017/03/23 4:23pm PDT The app changelog is now up: WHAT'S NEW **Introducing Mobile Disc to Digital – Convert from your phone!** Use your mobile device to convert your Blu-ray and DVD discs into digital movies! Upgrade your app and convert your collection today! • It’s easy! Scan the UPC, convert with a click, and watch anytime, anywhere • Conversions start at just $2; watch instantly • Access your movies on any Vudu compatible device Don’t have your UPC? Try Vudu To Go on your computer or laptop and convert with your disc. Learn more at vudu.com/disc End of Update Download: Vudu Movies & TV (Play Store) Press Release Movie Lovers, Rejoice: Walmart’s Vudu Launches First Mobile Service that Transforms DVDs and Blu-rays into a Digital Collection Vudu’s Mobile Disc-to-Digital is Available Starting Today for Nearly 8,000 Movies March 23, 2017 12:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vudu, Walmart’s subscription-free, premium video streaming service, announced today the launch of the first mobile offering to convert DVDs and Blu-rays into digital libraries, right from a customer’s phone. Available beginning today, March 23, at 12:00 a.m. EDT, Mobile Disc-to-Digital turns DVDs and Blu-rays into digital movies* with a simple scan through the Vudu app. These movies can then be viewed on hundreds of Vudu-enabled devices including televisions, Blu-ray disc players, gaming consoles, streaming players and through the Vudu app on phones and tablets. Over the past several years, Vudu has seen increased demand for its offerings that bridge physical and digital entertainment, including its in-home Disc-to-Digital service and InstaWatch, which automatically sends customers a digital copy of eligible DVDs or Blu-ray discs purchased at Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. “The average movie collector owns nearly 100 DVDs and Blu-rays.** We know these customers have invested a lot into building their physical movie collections,” said Jeremy Verba, general manager, Vudu. “As more and more customers create digital libraries, we are constantly looking for ways to help them unlock additional value from the movies they already own.” Mobile Disc-to-Digital works on iPhones and Android devices and is available for nearly 8,000 movies from Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Additional titles will be added in the coming months. Movie fans can convert a DVD to SD or a Blu-ray disc to HDX for $2. To upgrade DVDs to HDX, it will cost $5 per title. All Vudu users will receive one complimentary first-time mobile conversion. Mobile Disc-to-Digital conversions must take place at a customer’s home / billing address. Mobile Disc-to-Digital works in three easy steps: 1. Scan – Navigate to Disc-to-Digital in the Vudu app and scan the barcode on the physical disc case. 2. Convert – Choose SD or HDX. Submit one title or scan all of your movies before submitting. 3. Watch – Watch your movies on any Vudu-enabled device. “Like Walmart, at Vudu we’re always striving to save our customers time and money,” added Verba. “Our Mobile Disc-to-Digital service is a key part of Vudu’s broader effort to make digital entertainment access simple and convenient.” For more information on Vudu, visit www.Vudu.com. *Customers need a free UltraViolet account in order to use Mobile Disc-to-Digital **Fox Media & Tech Tracker - 2016 About Vudu With more than 100,000 titles that can be watched on movie lovers’ favorite devices, Vudu gives users anytime, anywhere access to favorite movies and television shows.

Justin W Same thing that prevents you from walking into a store and scanning an on-the-shelf DVD you haven't purchased: nothing. F4LL0U7 The GPS feature prevents you from doing it at the store, but you could take a photo at the store and then do it at home. I don't really care enough to go through that hassle, but I'll definitely do the one complimentary conversion to try out the service. Impulse_Vigil I'm curious what does the location feature check for... Cause my billing address is a P.O. box a couple miles from my house. Zorn85 ...well presumably it will check to see if you are at the billing address, which you wouldn't be if it's a PO Box. They may not even accept PO Boxes as billing addresses for that very reason. Impulse_Vigil Vudu does, at least in general, it might error out for the purpose of this service tho. Hasn't gone live so can't very well try it and find out... Gregory What's a billing address? Brett What's a horse shoe? What does a horse shoe do? Are there any horse socks? Is anybody listening to me? Gregory You might be joking, but I genuinely have no idea what a billing address is. Internet search reveals that it's "an address to which you receive your credit card statement", but I've never seen a "credit card statement" in my life either... Matt Do you know what a shipping address is? Demitrius Harris Everybody knows that... clearly, a shipping address is a speech given to an audience of ships. Clearly. My1 well putting credit cards aside, you probably have to register with an address in case any bills or whatever may arrive, and the app will check whether you are at your registered address. F4LL0U7 Everybody my age pees their pants, it's the coolest disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O The address your credit card is registered on. tehboogieman UPCs for DVDs and Blurays are easily available online just like almost any movie that's on this list, Don't even need to go anywhere. I guess it's a way for pirates to launder their movies, but hardly seems worth it to pay for something a person is willing to "steal" Justin W Ah, missed that part of the article. Still, it's quite stupid to assume this would stop anyone from trying to get discount movies, as others have mentioned UPCs are available pretty much universally online. Impulse_Vigil You still need to pay per disc, so I imagine between the 100 movie cap and the cost they've crunched the numbers on possible losses... If you're going to all these trouble you'd probably just pirate it thru p2p anyway. Demitrius Harris Some people rather not steal, no matter the cost or savings. Impulse_Vigil You're misinterpreting my comment, I never justified stealing or pirating... Shoot I commented I'd be trying this out, I *still* buy BDs and even CDs. What I'm saying is that the companies behind this are aware there'll be a certain amount of people trying to game the system and they probably already crunched the numbers on potential losses... Plus they know that pirating a movie online is still much much easier, so they don't need to put so many safeguards on this system... Not that many people are gonna go around scanning barcodes with pretend addresses in order to steal online copies of a movie. Demitrius Harris Thank you for clarifying and yes, I misunderstood what you meant. HeyRadar Honestly, $2 (or $5.00) is a fair price for a media-less video anyway. Why digital and physical copies stayed the same price, was just price fixing. My1 I would agree if this is offline and without annoyances, but I have experienced too much of the bullshit happening there to believe that that would happen. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Or you could just do it yourself at home using Handbrake. FernandoRocker But you could theoretically stream the Vudu movies from anywhere, not just locally. Impulse_Vigil Yeah that's one advantage... Uploading a bunch of rips to a cloud account or streaming them from home is certainly possible but more of a hassle. slayer91790 Then that's were Plex comes into play. mog386 But with handbrake you can't get hd versions of your DVDs. With Vudu you can get the HDX copy for a bit more. Which is perfect if you have a giant DVD collection that you never got rid of... Like me. Matt But you can't take a picture of a dvd in a store and put the picture into Handbrake. Shagnscooby Headline probably shouldn't imply you can do your whole collection for free when you only get one. A bit click-batey. DEKKER Read again: "for a fee". marcusmarcus2 I hate how articles headlines are click-batey when I don't read them. How dare they. Reading is hard. /s SHunter Couldn't you jus go to the store and start scanning barcodes? Just price checking! /wink cajunflavoredbob Settings > Developer Options > Enable Mock Locations Yes. Yes you could. You could also do a Google Search at home for the DVD box art, which would get you the barcode at home. If they block mock locations, root users can move the mock location app to /system. However, for all this hassle of trying to game Vudu as a service, you could also download the films illegally and not be restricted to Vudu's service. Point is that there are always ways around the artificial road blocks set up by media companies. Illegal is illegal. Choose your poison. Nathan J Well, you're still paying $5 for HD or $2 for SD. The fact that you supposedly bought it on DVD doesn't really matter. I mean, does it really? You could have bought the disc used for however low. You could have borrowed it from a friend. The idea that they made money on the first sale of the DVD is beside the point. They're selling you access to a DRM-locked digital file for $5. It's not an unfair price for the consumer, and it's straight profit to the rightsholder. I don't think you can really cheat them, since you're paying either way. Unless it's the free copy, which I'm guessing Vudu pays for. But they're paying regardless, and they don't see a single rusty red cent of the DVD's initial sale, so it doesn't matter (much) to them. Or at least it shouldn't. Dan DeBartolo It's $2 for HD if you are scanning Blu Ray titles. $2/pop for 1080p titles that are viewable offline is pretty sweet. My1 you dont even need mock location, you also could just take a picture of the DVD with barcode and take a picture of that picture to scan the barcode, or you check google images. teh Jax Now I just need this to work on my HDDVD titles! jm9843 I did this in-store one time and they treated it like a DVD. So the 'conversion' to HD was a little more expensive ($5 instead of $2). teh Jax No shit?! That's pretty awesome! brararsh At first I read it as "Scan your DVD collection and convert it to digital for FREE". My Bad. :) Max Johnson Me too. Why the heck would I want to do it for a 'fee' when I can do it for free myself. enoch861 Well your first conversion is gratis. So there's that. Jeff Beck Keep in mind if you convert 10+ movies at a time you get a 50 percent discount, bringing the cost down to $1 a movie or 2.50 for an HD upgrade if you are using a DVD copy. I converted all the titles I could from my own library a couple years ago. I love not having to use discs anymore and my collection is available almost anywhere through VUDU. marcusmarcus2 Nice catch. Robert Preston It appears they sadly ended that promotion, finally. Josh The standard (long standing) 50% off for converting 10 titles at a time has now expired. Now, newcomers to D2D who use the mobile app to convert titles, get 50% off of 10 for their first conversion only. Previous users get 100% off their first mobile conversion, for a single title. Chris Griffin "Ok." - Plex users mjholtzem So it looks like this service is backed by UltraViolet, so that means discs that you convert with this service should be available on other UltraViolet clients such as Flixter right? enoch861 I believe so. But don't quote me on that. mjholtzem Any clue how that might work with "hdx" titles? enoch861 On other services it'll show up as HD since Vudu is the only one that has "HDX". As far as I can tell any Blu-Ray is redeemed as an HDX title. All my Blu-Rays I've redeemed (with the UV code) show up as HDX. mjholtzem If that's true this is actually pretty compelling Josh Yes, about UltraViolet and Flixster Video. Richard Branches Wish we could have this in other countries, I remember Vudu was planning to go internationally starting with Mexico but it didn't work out, which is sad 😞... Josh When I travelled, I was able to get it working with a VPN connection. Also Hola Unblocker worked in Chrome. Leonardo Baez Limitation of 100 titles per year.... But I have a 450 titles collection. (Dvds plus blurays) Jeff718 Pay again to have access anywhere without carrying around a DVD player. Nathan J Anywhere? So you can download the files for offline use and watch on an airplane? Or anywhere you have unmetered broadband access? Because there is a pretty big difference there. Not trying to be snarky here. I am unfamiliar with the Vudu service. I do have a couple movies up there. Since I started buying Blu-rays, a couple of them have had the digital HD option. (Pro tip, never do Google. They only offer SD copies. Found that out the hard way with Independence Day. Digital HD copy? Google is an option? Oh, Google only offers it in SD? And I can't change my mind and use Vudu instead? Well that sucks!) ProvoAggie They do allow offline playback. You can download them using the app on your tablet, phone or PC. Dan DeBartolo You absolutely can do offline playback. I download a bunch to my iPad Vudu app before hitting the road. The Ultraviolet linkage also means titles share between platforms like Flixster video, and it's Disney Movies Anywhere friendly. When the 50% for 10 or more titles was active I converted my entire DVD collection to HD digital at $2.50/pop. Some of the remastered prints are a pretty penny on their own, and to get some classics in HD was well worth it. The old SD DVDs age with time. It was a no brained for me. br_hermon I doubt it but... does VUDU allow you to download the files locally so you can store them and play them via VLC, Kodi, etc? Is there DRM? or is it proprietary, and you can only view them on VUDU's servers (streaming)? Japzone It's just like all the other VOD services like iTunes, Google Play, etc. You stream from them, and they have a few apps that support offline playback. Plenty of DRM layered on as required by Hollywood. Jeff718 I toss my cases and put my discs in a binder. Am I screwed if I want to use this service? HeyRadar You may not be able to use the smartphone app, but you can still use the service using a PC, or taking your discs to Walmart. Course, you could probably find the UPC on the internet. Josh Note that the in-store Walmart conversion service ends on April 1. Mr. Robot Sounds like there's no conversion involved. This company just sells you those movies in digital form for a lower price because you already own the physical discs. But the article misses some important information, f.e. what format you get and if there's DRM or not. I bet there is. Japzone It doesn't miss anything. This is clearly about Vudu, a popular VOD Streaming service owned by Walmart. Everything is streamed and DRM protected, with some apps that support offline playback. Just like every other VOD Streaming service out there that deals with Hollywood content. Mr. Robot Sorry, not everybody who reads AP is from the US. I have never before heard of this service and as I said, the word "conversion" is a bit misleading IMO. And even after your answer I still don't know the format. Is it h264, hevc, VP9? Japzone There is no user accessible format. The content is accessed like Netflix. You stream using their website or apps, and the apps have a DRM protected offline function so you can store videos offline for a flight or trip. The user never gets direct access to the files. Sorian >400 dvds and blu-rays.... yeah... that's expensive for now. RyanT I'd say about half of my collection came with digital copies, would be nice to eventually have the other half digital as well, not to mention upgrading those awful old DVDs. Motoinsistor It's live now, just showed up for me in settings pfmiller Doesn't work for me. Tried my free conversion and it app just "captures" your UPC before you even have a chance to line up the barcode. Even if you manage to get the barcode lined up in time it always reports that it can't find the UPC. Michael Scapp I tried this today, and I got an error message every time. Still buggy, hoping it gets better with updates. My1 is this thing US only? would be great to convert my anime collection over. but probably the digital version is either online only and/or riddled with DRM Skeeter P I added some the first night. Now I tried to add more and it keeps saying location has to be same as billing address. It won't work. I didn't move from night before?? Powered phone off. restarted. checked location Button nothing helps. Any ideas? Max Miller http://www.upcitemdb.com You're welcome...

Sweet butter, spring mix....ooo, bat mix. Gimme 10 of those. Image: justin sullivan/Getty Images By Maria Gallucci2017-04-09 23:25:27 UTC Two diners in Florida were munching on a prepackaged salad, perhaps enjoying the crispy crunch of lettuce, when they stumbled upon a strange ingredient. A weird crouton? No. Some ultra-GMO vegetable? You wish.  It was a bat. A dead bat. A dead bat was in their salad. Fresh Express recently recalled some salad mixes sold at Walmart stores after the unlucky customers found a winged creature plopped among the leafy greens.  SEE ALSO: Bed bugs were blood-sucking pests even 11,000 years ago The pair had already started eating some of the salad before they found the bat. Not gross enough? Well, turns out the bat was in such deteriorated condition that when U.S. health officials tried to test it in the lab, they couldn't definitively determine if that bat had rabies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Saturday. As if finding a decomposing creature in your food wasn't bad enough, the two people were advised to start post-exposure rabies treatment. Fortunately, the CDC said both people reported being in good health, and neither had any signs of rabies. Apparently, it's extremely uncommon to get rabies by eating a rabid animal (pro tip!) and the virus doesn't survive very long outside of the infected animal, the health agency said. Orlando-based Fresh Express on Saturday announced a precautionary recall of its 5-ounce Organic Marketside Spring Mix. The recalled salads came in a clear container with a best-if-used-by date of April 14. They were only distributed to Walmart stores in the southeastern region of the United States. Image: u.s. food and drug administration No other Fresh Express or Marketside salads were included in the recall. Fresh Express said that Walmart acted quickly to remove the spring mix product from its store shelves. Experts from the CDC are working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Florida Department of Health to crack this particularly unsettling food safety case.

In a report by The Guardian, the discovery led to an investigation conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see if the animal had rabies. The CDC is also working alongside the Florida department of heath and the federal Food and Drug Administration to find out how the hell a dead bat got inside a packaged salad. Related 17-Foot Burmese Python Found in Florida Everglades This Lion Wanted a Weekend of Freedom in Florida Florida Man Tries to Trade Baby for Food Even though the CDC claims that it is "extremely uncommon" for these individuals to have contracted any illness from the decayed bat, the agency is exercising extreme caution and looking into the matter. Fresh Express, the packaged salad brand which contained the bat, have issued a recall of their product sold in the southeastern part of the United States with a best-used date of April 14 and the production code G089B19. The company also released a statement stressing that they take "matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulation." The CDC implores customers who ate the packaged salad in question but didn't consume any "animal material” to reach out to Fresh Express to demand a full refund. The agency also used this incident to advise “anyone who ate the recalled salad product and found animal material in it [should] contact their health department for evaluation.” Leave it up to poor Florida to have yet another bizarre incident happen to someone from the Sunshine State. What oddity could possibly occur next? Just give it a week or two, and we will surely find out.

There's just one problem. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 08 April, 2017 21:00 - - - - print email Comments Cash registers are dumb. Why do we still have them? Invented in 1879 to keep saloon employees from stealing, the cash register combines the functions of a calculator to add up the purchases and a lockbox to keep cash safe. It assumes that retail employees have no verifiable way to add up numbers. And it assumes customers are paying in cash. Nowadays, most people have a smartphone and pay electronically. So the assumptions are gone. Yet cash registers remain. The success of online retail demonstrates that you don't need a Victorian-era contraption to sell things. You can do it all electronically. But brick-and-mortar retail stores have a problem that online stores don't: shoplifting. Without a cashier verifying the purchase and providing a paper receipt, it's hard to stop some people from just taking stuff and walking out without paying. The whole cash register model now represents a ritual that exists mainly as an anti-theft system. That sounds like an easy problem to solve. Turns out it's not. Why Amazon Go isn't ready to go Amazon Go is that company's latest concept for disrupting brick-and-mortar retail. The company's vision is that you shop normally, then just walk out of the store without waiting in a line or interacting with a cashier or point-of-sale system. Amazon The Amazon Go concept store watches you shop and lets you skip the cash register. Amazon Go is a single 1,800-square-foot store in downtown Seattle that sells groceries as well as prepared food that's ready to eat. Amazon Go also features "Amazon Meal Kits," which are pre-portioned ingredients with recipes, a concept similar to Blue Apron. The Amazon Go store is not open to the public. Amazon has been developing the store's technology for years and "beta testing" the store with employees for months. A report in The Wall Street Journal claimed that Amazon intended to open last month but delayed the launch because of technical issues. That's not surprising. Amazon is attempting something very bold and new. Amazon is using a combination of computer vision, sensors and deep-learning algorithms to know who's buying what. Amazon says that its patented "Just Walk-Out Technology" uses artificial intelligence (A.I.) comparable to the A.I. used in self-driving cars. Here's how the store works. When you enter, you scan a QR code on the Amazon Go app at the front door. That scan announces to the store's system that you're there and preemptively authenticates the purchases you're about to make. Then you shop. Amazon's "Just Walk-Out Technology" has one job: to figure out what you're taking out of the store. As you remove items from the shelf, A.I. uses multiple inputs to figure out what you grabbed. Cameras watch you take it. Scales built into the shelves provide data to calculate the weight of what you took. Amazon's patent filing suggests that the system may also refer to past purchases to help identify current ones. In other words, intelligent software analyzes a video feed to determine that you removed something from the shelf that looked like a cupcake. It considers data from the shelf, which is also a scale, and calculates that you took something that weighs about as much as a cupcake. And it checks your purchase history â it knows you're a cupcake-eating maniac. After all that input, the software decides that you took a cupcake off the shelf and adds it to your list, which is kept up-to-date in real time as you shop. If you place an item back on the shelf, the item is removed from the list. It's possible, based on patent applications, that Amazon intends to use both face and body recognition (metrics like height and weight) to continuously identify you when you wander around the store picking up items. Here's the best part: When you're done shopping, you just walk out of the store. As you leave, sensors at the door detect that you're exiting, and your Amazon account is charged for the items you got. It's like shoplifting, except you have to pay for everything you took. The technology is advanced. It may be too advanced. A Bloomberg report said the Amazon Go system becomes overwhelmed when the store gets crowded, and that it's relying on humans to supervise the A.I. to make sure it correctly identifies the foods it's charging for. (Amazon did not respond to my request for an interview.) It appears that Amazon's "Just Walk-Out Technology" makes a lot of mistakes, which is probably OK within reason. But it also may crash, bringing the whole system to a halt, which is not OK. Amazon dominates retail already. Walmart is a global retail giant worth $215 billion (the company's value based on stock price). By comparison, Amazon is worth $430 billion -- twice the value of Walmart. It seems like Amazon has a sweet deal going with online retail. Why would they want to enter into the brick-and-mortar space? The truth is that there are many items that consumers won't buy without seeing or trying them in person. Think of couches, for example. You probably don't want to buy a couch unless you can feel how comfortable it is. There are other items, such as your lunch, that are too perishable for shipping. Amazon has been trying a range of ideas for breaking into the $800 billion U.S. grocery industry. The Amazon Fresh delivery service is now available in 20 U.S. cities. Prime Now delivers groceries from local grocery stores in a few locations. Subscribe & Save lets people subscribe to buy paper towels and a range of other non-perishable but frequently consumed items for delivery like other Amazon items. A system like Amazon's "Just Walk-Out Technology" adds convenience to shopping. But the real revolution is a quantum leap in behavioral data. In the same way that companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook track every mouse movement, every click, every scroll and every hesitation while you're browsing the Internet, Amazon Go's system potentially brings that level of customer awareness to the brick-and-mortar space. They'll know if you hesitated to buy that cupcake. They'll know you spent three minutes browsing the burrito options without finding something you wanted. They'll know exactly how long you were in the store, which sections you checked out and of course what items you bought, exactly. It's likely that Amazon will open the Amazon Go store to the public sometime in the next few months. They will probably have to limit the number of customers allowed in the store at the same time. And the "Just Walk-Out Technology" will make a lot of errors for the next few years, requiring human supervisors to monitor and correct those errors. For the foreseeable future, Amazon Go will be a half-baked mirage. Amazon will accept losses resulting from errors as the price of learning how to do no-cashier retail. Eventually, the payoff could be huge. Once Amazon makes "Just Walk-Out Technology" reliable and relatively error-free, the company can roll out stores nationwide, then worldwide. Like self-driving cars, however, automated stores that really work are years away, and for the same reason: A.I. just isn't good enough yet. Starbuck's Mobile Order & Pay is hot, but still has grande problems Starbucks is also working on the elimination of cash registers and cashiers. The company's app enables a service called Mobile Order & Pay, where you can order anything on the Starbucks menu via the app and pick it up without interacting with a cashier. The company last week opened a mobile-only store at its Seattle headquarters. Here's the company's dirty little secret: Mobile Order & Pay doesn't really work that well. (Starbucks did not return my request for comment.) Sometimes customers place their order at the wrong store. I've done this myself a few times. That means the product is wasted at the wrong store, and the customer has to wait in line like everybody else at the right store. Other times customers pick up somebody else's mobile order by accident. (I'm a heavy user of Mobile Order & Pay, and I live in constant fear that somebody else will get my tall drip -- clearly my coffee order reflects who I am as a person -- and I'll get their pumpkin spice latte with 12 shots of coconut syrup.) Mobile Order & Pay can be great for coffee thieves bold enough to just grab somebody else's order. In stores where this happens frequently, the drinks are placed out of reach, forcing Mobile Order & Pay users to wait for a barista to give them their order. Starbucks executives have hinted that they're working on perfecting Mobile Order & Pay. But making it function as it should will take years â and the development of more advanced technology. While Mobile Order & Pay is worthwhile for Starbucks (because their long-line problem is bad, coffee is so cheap and errors are fast and cheap to make right), it actually doesn't work well and isn't exportable to other retail situations that aren't selling what is essentially flavored water. Apple's 'automation' depends on an army of employees Apple was the first major retailer to enable a smartphone-based system where you can pick your product and waltz out of the store without interacting with a cashier, launching their EasyPay self-checkout system years ago. The Apple Store app enables you to process your purchase as if you were buying online, then walk out of the store with the item. This system isn't especially replicable. Apple doesn't use advanced technology for this feature. And one benefit of self-checkout should include cost savings because fewer employees are required. But with Apple, the opposite is true. The system works to deter theft only because Apple Stores employ dozens of employees, often for stores that are really a small single room. Apple's system works for Apple because that company sells very expensive items at mass market scale, enabling them to afford an army of watchful employees. Automated retail is years away Amazon, Starbucks and Apple create the illusion that the era of automated, smartphone-based brick-and-mortar retail is here. The truth is that the technology behind these stores doesn't work nearly as well as it appears to. And the systems developed thus far can't be extended to the wider world of retail stores. Someday, stores will enable you to skip the cash register altogether. But for now, I just don't buy it.

Joslyn C. Harris, 19, was charged with seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance outside its original container. Police said they found Xanax on her. Officers went to the store about 4:30 a.m. to investigate reports that a woman was going through the parking lot, checking car doors to see if any were unlocked. Police said Harris told them she was trying to find her car, but was unable to furnish police with a license plate number, make or model.   Click here to see the comments. Add yours now!

News Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Archive Decomposed bat is found inside bag of organic salad from a Florida Walmart Sunday Apr 9, 2017 at 6:21 PM Avi Selk of The Washington Post As the Miami Herald would observe, Saturday's notice recalling an untold quantity of organic salad from Walmart stores across the southeastern United States "tiptoes around the batness" of the situation. Fresh Express' recall notice says only that, despite "a range of stringent controls … in place during growing and harvesting," some "extraneous animal matter" found its way into a single five-ounce container of Organic Marketside Spring Mix, somewhere on the continent. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the other hand, will tell you possibly more than you wanted to know. "Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found," reads the agency's notice of an investigation of the incident. The dead bat was turned over to the federal government. "The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies." That sounds bad, though the CDC offers reassurance that the chance of a live rabies virus making its way into the salad is very small. And the two people who ate the salad appear healthy. "Immediately upon notification of the event, Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams worked in close coordination with Walmart and regulatory authorities to launch an intensive investigation," a spokesperson for the company, which is owned by Chiquita of bananas fame, wrote in a statement to The Washington Post. "Based on all available evidence, we are confident this is an isolated incident."

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Two people in Florida reportedly made a grisly discovery while munching away at some Fresh Express’ Organic Marketside Spring Mix salad – a decomposed bat nestled amid the baby lettuce and radicchio. Story continues below The salad brand announced a “precautionary recall” of the salad from Walmart stores in the southeastern U.S. due to what it described as “extraneous animal matter” being “allegedly found in a single container of salad.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was more forthcoming about the species of the offending animal. “Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found,” the CDC revealed. The federal health protection agency added in its release that the bat’s corpse was being sent to a rabies lab for laboratory testing, because the animal’s “deteriorated condition” made it difficult to immediately rule out whether it had rabies. READ MORE: Here’s why your bagged salad is a food poisoning risk The people who ate the salad appear to be in good health, but are expected to undergo post-exposure rabies treatment as a precaution. Both Fresh Express and the CDC say there are no other reports of bats found in packaged salads. No other salads in Fresh Express’ product line are subject to the recall, although they may now be subject to increased scrutiny and caution from customers. It’s not the first time the salad brand has fielded complaints about unwanted protein sources in its offerings, as this Facebook thread reveals.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 April 2017 by Military News Public Relations Legend Al Golin Passes Away at Age 87 Built Global PR Powerhouse with Iconic Culture CHICAGO and SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Al Golin, the man who founded what has become one of the world's largest public relations (PR) agencies with a now-famous cold call more than 60 years ago, passed away peacefully Saturday, April 8 at his second home in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 87 and had never retired, continuing to provide counsel to his namesake firm, even in his final weeks. Widely regarded as a legend in his field, Al saw the role of public relations extending well beyond that of a "publicist."  While he understood the value of a well-placed news story, he thought more deeply about the responsibility his clients had as businesses in society. And he created the idea of a "trust bank," based on the belief that companies who established a meaningful presence in the communities they serve would have the support of those communities in good times and in bad. Al is survived by June Golin (nee Kerns), his wife of more than 55 years; their three children: Barry Golin (Gemma Brownhill), Karen Golin and Ellen Resnick (David Resnick); six grandchildren: Sam, Alex, Jackson, Kyle, Cydney and Marlena; and one great grandson, Thor. Al was born in Chicago on June 19, 1929 to Charles and Jeanette Golin. He had an older brother, Ted who passed away last year. Al spent his youth playing tennis, attending Bears and Cubs games at Wrigley Field just blocks away from the family home, and working at the movie theater owned by his father. Following several years as a publicist in the Chicago office of MGM Studios during the early 1950s, in 1956, Al became a junior partner in a public relations agency – Max Cooper & Associates and later Cooper, Burns & Golin and then Cooper & Golin. Al later became the sole owner of the agency, and renamed it Golin Communications, until 1978, when Tom Harris joined forces with Al to form Golin/Harris Communications. Today, that award-winning Chicago-based agency has grown to more than 50 offices and 1,200 employees worldwide, and is known simply as Golin. Its clients include some of the world's best-known brands, including McDonald's, Walmart, Unilever, Nintendo, Texas Instruments, Mondelez and many others. "I've spent half my life working with Al at Golin. He has been my boss, my mentor, and most of all, my friend," said Chairman Fred Cook. "Al loved this company, and his honest, humble, humorous approach to life and business made a huge impact on all of us.  We will strive to nurture the enduring legacy he created." It is the agency's longest-standing client, McDonald's, that best represents the indelible impression Al left on the industry. The agency's history is inexorably tied to that of McDonald's. In 1957, Al made a cold call to McDonald's Founder Ray Kroc and explained how public relations and community engagement could help Kroc grow his brand. Kroc invited Al to see him and quickly retained the agency for $500 per month, marking the start of a relationship that has spanned 60 years -- the longest lasting client-agency partnerships in public relations. In his time working with Kroc and every McDonald's leader since, Al was a trusted advisor who had a hand in creating or expanding programs that have become famous for both McDonald's and Golin – including Ronald McDonald House Charities™, the McDonald's All-American High School Basketball Game™ and The McDonald's All-American High School Band. "McDonald's owes Al a tremendous debt of gratitude for all he accomplished in his partnership with us," said McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook. "We have benefitted for decades from his wisdom and leadership, from his friendship and his support." Those closest to Al knew him as a kind, genuine and affable gentleman who paired humility and sharp wit with an uncanny instinct for engaging with the public to establish consistently effective PR campaigns. He published many of these successful business strategies in his book Trust or Consequences in 2003, which promoted trust as an essential element of brand equity, longevity and survival. "Ours was a remarkable partnership that became a great friendship," longtime business partner Tom Harris said. "I have enormous admiration for his professional accomplishments, but most of all for his personal qualities and total integrity. And for our enduring friendship." From the day he founded Golin and throughout his life, Al invested his heart and soul in his agency and its people. He often told people to "find a job you love and you will never work another day the rest of your life." He poured this ethos into his own work life, always making time to counsel clients and mentor agency staff. Al relished meeting with young new staffers and was a regular participant in educational programming for interns at the agency's Chicago headquarters. Al encouraged everyone in the agency to work with a strong sense of curiosity. He shared that same advice in speeches he gave to college students and new graduates. As a result, Golin's culture embodies a sense of collaboration, courage, happiness and dedication to delivering exceptional effort and service. In fact, Golin's tagline – Go All In – is an anagram of Al's name, in addition to a mantra for the agency's employees. In that spirit, the agency recently branded its culture "Courageously Happy", owing to Al's oft-quoted belief that "happy employees make for happy clients" and his stated desire that the agency's culture be his legacy. As a respected public relations legend, Al received abundant industry recognition, including lifetime achievement awards from the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), Publicity Club of Chicago and Inside PR magazine, the PRSA Gold Anvil Award and the Arthur W. Page Society Hall of Fame Award for "Career Achievements and Outstanding Contributions to the Profession." Al was the recipient of the Institute for Public Relations' Lifetime Achievement Alexander Hamilton Medal in 2009 and Roosevelt University's Distinguished Service Award in 2005. He also served for 30 years on the Board of Directors for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and for 16 years on the Board of Trustees for Roosevelt University in Chicago, the school from which he graduated in 1950. Al was named one of the 100 Most Influential Public Relations People of the 20th Century by PR Week, served as a PRSA Fellow and received honorary doctorate degrees from DePaul University and Roosevelt University. In 2014, Al was inducted into the PR Week Hall of Fame. His legacy lives on through McDonald's annual Al Golin Trust Bank Award, established in 1992, as well as Al's Day – a global day of service to honor Al's strong belief in giving back to the community. Each year around Al's birthday, Golin offices around the world close their doors and employees collectively participate in service activities to help make a difference in their local communities. At an Al's Day event in 2015, Al said, "Seeing our employees 'Go All In' together in support of such valued and beneficial organizations is more than I could ask for on my birthday each year." A memorial service will be held in Al's honor in Chicago on a date to be determined. In lieu of flowers, the Golin family has asked that donations be made in Al's name to Ronald McDonald House Charities, the Off the Street Club, the Goodman Theatre or Roosevelt University.

On Saturday, the company Fresh Express announced a precautionary recall of some of its prepackaged salad mixes, after two people in Florida say they found a dead bat in their leafy greens. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the two had eaten some of the product before finding the decomposed organism in a 5-ounce clear container of the Organic Marketside Spring Mix. But "out of an abundance of caution," Fresh Express says in a statement, all Organic Marketside Spring Mix salads from that production lot are subject to the recall. The mix in question was distributed exclusively to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the U.S. Walmart has since pulled the product from its shelves, the company adds, and no other Marketside salads are included in the recall.

Dead bat found in packaged salad sold in Florida  | CTV News Video Shows Canada World Politics Entertainment Sci-Tech Health Autos Business Sports CTV News Mobile CTV Search Search CTV News X Skip to Main Content Skip to Section Links Home Headlines Diet and Nutrition Fitness Body and Mind Lifestyle Advertisement Dead bat found in packaged salad sold in Florida A number of Organic Marketside Spring Mix salads recalled after a dead bat was found in a packaged salad sold at a Florida Walmart. (Pexels CC0) Misha Gajewski, CTVNews.ca Published Sunday, April 9, 2017 6:05PM EDT A “precautionary recall” has been issued in the U.S. for a number of Organic Marketside Spring Mix salads, after a dead bat was found in a packaged salad sold at a Florida Walmart. Two people in Florida reportedly ate some of the salad before finding the bat. The bat was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be tested for diseases. The CDC said in a statement that the “deteriorated condition” of the bat made it impossible to definitely say if the bat had rabies. However, they added that getting rabies by eating a rabid animal is “extremely uncommon”. The two people who ate the salad were told to begin a “post-exposure rabies treatment”. According to the CDC, neither has exhibited signs of rabies and both reported they were in good health. The salad recall was issued Saturday by Fresh Express, the producer and distributor of the packaged salads. “Out of an abundance of caution, all salads manufactured in the same production run are being recalled,” the company said in a statement. The salads were sold only in Walmart stores located in the southeastern parts of the U.S. Walmart said it has removed the product from store shelves. Fresh Express is also offering a full refund. ---- Recalled Product Details Organic Marketside Spring Mix - 5 oz. clear container Production Code of G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14 2017, located on the top label UPC Code of 6 8113132897 5 located on the bottom of the container next to the bar code Report Error MOST WATCHED false CTV National News for Sunday, April 9, 2017 Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV National News: U.S. escalates tensions Air Date: April 9, 2017 false Bodies of hikers found Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV News Special: Vimy Ridge Anniversary - Part 1 Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV National News: Vimy remembered Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV National News: 5 bodies recovered Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV National News: Egypt churches attacked Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV News Channel: 'Russia had very rude awakening' Air Date: April 8, 2017 false CTV News Special: Vimy Ridge Anniversary - Part 2 Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV National News: Students find their roots Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV National News: 'Two different audiences' Air Date: April 9, 2017 false CTV News Channel: Revisiting Vimy Air Date: April 9, 2017 More Stories from Health News Polluted London sets its sights on cars Hawaii LGBT couples seek equal access to fertility treatment Housing options help adults with autism find independence Dead bat found in packaged salad sold in Florida Care hours reinstated for B.C. woman with rare, painful disorder Nearly half of U.S. adults infected with genital HPV Join the conversation...

Two people in Florida say they found a dead bat in their food. The bat was sent to the rabies lab at the Atlanta-based CDC. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is assisting with a recall of salad distributed to Wal-Mart stores in the Southeast United States after two people in Florida discovered a dead bat in the food. The Food and Drug Administration issued a precautionary recall on Saturday for a limited quantity of 5-ounce packages of Organic Marketside Spring Mix, officials said in a news release. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease, the CDC said in a release.

All affected product was distributed in clear containers to Wal-Mart stores in the southeast, with UPC code 6 8113132897 5, the FDA said. The production code is G089B19 with a best-if-used-by date of April 14.

Posted By: Sunil Fernandes Updated: Friday, March 17, 2017, 9:30 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns Markets are not exactly cheap at the moment and it is difficult to find stocks that are good long term bets, as well as stocks that are low priced. Here are a few stocks that could be great buying opportunities in India at the current levels. They are low priced stocks that may not have a face value of Rs 10, though are inexpensive. Welspun India Welspun India is the world's second largest terry towel producer in the world. It is also among the top three home textile manufacturers in the world and the largest home textile company in Asia. The company supplies to to 17 of the top 30 global retailers across the wold including names like Bed Bath and Beyond, Macy's, Wal-Mart and JC Penney among others. 34% of FY16 sales of the company came from innovative products and 13% of FY16 sales from branded products. The promoters continue to have a solid holding of more than 73 per cent in the company. Huge potential for growth in Welspun India The company has a key market in the US, whose home textile market alone is worth $45 billion. India has some advantage in the export markets vis a vis markets like China on account of being the largest exporter of cotton and also having a 25 per cent surplus cotton, which is exported. All these play to the advantage of Welspun, which has a very large share in the terry towel market across the globe. In fact, India's share in the towel business has increased 10 per cent in the last 6 years. Welspun India: Excellent low prices stock with good fundamentals In the next few years, the company's flooring business which was recently set up will start driving growth, which should be a big positive. For the quarter ending December 31, 2017, the company reported an EPS of Rs 1.5, with a net profit of Rs 154.94crores. If we assume that it reports an EPS of Rs 10 next year (2017-18), the stock is not heavily priced at a p/e of just 7 times one year forward. A great low priced stock to buy at the current p/e levels. Check stock quote of Welspun here Gitanjali Gems The biggest trigger for this stock is that its subsidiary Nakshatra World has filed for an IPO. According to some unconfirmed numbers the company would raise Rs 650 crores. Nakshatra sells jewellery under the established brands of Nakshatra, Gili, Asmi, Sangini, Diya, Parineeta and Rivaaz. Gitanjali's own network of own stores, shop-in-shops and franchise outlets spans across 200 cities and 3,000 points of sale. We believe that going forward this company could improve its performance and the share price move higher. Low priced stock at low valuations and less risk The company has already reported an EPS of Rs 5 for the first three quarters and even if it does an EPS of Rs 6-7, the p/e of the company is barely 10 times. Gitanjali is planning to reduce debt and start the de-leveraging exercise. this should make it a great low priced stock to buy in India. Check stock quote of Gitanjali here       South Indian Bank This is one banking stock that has not seen a great rally. We believe that in the coming quarters the bank will improve its non performing assets a great deal. In fact, the stock is trading at a p/e of just about 7 times one year forward earnings. At Rs 20, there is nothing much to lose in South Indian Bank stock. Buy on declines this low prices banking stock.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Apr 9, 2017 at 12:47PM Of the many growth initiatives Target (NYSE:TGT) introduced during its most recent earnings call, two in particular show long-term promise. In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, we continue our discussion of Target's strategy shift. Learn why a focus on experiential shopping and newer store formats could be critical for the big box retailer's planned resurgence. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 4, 2017. Vincent Shen: They address certain things that resonated with me personally. Here's another quote from that call, they said, "Put a guest in the store, they are looking for inspiration, they enjoy discovery, they enjoy shopping. But very often a visit to Target.com, it's far more transactional. One item at a time, logon, check out, as fast as possible, friction free." I think that reflects a lot of the challenges that these brick-and-mortar operations face, which is declining customer traffic. That's affected the other industry we've talked about today, which is restaurants, especially with chain restaurants. You see less traffic at malls and shopping centers, and that has hurt a lot of the restaurants that are located near them, as well. But ultimately, the expression "friction free" speaks to a lot of people, younger consumers especially, who want to be efficient with their time, and technology overall has generally made shopping this very informed, competitive process, where you can price check, you can compare, at any time and place, and then press a button for very fast, often free delivery to your doorstep. Ultimately, the company is trying to think about what is going to get their shoppers out the door and into stores. They mentioned the importance of things like experiences, and how that can be addressed in two ways. You can either have a really wide breadth of offerings, like a Costco model, or the fact that Wal-Mart has expanded into groceries; or you have a convenience model where, even Amazon, the company that's putting a lot of pressure on Target, where they're opening locations for their pick up concepts. And now Target is pushing some of their smaller-store concepts. I think they have 30 of them in operation now. They've talked about doubling that base with another 30 stores this year, 40 more in 2018. Some of the things they've learned from this test location, I think it was in LA, they really want to expand the aesthetics of the store, update them, make them more of an attraction, more of a place that people want to go, to boost that traffic. So, on the more positive side, I hear things like that and I think that's the right move. But, again, some of the finer details when it comes down to how they're going to try and step up the business, especially, like you mentioned, the investments in the gross margin, what that means is basically, they're going to be discounting and trying to get into a price war, essentially, with other bigger retailers like Wal-Mart. And that's really not a place I think Target ultimately wants to be. Any last thoughts for Target before we move on? Asit Sharma: Briefly, I like going toward fact in this comparison, the great case that you've laid out, Vince. One thing that you said that I will grant is a method for Target to turn this more into fact than fluff, and that is that smaller store format. When it comes down to it, this future for brick-and-mortar retailers is about smaller spaces, so less fixed cost per square foot. When you have anchor stores and these very large 20,000 to 40,000 sq. ft. stores, you're competing against Amazon's and Wal-Mart's fixed costs, which are now in warehouses. That's where they are investing their dollars, in technology warehouses and distribution. By experimenting with these smaller stores, which are more experiential, I think Target might have a way to turn some of this fluff into fact. I think it's a great point that you make. I also do think their brand resonates more than other brands. I think they have an edge over Wal-Mart, and it is a brand that customers, if you give them something to come into the store for, they'll return. So, there are some positives here. Still say fluff, but there is at least a narrow path to getting back to fact for Target. We'll see what 2017 brings. Shen: Absolutely. I think this is a company that both investors and consumers are rooting for. They want to have that reason to shop with Target. Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon and Costco Wholesale. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Chris Lee TNS Fresh Express recalled its Organic Marketside Spring Mix from Walmart stores in the Southeastern United States Saturday. 1 of 2 i By David J. Neal dneal@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Fresh Express recalled its Organic Marketside Spring Mix from Walmart stores in the Southeastern United States Saturday because a dead bat was found in a packaged salad in Florida. As the U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s recall chart notes, if there’s the possibility of bat body parts, there’s a “minimal risk of rabies contamination.” The CDC says it’s working with the FDA and the Florida’ Department of Health to investigate situation. While Fresh Express’ recall notice tiptoes around the batness — “Fresh Express was notified that extraneous animal matter was allegedly found in a single container of the salad” — the Centers for Disease Control indulges no such subtlety on its website: “Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease. The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies.” The CDC did say the risk of rabies transmission in this is very low, but not zero so the organization recommended the two eaters of the too-organic salad begin treatment as if they’d been exposed to rabies. Both report good health so far, according to the CDC. As for the recalled product, it comes in a five-ounce, clear container. The Best By date is Apr. 14, 2017 with production code G089B19. Customers can toss it or return it to the Walmart of purchase. Those with any questions can call the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center 1-800-242-5472 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time.

Fresh Express announced a precautionary recall of its 5 oz. Organic Marketside Spring Mix. The mix was marketed in a clear container with production code G089B19 and the best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 located on the front label, and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 located on the bottom of the package. The dead animal was discovered in a package purchased in Florida. The salads were carried at the retailer’s stores across the Southeastern region of the United States. After lab testing, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not determined whether the bat in the salad had rabies. Fresh Express says anyone who has purchased the recalled product should throw it away. If you’ve already eaten this salad and did not find suspicious material, you are not at risk and there is no need to contact health authorities. A full refund is available where purchased or by calling the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center toll-free at 1-800-242-5472 between 8 am and 7 pm Eastern time.

Neal The Miami Herald LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Fresh Express recalled its Organic Marketside Spring Mix from Walmart stores in the southeastern United States Saturday because a dead bat was found in a packaged salad in Florida. South Carolina is included in the recall. As the U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s recall chart notes, if there’s the possibility of bat body parts, there’s a “minimal risk of rabies contamination.” The CDC says it’s working with the FDA and the Florida’ Department of Health to investigate situation. While Fresh Express’ recall notice tiptoes around the batness – “Fresh Express was notified that extraneous animal matter was allegedly found in a single container of the salad” – the Centers for Disease Control indulges no such subtlety on its website: “Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease. The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies.” The CDC did say the risk of rabies transmission in this is very low, but not zero so the organization recommended the two eaters of the too-organic salad begin treatment as if they’d been exposed to rabies. Both report good health so far, according to the CDC. As for the recalled product, it comes in a five-ounce, clear container. The Best By date is Apr. 14, 2017 with production code G089B19. Customers can toss it or return it to the Walmart of purchase. Those with any questions can call the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center (800) 242-5472 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time. In addition to Walmart stores in South Carolina, these salads went to Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia as well as Florida. But only Florida’s managed to pull a bat out of the salad hat.

An exhibit of political posters at Oxford Performing Arts Center features presidents William Howard Taft and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. "It’s fine to pray for a good harvest as long as you keep plowing." This witticism is an insight that American singer Patti LaBelle believes in. It’s one of the sayings that the older people in her family used as they were passing on their wisdom. It’s a truth she shares with readers in her book "Patti’s Pearls," and it’s one she has practiced in her career. Evidently, she has never quit plowing. At age 71, Patti is still going strong with a glow and sparkle in her stage presence. You might say that she and the Knox Concert Series, now celebrating 72 years, have grown up together musically and have continued working, year by year. LaBelle will perform for the Knox Concert Series on April 22 at 7:30 p.m. at the Anniston Performing Arts Center. Tickets are $75 for general admission or $95 for reserved seating. For tickets, call Mandi King at 256-235-2553. LaBelle was selected for this concert because she is a good example of the celebrity status of artists that Knox is known for. "Her music is timeless and spans across cultures, genres and generations," said Mary Beth Prichard, Knox executive director. "She is a classic songstress with a contemporary presence," added Patricia Smith, chairman emeritus of the Knox board of directors. LaBelle is more than a singer. Besides writing books on living joyfully, she also writes cookbooks and has launched her own brand of sauces and marinades called Patti LaBelle’s Good Life. She is also famous for her signature sweet potato pies, sold at Walmart. A contestant on "Dancing With the Stars" in 2015, she has also acted in stage and screen productions and at least two television series. She got her singing start as a choir member at Beulah Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Pa. She was lead vocalist for Patti LaBelle & the Bluebelles, then later for LaBelle, before becoming a solo artist. LaBelle was the first group to play at the Metropolitan Opera House and the first African-American group to be featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Winner of two Grammys, LaBelle has been called the Queen of Rock and Soul. She was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1993 and continued releasing popular albums throughout the 1990s, including "Flame" (1997) and "Live! One Night Only" (1998). Ruben Mitchell, band director at Anniston High School, is eagerly awaiting the concert. "To me, Patti is one of the top vocalists in the country," he said. "She’s a living legend with a voice both strong and delicate. She has a real ability to draw you in with her songs." Charter Night at Knox Concerts Patti LaBelle’s concert on April 22 will also be the time to sign up for Knox Concerts’ 2017-2018 season. Charter Night is the night when patrons make a commitment to support another season and to encourage the organization’s volunteers. Knox announces three concerts, with more to be finalized: •October: Kenny Loggins, Grammy-winning country and rock songwriter, guitarist and singer. • January: The Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra, one of Sweden’s oldest orchestras. • March: Dublin Irish Dance a dance troupe of world-champion Irish step dancers with a traditional Irish band and vocalists. During the charter campaign, which continues through May 31, general admission season tickets are $155 for adults and $85 for students under 24 years old. After May 31, the adult prices are $180 and remain at $85 for students. Patrons who sign up early receive a $25 discount, a "thank you gift" and are included in a drawing for dinners at fine area restaurants. Political poster exhibit at OPAC It is quiet inside the Martin-Lett Gallery of Art in the Oxford Performing Arts Center, but the artists’ visual language is at its loudest and most compelling. When you view the "American Political Posters 1844-2012" exhibit, you can imagine the presidents and presidential candidates speaking directly to you, as well as the conversations — or debates — those messages might inspire. The posters, which came to OPAC through the Mid-America Arts Alliance, are arranged chronologically. They are borrowed from the Library of Congress, historical societies and private collections. If the candidates did not capture our votes, it is likely that most illustrations caught our eye. Campaign posters were of vital importance in the days before television. The display is as educational as it is colorful. It explores the design trends and printing technology represented in effective communication. Research guides in the gallery are available for questions that may come up about these political figures. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and William Howard Taft were the presidents I focused on when viewing the posters. Roosevelt, disabled with polio and unable to walk without skilled assistance, was elected president four times. The public never knew the extent of his disability, and that was what FDR preferred. Taft first served the country as president, then as chief justice. At heart, he never wanted to be president; above all, he wanted to be a justice of the Supreme Court. It was at his wife’s request that the mayor of Tokyo presented about 3,000 cherry trees to the American people, which are now planted in Washington, D.C. The exhibit of political posters will be up through April 30. Hervey Folsom writes about the local arts scene every Sunday. Contact her at herveyfolsom@yahoo.com.

On Saturday, the company Fresh Express announced a precautionary recall of some of its prepackaged salad mixes, after two people in Florida say they found a dead bat in their leafy greens. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the two had eaten some of the product before finding the decomposed organism in a 5-ounce clear container of the Organic Marketside Spring Mix. But "out of an abundance of caution," Fresh Express says in a statement, all Organic Marketside Spring Mix salads from that production lot are subject to the recall. The mix in question was distributed exclusively to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the U.S. Walmart has since pulled the product from its shelves, the company adds, and no other Marketside salads are included in the recall. Florida health officials, the FDA and the CDC have launched an investigation into the matter. Due to the animal's decayed condition, the CDC couldn't immediately rule out whether this particular bat carried rabies, but recommended the two people who ate the contaminated salad receive treatment for the disease. "Both people report being in good health and neither has any signs of rabies," the CDC says. The deadly rabies virus is endemic to bats across the U.S., but is rarely contracted by humans. And, as the CDC points out, transmission through consuming an infected animal is "extremely uncommon." The agency adds that it hasn't heard of any other cases of bat material found in packaged salads. "People who have eaten the recalled salad product and did not find animal material are not at risk and do not need to contact their health department," the CDC advises.

The bat was sent to the CDC after it was found in a bag of Fresh Express Organic Marketside Spring Mix. "The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies," the Atlanta-based agency said. The CDC said the risk of rabies transmission was extremely low but not zero, so the two people who ate salad mix were recommended for treatment as a precaution. They are fine and show no signs of having rabies, the CDC said. Fresh Express has recalled packages of the salad mix that were sold at Walmarts in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The affected product has the production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of Apr 14, 2017 on the front label, and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 on the bottom of the container. "Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation and initiate product removal and recall procedures," Fresh Express said. There have been no other reports of animal matter. The Florida Department of Health, US Food and Drug Administration and CDC are part of the investigation into the dead bat.

Harpreet Grover was at a crossroad last year -go it alone or get acquired. His hiring assessment company, CoCubes, which had 600 customers and $2 million in funding from Ojas Ventures, was in acquisition talks with HR consultancy and long-term customer, Aon Hewitt. But a private equity fund was offering a $10 million funding round. "It was a difficult decision -join a big firm or take the funding and stay independent," says Grover. Finally, the Gurgaon-based company chose acquisition by Aon in an all-cash deal. "We wanted to go global. If we wanted to reach that end goal faster, we had to join a bigger firm," says Grover. Overnight, CoCubes had access to 10,000 companies through Aon's resources. As innovation becomes key to the way business is done, legacy firms are taking the merger and acquisition (M&A) route to leverage the latest technology from smaller startups. According to analytics firm Tracxn, almost half of the 45 M&A deals between a tech startup and a larger offline player happened in or after 2015. This reflects a global trend: In 2016, US retailer Walmart purchased online store Jet.com for $3 billion, while General Electric's software division bought ServiceMax, a cloud-based provider of software used in inventory and workforce management, for $915 million. Automakers such as General Motors and Daimler have taken large stakes in ride-sharing applications, including Lyft and Hailo. The number of technology companies sold to nontech companies in 2016 was more than those sold to tech enterprises, The New York Times reported in January this year citing data compiled by Bloomberg. In India too, large organisations are seeing the benefits of engaging with lean and agile startups that can bring innovation faster with shorter turnaround periods for solutions. "Acquisitions are happening for niche technology that a large organisation with legacy systems would take ages to build on its own, or for rele vant tech talent that can work on cuttingedge solutions with in-house expertise, or to make inroads into new market opportunities," says K S Viswanathan, vicepresident, Nasscom. Nasscom has started a programme to connect large enterprises with emerging product tech companies in India. Over 600 B2B product tech startups and 32 large enterprises, including Hindustan Unilever and banks like ICICI, HDFC and Axis, are part of the programme. Finding the right partners Fino Paytech, a financial technology company founded in 2006 in Mumbai with plans to start its own payments bank, is a startup that has learnt the value of partnerships with larger non-tech companies. Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) picked up a 21 per cent stake in Fino Paytech for Rs 250 crore in July 2016. BPCL uses Fino Paytech's digital solutions to simplify payments for customers, while Fino leverages BPCL's network of outlets in rural and urban areas to facilitate banking access for customers. Earlier this year, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and ICICI Lombard acquired a 10 per cent stake in Fino Paytech for Rs 118 crore. Fino Paytech founder Rishi Gupta says partnerships are the only way forward."We have partnered with a lot of firms and have always been the smaller partner.Big non-tech companies need to build a scalable model but costs are enormous if they get down to building their own technology stack," he says. Mohan Kumar, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, says companies scout for startups to acquire through in-house accelerators. "Non-tech companies have started setting up incubators and accelerators to find startups working on tech that will benefit them, like Target for retail, SwissRe for insurance and Wells Fargo for banking. These have five or six companies that they mentor actively at any point in time. For a startup, this is very valuable since they have access to domain knowledge and key people. The company benefits by having access to latest technology and entrepreneurs who can direct energy towards solving their key problems," says Kumar. Good for growth Forty-year-old healthcare giant Piramal Enterprises, which acquired health analytics company Searchlight Health two years ago, has a corporate development group in Boston to look at early-stage companies. "The two businesses (Piramal and Searchlight) collaborate in areas including creation of analytic tools, capturing data regarding the Indian healthcare system and creating new solutions for client needs. Searchlight Health brings extraordinary technology and engineering skills to Piramal," says Jonathan Sandler, CEO, decision resources group, which is part of Piramal Enterprises. For Godrej Nature's Basket, the food store chain owned by the Godrej Group, the acquisition of online grocery store Ekstop helped them grow their business."With the acquisition of Ekstop, we have seamlessly integrated our own web presence with the new platform and made the offering for consumers far more robust and convenient. Ekstop's technical capabilities have given us the technological edge adding significant value to our online business," says Avani Davda, managing director, Godrej Nature's Basket. There are challenges to working with legacy companies, especially for startups that are used to quick decision-making and working with smaller teams. "Business processes are definitely longer [in a legacy company]. A solution first has to be put together on paper and sometimes many people are involved," says Fino Paytech's Gupta. Sometimes decision-making takes several months and that becomes frustrating, he says. "When you are building technology, it has to be fast. It was an issue earlier, when projects would be delayed. Now, non-fintech players have realised that they need to be quick," Gupta says. "They are open to understanding and moving quickly."

Two years after Freddie Gray's death, residents are still waiting for change Decision delayed on Eldersburg zoning Jon KelveyContact ReporterCarroll County Times The Carroll County Planning and Zoning Commission agreed to table until this summer a proposed zoning amendment that would allow for a larger commercial development on a property off Liberty Road in Eldersburg, but also affect similarly zoned properties in the county. The change was proposed in February by J. Brooks Leahy, an attorney working for the developer and property owner Louis Mangione, who would like to develop a 15.56-acre property on Luers Avenue into a shopping center that would potentially be anchored by a Lidl grocery store. The property is currently zoned Neighborhood Retail Business, or BNR. Currently, the site includes a few residences but is largely vacant. That zoning change is opposed by the owners of Freedom Village Shopping Center, anchored by a Shoppers grocery store and represented by attorney John McGuire. Both attorneys presented their cases to the Planning Commission during an, at times, colorful meeting on Wednesday. That's one reason the commission decided to table the discussion for the time being, according to Chairman Matt Helminiak. "When we reconsider it, we wouldn't be having the attorneys for and against make arguments here," he said. "It's a rule change that affects the entire county, and you don't want it to be about a specific business." Before 2006, Helminiak said, there were two business zoning districts in Carroll County, Business General, or BG, and Business Local, or BL. In 2006, the then-Board of County Commissioners converted all the BL zoned parcels to BNR, according to Helminiak, and then they further restricted the size of any commercial developments on those lots to 10,000 square feet or less. Freedom Plan accepted, moving process to public comment Jon Kelvey Next step is 60-day public review period Next step is 60-day public review period (Jon Kelvey) This created a problem, Helminiak said, because "it made a whole bunch of existing building nonconforming, like the old Carrolltowne Mall," where the Eldersburg Walmart shopping center is now located. This "mistake" is what the current board of commissioners unanimously voted to correct in January 2016, granting a zoning change for the Luers Avenue site parcel that would allow Mangione to proceed with development. McGuire filed for judicial review on behalf of the owners of the Freedom Village Shopping Center and a Carroll County Circuit Court decision in September vacated the commissioners' earlier decision. That case is being appealed. Another reason the BNR zoning can be seen as a mistake, Helminiak said, is the reason the previous board had changed the zoning and placed the 10,000-square-foot restriction was to prevent a business person from creating a specific business in the Finksburg area. It's not good zoning policy, he said, to use zoning to restrict specific businesses any more than it is to encourage a specific business. "If somebody were to come in and say, 'We would like to have this location rezoned because it would be great for a coffee shop and a high-end steak house,' zoning rules say you can build anything that is acceptable within that zoning category," Helminiak said. "Even if they did put in the high-end steak house, it could go out of business and be replaced by anything else." At Wednesday's meeting, Planning Commission members took issue with McGuire, who argued the opening of another grocery store across the street from Shoppers could imperil jobs through competitive pressure. "From a business standpoint, it sounds like you are trying to eliminate competition," said commission member Alec Yeo. "Our society is based on competition." Leaving aside the poor origins of the BNR zoning restrictions, they're also problematic in that they discourage efficient development of the larger parcels now zoned BNR, said Carroll County Director of Planning and Management Phil Hager. Long Term Advisory Council takes shape Jon Kelvey Carroll County's Long Term Advisory Council met for the third time Thursday, bringing together for the first time all of the community partners involved.

Carroll County's Long Term Advisory Council met for the third time Thursday, bringing together for the first time all of the community partners involved. The council was formed as a purely advisory body designed to provide forward thinking and context on the 10-, 15- or 20-plus year timescale to... (Jon Kelvey) "If you have a 1-acre property and you develop a commercial site on one-quarter of an acre, the rest becomes your parking ... that's not too bad," he said. But a 10,000-square-foot building on a multiacre site is not the best use of the space. The broader context for this debate, Hager said, is that as part of the recommendations of the Carroll County Master Plan, the planning office is working on updating the county zone code, such that the old BG and BNR categories will be replaced by C1, C2, and C3 zoning categories. County staff should be finishing up that work, detailing how the old categories will map to the new, in the next 60 days. Leahy's text amendment — which would affect all BNR zoned parcel's in the county, not just the Luers Avenue parcel — initially suggested increasing the size of commercial sites to 40,000 square feet, Hager said. After it become clear that these sites would likely map on to the new C2 zoning, with a 100,000-square-foot building restriction, Leahy amended his initial amendment, presenting it to the Planning Commission Wednesday. The Planning Commission ultimately decided to wait and see how things look after staff completes the zoning work, Helminiak said. "We didn't want to make a decision with regards to BNR that would sort of be temporary since we would be replacing BG and BNR with C1, C2 and C3," he said. "So even though we were positively inclined to increase the size restriction, we didn't want to put that in before the changes went through." jon.kelvey@carrollcountytimes.com 410-857-3317 twitter.com/CCT_Health Caption 2017 Maryland General Assembly opens Governor Larry Hogan and Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Michael Busch opened up the 2017 Maryland General Assembly.

Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease. The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies. Transmission of rabies by eating a rabid animal is extremely uncommon, and the virus does not survive very long outside of the infected animal. CDC is supporting Florida local and state health officials in evaluating the people who found the bat in the salad. In this circumstance, the risk of rabies transmission is considered to be very low, but because it isn’t zero, the two people who ate salad from the package that contained the bat were recommended to begin post-exposure rabies treatment. Both people report being in good health and neither has any signs of rabies. CDC is not aware of any other reports of bat material found in packaged salads. On April 8, 2017, Fresh Express issued a recall of a limited number of cases of Organic Marketside Spring Mix. The salads were sold in a clear container with production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 located on the front label. The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States (AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, VA). All remaining packages of salad from the same lot have been removed from all store locations where the salad was sold. Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it.

More than half (52%) of retailers surveyed for recent research by analyst house Ovum and European payments provider Klarna, cited checkout as the main point in the shopper journey for consumers to fall out. "This data shows that simple things such as a tricky checkout process or lack of payment options can turn off today's consumers," said Luke Griffiths, UK General Manager, Klarna. "But there is much to gain for retailers who get this right - consumers will spend more if the payment process is smooth and stress free." To this end, it's interesting to note Visa Checkout's success. Visa Checkout provides online shoppers with a quick and frictionless method of payment. Visa announced last week that Visa Checkout now reaches more than 20 million accounts and an increase of big brand names, such as Marriott, Walmart, Emirates and Avis Budget, joining the platform. "Visa Checkout continues to simplify the online checkout process for consumers, while helping merchants increase sales and convert items in the cart to completed purchases," says Sam Shrauger, senior vice president, digital solutions, Visa Inc. Earlier this year, yStats' 'Global Alternative Payment Methods: Second Half 2016' report revealed that the combined share of alternative payment methods globally accounts for a higher share of ecommerce sales than traditional credit cards. In the coming years, through 2020, yStats forecasts that credit and debit card share will further decrease while use of alternative payments will continue to rise. The top alternative online payment method is e-wallet, accounting for close to one-third of global ecommerce sales. It is also the second most-used payment method for cross-border online shopping. Other prominent alternative payment methods include bank transfer, direct debit, cash on delivery, payment by invoice and in-store payment.

REUTERS/David Gray By Charlotte Greenfield and Aaron Bunch | WELLINGTON/SYDNEY WELLINGTON/SYDNEY As China's middle class develops its taste for imported food and drink, fresh produce suppliers in New Zealand and Australia are topping up nature's bounty with anti-counterfeiting technology in a bid to protect their growing business from fakes. Suppliers of goods from fruit to wine and lamb are teaming up with makers of tracking systems, codes and powders to combat fakes that cost the global food business billions of dollars. As tech tools become cheaper, services like China's popular WeChat smartphone app are also being deployed, offering consumers a free scanning ally to work out what's on Chinese store shelves. Smaller players like meat company Silver Fern Farms and Synlait Milk have tapped local tech firms like Dunedin's Oritain, which measures food isotopes as a checkable 'fingerprint'. But Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is also in on the act with a pilot Blockchain-based tracing system, signing up Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra and Australian vitamin supplier Blackmores as partners. "We see the Australian and New Zealand markets setting the tone for the rest of the world when it comes to integrity, safety and quality of food supply chains," said Maggie Zhou, Alibaba's Australia and New Zealand managing director, in comments published to mark its project launch at a late March Canberra ceremony. "It was a natural decision to pilot a programme here." Dislodging counterfeit food, now a well established business of its own, presents no small challenge. Fraud costs the global food industry an estimated $40 billion a year, Alibaba said, citing research conducted by Michigan State University. In China, $1 billion in counterfeited goods was seized in 2014, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition. "Categories that are faked so regularly are the (fresh produce) ones where New Zealand and Australia are strong," said Mark Tanner, director of Shanghai-based China Skinny, a firm that advises Western businesses operating in China. But firms in Australia and New Zealand are prepared to go to increasing lengths to protect sales they rely on for growth. New Zealand's total exports to China have quadrupled to NZ$12 billion ($8.62 billion) since 2007, most of them being food and beverage products. Australia agriculture exports to China were worth around A$10 billion ($7.67 billion) in 2016, double the amount five years earlier. QUICK RESPONSE Widespread use of apps like WeChat, owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings, and developments in technology like machine learning have made it easier and cheaper for smaller tech firms to develop anti-counterfeiting technologies. That lower cost base has brought what tracking systems that were previously solely in the realm of multinational giants like HP and Walmart within reach of the small to mid-level firms that are the backbone of the food and drink business in New Zealand and Australia. Oritain charges customers NZ$300-700 per isotope test product, while for from around NZ$200 a month, Auckland-based Trust Codes supplies a machine-learning algorithm that can pull data from consumers' phones in China when they scan a product's encrypted Quick Response, or QR, packaging code. At Auckland manuka honey firm Oceania Natural, Chief Executive Walker Zhong said he used his knowledge of Chinese consumers' shopping, social media habits and liking of convenience in building Oceania's own scanning system at a cost of NZ$1 million. Backed by a Chinese insurer, Oceania Natural's tool revolves around WeChat - which Zhong knew Chinese consumers would already have on their smartphones - sending an alert if the scannable code on product has been used before, indicating in one step whether it's genuine. "China consumers...they don't like to use two steps or three steps to verify your product is genuine," said Zhong. Pitfalls remain. Packaging can be tampered with, or even faked, and that many exports like meat are still sent to China in bulk shipments without any packaging for consumers at all. "The only real way of knowing is testing the actual product," said Sam Lind, operations director at Oritain. "We're at the whim of counterfeit packaging just like anyone else."

Oritain charges customers NZUS$300-700 per isotope test product, while for from around NZUS$200 a month, Auckland-based Trust Codes supplies a machine-learning algorithm that can pull data from consumers' phones in China when they scan a product's encrypted Quick Response, or QR, packaging code. At Auckland manuka honey firm Oceania Natural, Chief Executive Walker Zhong said he used his knowledge of Chinese consumers' shopping, social media habits and liking of convenience in building Oceania's own scanning system at a cost of NZUS$1 million. Backed by a Chinese insurer, Oceania Natural's tool revolves around WeChat - which Zhong knew Chinese consumers would already have on their smartphones - sending an alert if the scannable code on product has been used before, indicating in one step whether it's genuine. "China consumers...they don't like to use two steps or three steps to verify your product is genuine," said Zhong. Pitfalls remain. Packaging can be tampered with, or even faked, and that many exports like meat are still sent to China in bulk shipments without any packaging for consumers at all. "The only real way of knowing is testing the actual product," said Sam Lind, operations director at Oritain. "We're at the whim of counterfeit packaging just like anyone else."

It was small — maybe 1,000 square feet total — and architecturally simple, almost like a cartoon. It had this lovely stone exterior, the kind that the newer Virginia estates try to clone for hundreds of thousands of dollars extra, sometimes beautifully, but usually awkwardly. The house sat contently in the least-residential-friendly area with an un-shingled roof and an A.C. unit dangling out the front window like a bored teenager. A wire fence hugged the house, punctuated by haphazardly sized wooden posts. The house is interesting, I guess, in the way that if you describe any building idyllically it becomes interesting. Let’s be clear here: it was a rather unremarkable house. Except almost everyone in town knows that house. If you live in my zip code, you know the house. If you’ve driven through my zip code, you probably know the house, because it used to be absurdly ornamented. The entire property was peppered with antiques and lawn decorations that were different every time you drove by, yet always maintained a constant visage of busyness. The house glistened as you drove by, a result of the sun beating down on several swirling silver windmills and brass chimes. There were a gaggle of ceramic baby cows circling a decorative wooden well, enough birdbaths for every bird in the mid-Atlantic and banners welcoming spring, welcoming fall, welcoming the holidays, welcoming goodness knows what. Our town, which used to be a just a handful of farms and was once entirely burned down by Union troops, has been suburbanizing since the turn of the millennium. In 1995, the population was around 500. Today, it’s quadruple that, with every patch of grass being sold as a lot for a new cookie-cutter house. The cookie cutter is such a fitting analogy for those semi-suburban developments; they are all, in essence, the same house, decorated ever-so-slightly differently. Different developers give you different cutters, depending on your taste. My best friend from middle school and I effectively live in the same house, only hers is on the other side of the street. It makes it easy to find the bathroom and hard to feel special about the place where you live. The house on the highway had always been here longer than I had. Probably longer than I had been on Earth. It’s seen a hospital erected just across the street and a controversial Walmart built just down the freeway. The house has seen the roads expand so much that it could nibble on the highway asphalt. It’s old. Old, absurd and memorable. Several years ago, there was buzz of expanding the interstate and fixing the janky ramp that had been cause for countless accidents. The connection never quite hit me, but afterwards the house began to strip itself of its ornaments. As I grew older, it grew increasingly naked. Last week, I finally noticed it was gone. Torn down to make room for the ramp.   Pegah Moradi is a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Related SCHULMAN | Showing Empathy (Better Late Than Never) By Eric Schulman 4 hours ago Gingrich and his supporters made me question that faith a little bit. Their lack of empathy towards gender equality shocked me. In the most confrontational part of the event, someone asked whether women get respect in Washington (considering the current president’s record on respecting women). He wrote off the concern with a joke about locker room talk to which the audience chuckled. It was uncomfortable. BYRNE | Five Childhood Activities that Never Paid Off in Real Life By Sarah Byrne September 11, 2013 As a junior, I feel like I’m getting perilously close to entering what some might call the “real world,” what others might call “adulthood,” and what I call “scary.” With this old age comes a (very) small bit of wisdom, and I feel that I can now confidently assess some of the decisions I made earlier in life. I’m not sure about everyone else, but I know that I definitely used to take everything way too seriously. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The bat was sent to the CDC's rabies lab for further testing, but the CDC said the animal's "deteriorated condition" did not allow for them to "definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies." To be on the safe side, Fresh Express has issued a recall of a small number of cases of its Organic Marketside Spring Mix, which the CDC says may have been distributed to Walmart stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The affected salad is sold in a clear container with the production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 on the top label. On the bottom of the container, UPC Code 6 8113132897 is printed by the bar code. Catherine Garcia   CDC: Bat found in packaged salad prompts recall 1:08 a.m. Tweet-right Edit The alt-right's views of Trump are getting kind of complicated after his Syria strike 2:47 a.m. ET   When President Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian government air base Thursday night, in retaliation for a chemical weapon attack Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces had carried out on civilians in a rebel-held town, America's political factions were scrambled. Some officials in former President Barack Obama's administration joined GOP congressional leaders and many commentators critical of Trump in praising the strike, while Trump's core supporters on the alt-right and critics on the left criticized the attack. Alt-right leader and noted white nationalist Richard Spencer led an anti-Syria-war march in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, and Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at Alex Jones' InfoWars who broke with Trump over the attack, debated one of Trump's biggest supporters on Twitter, Bill Mitchell, who supported the strike. But like Mitchell, many of Trump's supporters on the alt-right did not like the alt-right's criticism of Trump, as Watson's Twitter feed demonstrates. Here's a sampling: I guess Trump wasn't "Putin's puppet" after all, he was just another deep state/Neo-Con puppet. I'm officially OFF the Trump train. — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 7, 2017 First time I've ever lost Twitter followers.

Fake news. — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 7, 2017 I did flounce a bit I admit, but passions were high and I genuinely think this is a bad move. Doesn't mean I'm suddenly Michael Moore. https://t.co/mRg2WUM4hd — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 7, 2017 WTF happened to https://t.co/C176uzY4UY? Not wanting Trump's presidency to be destroyed by another ME quagmire isn't "abandoning Trump". — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 9, 2017 The alt-right movement opposes more military intervention or "regime change" in Syria because, like the left, they fear it could lead to another Iraq-style quagmire, and unlike the left, because they want the $1.5 million spent on each Tomahawk missile to be used on a Mexico border wall and mass deportation of immigrants. "If the alt-right's core ethos could be reduced to a single maxim, it would be this: to each his own," writes Osita Nwanevu at Slate, in an analysis Spencer called "fairly objective." That attitude undergirds the movement's "support for racial and cultural separation and white nationalism," Nwaneyu said, but "it is also the attitude that undergirds the movement's less widely discussed isolationism." That isolationism, it seems, has its limits when it comes to Trump. Peter Weber   The alt-right's views of Trump are getting kind of complicated after his Syria strike 2:47 a.m. investigations Edit 21st Century Fox will investigate sexual harassment claim against Bill O'Reilly 2:45 a.m. ET   Spencer Platt/Getty Images 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, announced on Sunday it will investigate a sexual harassment claim against anchor Bill O'Reilly that was phoned into a hotline run by the network. Wendy Walsh, a psychologist who once frequently appeared on The O'Reilly Factor, and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, posted a video online last week showing the pair calling the corporate hotline and making a complaint against O'Reilly. Walsh says that in 2013, O'Reilly walked back his offer to get her a job on the network after she rejected his invitation to go back to his hotel room. In a statement, 21st Century Fox said it "investigates all complaints" and has asked a law firm to "continue assisting the company in these serious matters." Last week, The New York Times reported that Fox News and O'Reilly have paid $13 million to settle with five women who have accused the host of sexual harassment and verbal abuse. O'Reilly said he is being unfairly targeted because of his status, and has not mentioned the scandal on his show. In the aftermath of the report, several major companies, including Mercedes, BMW of North America, and T. Rowe Price, have yanked their ads from airing during The O'Reilly Factor, the top-rated cable news program. Catherine Garcia   21st Century Fox will investigate sexual harassment claim against Bill O'Reilly 2:45 a.m. It wasn't all bad Edit Special Easter eggs let blind children participate in egg hunt 2:02 a.m. ET   iStock In Bakersfield, California, 22 children tackled an Easter egg hunt in an unexpected way — instead of looking for the eggs, they listened. The kids, between the ages of 3 and 13, were all blind and visually impaired, and for the second year in a row they went on an early Easter egg hunt featuring plastic eggs specially designed by the Bakersfield Police Department's bomb squad. The eggs were outfitted so they would make beeping noises, which the children would follow. The kids exchanged the eggs they discovered for snow cones, popcorn, candy, and other treats, and they all went home with individualized Easter baskets. Gaylene Roberts, a principal who oversees education for the blind and visually impaired, said for kids who have difficulty seeing, egg hunts are the type of experience they typically don't get a chance to have. For them to be able to participate in a traditional event in an innovative way, "you can't really put a value on it," she told The Bakersfield Californian. "It touches the hearts of all of us." Catherine Garcia   Special Easter eggs let blind children participate in egg hunt 2:02 a.m. Freeze! Edit Trump's federal hiring freeze is starting to hit veterans, Social Security recipients 1:14 a.m. ET   Olivier Douliery - Pool/Getty Images On Jan. 23, President Trump signed an executive order instituting a 90-day federal hiring freeze, as the first step in a "long-term plan" to cut the federal workforce. It's unclear how far along that plan is, but 79 days into his presidency, the effects of Trump's freeze are already being felt at government agencies like the Social Security Administration, the Veterans Affairs Department, and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday — and the public is starting to feel the reduced staffing levels, too. Federal agencies lose about 10 percent of their workforce each year, and the VA has an unusually large 45,000 positions unfilled. VA Secretary David Shulkin exempted jobs tied to processing benefits claims in mid-March, six weeks into the freeze, but there are now more than 100,000 claims awaiting processing. Veterans have also been hit hard, The Journal notes, because the federal government often hires them after their military service. At the Social Security Administration, an inability to replace the workforce after departures, combined with a rise in claims as baby boomers retire, has led to longer lines at offices and on the phone. "The agency is doing things they never did before, like sending people home without any service," Witold Skwierczynski, president of a union that represents 25,000 Social Security employees, tells The Wall Street Journal. "You can't just establish a hiring freeze and expect us to continue to do all our work." At the U.S. prisons bureau, about 10 percent of positions are vacant, and the widespread shortages are forcing prison guards and medical personnel to work overtime and at higher personal risk. According to USA Today, nurses, physical therapists, and other medical staff — many of whom belong to the uniformed U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and have no training for security in overcrowded prisons — are being forced into guard and security duties. (USA Today also noted that despite the terrible conditions face by workers and inmates, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons awarded more than $2 million in bonuses to wardens and top administrators over the past three years.) The result of Trump's hiring freeze, WSJ says, is that "in attempting to fulfill one campaign promise — to 'drain the swamp' and reduce the size of the federal government — Mr. Trump is potentially undermining other promises, including his pledges to champion veterans and law enforcement."

Parliament now needs to approve the measure, which will permit authorities to search homes and make arrests without warrants. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blasts Palm Sunday at St. George's Coptic Church in Tanta, which killed 27 people, and outside of St. Mark's Coptic Church in Alexandria, which left 17 people dead. Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population.

Sgt. Justin Antle of the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office received a call about a hurt bird near Lake Afton, and he found the eagle, clearly injured and unable to fly more than 10 feet in the air before having to come back down to land. Antle enlisted the help of Ken Lockwood of the Eagle Valley Raptor Center, who on his way to the lake stopped by the Sedgwick County Fire Department and picked up firefighters to assist in the rescue. After following the bird for two hours, they were finally able to capture him. The eagle, estimated to be about 3 years old, is now being tested at Kansas State University's veterinarian school and being fed by handlers. Once the bird has a clean bill of health, Lockwood said he will ask the team to come back together to release him in the wild. "It's an eagle — that's our national symbol," Lockwood told ABC News. "You just have to go rescue them. You can't just let it die."

Supreet Kaur reported that three people died and two were injured when an SUV and truck collided in Pithora. As more images and details started to come in, including the type of car involved and the site of the accident, she began to worry about her husband of 18 months, Harshad Kawade, who drove a similar vehicle and was in the area. "She was doing her job, and she kept on doing it with composure and without showing her emotions on air," IBC24 editor-in-chief Ravi Kant Mittal told CNN. After Kaur went off the air, it was confirmed that Kawade was one of the victims in the accident, and she broke down, the station said. Dr. Raman Singh, chief minister for the state of Chhattisgarh, tweeted his appreciation of Kaur's "strength in dealing with her husband's demise with extraordinary bravery and professionalism."

And I want out of here’: The Americans who want to flee to Canada Chico Harlan, Washington Post | April 9, 2017 | Last Updated: Apr 9 8:47 PM ET More from Washington Post Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo? More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon CAPE BRETON ISLAND — The first sign of what Rob Calabrese would come to think of as America’s unmooring began last year, just after Donald Trump won his first presidential primary and Calabrese published a $28 website that he’d designed in 30 minutes. “Hi Americans!” it began, and what followed was a sales pitch for an island where Muslims could “roam freely,” and where the only walls were those “holding up the roofs” of “extremely affordable houses.” “Let’s get the word out!” Calabrese wrote, adding a photo of an empty coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. “Move to Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins!” It was meant as a joke – but seven hours after Calabrese linked the site to the Facebook page of the pop radio station where he works as a DJ, in came an email from America. “Not sure if this is real but I’ll bite.” And then another: “It pains me to think of leaving, but this country is beyond repair.” And then more. Within 24 hours, there were 80 messages. Within a week, there were 2,000, and many used the same words: “nervous” and “terrified” and “help.” “The United States is losing its mind,” one person wrote. “So ashamed of half of my country I could curl up and cry,” wrote another. The emails kept coming, so many that soon the island’s tourism association brought on four seasonal workers to help respond to the inquiries, which were arriving from every state and hundreds of towns, until it seemed to Calabrese that America was filled with people who wanted to get away. “Look at this one,” he said one day recently, scrolling through a spreadsheet where the inquiries were organized and stopping on No. 2,121. “I am a former U.S. Marine who did two tours to Iraq. And I want out of here.” “Beyond astonished,” Calabrese said, scrolling through more. There were emails from a molecular biologist, a University of Oregon professor, a granite construction worker, a contractor for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a woman who said her home town was “Unfortunately, Alabama.” There were declarations and confessions about incomes, sexual orientations, goals for their children. Several included résumés. “I am so sick of what has happened to my beautiful country,” one letter began. “I desperately want to move my daughters to the safety and sanity of Canada,” email No. 3,248 read. “It doesn’t even really matter if Donald Trump wins. He has exposed the awful attitude that plagues the US.” I desperately want to move my daughters to the safety and sanity of Canada “This is no longer the America I have loved for all my life,” email No. 3,310 read. “I am a hardworking man and could contribute much to any country that gives me a chance.” It was somewhere around email 4,230 that Trump was elected president of the United States, and just before his inauguration came email No. 4,635. “Looking to immigrate to Cape Breton area from Colorado,” it began. “I am a skilled paralegal and my wife is an attorney.” Calabrese read it, wondered briefly about the people who sent it, and waited for the next one to come in. “What do people see on the horizon to be this afraid?” he said. * * * The email was written by Jimmy Gantenbein and Cathleen McEwen from their living room sofa in Loveland, a town 50 miles north of Denver. A month later, furniture from that living room had been stuffed into the garage. Paint buckets lined the hallway. They’d been in touch with a real estate agent. Soon they planned to have their home on the market. “Can you hand me a nail?” Cathleen, 61, asked as she fixed up the bedroom. “Here you go, Cat,” Jimmy, 54, said. They’d bought this home at the start of their marriage – the second for Jimmy, the third for Cathleen – and 17 years later they knew the place nearly as well as they knew each other. They had a view of the Rocky Mountains from the bedroom. Afternoon sunlight warmed the carpet where their old poodle liked to curl up. Two right turns and a left took them to the local Safeway. “We’re going to love it here,” Cathleen remembered saying on one of their first spring nights, after a neighbour’s 50th birthday party ended with outdoor cartwheels. They lived on a cul-de-sac with two other homes, and Cathleen spent a few years on the city council. They made friends with Democrats and Republicans. When Cathleen’s son, an Army reservist, returned from Iraq in 2005, 150 people showed up at the local veterans’ hall for barbecue and beer. There was a short period when they rented out the home and moved to a more commercial part of the city, hoping to improve their business. But they returned as soon as they could, and even as they aged, and faced some health problems, and their business slowed, this place remained the closest thing to a constant in their lives. And then came the arrival into their settled world of Donald Trump. He was on TV so often that Jimmy and Cathleen created a no-Trump rule after 9 p.m. He was in their town, holding a rally 10 miles from their home that drew an overflow crowd. He was in their neighbourhood, his name popping up on yard signs all around them. During primary season, it felt as if he’d arrived at their own front yard, when their neighbor saw them in the driveway, walked over, and said he was supporting Trump. We’re going with Bernie, Jimmy and Cathleen recalled saying, and though the conversation was brief and cordial, they hadn’t talked to their neighbor since. “We feel out of sync with everybody,” Cathleen was saying now. Just that morning, signing onto Facebook, there was a post written by her friend Pam, somebody she’d known for 13 years, telling Muslims to “grow a pair” and “defend the country they immigrated to and assimilate!” She thought for a few minutes about what to do and then punched out a response, telling Pam to “put the same mental energy” into researching the Muslim faith “that you put into your diatribe.” Then came the back-and-forth among other people, 19 comments, no minds changing. “People are in a frenzy to out-anger,” Cathleen said, and she read the comments aloud to Jimmy. She’d had 400 Facebook friends before Trump. Now she had 288. “It’s just that Trump mentality,” Jimmy said. I haven’t been very good at peacemaking lately. It’s making me a worse person “We can’t have a conversation with anybody,” Cathleen said. “We try to engage, but it’s usually . . . ” “Disastrous,” Jimmy said. “Yeah,” Cathleen said. “I haven’t been very good at peacemaking lately. It’s making me a worse person. You know, if you can’t rise above it. But I can’t totally resist.” She went on: “I don’t know what to do constructively. It’s a crisis of purpose.” And so, they were thinking of leaving. It’s not that they had never thought of moving – they’d talked before about finding a cheaper place as they aged – but when Trump came along, that’s what pushed them. To where, though? Just move closer to your grandchildren, Cathleen’s son, an accountant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said. Just don’t leave the country, Cathleen’s daughter, a doctor in Toledo, Ohio, remembered telling them. “Don’t give up so quickly. Now more than ever, good people need to fight for what matters.” But Jimmy and Cathleen didn’t see it as giving up. Instead, they felt America becoming so off-kilter, so “angry” and “bigoted” and “regressive,” that they thought maybe the moment required an absolute break. “I don’t recognize the country I was born in,” Cathleen said. “I was born into a narrow-minded, anti-intellectual country. It took me 61 years and one election to figure it out.” So now, they also had a “Relocation” folder on their computer filled with information about Panama and Belize and Costa Rica and Canada. They’d bookmarked the Cape Breton website and set up Web alerts for real estate listings on the island. They’d talked to an immigration lawyer in Canada. “I’m so glad they aren’t around to see this,” Jimmy said, in the living room now, where there were two folded funeral flags honoring their veteran fathers. “It just keeps getting worse,” said Cathleen, who keeps a framed copy of the Gettysburg Address on the basement office wall. So many decisions to make. Would they sell off their stuff? Would they give up their citizenship? Would they be able to repair damaged relationships with their children and grandchildren? And if they made it to Cape Breton, would they feel regret? They knew it was cold. They knew homes were cheap. But they’d never been there. Related Brain drain: Brexit and Trump have top-notch academics fleeing — and Canadian schools stand to gain National Post View: Preparing for a border crisis is the most important job the Liberals have now A crisis is coming: If this many cross the U.S. border in February, how many will come by June? “It’s risky to stay and risky to go,” Cathleen said, and now they were back in the bedroom, hammering in new baseboards and fastening new light switch covers. “Maybe,” she said, “the pragmatist wins out.” “Maybe,” he said, “we rent for a while and figure things out.” Cathleen put down the screwdriver and sat on the carpet. “We don’t have a clue,” she said. “We’re in a quandary,” he said. Their dog was sleeping. Soon, their real estate agent would be calling. Homes sold fast in Loveland. Eight weeks and there’d be a “for sale” out front. So, maybe Cape Breton. * * * Maybe Cape Breton, and maybe the house whose listing Valarie Sampson, a real estate agent who’d heard from a handful of Americans, was looking at now. Right on the ocean. A renovated farmhouse. One hundred forty-four acres of land. $220,000 Canadian, or $164,000 U.S. On the market for more than three years. Winter viewings, the listing said, “require snowshoes.” “It’s a beautiful home if you’re looking to escape,” said Sampson, climbing into her SUV and steering through an island that people don’t come to anymore but instead have been choosing to leave. Once rich in coal, mining had dried up and no industry yet had replaced it. Every year, another 1,000 people were either dying or taking off for larger cities such as Toronto or Halifax. Budgets were shrinking. Ten schools had closed in the last year. The island’s unemployment rate was 15.5 percent. The population was down to 130,000, and that left Cape Breton with hundreds of abandoned homes awaiting demolition and several hundred more for sale. Navigating streets narrowed by high snow, Sampson turned into a neighborhood of simple vinyl-sided homes near the shuttered coal mines. “This one has been on for months,” she said. A few minutes later: “$149,000 for this one. We haven’t had one viewing.” Sampson knows that summers here feel different. The tourists arrive. The lobster and pizza restaurants reopen. The lakes fill with sailboats. “The geography is second to none,” she said. “A one-hour drive in any direction will take you to the beach.” But for four or five months of the year, this is a place with short days, frigid temperatures and icy sidewalks, where people play backyard hockey or gather in little bars and doughnut shops. As Sampson returned to the office, the only activity in Sydney, the island’s largest town, seemed to be a meeting of community leaders who were talking about how to save the island. “We don’t get people, we’re going to die,” Rankin MacSween, head of a community development group, was saying. “These are huge losses against an already small population,” a lawyer said. “It doesn’t take much math to realize how much time is left.” People passed around a five-page research paper that said the island needed to attract 2,000 people annually to remain viable. There’d been decades of failed attempts to rebuild. The island had one new thing going for it – the website. More people knew about Cape Breton now. “We’re receiving thousands of emails,” one person said at the meeting. But that wasn’t the same as thousands of people moving there. Canada had strict immigration laws. People couldn’t just come because they wanted to. Applicants were scored based on age and skills and their ability to help the economy. Anybody who emailed Cape Breton was told they still had to apply through Canada’s immigration agency. They were sent a link to begin a process that could take more than a year. So maybe some Americans would arrive someday, but they hadn’t yet. As the responses rolled in, Calabrese had revised the site’s text to make it less political – and less directed at Americans specifically. “The truth is,” Calabrese had written, “we welcome all, no matter the ideology. Join us!” “We need to be thinking about this,” the lawyer said as the meeting was winding down. “What kind of person would come here?” * * * One answer to that question could be found just past the meeting hall, in a house that had been stripped of wire and abandoned for a year and now had a family of seven inside, all of them from Syria. School had just ended. The television was on. The kids were squeezed on a couch. “What are you drawing?” the father, Ahmad Hamadi, 35, asked one of his sons, Mohamad, who is 10. “It’s a Pokemon,” Mohamad said. He held up the drawing for a father who eight months after arriving was still sorting through what it meant to have left a country he loved. “It looks good,” said Ahmad, and then he turned back to the television. These were the people moving to Cape Breton: refugees from the Syrian war who not only left their country but had to flee it. Fifty-four had come so far, and Ahmad and his family were among the most recent. After escaping Syria and spending several years in Lebanon, they had ended up here because of the sponsorship of a church group waiting for them on an island they’d never heard of. They’d been traveling for 48 hours: Beirut to Cairo to Toronto to Cape Breton. They landed at 1:30 a.m. They were shuttled into a van, and when the sun came up Ahmad found himself in a house stocked with food and furniture and toys, all of it his and none of it familiar. Compared with where he had come from, it was quiet outside. The electricity worked. The children went to school. Ahmad pinned a small Canadian flag to the front door, and every day he walked out was another chance to adapt to a new place. He applied for positions at Value Village and a building supply company, where an interpreter helped him with the interviews, but he didn’t land either. He asked about an entry spot at a Lebanese restaurant, but the owner didn’t want somebody without experience. Months passed with nothing. He got a driver’s license. He lifted weights at the YMCA to burn stress. He thought about applying for a late shift at McDonald’s, but one of the leaders from the church committee that sponsored him said he should instead ramp up his English and become more employable. So twice-a-week government-funded English classes became four-a-week, and for Ahmad the sessions became his best excuse to leave the house: a two-mile drive across town to a community center classroom, where the names of Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories were written on the chalkboard. “How are you?” the teacher, Susan Burchell, asked as Ahmad walked in. “Bored,” he said. “Bored?” she asked. She addressed the grammar instead of the sentiment. “It’s good you didn’t say boring,” she said, and when he didn’t say anything, she asked, “What do you want to do today?” “Nothing,” he said, shrugging. “Learning?” “What did you do last week? Talk to me about it.” “Shopping,” he said. “I went to Walmart. We went to Tim Hortons. And we went to my friend.” “Do I know this friend?” “An old man. From Lebanon.” “Anything else?” He shrugged again. Before the war, in a town outside of Damascus, Ahmad had owned a small department store. He’d lived on the same street with his parents and three siblings. He met friends for late-night shawarma and chicken at restaurants. He had fled four years ago, and now his family was scattered across three continents. Among his five closest friends, he figured four were dead. The restaurants were just as likely rubble, something he thought of when he opened up Facebook and saw videos of charred and ruined street blocks. Had he known those places? Could he recognize them now? He’d built a home for his family in 2010, ceramic tiles in the kitchen and the apricot trees out front. Was that home, too, part of the rubble? He’d heard it might be. “One day I had a car, a house, a business, a life,” Ahmad said. “The second day I lost it all.” Ahmad had the best fortune of almost anybody he knew, and yet because of the changed fortunes of a country he loved, he was here, looking out at a yard with five-foot snowdrifts and a horizon with an early-setting Canadian sun. He sat down on a chair and rubbed his aching back. “Can you grab me some Advil?” he asked his daughter, Aya. She reached into a cabinet and handed him a pill. Ahmad’s hair was greasy, and stubble covered his neck and face. “A fish out of water, they die,” he said as his wife prepared lunch in the kitchen. The smell of hot oil filled the air. Ahmad swallowed the pill, drank some tea, and waited for the ache to go away. * * * “Cat, did you see that!” Cathleen and Jimmy were driving back at dusk from a window-screen repair shop when a big white owl soared in front of their car, and soon they were at home talking about the owl that used to live in their front yard, the elk that would roam out back, and how this has always been their favorite time of year. Every spring on the cul-de-sac, they’d crack the windows open, hear birds in the spruce tree, see the crocuses and gray hyacinths sprout from the fresh mulch in front of their house. Sundown came later. They’d barbecue. They’d see the neighbors more. And sometimes, they’d take off for road trips in their SUV: heading east across the plains and into the Ozarks, or maybe west, over the mountains and past the Continental Divide, finding lakes for fishing and stopping at fruit stands and sleeping in whatever motel they could find. “So long as it wasn’t flea-ridden,” Jimmy said. “We didn’t have any plan,” Cathleen said. “We’d just kind of wing it.” “Remember the Black Canyons?” Jimmy said. “Remember those cliffs?” Cathleen said. “The Million Dollar Highway?” Jimmy said. There was a knock on the door. Their home inspector. In two weeks, the house would be on the market, and as soon as it sold they’d be on their way – first to visit their children and, after that, they’d have to see. Maybe a drive through America would remind them of things they were forgetting. The inspector shook their hands and walked in. He carried a measuring tape, a notebook, and tools in a zippered pouch. He checked on the things that would be used by whoever lived there next – the furnace, the hot water heater, the electrical boxes – and moved through the rooms that now looked as though nobody had lived there before. No more family photos. No more artwork. Almost two decades of things boxed away. “So,” he asked, “where are you guys moving to?” There’d been a run of 60-degree days in Loveland, and meanwhile in Cape Breton, the temperatures were near freezing, forecasters were saying another eight to 11 inches of snow were on the way, and the emails were still arriving, a couple every day. “I can no longer live here, nor sleep with this evil man as our leader,” one person wrote. “History repeats itself and I can feel a repeat of the Third Reich,” another wrote. “I am heartbroken seeing our America be torn apart . . . by one, out-of-touch billionaire,” another wrote. “Please help me,” another wrote. Calabrese read every word, and as he waited for the snow to arrive, and the Americans to arrive, and email No. 4780 to arrive, he thought about how fortunate he was to live in a place where he wants to be.

Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email NEW YORK -- Several agencies have joined forces as part of an investigation into the discovery of a dead bat that was allegedly found in a packaged salad in Florida, authorities said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a media statement that two people reported eating some of the salad before finding the animal. Authorities say the bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for testing. “The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies,” the statement indicated. Following the incident, Fresh Express issued a recall on Saturday of a limited number of cases of Organic Marketside Spring Mix out of an abundance of caution. What to look for on recalled product: Organic Marketside Spring Mix -- 5 oz. clear container Production code of G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14 2017, located on the top label UPC Code of 6 8113132897 5 located on the bottom of the container next to the bar code According to the CDC, the salads were distributed to Wal-Mart stores located in the Southeastern region of the U.S. States where salads may have been distributed: Alabama Florida Georgia Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Virginia For more information, call (800) 242-5472 during the hours of 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET.  Officials stressed that those who have eaten the recalled salad and didn’t find animal material aren’t at risk, and don’t need to contact their health department. The CDC also mentioned in its release: Fresh Express takes matters of food safety very seriously and rigorously complies with all food safety regulations including the proscribed Good Agricultural Practices. In addition, a range of stringent controls are in place during growing and harvesting to mitigate against field material from entering the raw product system. In manufacturing, additional controls including thorough washing and filtration systems as well as visual inspections that are designed to eliminate unwanted debris. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

(BBBY) Stock Before It’s Too Late BBBY stock is jumping on better-than-expected Q4 numbers, but Wall Street is ignoring the long-term trend Apr 6, 2017, 1:55 pm EDT  |  By Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Contributor Get AMZN alerts: Submit     Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) headed higher on Thursday after the company beat expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings. However, today’s rally in BBBY stock feels like a dead-cat bounce back to where shares traded just a week ago. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr While the headline numbers beat, the trend is down, and Bed Bath’s current attractive multiple will go nowhere but up. I think the right move is to fade the rally here. What’s Wrong With Bed Bath? The headline numbers: Bed Bath’s Q4 revenues climbed from $3.4 billion a year ago to $3.5 billion, matching estimates. Meanwhile, the bottom line shrunk from $1.91 per share in Q4 2015 to $1.84 per share — but that was still enough to beat expectations for $1.77 per share. The market is focused on Bed Bath & Beyond’s top-line story, which is gaining momentum. Comparable-store sales were up 0.4% in the quarter, ending a multi-quarter streak of negative comps. Actual brick-and-mortar sales are still weak, but strength in the digital channel is finally outweighing store declines. The positive comp trend from Q4 is expected to continue. Management guided for Bed Bath & Beyond to comp positive next year. Sales are expected to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range. For a depressed retailer like BBBY, that’s great, and the stock is responding positively. But the market is missing the fact that the resurgent top-line story is being fueled by high spend. Digital sales are soaring. Some of that growth, though, is a result of BBBY sweetening the pie for consumers on the shipping front. Competing with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) on free shipping perks is tough to do, but BBBY has tried its best. This is driving digital sales growth, but it’s also forcing Bed Bath & Beyond to absorb higher DTC shipping expenses. That is weighing on gross margins, which compressed 600 basis points in Q4 and are expected to continue to deleverage next year. Bed Bath & Beyond is also spending more on advertising to drive sales growth. Meanwhile, wages are rising. Together, advertising ramp and wage hikes are driving the SG&A rate significantly higher. BBBY management expects this SG&A deleveraging to continue next year. What was a 26.5% SG&A rate in 2015 is moving ever closer to 30%. All together, margins are compressing at a rapid rate. Although sales were up 3.4% in the quarter, diluted EPS was down 3.7%. A lot of that was actually driven by aggressive share buybacks. Excluding those buybacks, net income fell 11.5% year-over-year. With BBBY, then, investors are looking at this huge disconnect between 3.4% sales growth and an 11.5% decline in net income. This disconnect will only widen next year. Sales are projected to be up at a similar rate, and EPS is projected to be down as much as 10%. Bottom Line on BBBY Stock As an investor, though, I always look at the value. Bed Bath stock trades at 8.5 times trailing earnings, which is cheap at first glance. But that $4.58 in trailing-12-month EPS is expected to compress by as much as 10% next year. Say that happens, and earnings come in next year around $4.10. If BBBY stock stays sideways for 12 months at $39, the trailing price-to-earnings multiple would be 9.5. It’s not bad, but it’s not grand — especially considering the company’s bottom line is contracting. I don’t see Bed Bath turning things around. Shipping perks and higher ad spend are driving sales growth. Management will continue to have to absorb higher costs in those areas to maintain a steady top line. At the end of the day, revenues will grow slowly and margins will compress rapidly. That isn’t a good combo. I say fade the rally, and look for better value elsewhere. As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

They also had to deal with a shoplifting incident at Wal-Mart. The weekend kicked off with a hit-and-run before 5AM in a McDonald’s drive-thru. Keep up the good work, Richland Police Department!

Source: Reuters/David Gray 8Social Buzz AS China’s middle class develops its taste for imported food and drink, fresh produce suppliers in New Zealand and Australia are topping up nature’s bounty with anti-counterfeiting technology in a bid to protect their growing business from fakes. Suppliers of goods from fruit to wine and lamb are teaming up with makers of tracking systems, codes and powders to combat fakes that cost the global food business billions of dollars. As tech tools become cheaper, services like China’s popular WeChat smartphone app are also being deployed, offering consumers a free scanning ally to work out what’s on Chinese store shelves. Smaller players like meat company Silver Fern Farms and Synlait Milk have tapped local tech firms like Dunedin’s Oritain, which measures food isotopes as a checkable ‘fingerprint’. But Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is also in on the act with a pilot Blockchain-based tracing system, signing up Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra and Australian vitamin supplier Blackmores as partners. “We see the Australian and New Zealand markets setting the tone for the rest of the world when it comes to integrity, safety and quality of food supply chains,” said Maggie Zhou, Alibaba’s Australia and New Zealand managing director, in comments published to mark its project launch at a late March Canberra ceremony. “It was a natural decision to pilot a programme here.” Dislodging counterfeit food, now a well established business of its own, presents no small challenge. Fraud costs the global food industry an estimated US$40 billion a year, Alibaba said, citing research conducted by Michigan State University. In China, US$1 billion in counterfeited goods was seized in 2014, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition.

But firms in Australia and New Zealand are prepared to go to increasing lengths to protect sales they rely on for growth. New Zealand’s total exports to China have quadrupled to NZD12 billion (US$8.62 billion) since 2007, most of them being food and beverage products. Australia agriculture exports to China were worth around AUD10 billion (US$7.67 billion) in 2016, double the amount five years earlier. Quick response Widespread use of apps like WeChat, owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings, and developments in technology like machine learning have made it easier and cheaper for smaller tech firms to develop anti-counterfeiting technologies. That lower cost base has brought what tracking systems that were previously solely in the realm of multinational giants like HP and Walmart within reach of the small to mid-level firms that are the backbone of the food and drink business in New Zealand and Australia. Oritain charges customers NZD300-700 per isotope test product, while for from around NZD200 a month, Auckland-based Trust Codes supplies a machine-learning algorithm that can pull data from consumers’ phones in China when they scan a product’s encrypted Quick Response, or QR, packaging code.

Source: Reuters/David Gray At Auckland manuka honey firm Oceania Natural, Chief Executive Walker Zhong said he used his knowledge of Chinese consumers’ shopping, social media habits and liking of convenience in building Oceania’s own scanning system at a cost of NZD1 million. Backed by a Chinese insurer, Oceania Natural’s tool revolves around WeChat – which Zhong knew Chinese consumers would already have on their smartphones – sending an alert if the scannable code on product has been used before, indicating in one step whether it’s genuine. “China consumers…they don’t like to use two steps or three steps to verify your product is genuine,” said Zhong. Pitfalls remain. Packaging can be tampered with, or even faked, and that many exports like meat are still sent to China in bulk shipments without any packaging for consumers at all. “The only real way of knowing is testing the actual product,” said Sam Lind, operations director at Oritain. “We’re at the whim of counterfeit packaging just like anyone else.” – Reuters Read Full Article 1491802844 {"total":8,"error":"","facebook_total":7,"stumbleupon":0,"pinterest":0,"google":1,"linkedin":0,"buffer":0,"twitter":0,"vk":0} 169905 Topics covered: anti-counterfeiting tech australia China china fakes counterfeit New Zealand Today’s Top Stories Indonesian artist hides anti-Ahok references in new X-men comics Beijing offers cash rewards to unearth foreign spies Burma: UNICEF urges govt to release detained Rohingya children MOST READ THIS WEEK Meet the man who rules over 4m-long king cobras 30,000-year-old Ice Age civilisation discovered in Indonesia 'I’m no Mother Teresa' says Suu Kyi, denying ethnic cleansing Rain-triggered landslide buries at least 27 in Indonesia's Java Malaysia deports 140 N.

The Indianapolis-based company is trying to stay afloat, but it may already be too late. Dwight Adams/IndyStar Exterior of the hhgregg store at 151 East 96th St. in Indianapolis.

The bankrupt retailer is planning to begin liquidating its assets Saturday after failing to find a buyer by its Friday deadline. The company expects to close all of its 220 stores by the end of May, resulting in about 5,000 layoffs across the U.S. HHGregg CEO Bob Riesbeck in a statement said the company has "continued to fight for the future" since March 6 when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. "While we had discussions with more than 50 private equity firms, strategic buyers and other investors, unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our plan to secure a viable buyer of the business on a going-concern basis within the expedited timeline set by our creditors," Riesbeck said. A company spokeswoman said Riesbeck was not available for an interview. The liquidation process means HHGregg customers only have a few weeks left to use gift cards and return previously purchased items. Customers who want to make returns could end up being disappointed. The company, citing its bankruptcy process, is limiting returns on items bought before March 6 to $2,850 — a fraction of the cost of many high-ticket appliances and televisions. The liquidation ends a 62-year run for HHGregg, which is headquartered on 96th Street. The company was founded by Henry Harold Gregg and his wife, Fansy. CLOSING STORES IN 2017:Sears, J.C. Penney, Kmart, Macy's and more HHGregg built a reputation as a regional electronics retailer, taking on companies such as Best Buy. But, like other big-box stores, HHGregg struggled to adapt to the e-commerce age. The store lost foot traffic and was slow to add features that online shoppers like, such as free shipping. Riesbeck, who became CEO in February 2016 after Dennis May resigned, acknowledged he faced a difficult task. He described in an August interview how constantly changing technology has disrupted the company's business model. "One thing HHGregg used to make their money on was those big-box TVs people had to have delivered," Riesbeck said. "And that's how HHGregg was built through the years. Once it went to flat panels, and all of a sudden people realized they could put them in the backseat of their car, delivery's not that important anymore." Riesbeck attempted to divert HHGregg's focus from electronics to Fine Lines, an upscale store-within-a-store that sells appliances. HHGregg has become the seventh-largest appliance retailer in the U.S. behind Lowe's, Home Depot, Sears, Best Buy, Sears Hometown and Wal-Mart, according to the consumer electronics trade publication Twice. Although the Fine Lines brand showed encouraging growth, it was not enough to make up for plummeting electronics sales. HHGregg lost money in each of the past two years. The company suffered through a brutal holiday shopping season last year, which accelerated its demise. HHGregg this year has taken a series of drastic steps to stay afloat. The company in February said it would lay off 100 people, including 70 workers at its headquarters, and followed that up March 2 with an announcement that it would close 88 stores in 15 states. Those store closings, which have not yet been completed, would have brought the company down to 132 locations. HHGregg has a total of 220 stores in 19 states. HHGregg warned a week ago that the end could be near. The company disclosed in a March 31 Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it would begin liquidating unless it found a buyer by Friday. HHGregg has signed a consulting agreement with Tiger Capital Group and Great American Group to sell its merchandise, furniture, fixtures and equipment across all of its stores and 14 distribution centers. The bankruptcy is expected to wipe out the value of HHGregg's common stock. As Riesbeck was working to reinvent HHGregg last year, he offered a blunt assessment of the company that could be considered its epitaph. "I would say," he told IndyStar, "we're not unique in retail." Call IndyStar reporter James Briggs at (317) 444-6307.

ShareAdjustCommentPrint CAPE BRETON ISLAND — The first sign of what Rob Calabrese would come to think of as America’s unmooring began last year, just after Donald Trump won his first presidential primary and Calabrese published a $28 website that he’d designed in 30 minutes. “Hi Americans!” it began, and what followed was a sales pitch for an island where Muslims could “roam freely,” and where the only walls were those “holding up the roofs” of “extremely affordable houses.” “Let’s get the word out!” Calabrese wrote, adding a photo of an empty coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. “Move to Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins!” It was meant as a joke – but seven hours after Calabrese linked the site to the Facebook page of the pop radio station where he works as a DJ, in came an email from America. “Not sure if this is real but I’ll bite.” And then another: “It pains me to think of leaving, but this country is beyond repair.” And then more. Within 24 hours, there were 80 messages. Within a week, there were 2,000, and many used the same words: “nervous” and “terrified” and “help.” “The United States is losing its mind,” one person wrote. “So ashamed of half of my country I could curl up and cry,” wrote another. The emails kept coming, so many that soon the island’s tourism association brought on four seasonal workers to help respond to the inquiries, which were arriving from every state and hundreds of towns, until it seemed to Calabrese that America was filled with people who wanted to get away. “Look at this one,” he said one day recently, scrolling through a spreadsheet where the inquiries were organized and stopping on No. 2,121. “I am a former U.S. Marine who did two tours to Iraq. And I want out of here.” “Beyond astonished,” Calabrese said, scrolling through more. There were emails from a molecular biologist, a University of Oregon professor, a granite construction worker, a contractor for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a woman who said her home town was “Unfortunately, Alabama.” There were declarations and confessions about incomes, sexual orientations, goals for their children. Several included résumés. “I am so sick of what has happened to my beautiful country,” one letter began. “I desperately want to move my daughters to the safety and sanity of Canada,” email No. 3,248 read. “It doesn’t even really matter if Donald Trump wins. He has exposed the awful attitude that plagues the US.” I desperately want to move my daughters to the safety and sanity of Canada “This is no longer the America I have loved for all my life,” email No. 3,310 read. “I am a hardworking man and could contribute much to any country that gives me a chance.” It was somewhere around email 4,230 that Trump was elected president of the United States, and just before his inauguration came email No. 4,635. “Looking to immigrate to Cape Breton area from Colorado,” it began. “I am a skilled paralegal and my wife is an attorney.” Calabrese read it, wondered briefly about the people who sent it, and waited for the next one to come in. “What do people see on the horizon to be this afraid?” he said. * * * The email was written by Jimmy Gantenbein and Cathleen McEwen from their living room sofa in Loveland, a town 50 miles north of Denver. A month later, furniture from that living room had been stuffed into the garage. Paint buckets lined the hallway. They’d been in touch with a real estate agent. Soon they planned to have their home on the market. “Can you hand me a nail?” Cathleen, 61, asked as she fixed up the bedroom. “Here you go, Cat,” Jimmy, 54, said. They’d bought this home at the start of their marriage – the second for Jimmy, the third for Cathleen – and 17 years later they knew the place nearly as well as they knew each other. They had a view of the Rocky Mountains from the bedroom. Afternoon sunlight warmed the carpet where their old poodle liked to curl up. Two right turns and a left took them to the local Safeway. “We’re going to love it here,” Cathleen remembered saying on one of their first spring nights, after a neighbour’s 50th birthday party ended with outdoor cartwheels. They lived on a cul-de-sac with two other homes, and Cathleen spent a few years on the city council. They made friends with Democrats and Republicans. When Cathleen’s son, an Army reservist, returned from Iraq in 2005, 150 people showed up at the local veterans’ hall for barbecue and beer. There was a short period when they rented out the home and moved to a more commercial part of the city, hoping to improve their business. But they returned as soon as they could, and even as they aged, and faced some health problems, and their business slowed, this place remained the closest thing to a constant in their lives. And then came the arrival into their settled world of Donald Trump. He was on TV so often that Jimmy and Cathleen created a no-Trump rule after 9 p.m. He was in their town, holding a rally 10 miles from their home that drew an overflow crowd. He was in their neighbourhood, his name popping up on yard signs all around them. During primary season, it felt as if he’d arrived at their own front yard, when their neighbor saw them in the driveway, walked over, and said he was supporting Trump. We’re going with Bernie, Jimmy and Cathleen recalled saying, and though the conversation was brief and cordial, they hadn’t talked to their neighbor since. “We feel out of sync with everybody,” Cathleen was saying now. Just that morning, signing onto Facebook, there was a post written by her friend Pam, somebody she’d known for 13 years, telling Muslims to “grow a pair” and “defend the country they immigrated to and assimilate!” She thought for a few minutes about what to do and then punched out a response, telling Pam to “put the same mental energy” into researching the Muslim faith “that you put into your diatribe.” Then came the back-and-forth among other people, 19 comments, no minds changing. “People are in a frenzy to out-anger,” Cathleen said, and she read the comments aloud to Jimmy. She’d had 400 Facebook friends before Trump. Now she had 288. “It’s just that Trump mentality,” Jimmy said. I haven’t been very good at peacemaking lately. It’s making me a worse person “We can’t have a conversation with anybody,” Cathleen said. “We try to engage, but it’s usually . . . ” “Disastrous,” Jimmy said. “Yeah,” Cathleen said. “I haven’t been very good at peacemaking lately. It’s making me a worse person. You know, if you can’t rise above it. But I can’t totally resist.” She went on: “I don’t know what to do constructively. It’s a crisis of purpose.” And so, they were thinking of leaving. It’s not that they had never thought of moving – they’d talked before about finding a cheaper place as they aged – but when Trump came along, that’s what pushed them. To where, though? Just move closer to your grandchildren, Cathleen’s son, an accountant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said. Just don’t leave the country, Cathleen’s daughter, a doctor in Toledo, Ohio, remembered telling them. “Don’t give up so quickly. Now more than ever, good people need to fight for what matters.” But Jimmy and Cathleen didn’t see it as giving up. Instead, they felt America becoming so off-kilter, so “angry” and “bigoted” and “regressive,” that they thought maybe the moment required an absolute break. “I don’t recognize the country I was born in,” Cathleen said. “I was born into a narrow-minded, anti-intellectual country. It took me 61 years and one election to figure it out.” So now, they also had a “Relocation” folder on their computer filled with information about Panama and Belize and Costa Rica and Canada. They’d bookmarked the Cape Breton website and set up Web alerts for real estate listings on the island. They’d talked to an immigration lawyer in Canada. “I’m so glad they aren’t around to see this,” Jimmy said, in the living room now, where there were two folded funeral flags honoring their veteran fathers. “It just keeps getting worse,” said Cathleen, who keeps a framed copy of the Gettysburg Address on the basement office wall. So many decisions to make. Would they sell off their stuff? Would they give up their citizenship? Would they be able to repair damaged relationships with their children and grandchildren? And if they made it to Cape Breton, would they feel regret? They knew it was cold. They knew homes were cheap. But they’d never been there. “It’s risky to stay and risky to go,” Cathleen said, and now they were back in the bedroom, hammering in new baseboards and fastening new light switch covers. “Maybe,” she said, “the pragmatist wins out.” “Maybe,” he said, “we rent for a while and figure things out.” Cathleen put down the screwdriver and sat on the carpet. “We don’t have a clue,” she said. “We’re in a quandary,” he said. Their dog was sleeping. Soon, their real estate agent would be calling. Homes sold fast in Loveland. Eight weeks and there’d be a “for sale” out front. So, maybe Cape Breton. * * * Maybe Cape Breton, and maybe the house whose listing Valarie Sampson, a real estate agent who’d heard from a handful of Americans, was looking at now. Right on the ocean. A renovated farmhouse. One hundred forty-four acres of land. $220,000 Canadian, or $164,000 U.S. On the market for more than three years. Winter viewings, the listing said, “require snowshoes.” “It’s a beautiful home if you’re looking to escape,” said Sampson, climbing into her SUV and steering through an island that people don’t come to anymore but instead have been choosing to leave. Once rich in coal, mining had dried up and no industry yet had replaced it. Every year, another 1,000 people were either dying or taking off for larger cities such as Toronto or Halifax. Budgets were shrinking. Ten schools had closed in the last year. The island’s unemployment rate was 15.5 percent. The population was down to 130,000, and that left Cape Breton with hundreds of abandoned homes awaiting demolition and several hundred more for sale. Navigating streets narrowed by high snow, Sampson turned into a neighborhood of simple vinyl-sided homes near the shuttered coal mines. “This one has been on for months,” she said. A few minutes later: “$149,000 for this one. We haven’t had one viewing.” Sampson knows that summers here feel different. The tourists arrive. The lobster and pizza restaurants reopen. The lakes fill with sailboats. “The geography is second to none,” she said. “A one-hour drive in any direction will take you to the beach.” But for four or five months of the year, this is a place with short days, frigid temperatures and icy sidewalks, where people play backyard hockey or gather in little bars and doughnut shops. As Sampson returned to the office, the only activity in Sydney, the island’s largest town, seemed to be a meeting of community leaders who were talking about how to save the island. “We don’t get people, we’re going to die,” Rankin MacSween, head of a community development group, was saying. “These are huge losses against an already small population,” a lawyer said. “It doesn’t take much math to realize how much time is left.” People passed around a five-page research paper that said the island needed to attract 2,000 people annually to remain viable. There’d been decades of failed attempts to rebuild. The island had one new thing going for it – the website. More people knew about Cape Breton now. “We’re receiving thousands of emails,” one person said at the meeting. But that wasn’t the same as thousands of people moving there. Canada had strict immigration laws. People couldn’t just come because they wanted to. Applicants were scored based on age and skills and their ability to help the economy. Anybody who emailed Cape Breton was told they still had to apply through Canada’s immigration agency. They were sent a link to begin a process that could take more than a year. So maybe some Americans would arrive someday, but they hadn’t yet. As the responses rolled in, Calabrese had revised the site’s text to make it less political – and less directed at Americans specifically. “The truth is,” Calabrese had written, “we welcome all, no matter the ideology. Join us!” “We need to be thinking about this,” the lawyer said as the meeting was winding down. “What kind of person would come here?” * * * One answer to that question could be found just past the meeting hall, in a house that had been stripped of wire and abandoned for a year and now had a family of seven inside, all of them from Syria. School had just ended. The television was on. The kids were squeezed on a couch. “What are you drawing?” the father, Ahmad Hamadi, 35, asked one of his sons, Mohamad, who is 10. “It’s a Pokemon,” Mohamad said. He held up the drawing for a father who eight months after arriving was still sorting through what it meant to have left a country he loved. “It looks good,” said Ahmad, and then he turned back to the television. These were the people moving to Cape Breton: refugees from the Syrian war who not only left their country but had to flee it. Fifty-four had come so far, and Ahmad and his family were among the most recent. After escaping Syria and spending several years in Lebanon, they had ended up here because of the sponsorship of a church group waiting for them on an island they’d never heard of. They’d been traveling for 48 hours: Beirut to Cairo to Toronto to Cape Breton. They landed at 1:30 a.m. They were shuttled into a van, and when the sun came up Ahmad found himself in a house stocked with food and furniture and toys, all of it his and none of it familiar. Compared with where he had come from, it was quiet outside. The electricity worked. The children went to school. Ahmad pinned a small Canadian flag to the front door, and every day he walked out was another chance to adapt to a new place. He applied for positions at Value Village and a building supply company, where an interpreter helped him with the interviews, but he didn’t land either. He asked about an entry spot at a Lebanese restaurant, but the owner didn’t want somebody without experience. Months passed with nothing. He got a driver’s license. He lifted weights at the YMCA to burn stress. He thought about applying for a late shift at McDonald’s, but one of the leaders from the church committee that sponsored him said he should instead ramp up his English and become more employable. So twice-a-week government-funded English classes became four-a-week, and for Ahmad the sessions became his best excuse to leave the house: a two-mile drive across town to a community center classroom, where the names of Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories were written on the chalkboard. “How are you?” the teacher, Susan Burchell, asked as Ahmad walked in. “Bored,” he said. “Bored?” she asked. She addressed the grammar instead of the sentiment. “It’s good you didn’t say boring,” she said, and when he didn’t say anything, she asked, “What do you want to do today?” “Nothing,” he said, shrugging. “Learning?” “What did you do last week? Talk to me about it.” “Shopping,” he said. “I went to Walmart. We went to Tim Hortons. And we went to my friend.” “Do I know this friend?” “An old man. From Lebanon.” “Anything else?” He shrugged again. Before the war, in a town outside of Damascus, Ahmad had owned a small department store. He’d lived on the same street with his parents and three siblings. He met friends for late-night shawarma and chicken at restaurants. He had fled four years ago, and now his family was scattered across three continents. Among his five closest friends, he figured four were dead. The restaurants were just as likely rubble, something he thought of when he opened up Facebook and saw videos of charred and ruined street blocks. Had he known those places? Could he recognize them now? He’d built a home for his family in 2010, ceramic tiles in the kitchen and the apricot trees out front. Was that home, too, part of the rubble? He’d heard it might be. “One day I had a car, a house, a business, a life,” Ahmad said. “The second day I lost it all.” Ahmad had the best fortune of almost anybody he knew, and yet because of the changed fortunes of a country he loved, he was here, looking out at a yard with five-foot snowdrifts and a horizon with an early-setting Canadian sun. He sat down on a chair and rubbed his aching back. “Can you grab me some Advil?” he asked his daughter, Aya. She reached into a cabinet and handed him a pill. Ahmad’s hair was greasy, and stubble covered his neck and face. “A fish out of water, they die,” he said as his wife prepared lunch in the kitchen. The smell of hot oil filled the air. Ahmad swallowed the pill, drank some tea, and waited for the ache to go away. * * * “Cat, did you see that!” Cathleen and Jimmy were driving back at dusk from a window-screen repair shop when a big white owl soared in front of their car, and soon they were at home talking about the owl that used to live in their front yard, the elk that would roam out back, and how this has always been their favorite time of year. Every spring on the cul-de-sac, they’d crack the windows open, hear birds in the spruce tree, see the crocuses and gray hyacinths sprout from the fresh mulch in front of their house. Sundown came later. They’d barbecue. They’d see the neighbors more. And sometimes, they’d take off for road trips in their SUV: heading east across the plains and into the Ozarks, or maybe west, over the mountains and past the Continental Divide, finding lakes for fishing and stopping at fruit stands and sleeping in whatever motel they could find. “So long as it wasn’t flea-ridden,” Jimmy said. “We didn’t have any plan,” Cathleen said. “We’d just kind of wing it.” “Remember the Black Canyons?” Jimmy said. “Remember those cliffs?” Cathleen said. “The Million Dollar Highway?” Jimmy said. There was a knock on the door. Their home inspector. In two weeks, the house would be on the market, and as soon as it sold they’d be on their way – first to visit their children and, after that, they’d have to see. Maybe a drive through America would remind them of things they were forgetting. The inspector shook their hands and walked in. He carried a measuring tape, a notebook, and tools in a zippered pouch. He checked on the things that would be used by whoever lived there next – the furnace, the hot water heater, the electrical boxes – and moved through the rooms that now looked as though nobody had lived there before. No more family photos. No more artwork. Almost two decades of things boxed away. “So,” he asked, “where are you guys moving to?” There’d been a run of 60-degree days in Loveland, and meanwhile in Cape Breton, the temperatures were near freezing, forecasters were saying another eight to 11 inches of snow were on the way, and the emails were still arriving, a couple every day. “I can no longer live here, nor sleep with this evil man as our leader,” one person wrote. “History repeats itself and I can feel a repeat of the Third Reich,” another wrote. “I am heartbroken seeing our America be torn apart . . . by one, out-of-touch billionaire,” another wrote. “Please help me,” another wrote. Calabrese read every word, and as he waited for the snow to arrive, and the Americans to arrive, and email No. 4780 to arrive, he thought about how fortunate he was to live in a place where he wants to be.

Suppliers of goods from fruit to wine and lamb are teaming up with makers of tracking systems, codes and powders to combat fakes that cost the global food business billions of dollars. As tech tools become cheaper, services like China’s popular WeChat smartphone app are also being deployed, offering consumers a free scanning ally to work out what’s on Chinese store shelves. Smaller players like meat company Silver Fern Farms and Synlait Milk have tapped local tech firms like Dunedin’s Oritain, which measures food isotopes as a checkable ‘fingerprint’. But Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is also in on the act with a pilot Blockchain-based tracing system, signing up Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra and Australian vitamin supplier Blackmores as partners. “We see the Australian and New Zealand markets setting the tone for the rest of the world when it comes to integrity, safety and quality of food supply chains,” said Maggie Zhou, Alibaba’s Australia and New Zealand managing director, in comments published to mark its project launch at a late March Canberra ceremony. “It was a natural decision to pilot a programme here.” Dislodging counterfeit food, now a well-established business of its own, presents no small challenge. Fraud costs the global food industry an estimated US$40 billion (RM177.5 billion) a year, Alibaba said, citing research conducted by Michigan State University. In China, US$1 billion in counterfeited goods was seized in 2014, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition. “Categories that are faked so regularly are the (fresh produce) ones where New Zealand and Australia are strong,” said Mark Tanner, director of Shanghai-based China Skinny, a firm that advises Western businesses operating in China. But firms in Australia and New Zealand are prepared to go to increasing lengths to protect sales they rely on for growth. New Zealand’s total exports to China have quadrupled to NZ$12 billion since 2007, most of them being food and beverage products. Australia agriculture exports to China were worth around A$10 billion in 2016, double the amount five years earlier. Quick response Widespread use of apps like WeChat, owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings, and developments in technology like machine learning have made it easier and cheaper for smaller tech firms to develop anti-counterfeiting technologies. That lower cost base has brought what tracking systems that were previously solely in the realm of multinational giants like HP and Walmart within reach of the small to mid-level firms that are the backbone of the food and drink business in New Zealand and Australia. Oritain charges customers NZ$300-700 per isotope test product, while for from around NZ$200 a month, Auckland-based Trust Codes supplies a machine-learning algorithm that can pull data from consumers’ phones in China when they scan a product’s encrypted Quick Response, or QR, packaging code. At Auckland manuka honey firm Oceania Natural, Chief Executive Walker Zhong said he used his knowledge of Chinese consumers’ shopping, social media habits and liking of convenience in building Oceania’s own scanning system at a cost of NZ$1 million. Backed by a Chinese insurer, Oceania Natural’s tool revolves around WeChat — which Zhong knew Chinese consumers would already have on their smartphones — sending an alert if the scannable code on product has been used before, indicating in one step whether it’s genuine. “China consumers... they don’t like to use two steps or three steps to verify your product is genuine,” said Zhong. Pitfalls remain. Packaging can be tampered with, or even faked, and that many exports like meat are still sent to China in bulk shipments without any packaging for consumers at all. “The only real way of knowing is testing the actual product,” said Sam Lind, operations director at Oritain. “We’re at the whim of counterfeit packaging just like anyone else.” — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Food fight: To beat China fakes, NZ and Australian produce firms raid tech larder Chef Wan on being in love… and new projects in the pipeline Dominique Ansel just created a floating cake, and it’s everything (VIDEO) New Zealand’s finger-lickin’ posties to deliver KFC A dash of bugs with that?

The group developing the project at Douglass and Main says, investors are ready to go and the grocery store will be open to the public by this summer. The first floor to the Century Plaza downtown will be home to this new development, if all goes as planned for the Wichita developers and KSN got the first peek inside. You may remember former law maker, Phil Hermanson but if not, you will remember him and his wife for being the brains behind this grocery store. “When you go inside, trust me it ain’t pretty,” said Michele Hermanson, Phil’s wife. “You’re going to see equipment and stuff everywhere. It’s now our job to go in there and get it all moved out and cleaned up, one piece at a time.” I decided to hit the streets to talk to folks that live or work downtown to see how they felt about this new grocery store. “I think it’s a great idea because there’s so many people that live on the edge of downtown or in downtown,” said Carolyn Burns, who tells us she’s downtown at least three times a week. ” I think it’s perfect because they either have to go to Walmart or out east or out west instead they can come downtown,” said another Wichita resident, Andie Becker.     Steve Anthimides owns the entire Century Plaza and he says he can’t think of a better idea. “This space here has been vacant for many years and Douglass and Main; there’s is no better location in Wichita Kansas,” said Anthimides. The owner tells us is took some time to find the right people for the job but he has a lot of faith that the Hermanson’s will get it done. “We did a lot of preparation, a lot of consulting work,” explained Phil. “I’ve always been the kind of person who says ten heads work better then one.” Phil and his wife say that they plan for this change to happen in the next 90 days and last I spoke with them, they’ve already made large leaps in clearing the space out. The couple has moved into an apartment upstairs so they can keep a close eye on the project.” “This is also for the faith of our investors,” explained Phil. “We want our investors to know that we are working this around the clock.” Phil and his wife are planning big. Not only will they be opening a grocery store in Century Plaza but also a convenience store, coffee shop and wedding venue. “We have the investors we need for this but it’s a huge job so, we are always open to more,” said Phil.       Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Google Tumblr More Send to Kindle LinkedIn Pocket Like this: Like Loading...

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Security On Eve of Trump-Xi Summit, Chinese Hackers Are Linked to a Cyber-Espionage Campaign Against the US By Rafia Shaikh Apr 6, 2017 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Ahead of Thursday’s summit between the United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, researchers released a report claiming that a Chinese cyber-espionage group broke into the website of a Washington D.C.-based trade group. The research firm revealed that the sophisticated hacking group APT10 is believed to be responsible for a February hack where the group left a malicious link on an Events web page that the members of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) use for upcoming meetings. Evidence of Chinese cyber-espionage released as Trump meets Xi APT10 that is believed to be a group pursuing Chinese government interests broke into the website of NFTC to implant a malicious link. Researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity firm uncovered this malware campaign back in February. However, the firm appears to be taking advantage of this week’s Trump-Xi summit to publish its findings. “In late February, Fidelis Cybersecurity observed a strategic web compromise on a prominent U.S. lobbying group that served up malware to a very specific set of targets,” the firm wrote. Related Trump Administration Wants to Check Chinese Visitors’ Social Media Profiles “The malware we observed has been used exclusively by Chinese nation-state threat actors in our observation and according to previously published research.” When members of NFTC clicked on this malicious link, instead of taking them to a meeting in Washington on March 7, the link deployed Scanbox – a spying tool that goes back to 2014. Scanbox has been previously associated with the Chinese government and enables its operators to record the type of software a target is running and run keyloggers on the affected systems. Advertisement “Traditionally these attacks are used to precisely identify targets and help them craft targeted phishing attacks using exploits they know the victim is vulnerable to.” NFTC is a prominent advocate on international trade policy having corporate members, including Wal-Mart Stores, KPMG, Pfizer, Visa, Johnson & Johnson, Amazon.com, Ford and Microsoft. The research firm wrote that the NFTC director who is a customer of Fidelis contacted the company. FBI was also notified after this malware implant was detected and removed. While the FBI and NFTC have declined to comment on the authenticity of this report, Fidelis said there is no evidence that any NFTC member could have been infected. The group is calling this malware campaign Operation TradeSecret and believes that the attack against NFTC could be an attempt to conduct surveillance on the main lobbyists and industry players associated with the US trade policies. The security firm also hypothesized that the attackers were trying to get trade secrets ahead of today’s meeting. Related Using Flaws in Pentagon Systems, Hackers Can Make It Look As If Cyberattacks Originated from the US However, according to independent security researchers who spoke to Forbes, the link that Fidelis makes between NFTC hack and APT10 is weak. It could very well be an attempt to draw attention to the firm ahead of President Trump’s meeting with the Chinese President. Both APT10 and US-China relationships are hot topics right now, as earlier this week a PwC and BAE report revealed that the hacking group was targeting IT, cloud and managed service providers (MSPs) globally, including in the United States. “The threat actor’s targeting of diplomatic and political organisations in response to geopolitical tensions, as well as the targeting of specific commercial enterprises, is closely aligned with strategic Chinese interests,” PwC wrote in its report earlier in the week. – Technical details of the NFTC hack can be found here.

Wentworth Military Academy and College's two top administrators announced the closure in letters Friday to cadets, students, parents and alumni, saying the assets of the site in 4,700-resident Lexington about 50 miles east of Kansas City will be liquidated as part of "an orderly closure." "Although everyone regrets this decision, we are proud that Wentworth successfully achieved its mission for 137 years, and many, many cadets and students obtained the knowledge and developed the character to be successful," Wentworth's board chairman, Regis McDonald, and president Michael Lierman wrote in a letter to alumni. Allan Hallquist, a Kansas City lawyer who has represented Wentworth for the past quarter century, said Saturday that Wentworth has 220 cadets who boarded there. Fifty-five of them are high school students, and the rest enrolled in its two-year college program. The site also has roughly 300 civilians taking classes there. "Wentworth has struggled for more than five years to break even and has tried different options," including hiring consulting firms to bolster recruiting and develop alumni fundraising, Hallquist told The Associated Press. "But they continued to run deficits and are projected to dig a deeper hole." The accrediting Higher Learning Commission placed Wentworth on ongoing probation in November 2015, citing "concerns related to integrity regarding the college's finances and resources to support its academic programs and operations." The commission was to revisit that matter Monday, according to its website. Wentworth's prominent alumni include the late Missouri Congressman Ike Skelton, Wal-Mart co-founder James "Bud" Walton, and zoologist Marlin Perkins, who hosted "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom" for more than two decades before his death in 1986. Wally Hulver, a 79-year-old insurance industry retiree who graduated from Wentworth in 1956, called the news "really a shame." Wentworth "taught you a lot about life, about how to treat people. It was just, well, etiquette and made you aware of how you should be living," Hulver, an Army veteran, told the AP by phone from his home in Lexington. "This is just a sad day for the old guys around here who went there." McDonald didn't immediately reply to messages left Saturday. Lierman has an unlisted home telephone number. The academy's website was inoperable, undergoing what it called "scheduled maintenance."

Suppliers of goods from fruit to wine and lamb are teaming up with makers of tracking systems, codes and powders to combat fakes that cost the global food business billions of dollars. As tech tools become cheaper, services like China's popular WeChat smartphone app are also being deployed, offering consumers a free scanning ally to work out what's on Chinese store shelves. Smaller players like meat company Silver Fern Farms and Synlait Milk have tapped local tech firms like Dunedin's Oritain, which measures food isotopes as a checkable 'fingerprint'. But Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is also in on the act with a pilot Blockchain-based tracing system, signing up Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra and Australian vitamin supplier Blackmores as partners. "We see the Australian and New Zealand markets setting the tone for the rest of the world when it comes to integrity, safety and quality of food supply chains," said Maggie Zhou, Alibaba's Australia and New Zealand managing director, in comments published to mark its project launch at a late March Canberra ceremony. "It was a natural decision to pilot a programme here." Dislodging counterfeit food, now a well established business of its own, presents no small challenge. Fraud costs the global food industry an estimated $40 billion a year, Alibaba said, citing research conducted by Michigan State University. In China, $1 billion in counterfeited goods was seized in 2014, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition. "Categories that are faked so regularly are the (fresh produce) ones where New Zealand and Australia are strong," said Mark Tanner, director of Shanghai-based China Skinny, a firm that advises Western businesses operating in China. But firms in Australia and New Zealand are prepared to go to increasing lengths to protect sales they rely on for growth. New Zealand's total exports to China have quadrupled to NZ$12 billion ($8.62 billion) since 2007, most of them being food and beverage products. Australia agriculture exports to China were worth around A$10 billion ($7.67 billion) in 2016, double the amount five years earlier. QUICK RESPONSE Widespread use of apps like WeChat, owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings, and developments in technology like machine learning have made it easier and cheaper for smaller tech firms to develop anti-counterfeiting technologies. That lower cost base has brought what tracking systems that were previously solely in the realm of multinational giants like HP and Walmart within reach of the small to mid-level firms that are the backbone of the food and drink business in New Zealand and Australia. Oritain charges customers NZ$300-700 per isotope test product, while for from around NZ$200 a month, Auckland-based Trust Codes supplies a machine-learning algorithm that can pull data from consumers' phones in China when they scan a product's encrypted Quick Response, or QR, packaging code. At Auckland manuka honey firm Oceania Natural, Chief Executive Walker Zhong said he used his knowledge of Chinese consumers' shopping, social media habits and liking of convenience in building Oceania's own scanning system at a cost of NZ$1 million. Backed by a Chinese insurer, Oceania Natural's tool revolves around WeChat - which Zhong knew Chinese consumers would already have on their smartphones - sending an alert if the scannable code on product has been used before, indicating in one step whether it's genuine. "China consumers...they don't like to use two steps or three steps to verify your product is genuine," said Zhong. Pitfalls remain. Packaging can be tampered with, or even faked, and that many exports like meat are still sent to China in bulk shipments without any packaging for consumers at all. "The only real way of knowing is testing the actual product," said Sam Lind, operations director at Oritain. "We're at the whim of counterfeit packaging just like anyone else."

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sheikh Hasina Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Arvind Kejriwal Yogi Adityanath Home Money Food fight: To beat China fakes, NZ and Australian produce firms raid tech larder Shares1 Mon, 10 Apr 2017-02:34am , Reuters As China's middle class develops its taste for imported food and drink, fresh produce suppliers in New Zealand and Australia are topping up nature's bounty with anti-counterfeiting technology in a bid to protect their growing business from fakes. Suppliers of goods from fruit to wine and lamb are teaming up with makers of tracking systems, codes and powders to combat fakes that cost the global food business billions of dollars. As tech tools become cheaper, services like China's popular WeChat smartphone app are also being deployed, offering consumers a free scanning ally to work out what's on Chinese store shelves. Smaller players like meat company Silver Fern Farms and Synlait Milk have tapped local tech firms like Dunedin's Oritain, which measures food isotopes as a checkable 'fingerprint'. But Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is also in on the act with a pilot Blockchain-based tracing system, signing up Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra and Australian vitamin supplier Blackmores as partners. "We see the Australian and New Zealand markets setting the tone for the rest of the world when it comes to integrity, safety and quality of food supply chains," said Maggie Zhou, Alibaba's Australia and New Zealand managing director, in comments published to mark its project launch at a late March Canberra ceremony. "It was a natural decision to pilot a programme here." Dislodging counterfeit food, now a well established business of its own, presents no small challenge. Fraud costs the global food industry an estimated $40 billion a year, Alibaba said, citing research conducted by Michigan State University. In China, $1 billion in counterfeited goods was seized in 2014, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition. "Categories that are faked so regularly are the (fresh produce) ones where New Zealand and Australia are strong," said Mark Tanner, director of Shanghai-based China Skinny, a firm that advises Western businesses operating in China. But firms in Australia and New Zealand are prepared to go to increasing lengths to protect sales they rely on for growth. New Zealand's total exports to China have quadrupled to NZ$12 billion ($8.62 billion) since 2007, most of them being food and beverage products. Australia agriculture exports to China were worth around A$10 billion ($7.67 billion) in 2016, double the amount five years earlier. QUICK RESPONSE Widespread use of apps like WeChat, owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings, and developments in technology like machine learning have made it easier and cheaper for smaller tech firms to develop anti-counterfeiting technologies. That lower cost base has brought what tracking systems that were previously solely in the realm of multinational giants like HP and Walmart within reach of the small to mid-level firms that are the backbone of the food and drink business in New Zealand and Australia. Oritain charges customers NZ$300-700 per isotope test product, while for from around NZ$200 a month, Auckland-based Trust Codes supplies a machine-learning algorithm that can pull data from consumers' phones in China when they scan a product's encrypted Quick Response, or QR, packaging code. At Auckland manuka honey firm Oceania Natural, Chief Executive Walker Zhong said he used his knowledge of Chinese consumers' shopping, social media habits and liking of convenience in building Oceania's own scanning system at a cost of NZ$1 million. Backed by a Chinese insurer, Oceania Natural's tool revolves around WeChat - which Zhong knew Chinese consumers would already have on their smartphones - sending an alert if the scannable code on product has been used before, indicating in one step whether it's genuine. "China consumers...they don't like to use two steps or three steps to verify your product is genuine," said Zhong. Pitfalls remain. Packaging can be tampered with, or even faked, and that many exports like meat are still sent to China in bulk shipments without any packaging for consumers at all. "The only real way of knowing is testing the actual product," said Sam Lind, operations director at Oritain. "We're at the whim of counterfeit packaging just like anyone else."

Robinson St. Grand jury makes no recommendations, but shares fun facts about city BY DARLA A. BAKER dbaker@tehachapinews.com Apr 9, 2017 Updated 1 hr ago Tehachapi News file photo Tehachapi's City Hall is located at 115 S. Robinson St. You might say the city of Tehachapi is living it up — a nod to one of its slogans — after a committee of the Kern County grand jury visited the city and offered no recommendations for improvement. The Cities and Joint Powers Committee of the 2016-17 grand jury visited the city Feb. 28. Often, but not always, the committees offer points for improvement for the city or other entity they review. Not so here, in a report issued Thursday. "The city appreciates Kern County grand jury for their extensive and thorough annual report," Tehachapi City Manager Greg Garrett. "This report adds to a long line of grand jury reports that confirm our team understands and embraces what it takes to manage all of your publicly owned infrastructure and support businesses. I am extremely proud of every employee for consistency providing the highest level of service to our residents possible." Among the findings in the grand jury's report: • The city has been operating in the black since 1999, and, according to the chief financial officer, the city anticipates being free of debt in three to four years. The city has a five-year budget plan, which is updated every year. • Water conservation is important in the city. Water is produced by seven wells. Plans are under development to expand the wastewater treatment facility. • The new police communication center replaced the contract with Bear Valley Springs, which was costing the city about $400,000 a year. • According to Police Chief Kent Kroeger, crime is down 16 percent (although no information was listed by the grand jury regarding what time periods were being compared) and police are now enforcing city building codes. • The Walmart Supercenter is expected to hire about 250 employees, and is anticipated to open later this year. • The city received a regional award of merit from Kern Council of Governments for a model water-efficient landscape ordinance. A $2 million grant for downtown railroad safety improvements will be used for pedestrian crossings, fencing, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and gutters and sidewalks. A new bike path is to be added. According to the report, the committee met with the city manager and assistant city manager, as well as staff from the Departments of Administrative Manager/Deputy City Clerk, the economic development coordinator, finance director, development services director, and the police chief. Did You Know? When the grand jury visited Tehachapi, it discovered all kinds of fun and interesting facts. Here are just a few from its report. (You can read the full grand jury report at TehachapiNews.com) • The city of Tehachapi is the oldest settlement in the Tehachapi Valley. It was incorporated in 1909. • The Tehachapi Loop allows trains to accomplish a 3,600-foot climb. • The city's name came from the Kawaiisu, the native Americans in the area.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 April 2017 by Military News How Apple Inc. Makes Most of Its Money It shouldn’t surprise anyone that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) makes most of its money from the iPhone. After its initial launch in mid-2007, the iPhone gradually replaced the iPod as  Apple’s biggest revenue driver. Between fiscal 2008 and 2016, Apple’s iPhone shipments surged from 11.6 million to  211.9 million. During that period, Apple’s annual revenue rose from $32.5 billion to  $215.6 billion. The seminal iPhone helped Apple crush former mobile kings Nokia and BlackBerry , sparked a tech shift which turned Microsoft and Intel  into underdogs, and made it the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of about $750 billion. Let’s take a closer look at how important the iPhone is to Apple, and why its success is also a double-edged sword. Apple’s iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. How much does the iPhone matter to Apple? The annual launch of new iPhones remains one of the biggest tech events of the year for consumers, tech journalists, Wall Street analysts, and investors. But demand for the phones has clearly been slowing, due to competition from high-end Android rivals and the saturation of major markets like the U.S. and China. That’s why last year’s 211.9 million shipments actually represent an 8% decline from the 231.2 million units the company shipped in 2015. However, analysts believe that the tenth-anniversary iPhone 8 — which will likely feature a glass body, edge-to-edge bezel-less OLED screen, and numerous hardware improvements — will get growth back on track. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski believes that iPhone shipments in  calendar 2017 will reach 230 million. Last quarter, Apple’s iPhone sales grew 5% annually and accounted for a whopping 69% of the company’s top line. Apple produces iPhones for about $200 and sells them for over $600. That total excludes R&D, marketing, and other expenses, but it still allows Apple to make a lot more money than Android OEMs, which are selling their devices at much thinner margins. That’s why research firm Strategy Analytics reported that at the end of 2016, Apple raked in 79% of the  entire smartphone industry’s profits, despite controlling just 18% of  the global market. That’s also why Apple constantly promotes its devices as luxury products. It’s also how Apple takes prisoners But it’s not just the hardware revenue that matters to Apple — the iPhone also represents the easiest way to lock users into iOS. After iPhone users start buying apps and media from the App Store and iTunes, they’re less likely to leave behind their purchases by switching to Android devices. Image source: Apple. Apple clearly knows that its lock-in strategy works. That’s why it boldly launched an „upgrade” program which lets people pay for their iPhones on a monthly basis for two years. That plan also gives customers AppleCare+ coverage, and works with all carriers since users are buying an unsubsidized device. After 12 months, users can  switch to the latest iPhone to reset the payment process. It’s highly unlikely that an Android OEM can launch a comparable „forever” plan, since Android users can easily swap between handset brands without losing all their Google Play content. It’s a launchpad for Apple Services That brand loyalty makes the iPhone an ideal launch pad for Apple’s growing Services business, which includes the App Store, iTunes, iBooks, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that Apple plans to grow its software services to offset its gradual slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple’s Services revenue rose 18% annually and accounted for 9% of its top line last quarter, but there have been a few speed bumps. Apple claims that Apple Pay’s user  base tripled over the past year, but Loup Venture recently claimed that just 13% of iPhone users  have ever used the service. Wal-Mart still doesn’t accept Apple Pay, and the service is still  being trampled by Tencent ‚s WePay and Alibaba ‚s AliPay in China. Apple Music hit  20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2016, but questions about the platform’s profit margins persist. Why is the iPhone a double-edged sword? It’s easy to see why the iPhone is a double-edged sword. As long as iPhone sales are rising year-over-year, investors will be happy. But once interest in the iPhone finally fades, Apple needs new products and services to pick up the slack. Mac sales rose and iPad annual sales fell last quarter, but their combined sales only accounted for 16% of Apple’s revenues. The Apple Watch still generates so little revenue that it’s included in the Other Products category, along with iPods, Apple TV, and Beats audio devices. No one is sure what Apple’s next big move will be — whether it be new hardware products, media acquisitions, or connected cars — but most investors agree that it needs to reduce the weight of the mighty iPhone on its top line. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The gains by the former were brought on by the consistent efforts it had made to modernise itself in the last three to four years, while Emirates was impacted by the uncertain operating climate for regional airlines, according to the UK-based Brand Finance, which comes up with the annual rankings. Emirates had been the most valuable brand in the Middle East since Brand Finance initiated the rankings in 2010. (But it remains the most “powerful brand” in the region given its investments in marketing and how this plays out on profitability and revenues. In contrast, brand value is tuned on more intangible factors such as perceptions about its products and services.) In the Middle East, the Top 10 rankings were dominated by etisalat at number three (at $5.51 billion), Qatar National Bank (placed fourth with $3.82 billion) and Emirates NBD (with $3.4 billion for a fifth place). The others were the Qatari telco Ooredoo, Saudi Arabia’s dairy giant Al Marai, Abu Dhabi’s National Bank of Abu Dhabi, another telco is Zain of Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. Moreover, UAE-based brands retain the highest share — at 44 per cent — as a percentage of brand value among the Middle East’s Top 50 brands. Saudi Arabia comes next with 32 per cent. Tech/media brands At the global level, Google pipped Apple to the top spot, “brought on more a by relatively lacklustre performance by Apple in the early part of last year and which told on its branding,” said Andrew Campbell, Managing Director of Brand Finance M.E. (The rest of the top 10 global listing was dominated by tech/media brands, with only Wal-Mart and a Chinese banking major ICBC.) “Emirates and Qatar Airways were primarily impacted by external factors such as the strong dollar and by the economic outlook for the region,” said Campbell. (Qatar Airways saw its brand value slide 38 per cent to $2.16 billion, in turn losing its status as Qatar’s most valuable brand to QNB.) As for STC, “it is re-engaging its many stakeholders with a fresh, personable outlook. A clear indication of its success is the five-point increase in its brand strength index score, proving that putting some heart into it pays off.” In fact, the presence of so many telcos in the region’s top brand valuations shouldn’t be a surprise. These brands and the services they offer on multiple platforms make them near universal. And with the sort of smartphone penetration this part of the world has, telcos have managed to offer up a certain level of consumer experience and backed it up with marketing dollars. Banking The other category that rules the Middle East brand perceptions is banking — “Apart from investing more in brand marketing, there is the drive towards a digital online future and that’s a strength,” Campbell said. Banking makes up the biggest share of total brand value of the “Brand Finance Middle East’s 50”, comprising 43 per cent of the $75 billion total. Banking is also the source of the region’s fastest growing brand — Dubai Islamic Bank, up 136 per cent last year. According to Brand Finance’s head banking analyst, Alex Corringham: “The increase in brand performance of so many of the Middle East’s bank brands has come about as a result of more favourable economic conditions, international expansion and an increased need for branded products and services within these markets. Over the past few years many have replaced their older, more localised brand names and logos for those that resonate with consumers and can be recognised on an international level.” More from Companies Saudi Telecom edges past Emirates in brand value 12:00 am More annual shareholder meetings go virtual Secretary Ross’ former firm tied to China steel tags from this storyAPPLE follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGNQatar follow this tag on MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGNKuwait follow this tag on MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessCompanies tagsAPPLE follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In CompaniesMore annual shareholder meetings go virtual Business Gallery Pictures: Gitex Shopper Spring 2017 Manufacturing is order of the day Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Saudi Telecom edges past Emirates in brand value 02Secretary Ross’ former firm tied to China steel 03Hamdan attends Forever Living investors meeting Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 11Images Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Mar 21, 2017 1Image Pictures: Nokia 3310 comes back to life at MWC Feb 27, 2017 36Images Robots, apps and 3D printing at Gitex Oct 22, 2015 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee World, UAE Markets Data OverviewGccEuropeAsiau.s.

He spent years working underground. Sometimes he burrowed through coal seams where the crawl space was just 28 inches high, so tight that “you had to pack a straw to drink your pop.”  It was hard, dangerous work. But it paid well – an allure that was obvious even back in high school, when Mr. Martin saw his friends graduate and come back with new cars. He wanted the same. The problem: The work always ended. Mining jobs kept disappearing, and he was laid off half a dozen times. With each pink slip, he’d take community college classes to learn a new trade. Recommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test? Now, that experience has given Martin a new mission – coaxing a young generation here to envision lives that don’t revolve around hauling solid black fuel out of the ground. On this late-winter day, as a teacher at a vocational school, Martin is guiding his students toward the finish line in a “tiny house” competition. The contest pits them against students from two other nearby towns to see whose house, when sold at an auction, can net the most money for their school. But the real idea is not just to raise money. It’s to raise aspirations. Tiny houses. Big dreams. Martin, with a black ponytail and denim overalls, hopes that learning trades will allow his students to stay in Hindman after they graduate, and perhaps start businesses of their own right here. Many want to, but worry they can’t.  “I’m going to stay here as long as I can,” says Brad Breeding, a senior. “I was born and raised here. I don’t wanna leave home. But if it came down to it, I would.” The tiny house project may seem exactly that – tiny. But it’s part of a coordinated effort that’s gathering momentum in Appalachian coal country, aiming to deliver opportunity to a region that has long stood as a symbol of persistent rural poverty in the United States. For decades, coal supplied many here with a soot-stained, mountain-hollow version of a middle-class lifestyle. But even 50 years ago, near mining’s heyday, this craggy terrain was a focal point in President Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty. Now, in a bid to move the region beyond reliance on either government support or a single uncertain industry, a broad web of local and national foundations, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society groups is trying to resurrect eastern Kentucky and other parts of America’s penurious Coal Belt. Perhaps more than at any time in the past, the focus is on bootstrap ingenuity – encouraging a more entrepreneurial economy. The goal is not just to pump money into the region, but to help communities like Hindman foster the desire and have the tools to build a new future for themselves, one small business at a time. “We’ve been waiting for someone to come in and save the day,” says Kelly Hall, innovation director at the school where Martin works, the Knott County Area Technology Center. “But I think the answer lies within.” If the vision is impressive, so are the region’s challenges. Here in Knott County, for example, the roughly 10 percent unemployment rate is twice the national average, on top of an unusually high rate of adults not even entering the workforce to look for a job. The 33 percent poverty rate is more than twice the national average. Kentucky has among the nation’s highest rates of drug-overdose deaths, and the rate in Knott County has been among the highest in the state.  Donald Trump made the revival of coal jobs a big theme in his successful campaign for the presidency. But to energy industry experts, any turnaround looks likely to be modest at best, given the long trend of decline that has brought eastern Kentucky coal employment from 66,000 in 1948 to fewer than 6,000 as of 2015.  Many in this region have some Trump- inspired hope for a coal rebound. The longstanding link to mining here is hard to break. But residents also know that President Trump can’t wish away the forces – mechanization in the mines and competition from abundant natural gas – that have driven coal’s decline. To many, the region simply has no choice but to adapt and diversify. Towns like Hindman, across a mining region that runs through the ancient folds of the Appalachian Mountains, from Pennsylvania to West Virginia to Tennessee, are beginning to see the opportunities – in fields such as tourism, agriculture, e-commerce, and environmental cleanup.  “There are a lot of different smaller things,” says Jeff Wilder, who heads the tourism office in Harlan County, 60 miles south of Hindman. “I think a lot of people here have decided to use their ingenuity to do other things [than coal].” Perhaps more important, young residents like Mr. Breeding have one advantage over generations past: They’re growing up without the deep-rooted loyalty to coal mining that their parents and grandparents harbored. As his classmates scale ladders around the tiny house, or slide underneath it on wheeled carts to install plumbing and insulation, they are looking to a different future. The old mind-set that the region needs a big jobs provider – like coal – is hard to break. Younger generations watch their parents endure unsteady employment and worry about their own prospects. Older generations can’t visualize a different way forward. One mistake outsiders make, many here say, is thinking all this is actually about coal. It’s not. It’s more about the life coal provided. Where else could you earn $80,000 a year with a high school education or less? “Embrace the change or be left behind,” says Jeff Combs of Hazard, Ky., standing outside a bed-and-breakfast on a hill overlooking the community’s nearly vacant downtown. “Be open-minded. Be open-minded to more.” Mr. Combs’s father, a former coal miner, implored him to avoid the mines. It was tough work, dangerous and unhealthy in the long term. Combs’s father was on disability in his 50s. Allen Jones has been through the hard rhythms of eastern Kentucky as well. For him, as for many in the region, jobs in the mines started to vanish. “I’ve worked underground. I’ve slept underground. I’ve duckwalked. I’ve climbed ladders,” he says. “Yeah, I wanna go back in. It’s in your blood.” Sleepless nights followed his exit from the coal industry five years ago. Anxiety over how he’d provide for his wife and three children gnawed at him. Now, Mr. Jones owns two auto-repair shops. He started his business with a loan from the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, a local venture capital group that provides financing for new businesses. He’s since turned into ​an investor​ himself​, loaning neighbors money during hard times. Jones lost on several deals, but says helping his neighbors is his duty because of his “ties with people in Harlan and seeing how hard they’re having it.” While Jones constantly has “the itch” to get back underground, coal isn’t necessarily the answer to the region’s future. “We don’t care what it is,” he says. “We just want to work.” It pains Jones to know young people don’t feel they can stay in eastern Kentucky. He wants his children to take over the family business, but knows he can’t force them. “If you apply yourself right, you can start your own business even in a small town like this,” he says. That’s what many civil society groups are certainly hoping. Regionwide, the entrepreneurial push started in earnest in 2010 when philanthropies and investors banded together to form the Appalachia Funders Network, steering grants toward economic diversification. Kentucky, home to some of the poorest corners of Appalachia, has gotten involved, too. Business and political leaders have backed an initiative called Shaping Our Appalachian Region, which in turn has attracted federal grants.  Climate change is an impetus for some of the efforts. Environmental advocates say it’s disingenuous to promote policies that curb greenhouse gas emissions and pollution without supporting affected communities. The Sierra Club, for example, is trying to help fashion a new economy. What really ties the initiatives together, though, is the focus on seeding new businesses and jobs that have been lacking as coal mining has plummeted for several reasons: first, because of mechanization; then because of technological advances that allowed power plants to burn dirtier Midwest coal; and, finally, because of competition from cheaper natural gas, and the costs imposed by former President Barack Obama’s environmental regulations. Trump has pledged to stem the industry’s decline, but, beyond removing some of the environmental rules, many believe his options are limited. His proposed budget, meanwhile, would cut into federal support for the region. Notably, he calls for eliminating the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development initiative that’s been running since 1965. The proposed cuts are causing concern among many Kentucky Republicans as well as Democrats. They come as towns are already struggling with their finances. Vital government funding from severance taxes imposed on coal companies has been waning as the industry has declined. Whitesburg, a town with a concert venue, media arts center, and a couple trendy restaurants, is debating selling its recreation center and raising taxes to offset a $1.3 million shortfall. “Transitioning is tough,” says Jim Ward, the judge-executive for Letcher County, in which Whitesburg is located. “We’ve just got to figure out how to do it. And we’re just at the beginning of it.” Mr. Ward hopes expanding broadband internet access will open up telecommuting and e-commerce opportunities. Kentucky Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has made attracting tech jobs one of his biggest economic diversification goals. Some policymakers are looking at other ways to help. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R) of West Virginia has introduced legislation in Congress to set aside $525 million for a “new market tax credit.” It is intended to spur private investment in distressed former coal communities in Appalachia. In Kentucky, the state Senate is considering a bill that would put $7.5 million of the annual coal severance tax revenues into a trust fund for economic diversification. Russell Huff, a business owner in Harlan who is also an amateur rapper, says the time for diversification is ripe because eastern Kentucky has its most educated workforce ever. The younger generation grew up without expecting a coal job, so they went to college instead. He’s taught welding to many of them at a community college. Mr. Huff owns a race car shop, though it most closely resembles a pawn store. His most recent find is a white BMW two-seater, bought on the cheap (he claims it was found at the bottom of a swimming pool in a drug seizure). People called him crazy for opening a business in a “ghost town.” He doesn’t mind. Most of his business is online anyway, selling cars he fixes on eBay. Huff says his students could do more with e-commerce. “Everybody thinks that running a business [means] they’re going to be millionaires overnight,” Huff says. “You can hang your name in the window and not be a millionaire, but you won’t be at Wal-Mart wearing a little blue vest. There’s a lot of people who could do that.” While creating new businesses isn’t easy, the Knott County Area Technology Center, the vocational school involved in the tiny house project, exemplifies one way the new entrepreneurial network here works. The $15,000 grant the school won to help create new jobs is part of a Kentucky Valley Educational Cooperative contest. That nonprofit wants to develop technical curriculum to better prepare students for emerging fields. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funds some of KVEC’s push, as does a $30 million federal education grant. All the while, KVEC helps 19 school districts make inroads with local businesses and civic leaders to strengthen employment pipelines. “We’re creating opportunities to build out career pathways in areas that won’t necessarily contribute to the brain drain that’s taking place in the area and has been for 50 years,” says KVEC executive director Jeff Hawkins. “We’re trying to reinvent the community in some way.” That’s why Brad Shepherd returned to the region with his partner, Daryl Royse. They were tired of city life in Lexington, Ky., and wanted to move somewhere they felt they could make a difference. They settled on Whitesburg and opened Heritage Kitchen, a comfort food restaurant that uses locally sourced ingredients. “We offer something different,” Mr. Royse says. “But we’re not a health-food business – we’ve been accused of that,” Mr. Shepherd adds, laughing. They’re certainly not. There’s a homemade veggie burger on the menu, but the (delicious) hash brown casserole is swimming in a pool of oil. Shepherd says there’s plenty of opportunity in Whitesburg for workers who know a trade. It took them three weeks to get their ice machine fixed, and the technician came from Lexington, about 150 miles away. But Royse says finding committed employees is difficult – they’ve been trying to fill openings for months. “People are just sort of stuck,” says Royse. “It’s an in-between time in that there’s a sense of loss that they don’t know what to do.” But he’s optimistic. His business has beat expectations every quarter. “Sometimes it’s not a quick fix,” he says. “Sometimes it’s a long-term collaborative effort.” Portal 31 in Lynch, Ky., is perhaps the most apt metaphor for the region’s hopes: It’s an old mining site that has been transformed into a tourist destination.​ Filled with $4 million of animatronics, it includes a 45-minute tour that takes visitors into the bowels of a decommissioned mine – a 13-mile-deep underground city. The dampness permeating the subterranean warrens is still very real. Much of the “coal” is not – many of the displays are fiberglass. To Don Elliott, walking through this dark mine of the past with a hand-held miner’s lamp shines a light on the future. “I would love to see the tourism industry flourish here,” says Mr. Elliott, who mined coal for 39 years. “I think it can. I would love to see any kind of business come here and employ people so that kids want to stay.” Royse, who ran for city council in Whitesburg, has been prodding Kentucky’s leaders to clean up abandoned mines. If state and local leaders could return mining-scarred mountains to usable flatland, that would open up areas to all kinds of development.  One reclaimed mine is already the site of a gated housing development, “The Meadow,” in Knott County. Farther up the road, more than 100 miles of trails for all-terrain vehicles and elk-hunting grounds have emerged on reclaimed lands. Zip lines in nearby Evarts, Ky., offer another form of recreation. With a more coordinated marketing effort, the tourist trade in eastern Kentucky might be able to flourish and match that of southern Virginia, just over the other side of Black Mountain. Some people are already working to make that happen. Brook Smith, a Louisville-based businessman who made his fortune in surety bonds on reclaimed mines, is recruiting other like-minded social impact investors to channel money into eastern Kentucky. “We do think that there is momentum with projects around tourism and culture and arts and ecotourism in the region, and we can help support that in some ways,” says Lora Smith, who is advising Mr. Smith on his philanthropic endeavors.  Shane Lucas represents another attempt to revitalize the region – one lettuce leaf at a time. He operates a small farm in the Appalachian foothills near Whitesburg.  His spread includes a sizable greenhouse where rows of purple-green lettuce sprawl across the floor. He’ll sell three bushels to Heritage Kitchen this week, but his big payoff is when the farmers market opens in the spring. The market accounts for at least half of Mr. Lucas’s farm income. “Growing is easy. Marketing is hard,” says Lucas, walking around his greenhouse in camouflage rubber boots and a hooded sweatshirt. Through a program called Grow Appalachia, Lucas is encouraging others to take up farming. He teaches them how to tend to their own gardens. Like many people here, Lucas was once a coal miner. But when he was last laid off in November 2015, he turned his hobby into a full-time business. Lucas is honest, though – if his wife didn’t have a job and health insurance, he wouldn’t be farming. He’d be tempted to go back to the mines if they reopened, even at a steeply reduced salary if it came with benefits. Still, he thinks there’s potential for agriculture in eastern Kentucky. Many in the development community do, too.  “Eastern Kentucky has always been about food,” says Kathy Curtis, who works with the local group Community Farm Alliance. “When people start out, they always go back to their roots.”  Whitesburg has a unique setup for farmers through a local nonprofit. The FARMACY program, run by Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation and Community Farm Alliance, gives low-income residents “prescriptions” for fruits and vegetables. Patients purchase produce with wooden chips, which sellers like Lucas exchange for cash. It encourages healthy eating – and new jobs. “The big talk in Whitesburg is the farmers market because there’s so much money rolling in from the health-care providers,” says Lucas.  Right now, the students at Knott County are just trying to finish their tiny house. Chris Hall is in the shop room building cabinets. Mr. Hall plans to go to college after he graduates. His dad, a former coal miner, wants his son to do anything but work underground. Hall says he will come back on weekends to see family and friends. The yearning to return, even if temporarily, is common. T.J. Short, a burly redhead who’s heading to West Virginia to dig coal after graduation, says he, too, plans to come home on weekends. He doesn’t know how long he’ll have his job anyway.  “I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t scared, but I hope it works out there,” says Mr. Short of his mining venture. One day these students may not have to leave the area to begin with. That will depend on whether a new Appalachia can be created. Many of the students have already taken the first step: They’re pinning their future hopes on something other than coal. But the second step, finding something else to do, will be harder. Yet many of those wielding hammers and screw guns here harbor the boundless idealism of youth. “All businesses, when you start out, are going to be rough,” says Billy Spears, who will run a logging company with his grandfather after graduating. “It’ll pay off in the end.” Tiny houses. Big dreams.  Related stories Could you pass a US citizenship test? In this Trump enclave, a pining for Obamacare?

Hume Hot meals of polish sausage, sauerkraut and corn and carrots prepared for Meals on Wheels customers at the Klamath Basin Senior Center on Tuesday. Wielding a hot lunch tray, Meals on Wheels volunteer delivery driver Larry Gibbs tapped on the door of a downtown Klamath Falls apartment on Tuesday morning. “Good morning, Meals on Wheels,” Gibbs calls out. Rose Earl, 67, answers the door, smiling at Gibbs before taking the meal of Polish sausage, sauerkraut, carrots, and corn into her room. Story continues below video × Advertisement “It helps out with groceries,” Earl said. “I'm on a limited income. “My husband died recently and I couldn't afford where we were living,” she added. Earl is one of a couple hundred served in Klamath County by the program that not only gives them a hot meal, but gives social workers a chance to check up on those most likely in need of health services. With proposed federal funding cuts to some programs falling under the Older Americans Act by President Donald Trump's 2018 budget, Meals on Wheels of Klamath and Lake Counties, operated by the Klamath & Lake Counties Council on Aging (KLCCOA) and Oregon Project Independence (OPI) faces an uncertain future. State program cuts of greater concern “It wasn't unexpected,” said Kim Estes, aging council executive director. “What really would be cut is the Older Americans Act, and there's no numbers in there of where they will cut. "Not only are we funded for Meals on Wheels, but we're funded for in-home care programs and caregiver programs and respite care and congregate meals. All of our programs are nationally funded." Estes, who has served in the role for two years, is more concerned about potential funding cuts for the aging council's only state-funded program, OPI. Those cuts are in Oregon Gov. Kate Brown's budget plan. The program, which aids home-bound seniors with care giving services, is slated to be cut by 75 percent as proposed, Estes said. “Which would be almost like slashing it out of the budget,” Estes said. “That's the bigger worry. That's where we hire someone to go in and keep people in their home by giving them a few hours of help, like bathing, and toileting, and shopping. “It's such a cost benefit to the state of Oregon,” Estes added. “For instance, a nursing home can cost up to $8,000 a month, and OPI costs $332 a month. That's the difference. Why would they cut a program that saves hundreds of thousands of dollars out of their own federal budget?” The Older Americans Act matches federal dollars to benefit OPI in-home care. “If we lose this program, we also lose millions of federal dollars,” Estes added. Care for those in greatest need Wendy Pearce, who manages dozens of recipients of Meals on Wheels and other council on aging programs, laid out how OPI helps seniors. With hourly rates for senior care giving services hovering around $20-$21 per hour, Pearce pointed to a chart detailing how low-income seniors can save through the program, and avoid moving to institution care. A senior couple that earns less than $1,500 per month, may only need to pay a small, one-time fee for care giving services, according to Pearce. Those who earn between $1,500 and $1,759 may only need to contribute 5 percent of the cost. Those earning upwards of $4,000 per month would pay most or all of the cost, she added. “When you can't get up to take a shower and you can't go get your medicine, you can't go to grocery store and your kids work full-time or they don't even live in this town, they're so isolated they'll just sit there and die before they ask for help,” Estes said. The program aims to help those who cannot afford the costs associated with remaining in their homes. “If you're making $2,000 a month, can you afford to pay $20 an hour?” Pearce asks on behalf of seniors. “We just try to help people.” Pearce is concerned if cuts to the federal program are made, the aging council's ability to staff caregivers at its current level will be affected. “We need the Meals on Wheels, we need to get these people checked on and make sure that they're okay,” Pearce said. “We need the volunteers, we need to have the Oregon Project Independence to help these people ...You cut that out, what is going to happen? These people are going to end up in institutions.” Pearce paused. “These people are going to die.” Public-private partnership Meals on Wheels operates through a public-private partnership, with hot and frozen meal deliveries being made by volunteers through the Klamath Basin Senior Center, and through a case manager based in Lake County. The council provides case management, with case managers working directly with meal recipients, making an assessment of potential and ongoing clients. And the waiting list for meals has grown, according to officials. “We're serving 191 seniors in Klamath County,” Estes said. “In Lake County, we only have 18 with a no-wait list. And we have 21 on the wait list for Klamath. The people on the wait list are just borderline needy, they're doing okay. It would really help them to have it, but they're not going to suffer from not having it.” Those in immediate need who cannot be served by Meals on Wheels are directed to the Aging and People with Disabilities program. Meals increase by 10 percent John Beard has served as lead cook for the senior center for three years and has seen a boost in demand for the meals. “We recently increased, I would say, about 10 percent over the last several months, just in the number of meals we're delivering,” Beard said. “We try to make sure it's a nutritious and a full meal,” Beard added. “Unfortunately, some of them split it into two meals and it's really too small for that.” “Sometimes, it's the only meal they get in a day,” Estes said. “They're surviving on it.” The aging council helps seniors who cannot eat regular meals anymore with a liquid supplement, according to Estes. It's something new the agency has been able to provide through a $2,500 grant from the Walmart Foundation. It purchases the liquid supplemtn Ensure by the case. “The word's gotten out that we have it, so now everybody wants it,” Estes said. “It's already gone actually.” May fundraiser The council's advisory board, in conjunction with the Klamath County Library, is holding an annual silent auction in May to benefit the Meals on Wheels program, including obtaining funding for more liquid supplements for seniors in the program. “We also get donations from the seniors, too,” Estes said. “Not all of them are low-income. It's a need base. We want them to stay in their home for as long as possible, with dignity, so they don't have to go into an institutional setting.” Vital link to the outside Volunteer drivers such as Larry Gibbs play a vital role in senior recipients lives as a point of contact when they might not have one otherwise. “Drivers will call us immediately and say, so-and-so didn't answer their door,” Estes said. Case managers will then follow up with recipients and their emergency contacts. In rare occurrences, seniors have been found in distress or sometimes deceased. “I tell people that the food is important but also the wellness check,” Pearce said. “We've found more than one person on the floor. We just had one that had fallen a couple of days ago.” Gibbs, who has served as a delivery driver for five years, has seen it first-hand. During his first week as a driver, Gibbs said he found a senior had passed away. “It's rewarding … and terribly sad sometimes,” Estes said. “When they go off Meals on Wheels, it's usually because they passed away, and that's how we open up slots.” Meals on Wheels has been offered in Klamath and Lake Counties since the enactment of the Older Americans Act of 1965. hdillemuth@heraldandnews.com By the numbers MEALS ON WHEELS BY THE NUMBERs: 67,000 – Meals delivered within Klamath Falls area each year 191 – Enrolled in Meals on Wheels in Klamath County 167 – Enrolled in Meals on Wheels in Klamath Falls area, which could include within urban growth boundary 18 – Enrolled in Meals on Wheels in Lake County 21 – Seniors on the wait list (Number fluctuates) Meals on Wheels America speaks out on funding In a letter, displayed on Meals on Wheels' America's website, addressed to Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Budget and Management based in Washington, D.C., Ellie Hollander, chief executive officer and president of Meals on Wheels America, urges support for the program through federal funding, and for clarity regarding funding. “We have always been cautious and careful in stating that we do not know whether there will be cuts proposed for the nutrition programs authorized under the Older Americans Act (OAA), administered by the U.S Department of Human Services,” Hollander wrote in the letter. “However, because OAA funding represents on average about 35 percent of a Meals on Wheels program's budget, we remain deeply concerned about the potential for further reductions in order to achieve the 17.9 percent proposed cuts to the HHS' budget. This threat, on top of the elimination of both the Community Development and Community Services Block Grants, as well as the senior volunteer and employment programs, will substantially undermine Meals on Wheels' ability to effectively serve those seniors who are highly vulnerable and at risk.” Tags Economics Program Commerce Finance Meals On Wheels Oregon Project Independence Larry Gibbs Kim Estes Meal Wendy Pearce Senior Holly Dillemuth Follow Holly Dillemuth Close Get email notifications on Holly Dillemuth daily!

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link via Twitter Earlier this year, seven-year-old Ginessa Vinanti Wride lost all of her hair due to a rare disorder called alopecia. Alopecia is an immune system disorder that causes the body to shed hair due to its failure to recognize its own body cells. In just twenty days, all of her hair was gone. Fearing her child would be bullied for being different, her mother made a heartfelt plea to her classmates.  “When her hair began falling out at an alarming rate I talked to her first-grade class,” Ginessa’s mother, Daniella Wride, told Buzzfeed. “I asked them to be her special lookout for anyone that might be bullying her, and I explained what alopecia is. There have been a few times people have made awful comments to her, but overall the response has been amazing.” Ginessa’s condition hasn’t stopped her from participating in her favorite hobbies, fashion and karate, but it did pose some difficulty when her school’s annual crazy hair day came along. But, never one to back down from a challenge, Ginessa and her mother got together to do something brilliant.  “I came across some scrapbooking stickers in Walmart.

The struggling office-supply retailer has put itself up for sale. Is there are reason to buy it? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Apr 9, 2017 at 1:14PM Staples Inc (NASDAQ:SPLS) stock has been on a tear over the last few days amid rumors of a potential buyout. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company is in talks with private-equity firms to sell itself after regulators blew up its planned merger with Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) last year. The office supply industry has been under pressure for several years, as the internet and digitization of communication reduces the demand for paper, printers, and copiers. Given this, and the 14% run-up in Staples' share price since the news broke, a better question may be: Who would want to buy the company? Image source: Motley Fool. A broken retail model  Big-box retailers across the board are facing challenges, but Staples' are particularly extreme. Same-store sales at the office-supply specialist have declined every year since 2007, even as its store count has fallen by a third since 2012.  Sales in the general office-supply retail industry have fallen by half over the last decade, and closing weaker stores and initiatives such as partnering with Workbar to set up coworking spaces inside stores have done little to reverse store performance. Comparable sales in the company's retail division fell 5% last year, but the division remains profitable, with an operating margin of 4.8% and operating income of $379 million. Profits, however, fell 16% from the year before, and the margin decreased 50 basis points. Like other struggling retail formats, Staples' retail business seems to be in an inevitable decline. The company is likely to close more stores as traffic falls, and already has plans to shutter 70 this year. A stable delivery business As Staples' retail business has declined, its delivery operation has become its key strength. The delivery business contributed about 60% of total sales from continuing operations last year, and though revenue in the division declined 1% last year, operating profits increased 8% to $672 million as operating margin improved 50 basis points to 6.3%. But continuing to grow those profits will not be easy, as Staples faces entrenched competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others. And while general e-commerce sales have been growing 15% annually, the office retailer's inability to grow its sales may indicate that it's losing market share.  During its campaign to get its merger approved by the Federal Trade Commission, Staples repeatedly use Amazon as a foil, claiming its competitive threat made a merger with Office Depot necessary and not anti-competitive. At least 38% of Staples' customers overlap with Amazon's, and the democratization of the internet has allowed brick-and-mortar chains like Target and Wal-Mart to build out their own online office retail businesses. In other words, though Staples' delivery business is solid, its future prosperity is not guaranteed. A good deal for private equity? Unlike some struggling retailers, Staples is solidly profitable, with free cash flow of around $700 million last year and a non-GAAP net income of $586 million from continuing operations. On a P/E basis, Staples stock was trading under 10 before speculation broke about a buyout.  A private-equity company could accelerate store closures and invest in the delivery business, or just harvest profits from the company, but it's unclear what a viable turnaround strategy would be or how it would profit from a sale or IPO down the road in a declining industry.  Other private equity buyouts in retail haven't gone so well recently. Toys 'R' Us has struggled since a 2005 buyout by several PE firms, and privately owned Payless recently declared bankruptcy, joining a parade of retailers that have done so. J. Crew also finds itself in turmoil after three straight years of comparable sales declines and losing its creative director. It makes sense for Staples' management to seek a buyer as the company seems to have run out of options for providing sustainable growth and profits. At this point, a sale is not guaranteed -- but without it, Staples investors will again find themselves tied and bound. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

This photo features a big brown bat, the most common species of bat in the United States. (AP Photo) By Susan Lunny Keag skeag@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y.--  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Saturday that they are working with the Florida Department of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an investigation of a dead bat that was found in a packaged salad purchased from a grocery store in Florida. Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found, according to a statement from the CDC.  The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease, according to the agency. Fresh Express announced on Saturday a precautionary recall of a limited number of cases of Organic Marketside Spring Mix.  The item subject to the recall is 5 oz. Organic Marketside Spring Mix marketed in a clear container with production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of April 14, 2017 located on the front label. The UPC code 6 8113132897 5  is located on the bottom of the container. The recalled salads were distributed only to Walmart stores located in the Southeastern region of the United States.  No other Marketside salads are included in the recall. Transmission of rabies by eating a rabid animal is extremely uncommon, and the virus does not survive very long outside of the infected animal. The CDC is supporting Florida local and state health officials in evaluating the people who found the bat in the salad. "The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies," according to a statement from the agency. In this circumstance, the risk of rabies transmission is considered to be very low, according to the CDC. However, the two people who ate the salad from the package that contained the bat were recommended to begin post-exposure rabies treatment. Both people report being in good health and neither has any signs of rabies. The CDC is not aware of any other reports of bat material found in packaged salads. All remaining packages of salad from the same lot have been removed from all store locations where the salad was sold. "Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation and initiate product removal and recall procedures," Fresh Express said in a statement. Consumers who may have already purchased the recalled product should discard and not consume it.  A full refund is available where purchased or by calling the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center toll-free at (800) 242-5472 during the hours of 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time.

Creighton/TSM COLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) — The father of a Tennessee teenager says the 50-year-old teacher she vanished with last month is “nothing but a liar.” Anthony Thomas tried to deliver a message to his missing 15-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, on Wednesday by telling WKRN-TV (http://bit.ly/2oEOJtZ ) “we all need you home.” He said teacher Tad Cummins is “filtering” the news the girl sees. He urged Cummins to turn himself in. Cummins and Thomas were reported missing on March 13. The last confirmed sighting of the pair was two days later at an Oklahoma City Walmart. Police have issued an Amber alert for Thomas and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. A tree was planted in honor of Thomas in a Tennessee park Wednesday as part of national crime victim’s rights week.

Now, they’re also stocking their medicine cabinets with organic beauty products and cosmetics. The demand for natural beauty products, creams with special ingredients, serums that tackle a specific beauty issue, and cosmetics that can multitask has prompted heightened interest in small and midsize players in the cosmetic ingredients sector. “Five or 10 years ago, cosmetic consumers were buying image,” said Mark Dixon, chief thinking officer at ThinkingLinking, a global mergers-and-acquisitions firm that specializes in emerging growth markets and investors. “Now they’re buying science, or believe they’re buying science.” Consumers care about what they’re wearing on their bodies in much the same way they care about what they’re putting in their bodies, Dixon said. Moreover, there is a new trend toward “quality and traceability” of ingredients. With increased regulation, cosmetics are being treated more like pharmaceutical products, and it becomes critical that companies know what exactly is going into their jars.

Here's how the financial industry is making money on the surge. “Companies are expanding their geographical sourcing and geographical customer channels but at the same time are expanding the range of products they control,” he said in a statement. A more established cosmetic ingredients company can provide accountability, but smaller companies can have access to coveted components and technologies, or may have the patents for them. According to ThinkingLinking’s report “Alchemists go shopping,” which analyzes the consolidation happening among cosmetics ingredients producers, there were 50 acquisitions in the five-year span of 2012 to 2016, with 45 different buyers involved. The biggest cosmetic ingredient deal, Symrise AG’s SY1, -0.23%   acquisition of Pinova Holdings Inc., was worth $417.0 million. Some of Pinova’s products are used for depilatory waxes, including those deemed “spa formula.” International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. IFF, -0.59%  , one of the largest companies in the sector with $3.12 billion in sales in 2016, acquired Lucas Meyer Cosmetics for $311 million. International Flavors was also the acquirer for the fifth largest deal, valued at $88 million. It bought Aromor Flavors and Fragrances, whose products include natural and “nature identical” materials. Most of the top 50 deals, 46 total, were for less than $100 million, according to Dixon. Read also: This is what Panera did to make its menu ‘clean “What you’re seeing now is a consolidation of some slices of the sector that weren’t previously consolidated,” said Dixon. “The middle market is consolidating the middle market and then the big players can snap them up.” The deal activity on the ingredients side of the cosmetics equation comes in response to a more finicky, and more educated consumer, who is shifting the landscape on the product side of the equation. With more access to both products and information about them, shoppers are choosing to purchase cosmetics that contain, or don’t contain, particular additives, and promise specific results. In this environment, smaller, independent, and very flexible beauty companies are coming to market and developing loyal customers. “These brands have a story, focus on a particular kind of skin, ethnicity or hair type,” said Sarah Jindal, senior innovation and insight analyst for beauty and personal care at Mintel, a market research company. “One-size-fits-all doesn’t resonate with consumers in this day and age. A brand with a personal story is another important aspect of what draws us into a brand.” There’s been a “shift in the way big guys handle their acquisitions,” Jindal said. Rather than buying a company and trying to integrate them as quickly as possible, big beauty companies are letting their small acquisitions do what they do best without too much interference. In return these small companies fill in gaps like a new audience or customer group. See also: Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way As a result, these large companies have purchased an established product rather than creating a new one, and probably saved money on expensive launch costs like advertising and public relations along the way. “The amount of indie brands that are coming out and resonating with a younger consumer base is ensuring their future growth,” said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst at NPD Group. The only thing these customers care about is whether the product works for them. “These are companies that larger and smaller companies want to have in their portfolio so they can have sustainable growth over time,” Grant said. Some of the brands that have thrived with the backing of a larger company are Urban Decay and IT Cosmetics, both under the L’Oréal SA OR, +0.75%   umbrella. “A company who’s small today can be huge tomorrow,” said Grant. “Don’t underestimate any brand today.” On the ingredients side, bigger players clearly see the value of smaller companies in the sector. And it’s not just about money. “These businesses are the opposite of commodity,” said Richard Despard, senior linker at ThinkingLinking, in a statement. “They are special and each is different. Economic value comes from considerable barriers to entry - knowhow, technology, often patents as well, customer relationships and a deep understand of ‘ingredient trajectories.’” More from MarketWatch What Happens if Filibusters Go Away?

Makes Most of Its Money Amazon’s revenue model is simpler than it might seem. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Apr 9, 2017 at 12:12PM Alexa, cloud computing, delivery drones, and more: For all its headline-grabbing innovations, the business model for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) can seem dizzyingly complex. The reality is much different though. Amazon's core business model is actually fairly simple. In this article, we'll explore how Amazon produces its sales and profits, as well as a few more points about how investors should think about the world's largest e-commerce operator. Breaking down Amazon's sales and profit drivers Amazon organizes its reporting structure around two main lines of business: its online retail operations and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform -- Amazon further divides retail into North America and International sub-segments. Here's a quick snapshot into how these three key categories have grown for Amazon over the last few years: Amazon Sales  2014 2015 2016 North America $50.8 billion  $63.7 billion $79.7 billion International $33.5 billion  $35.4 billion  $43.9 billion AWS $4.6 billion $7.8 billion $12.2 billion  Data Source: Amazon.com 2016 Form 10-K  Amazon remains in high-growth mode across its three main business categories, though AWS is growing at the fastest pace. By then comparing the above chart against Amazon's operating profit per unit one can truly understand how the company works. Amazon Operating Income  2014 2015 2016 North America $360 million $1.4 billion $2.3 billion International -$640 million -$699 million -$1.2 billion AWS $458 million $1.5 billion $3.1 billion Data Source: Amazon.com 2016 Form 10-K  A clear split shines through between Amazon's main sources of sales and operating profits. Its e-commerce platform clearly drives the top line. But AWS produces the bulk of its actual earnings, even as the company has repeatedly slashed prices for its cloud computing products in a bid to capture as much market share as possible. It's also worth noting that Amazon continues its long-standing practice of running its entire retail business at or near break-even. The underlying narrative for Amazon's retail business is that it's stealing market share from brick-and-mortar retail, a trend that is still in its early stages. The data point I typically cite as part of this argument is the Department of Commerce's figure on e-commerce sales as a percentage of total U.S. retail sales. In the most report, from the final quarter of 2016, e-commerce accounted for just 8.3% of all American retail sales. Aside from specialty verticals, fierce price competition generally characterizes the retail industry, and Amazon loves to use rock-bottom pricing as a mechanism to gain more market share. It's for this reason that Amazon can be thought of as the "Wal-Mart of the Web." Image Source: Getty Images Investing in innovation To be sure, Amazon's dominant beachheads in e-commerce and cloud computing -- two massive generational growth markets -- are reason enough to invest in the company. However, the fact that Amazon was able to conceive of and grow these two businesses speaks to an even more important underlying ability to invent that should help the company stay ahead of the competition. Case in point, this section of  CEO Jeff Bezos' 2016 letter to shareholders  speaks volumes about Amazon's culture: I believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment... Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of ten... Big winners pay for so many experiments. Bezos captures this important subtlety perfectly. To be sure, Amazon's massive financial footprint serves as the dollars-and-cents manifestation of his company's ability to take big risks. However, I also think it bears noting that Amazon's true long-term competitive advantage may be that it was designed by Bezos and his executive team to continually take such risks. Just think of the laundry list of products and services that the company pioneered or helped pioneer that looked impossible as recently as a decade prior: Alexa, AWS, and forthcoming efforts like delivery drones are just a handful of examples of Amazon's ability to see around the corner to where business is headed. To me, this is the crux of why you should own Amazon. It will likely win the global races for e-commerce and cloud computing dominance. It will also continue experimenting with new ideas that should yield new opportunities in the future. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Alfredo Sosa/Staff | Caption Loading... Zack Colman Staff Writer | @zcolman April 9, 2017 HINDMAN, Ky.— Teddy Martin knows the life of a Kentucky coal miner. He spent years working underground. Sometimes he burrowed through coal seams where the crawl space was just 28 inches high, so tight that “you had to pack a straw to drink your pop.”  It was hard, dangerous work. But it paid well – an allure that was obvious even back in high school, when Mr. Martin saw his friends graduate and come back with new cars. He wanted the same. The problem: The work always ended. Mining jobs kept disappearing, and he was laid off half a dozen times. With each pink slip, he’d take community college classes to learn a new trade. Now, that experience has given Martin a new mission – coaxing a young generation here to envision lives that don’t revolve around hauling solid black fuel out of the ground. On this late-winter day, as a teacher at a vocational school, Martin is guiding his students toward the finish line in a “tiny house” competition. The contest pits them against students from two other nearby towns to see whose house, when sold at an auction, can net the most money for their school. But the real idea is not just to raise money. It’s to raise aspirations. Could you pass a US citizenship test? Tiny houses. Big dreams. Students at the Knott County Area Technology Center, hoping to learn new skills that will lead to future jobs, build a tiny house as part of a competition with young people from other local schools. Alfredo Sosa/Staff | Caption Martin, with a black ponytail and denim overalls, hopes that learning trades will allow his students to stay in Hindman after they graduate, and perhaps start businesses of their own right here. Many want to, but worry they can’t.  “I’m going to stay here as long as I can,” says Brad Breeding, a senior. “I was born and raised here. I don’t wanna leave home. But if it came down to it, I would.” The tiny house project may seem exactly that – tiny. But it’s part of a coordinated effort that’s gathering momentum in Appalachian coal country, aiming to deliver opportunity to a region that has long stood as a symbol of persistent rural poverty in the United States. For decades, coal supplied many here with a soot-stained, mountain-hollow version of a middle-class lifestyle. But even 50 years ago, near mining’s heyday, this craggy terrain was a focal point in President Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty. Now, in a bid to move the region beyond reliance on either government support or a single uncertain industry, a broad web of local and national foundations, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society groups is trying to resurrect eastern Kentucky and other parts of America’s penurious Coal Belt. Perhaps more than at any time in the past, the focus is on bootstrap ingenuity – encouraging a more entrepreneurial economy. The goal is not just to pump money into the region, but to help communities like Hindman foster the desire and have the tools to build a new future for themselves, one small business at a time. “We’ve been waiting for someone to come in and save the day,” says Kelly Hall, innovation director at the school where Martin works, the Knott County Area Technology Center. “But I think the answer lies within.” If the vision is impressive, so are the region’s challenges. Here in Knott County, for example, the roughly 10 percent unemployment rate is twice the national average, on top of an unusually high rate of adults not even entering the workforce to look for a job. The 33 percent poverty rate is more than twice the national average. Kentucky has among the nation’s highest rates of drug-overdose deaths, and the rate in Knott County has been among the highest in the state.  Donald Trump made the revival of coal jobs a big theme in his successful campaign for the presidency. But to energy industry experts, any turnaround looks likely to be modest at best, given the long trend of decline that has brought eastern Kentucky coal employment from 66,000 in 1948 to fewer than 6,000 as of 2015.  Many in this region have some Trump- inspired hope for a coal rebound. The longstanding link to mining here is hard to break. But residents also know that President Trump can’t wish away the forces – mechanization in the mines and competition from abundant natural gas – that have driven coal’s decline. To many, the region simply has no choice but to adapt and diversify. Towns like Hindman, across a mining region that runs through the ancient folds of the Appalachian Mountains, from Pennsylvania to West Virginia to Tennessee, are beginning to see the opportunities – in fields such as tourism, agriculture, e-commerce, and environmental cleanup.  “There are a lot of different smaller things,” says Jeff Wilder, who heads the tourism office in Harlan County, 60 miles south of Hindman. “I think a lot of people here have decided to use their ingenuity to do other things [than coal].” Perhaps more important, young residents like Mr. Breeding have one advantage over generations past: They’re growing up without the deep-rooted loyalty to coal mining that their parents and grandparents harbored. As his classmates scale ladders around the tiny house, or slide underneath it on wheeled carts to install plumbing and insulation, they are looking to a different future. The old mind-set that the region needs a big jobs provider – like coal – is hard to break. Younger generations watch their parents endure unsteady employment and worry about their own prospects. Older generations can’t visualize a different way forward. One mistake outsiders make, many here say, is thinking all this is actually about coal. It’s not. It’s more about the life coal provided. Where else could you earn $80,000 a year with a high school education or less? “Embrace the change or be left behind,” says Jeff Combs of Hazard, Ky., standing outside a bed-and-breakfast on a hill overlooking the community’s nearly vacant downtown. “Be open-minded. Be open-minded to more.” Mr. Combs’s father, a former coal miner, implored him to avoid the mines. It was tough work, dangerous and unhealthy in the long term. Combs’s father was on disability in his 50s. Allen Jones has been through the hard rhythms of eastern Kentucky as well. For him, as for many in the region, jobs in the mines started to vanish. “I’ve worked underground. I’ve slept underground. I’ve duckwalked. I’ve climbed ladders,” he says. “Yeah, I wanna go back in. It’s in your blood.” Sleepless nights followed his exit from the coal industry five years ago. Anxiety over how he’d provide for his wife and three children gnawed at him. ‘We don’t care what [the job] is. We just want to work.’ – Allen Jones, a former coal miner who now owns two auto-repair shops in Harlan, Ky. Alfredo Sosa/Staff | Caption Now, Mr. Jones owns two auto-repair shops. He started his business with a loan from the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, a local venture capital group that provides financing for new businesses. He’s since turned into ​an investor​ himself​, loaning neighbors money during hard times. Jones lost on several deals, but says helping his neighbors is his duty because of his “ties with people in Harlan and seeing how hard they’re having it.” While Jones constantly has “the itch” to get back underground, coal isn’t necessarily the answer to the region’s future. “We don’t care what it is,” he says. “We just want to work.” It pains Jones to know young people don’t feel they can stay in eastern Kentucky. He wants his children to take over the family business, but knows he can’t force them. “If you apply yourself right, you can start your own business even in a small town like this,” he says. That’s what many civil society groups are certainly hoping. Regionwide, the entrepreneurial push started in earnest in 2010 when philanthropies and investors banded together to form the Appalachia Funders Network, steering grants toward economic diversification. Kentucky, home to some of the poorest corners of Appalachia, has gotten involved, too. Business and political leaders have backed an initiative called Shaping Our Appalachian Region, which in turn has attracted federal grants.  Homes sprawl out in a valley of mountainous Letcher County in eastern Kentucky. Alfredo Sosa/Staff | Caption Climate change is an impetus for some of the efforts. Environmental advocates say it’s disingenuous to promote policies that curb greenhouse gas emissions and pollution without supporting affected communities. The Sierra Club, for example, is trying to help fashion a new economy. What really ties the initiatives together, though, is the focus on seeding new businesses and jobs that have been lacking as coal mining has plummeted for several reasons: first, because of mechanization; then because of technological advances that allowed power plants to burn dirtier Midwest coal; and, finally, because of competition from cheaper natural gas, and the costs imposed by former President Barack Obama’s environmental regulations. Trump has pledged to stem the industry’s decline, but, beyond removing some of the environmental rules, many believe his options are limited. His proposed budget, meanwhile, would cut into federal support for the region. Notably, he calls for eliminating the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development initiative that’s been running since 1965. The proposed cuts are causing concern among many Kentucky Republicans as well as Democrats. They come as towns are already struggling with their finances. Vital government funding from severance taxes imposed on coal companies has been waning as the industry has declined. Whitesburg, a town with a concert venue, media arts center, and a couple trendy restaurants, is debating selling its recreation center and raising taxes to offset a $1.3 million shortfall. “Transitioning is tough,” says Jim Ward, the judge-executive for Letcher County, in which Whitesburg is located. “We’ve just got to figure out how to do it. And we’re just at the beginning of it.” Mr. Ward hopes expanding broadband internet access will open up telecommuting and e-commerce opportunities. Kentucky Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has made attracting tech jobs one of his biggest economic diversification goals. Some policymakers are looking at other ways to help. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R) of West Virginia has introduced legislation in Congress to set aside $525 million for a “new market tax credit.” It is intended to spur private investment in distressed former coal communities in Appalachia. In Kentucky, the state Senate is considering a bill that would put $7.5 million of the annual coal severance tax revenues into a trust fund for economic diversification. Russell Huff, a business owner in Harlan who is also an amateur rapper, says the time for diversification is ripe because eastern Kentucky has its most educated workforce ever. The younger generation grew up without expecting a coal job, so they went to college instead. He’s taught welding to many of them at a community college. Mr. Huff owns a race car shop, though it most closely resembles a pawn store. His most recent find is a white BMW two-seater, bought on the cheap (he claims it was found at the bottom of a swimming pool in a drug seizure). People called him crazy for opening a business in a “ghost town.” He doesn’t mind. Most of his business is online anyway, selling cars he fixes on eBay. Huff says his students could do more with e-commerce. “Everybody thinks that running a business [means] they’re going to be millionaires overnight,” Huff says. “You can hang your name in the window and not be a millionaire, but you won’t be at Wal-Mart wearing a little blue vest. There’s a lot of people who could do that.” ‘Growing is easy. Marketing is hard.’ – Shane Lucas, a former coal miner near Whitesburg, Ky., who has become a full-time farmer. Alfredo Sosa/Staff | Caption While creating new businesses isn’t easy, the Knott County Area Technology Center, the vocational school involved in the tiny house project, exemplifies one way the new entrepreneurial network here works. The $15,000 grant the school won to help create new jobs is part of a Kentucky Valley Educational Cooperative contest. That nonprofit wants to develop technical curriculum to better prepare students for emerging fields. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funds some of KVEC’s push, as does a $30 million federal education grant. All the while, KVEC helps 19 school districts make inroads with local businesses and civic leaders to strengthen employment pipelines. “We’re creating opportunities to build out career pathways in areas that won’t necessarily contribute to the brain drain that’s taking place in the area and has been for 50 years,” says KVEC executive director Jeff Hawkins. “We’re trying to reinvent the community in some way.” That’s why Brad Shepherd returned to the region with his partner, Daryl Royse. They were tired of city life in Lexington, Ky., and wanted to move somewhere they felt they could make a difference. They settled on Whitesburg and opened Heritage Kitchen, a comfort food restaurant that uses locally sourced ingredients. “We offer something different,” Mr. Royse says. “But we’re not a health-food business – we’ve been accused of that,” Mr. Shepherd adds, laughing. They’re certainly not. There’s a homemade veggie burger on the menu, but the (delicious) hash brown casserole is swimming in a pool of oil. Shepherd says there’s plenty of opportunity in Whitesburg for workers who know a trade. It took them three weeks to get their ice machine fixed, and the technician came from Lexington, about 150 miles away. But Royse says finding committed employees is difficult – they’ve been trying to fill openings for months. “People are just sort of stuck,” says Royse. “It’s an in-between time in that there’s a sense of loss that they don’t know what to do.” But he’s optimistic. His business has beat expectations every quarter. “Sometimes it’s not a quick fix,” he says. “Sometimes it’s a long-term collaborative effort.” Portal 31 in Lynch, Ky., is perhaps the most apt metaphor for the region’s hopes: It’s an old mining site that has been transformed into a tourist destination.​ Filled with $4 million of animatronics, it includes a 45-minute tour that takes visitors into the bowels of a decommissioned mine – a 13-mile-deep underground city. The dampness permeating the subterranean warrens is still very real. Much of the “coal” is not – many of the displays are fiberglass. To Don Elliott, walking through this dark mine of the past with a hand-held miner’s lamp shines a light on the future. “I would love to see the tourism industry flourish here,” says Mr. Elliott, who mined coal for 39 years. “I think it can. I would love to see any kind of business come here and employ people so that kids want to stay.” Royse, who ran for city council in Whitesburg, has been prodding Kentucky’s leaders to clean up abandoned mines. If state and local leaders could return mining-scarred mountains to usable flatland, that would open up areas to all kinds of development.  Portal 31, an early coal mine in Kentucky, is now a museum where visitors can take a tour to see what it was like to work in the underground warrens. The site in Lynch, Ky., features more than $4 million worth of animatronics – including these two ‘miners’ Alfredo Sosa/Staff | Caption One reclaimed mine is already the site of a gated housing development, “The Meadow,” in Knott County. Farther up the road, more than 100 miles of trails for all-terrain vehicles and elk-hunting grounds have emerged on reclaimed lands. Zip lines in nearby Evarts, Ky., offer another form of recreation. With a more coordinated marketing effort, the tourist trade in eastern Kentucky might be able to flourish and match that of southern Virginia, just over the other side of Black Mountain. Some people are already working to make that happen. Brook Smith, a Louisville-based businessman who made his fortune in surety bonds on reclaimed mines, is recruiting other like-minded social impact investors to channel money into eastern Kentucky. “We do think that there is momentum with projects around tourism and culture and arts and ecotourism in the region, and we can help support that in some ways,” says Lora Smith, who is advising Mr. Smith on his philanthropic endeavors.  Shane Lucas represents another attempt to revitalize the region – one lettuce leaf at a time. He operates a small farm in the Appalachian foothills near Whitesburg.  His spread includes a sizable greenhouse where rows of purple-green lettuce sprawl across the floor. He’ll sell three bushels to Heritage Kitchen this week, but his big payoff is when the farmers market opens in the spring. The market accounts for at least half of Mr. Lucas’s farm income. “Growing is easy. Marketing is hard,” says Lucas, walking around his greenhouse in camouflage rubber boots and a hooded sweatshirt. Through a program called Grow Appalachia, Lucas is encouraging others to take up farming. He teaches them how to tend to their own gardens. Like many people here, Lucas was once a coal miner. But when he was last laid off in November 2015, he turned his hobby into a full-time business. Lucas is honest, though – if his wife didn’t have a job and health insurance, he wouldn’t be farming. He’d be tempted to go back to the mines if they reopened, even at a steeply reduced salary if it came with benefits. Still, he thinks there’s potential for agriculture in eastern Kentucky. Many in the development community do, too.  “Eastern Kentucky has always been about food,” says Kathy Curtis, who works with the local group Community Farm Alliance. “When people start out, they always go back to their roots.”  Whitesburg has a unique setup for farmers through a local nonprofit. The FARMACY program, run by Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation and Community Farm Alliance, gives low-income residents “prescriptions” for fruits and vegetables. Patients purchase produce with wooden chips, which sellers like Lucas exchange for cash. It encourages healthy eating – and new jobs. “The big talk in Whitesburg is the farmers market because there’s so much money rolling in from the health-care providers,” says Lucas.  Students at the Knott County Area Technology Center, a vocational high school in Hindman, Ky., work on construction projects for a class. Alfredo Sosa/Staff | Caption Right now, the students at Knott County are just trying to finish their tiny house. Chris Hall is in the shop room building cabinets. Mr. Hall plans to go to college after he graduates. His dad, a former coal miner, wants his son to do anything but work underground. Hall says he will come back on weekends to see family and friends. The yearning to return, even if temporarily, is common. T.J. Short, a burly redhead who’s heading to West Virginia to dig coal after graduation, says he, too, plans to come home on weekends. He doesn’t know how long he’ll have his job anyway.  “I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t scared, but I hope it works out there,” says Mr. Short of his mining venture. One day these students may not have to leave the area to begin with. That will depend on whether a new Appalachia can be created. Many of the students have already taken the first step: They’re pinning their future hopes on something other than coal.

CAPE BRETON ISLAND, Canada —The first sign of what Rob Calabrese would come to think of as America’s unmooring began last year, just after Donald Trump won his first presidential primary and Calabrese published a $28 website that he’d designed in 30 minutes. “Hi Americans!” it began, and what followed was a sales pitch for an island where Muslims could “roam freely,” and where the only walls were those “holding up the roofs” of “extremely affordable houses.” “Let’s get the word out!” Calabrese wrote, adding a photo of an empty coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. “Move to Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins!” It was meant as a joke — but seven hours after Calabrese linked the site to the Facebook page of the pop radio station where he works as a DJ, in came an email from America. “Not sure if this is real but I’ll bite.” And then another: “It pains me to think of leaving, but this country is beyond repair.” At a Cape Breton Screaming Eagles hockey game, Keanan MacKenzie, 6, left, and his brother, Cullen, 4, of New Waterford, Nova Scotia, remove their equipment in the dressing room during the first intermission. And then more. Within 24 hours, there were 80 messages. Within a week, there were 2,000, and many used the same words: “nervous” and “terrified” and “help.” “The United States is losing its mind,” one person wrote. “So ashamed of half of my country I could curl up and cry,” wrote another. The emails kept coming, so many that soon the island’s tourism association brought on four seasonal workers to help respond to the inquiries, which were arriving from every state and hundreds of towns, until it seemed to Calabrese that America was filled with people who wanted to get away. “Look at this one,” he said one day recently, scrolling through a spreadsheet where the inquiries were organized and stopping on No. 2,121. “I am a former U.S. Marine who did two tours to Iraq. And I want out of here.” “Beyond astonished,” Calabrese said, scrolling through more. There were emails from a molecular biologist, a University of Oregon professor, a granite construction worker, a contractor for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a woman who said her home town was “Unfortunately, Alabama.” There were declarations and confessions about incomes, sexual orientations, goals for their children. Several included résumés. “I am so sick of what has happened to my beautiful country,” one letter began. “I desperately want to move my daughters to the safety and sanity of Canada,” email No. 3,248 read. “It doesn’t even really matter if Donald Trump wins. He has exposed the awful attitude that plagues the US.” “This is no longer the America I have loved for all my life,” email No. 3,310 read. “I am a hardworking man and could contribute much to any country that gives me a chance.” It was somewhere around email 4,230 that Trump was elected president of the United States, and just before his inauguration came email No. 4,635. “Looking to immigrate to Cape Breton area from Colorado,” it began. “I am a skilled paralegal and my wife is an attorney.” Calabrese read it, wondered briefly about the people who sent it, and waited for the next one to come in. “What do people see on the horizon to be this afraid?” he said. *** Workers at Ka’Le Bay Seafoods in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, remove chunks of ice and snow from the front of the facility on Glace Bay Harbor. The email was written by Jimmy Gantenbein and Cathleen McEwen from their living room sofa in Loveland, a town 50 miles north of Denver. A month later, furniture from that living room had been stuffed into the garage. Paint buckets lined the hallway. They’d been in touch with a real estate agent. Soon they planned to have their home on the market. “Can you hand me a nail?” Cathleen, 61, asked as she fixed up the bedroom. “Here you go, Cat,” Jimmy, 54, said. They’d bought this home at the start of their marriage — the second for Jimmy, the third for Cathleen — and 17 years later they knew the place nearly as well as they knew each other. They had a view of the Rocky Mountains from the bedroom. Afternoon sunlight warmed the carpet where their old poodle liked to curl up. Two right turns and a left took them to the local Safeway. “We’re going to love it here,” Cathleen remembered saying on one of their first spring nights, after a neighbor’s 50th birthday party ended with outdoor cartwheels. They lived on a cul-de-sac with two other homes, and Cathleen spent a few years on the city council. They made friends with Democrats and Republicans. When Cathleen’s son, an Army reservist, returned from Iraq in 2005, 150 people showed up at the local veterans’ hall for barbecue and beer. Jimmy Gantenbein and Cathleen McEwen, shown with their dog, stand in front of their house in Loveland, Colo. (Kevin Moloney /For The Washington Post) Meaning it as a joke, DJ Rob Calabrese in February 2016 launched the website cbiftrumpwins.com and has since received nearly 5,000 emails. There was a short period when they rented out the home and moved to a more commercial part of the city, hoping to improve their business. But they returned as soon as they could, and even as they aged, and faced some health problems, and their business slowed, this place remained the closest thing to a constant in their lives. And then came the arrival into their settled world of Donald Trump. He was on TV so often that Jimmy and Cathleen created a no-Trump rule after 9 p.m. He was in their town, holding a rally 10 miles from their home that drew an overflow crowd. He was in their neighborhood, his name popping up on yard signs all around them. During primary season, it felt as if he’d arrived at their own front yard, when their neighbor saw them in the driveway, walked over, and said he was supporting Trump. We’re going with Bernie, Jimmy and Cathleen recalled saying, and though the conversation was brief and cordial, they hadn’t talked to their neighbor since. “We feel out of sync with everybody,” Cathleen was saying now. Just that morning, signing onto Facebook, there was a post written by her friend Pam, somebody she’d known for 13 years, telling Muslims to “grow a pair” and “defend the country they immigrated to and assimilate!” She thought for a few minutes about what to do and then punched out a response, telling Pam to “put the same mental energy” into researching the Muslim faith “that you put into your diatribe.” Then came the back-and-forth among other people, 19 comments, no minds changing. “People are in a frenzy to out-anger,” Cathleen said, and she read the comments aloud to Jimmy. She’d had 400 Facebook friends before Trump. Now she had 288. Knitters from across Cape Breton gather at McConnell Library in Sydney, Nova Scotia, for the annual all-day knit-a-thon that produces about 1,000 items for donation to community causes. “It’s just that Trump mentality,” Jimmy said. “We can’t have a conversation with anybody,” Cathleen said. “We try to engage, but it’s usually . . . ” “Disastrous,” Jimmy said. “Yeah,” Cathleen said. “I haven’t been very good at peacemaking lately. It’s making me a worse person. You know, if you can’t rise above it. But I can’t totally resist.” She went on: “I don’t know what to do constructively. It’s a crisis of purpose.” And so, they were thinking of leaving. It’s not that they had never thought of moving — they’d talked before about finding a cheaper place as they aged — but when Trump came along, that’s what pushed them. To where, though? Just move closer to your grandchildren, Cathleen’s son, an accountant in Tulsa, said. Just don’t leave the country, Cathleen’s daughter, a doctor in Toledo, remembered telling them. “Don’t give up so quickly. Now more than ever, good people need to fight for what matters.” But Jimmy and Cathleen didn’t see it as giving up. Instead, they felt America becoming so off-kilter, so “angry” and “bigoted” and “regressive,” that they thought maybe the moment required an absolute break. “I don’t recognize the country I was born in,” Cathleen said. “I was born into a narrow-minded, anti-intellectual country. It took me 61 years and one election to figure it out.” So now, they also had a “Relocation” folder on their computer filled with information about Panama and Belize and Costa Rica and Canada. They’d bookmarked the Cape Breton website and set up Web alerts for real estate listings on the island. They’d talked to an immigration lawyer in Canada. “I’m so glad they aren’t around to see this,” Jimmy said, in the living room now, where there were two folded funeral flags honoring their veteran fathers. “It just keeps getting worse,” said Cathleen, who keeps a framed copy of the Gettysburg Address on the basement office wall. So many decisions to make. Would they sell off their stuff? Would they give up their citizenship? Would they be able to repair damaged relationships with their children and grandchildren? And if they made it to Cape Breton, would they feel regret? They knew it was cold. They knew homes were cheap. But they’d never been there. “It’s risky to stay and risky to go,” Cathleen said, and now they were back in the bedroom, hammering in new baseboards and fastening new light switch covers. “Maybe,” she said, “the pragmatist wins out.” “Maybe,” he said, “we rent for a while and figure things out.” Cathleen put down the screwdriver and sat on the carpet. “We don’t have a clue,” she said. “We’re in a quandary,” he said. Their dog was sleeping. Soon, their real estate agent would be calling. Homes sold fast in Loveland. Eight weeks and there’d be a “for sale” out front. So, maybe Cape Breton. *** A fishing shed in Little River Wharf is covered with tuna fins as it sits unused during the winter season on Cape Breton Island. The shed is located near the Cabot Trail, one of Cape Breton’s most scenic roadways.

Winter viewings, the listing said, “require snowshoes.” “It’s a beautiful home if you’re looking to escape,” said Sampson, climbing into her SUV and steering through an island that people don’t come to anymore but instead have been choosing to leave. Once rich in coal, mining had dried up and no industry yet had replaced it. Every year, another 1,000 people were either dying or taking off for larger cities such as Toronto or Halifax. Budgets were shrinking. Ten schools had closed in the last year. The island’s unemployment rate was 15.5 percent. The population was down to 130,000, and that left Cape Breton with hundreds of abandoned homes awaiting demolition and several hundred more for sale. Navigating streets narrowed by high snow, Sampson turned into a neighborhood of simple vinyl-sided homes near the shuttered coal mines. “This one has been on for months,” she said. A few minutes later: “$149,000 for this one. We haven’t had one viewing.” Sampson knows that summers here feel different. The tourists arrive. The lobster and pizza restaurants reopen. The lakes fill with sailboats. “The geography is second to none,” she said. “A one-hour drive in any direction will take you to the beach.” Olivia Roach, 5, left, whispers a secret to her friend Jaielyne Burns, 5, as they watch the cows eat hay on a dairy farm in Grand Étang. Olivia lives on the farm, and Jaielyne is visiting for a sleepover. But for four or five months of the year, this is a place with short days, frigid temperatures and icy sidewalks, where people play backyard hockey or gather in little bars and doughnut shops. As Sampson returned to the office, the only activity in Sydney, the island’s largest town, seemed to be a meeting of community leaders who were talking about how to save the island. “We don’t get people, we’re going to die,” Rankin MacSween, head of a community development group, was saying. “These are huge losses against an already small population,” a lawyer said. “It doesn’t take much math to realize how much time is left.” People passed around a five-page research paper that said the island needed to attract 2,000 people annually to remain viable. There’d been decades of failed attempts to rebuild. The island had one new thing going for it — the website. More people knew about Cape Breton now. “We’re receiving thousands of emails,” one person said at the meeting. But that wasn’t the same as thousands of people moving there. Canada had strict immigration laws. People couldn’t just come because they wanted to. Applicants were scored based on age and skills and their ability to help the economy. Anybody who emailed Cape Breton was told they still had to apply through Canada’s immigration agency. They were sent a link to begin a process that could take more than a year. So maybe some Americans would arrive someday, but they hadn’t yet. As the responses rolled in, Calabrese had revised the site’s text to make it less political — and less directed at Americans specifically. “The truth is,” Calabrese had written, “we welcome all, no matter the ideology. Join us!” “We need to be thinking about this,” the lawyer said as the meeting was winding down. “What kind of person would come here?” *** Ahmad Hamadi, center, twirls his two youngest sons Odai, 3, left, and Kosai, 6, in a bedroom as Mohamad, 10, left, and Obai, 9, watch. The Hamadis are Syrian refugees who received help from a church to settle in Cape Breton. One answer to that question could be found just past the meeting hall, in a house that had been stripped of wire and abandoned for a year and now had a family of seven inside, all of them from Syria. School had just ended. The television was on. The kids were squeezed on a couch. “What are you drawing?” the father, Ahmad Hamadi, 35, asked one of his sons, Mohamad, who is 10. “It’s a Pokemon,” Mohamad said. He held up the drawing for a father who eight months after arriving was still sorting through what it meant to have left a country he loved. “It looks good,” said Ahmad, and then he turned back to the television. These were the people moving to Cape Breton: refugees from the Syrian war who not only left their country but had to flee it. Fifty-four had come so far, and Ahmad and his family were among the most recent. After escaping Syria and spending several years in Lebanon, they had ended up here because of the sponsorship of a church group waiting for them on an island they’d never heard of. They’d been traveling for 48 hours: Beirut to Cairo to Toronto to Cape Breton. They landed at 1:30 a.m. They were shuttled into a van, and when the sun came up Ahmad found himself in a house stocked with food and furniture and toys, all of it his and none of it familiar. Compared with where he had come from, it was quiet outside. The electricity worked. The children went to school. Ahmad pinned a small Canadian flag to the front door, and every day he walked out was another chance to adapt to a new place. Cape Breton features a Celtic music style that is central to residents’ identities. The West Mabou Family Square Dance is held on Saturday nights year-round at the West Mabou Hall. He applied for positions at Value Village and a building supply company, where an interpreter helped him with the interviews, but he didn’t land either. He asked about an entry spot at a Lebanese restaurant, but the owner didn’t want somebody without experience. Months passed with nothing. He got a driver’s license. He lifted weights at the YMCA to burn stress. He thought about applying for a late shift at McDonald’s, but one of the leaders from the church committee that sponsored him said he should instead ramp up his English and become more employable. So twice-a-week government-funded English classes became four-a-week, and for Ahmad the sessions became his best excuse to leave the house: a two-mile drive across town to a community center classroom, where the names of Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories were written on the chalkboard. “How are you?” the teacher, Susan Burchell, asked as Ahmad walked in. “Bored,” he said. “Bored?” she asked. She addressed the grammar instead of the sentiment. “It’s good you didn’t say boring,” she said, and when he didn’t say anything, she asked, “What do you want to do today?” “Nothing,” he said, shrugging. “Learning?” “What did you do last week? Talk to me about it.” “Shopping,” he said. “I went to Walmart. We went to Tim Hortons. And we went to my friend.” “Do I know this friend?” “An old man. From Lebanon.” “Anything else?” He shrugged again. Before the war, in a town outside of Damascus, Ahmad had owned a small department store. He’d lived on the same street with his parents and three siblings. He met friends for late-night shawarma and chicken at restaurants. He had fled four years ago, and now his family was scattered across three continents. Among his five closest friends, he figured four were dead. The restaurants were just as likely rubble, something he thought of when he opened up Facebook and saw videos of charred and ruined street blocks. Had he known those places? Could he recognize them now? He’d built a home for his family in 2010, ceramic tiles in the kitchen and the apricot trees out front. Was that home, too, part of the rubble? He’d heard it might be. “One day I had a car, a house, a business, a life,” Ahmad said. “The second day I lost it all.” Ahmad had the best fortune of almost anybody he knew, and yet because of the changed fortunes of a country he loved, he was here, looking out at a yard with five-foot snowdrifts and a horizon with an early-setting Canadian sun. He sat down on a chair and rubbed his aching back. “Can you grab me some Advil?” he asked his daughter, Aya. She reached into a cabinet and handed him a pill. Ahmad’s hair was greasy, and stubble covered his neck and face. “A fish out of water, they die,” he said as his wife prepared lunch in the kitchen. The smell of hot oil filled the air. Ahmad swallowed the pill, drank some tea, and waited for the ache to go away. *** A man is seen walking on the beach through the window of a shed in Ingonish near the Cabot Trail, a scenic roadway on Cape Breton Island. “Cat, did you see that!” Cathleen and Jimmy were driving back at dusk from a window-screen repair shop when a big white owl soared in front of their car, and soon they were at home talking about the owl that used to live in their front yard, the elk that would roam out back, and how this has always been their favorite time of year. Every spring on the cul-de-sac, they’d crack the windows open, hear birds in the spruce tree, see the crocuses and gray hyacinths sprout from the fresh mulch in front of their house. Sundown came later. They’d barbecue. They’d see the neighbors more. And sometimes, they’d take off for road trips in their SUV: heading east across the plains and into the Ozarks, or maybe west, over the mountains and past the Continental Divide, finding lakes for fishing and stopping at fruit stands and sleeping in whatever motel they could find. “So long as it wasn’t flea-ridden,” Jimmy said. “We didn’t have any plan,” Cathleen said. “We’d just kind of wing it.” “Remember the Black Canyons?” Jimmy said. “Remember those cliffs?” Cathleen said. “The Million Dollar Highway?” Jimmy said. There was a knock on the door. Their home inspector. In two weeks, the house would be on the market, and as soon as it sold they’d be on their way — first to visit their children and, after that, they’d have to see. Maybe a drive through America would remind them of things they were forgetting. Stefan MacNeil, 29, of Castle Bay, Nova Scotia, smokes a cigarette at a house party in Dominion. With him is Jonathan Kanary, 30, of Glace Bay. The inspector shook their hands and walked in. He carried a measuring tape, a notebook, and tools in a zippered pouch. He checked on the things that would be used by whoever lived there next — the furnace, the hot water heater, the electrical boxes — and moved through the rooms that now looked as though nobody had lived there before. No more family photos. No more artwork. Almost two decades of things boxed away. “So,” he asked, “where are you guys moving to?” There’d been a run of 60-degree days in Loveland, and meanwhile in Cape Breton, the temperatures were near freezing, forecasters were saying another eight to 11 inches of snow were on the way, and the emails were still arriving, a couple every day. “I can no longer live here, nor sleep with this evil man as our leader,” one person wrote. “History repeats itself and I can feel a repeat of the Third Reich,” another wrote. “I am heartbroken seeing our America be torn apart . . . by one, out-of-touch billionaire,” another wrote. “Please help me,” another wrote. Calabrese read every word, and as he waited for the snow to arrive, and the Americans to arrive, and email No. 4780 to arrive, he thought about how fortunate he was to live in a place where he wants to be. classic-apps Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

It is a politically fraught and dizzyingly complex endeavor that pits powerful interests against one another and threatens to increase the federal deficit. “Trump has to win on this,” said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation who advised Mr. Trump on tax policy during his campaign and transition. “There’s no margin for error here, and failure is just not an option.” Just how difficult will it be? Here are five obstacles to getting a new tax law: A leadership vacuum The greatest hurdle to a tax overhaul may be the White House itself. Mr. Trump has yet to make basic decisions about the structure and scope of his plan, the strategy for pushing it through Congress or even who in his administration will be in charge of crafting and selling it. While White House officials said they would unveil a plan weeks ago, one has not materialized. “Obviously, we’re driving the train on this,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday as he deflected basic questions about what the president’s proposal would look like. That is hardly obvious to many members of Congress, administration insiders and outside observers who now question whether Mr. Trump and his close advisers are capable of executing on such an ambitious and high-stakes negotiation. Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will most likely play a major role in devising a tax package. He said last week that the administration would soon release a plan. He also predicted that the tax effort would be easier than health care, a notion that many longtime congressional aides consider laughable. With many central jobs still unfilled at the Treasury Department, Mr. Mnuchin does not yet have the number-crunching and policy-analyzing firepower he needs to lead a major tax overhaul effort. Then there is Gary Cohn, the director of Mr. Trump’s National Economic Council, who has told people that he is leading the president’s tax overhaul effort. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has expressed interest in using revenue raised by a special tax on American companies’ offshore earnings to finance a major infrastructure rebuilding effort, an approach that could have some appeal among Democrats eager to see new spending on roads and bridges. Deficits and debt Many Republicans in Congress — up until recently including Mr. Trump’s own budget director, Mick Mulvaney — are deficit hawks. Their deeply held conviction is that any tax overhaul should not add to the national debt. The president, who as a businessman proudly called himself the “king of debt,” has accepted no such constraints. During his presidential campaign, he proposed a tax cut plan that would add an estimated $7.2 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over a decade. Yet House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, are among those who have held firm to the idea of a tax overhaul that does not increase the debt. “I’m optimistic that Republicans still very much care about balancing the federal budget,” Mr. Brady said. “And in truth, this doesn’t have to be a choice.” But choices will have to be made. The border tax showdown One choice dividing Republicans is whether to include a large import tax, also known as a “border adjustment tax” in the package. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady have been aggressively pushing the inclusion of a 20 percent tax on imports that they think would raise as much as $1 trillion to offset cuts in individual and business tax rates. Such a proposal appeals to Mr. Trump’s instinct for toughness at the border, promoting American-made products and igniting the creation of new manufacturing jobs. While he has sent mixed signals about whether he supports including it in a tax overhaul, the president told The New York Times this month that he did. “I’m the king of that,” he said. But the proposal has already created a sharp split within the business community. Retail giants like Walmart are bitterly opposed and willing to wage a costly advertising war against a plan they argue will increase the price of their products and end up raising prices for American consumers. Industrial companies that are heavily dependent on exports support the idea. The winners-and-losers effect It is a cliché in Washington to say that tax reform creates winners and losers. But it is true, and that is one of the most formidable obstacles that has frustrated previous efforts at enacting broad changes to the tax code. The tax code is riddled with special-interest provisions and deductions enacted over many decades. Reorienting is bound to give advantages to certain groups and impose disadvantages on others. Popular tax breaks for individuals such as deductions for mortgage interest, charitable giving, and state and local taxes account for huge amounts of revenue. They would probably have to be curbed or eliminated in order to compensate for bringing down tax rates. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Brady have proposed doing so. The real estate industry, charitable groups, municipal bond traders, and state and local governments are just a few of the constituencies that are likely to revolt at the first hint of such changes. And they could be expected to spend freely to defeat them. Rules, rules, rules The arcane procedural rules of Congress — the same ones that contributed to the demise of the health care repeal bill — will complicate the process of pushing through a tax overhaul. The White House and congressional Republicans would need to decide whether to use a process known as budget reconciliation to speed changes through Congress on a simple majority vote or allow the legislation to proceed under normal rules. Go with the normal rules and they would need 60 votes in the Senate — including some Democratic support — to pass it. Because of the strictures of the reconciliation process, the plan would not be allowed to add to deficits outside of a 10-year budget window. That is why President George W. Bush had to include a sunset provision in his tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. But businesses that crave long-term certainty are not likely to favor such an impermanent approach. And on Monday, Mr. Brady said he had no intention of producing such a plan. “If we’re serious about leapfrogging America back to the lead of the pack, if we’re serious about creating jobs and jump-starting this economy, a 10-year bill will not accomplish either of those,” Mr. Brady said. “The most pro-growth tax reform is a permanent tax reform.” That is a lot that could go wrong. Notice we have not even mentioned Democratic opposition.

Significant layoffs are expected to begin Tuesday at the company’s Maumee and Toledo stores, and more cuts will occur after Easter, according to employees. The Monclova Township agribusiness announced in January it would shut down its two local and two Columbus-area stores this spring, ending jobs for 1,050 employees. IN PICTURES: Local shoppers react to the closing of The Andersons For area consumers, The Blade found last week in interviews with handfuls of shoppers, there will be no replacement for the “Store Like No Other,” as The Andersons liked to call the retail shops. VIDEO: Blade Briefing on The Andersons If, as an old saying goes, you don’t know what you have until it’s gone, then the value of The Andersons to the Toledo area community may not be understood for some time. The company told the state its stores would be closed by June 9, although the sell-off of merchandise could bring the closings sooner. A sign thanking shoppers is on display outside The Andersons general store in West Toledo. The company will soon close its retail stores, affecting 1,050 workers. The Andersons opened its first store in 1952. THE BLADE/KATIE RAUSCH Enlarge | Buy This Image “The psychological impact of The Andersons closing will be significant on the Toledo area. It’s an iconic brand, very much in line with Tony Packo’s or perhaps the Frisch’s Big Boy chain,” said Mark Luetke, a consultant at Thread Marketing Group of Toledo.  “Losing a brand like that is like losing a friend for the people in the community.” Toledo firefighter paramedic Jamie Ferguson said last week that seeing half-bare shelves in the stores as merchandise is not restocked is like watching a loved one die slowly from a disease. “That’s the best way I’ve heard it described. ... It’s just sad,” said Mr. Ferguson, who lives in Berkey, but stopped at the Talmadge Road store last week after a fire run to purchase a few items. Toledoan Bo Brown, who regularly bought fresh fruit at The Andersons, said upon exiting the Talmadge Road store with groceries, “I think this is the last store that you could come in and find a little of everything and it’s not expensive and you could trust the product. ... Walking in there made me kind of sad knowing it’s not going to be here anymore.” Karen Timbrook, who will retire Monday from the company’s retail division after working 27 years as a price comparison shopper, said just setting foot inside the Maumee store is heartbreaking. “I was out here last week and walked through and it was the first time I saw how empty the shelves were. I walked around crying my eyes out,” Ms. Timbrook said. Mike Hart, president of Toledo marketing firm Hart Inc., said he knows why some are taking the closing personally. “I think it is because The Andersons is more than a retail store. It’s a gathering place,” he said. To him, the stores are a place he can comfortably walk down an aisle, be greeted by employees, and feel no pressure to buy. “It’s like Norm and (the former TV show) Cheers, the place where everybody knows your name,” Mr. Hart said. “People like to go where they’re comfortable and there’s a certain feel when you go to a comfortable establishment. ... You go to The Andersons and you see your friends every weekend, and that will be tough losing that.” Bo Brown of Toledo says, ‘I think this is the last store that you could come in and find a little of everything and it’s not expensive and you could trust the product.’ THE BLADE/KATIE RAUSCH Enlarge | Buy This Image Longtime customer Mark Barton of Toledo agrees that The Andersons has a “hometown feeling” that he is going to miss. “You walk in and it feels like a good friend,” he said. “It’s not like some huge out-of-the-city company that comes in.” Shopping experiences aside, Mr. Luetke said, there are less tangible community benefits lost when The Andersons stores close. The company encouraged employees to be active in community organizations.  “But because their whole retail division is being eliminated, I assume there will be fewer people to fill in those board seats and that’s going to be missed,” Mr. Luetke said. As a retail anchor, customers had to drive past smaller retailers to get to The Andersons, so the economic benefit smaller retailers received likely will be lessened. “There is probably not one other local brand that has touched people in the area in so many ways,” Mr. Luetke said. The company has been a major retailer, a major employer, and a major charitable contributor. “All of these touch points are really going to be missed,” he said, although Andersons officials have said they plan to continue their charitable efforts. What set The Andersons apart from other retailers was versatility, said Mark Gleim, a University of Toledo assistant professor of marketing. “To me The Andersons is good at everything but not great at anything,” he said. “I think people are going to miss going to The Andersons and if you needed lumber, you could get it, or bread or grill or wine. You could go to The Andersons and get all of that.” Annie Holey of Toledo agreed that the stores “have everything in one spot” a shopper could want. “And it’s different than your Walmart or your Target or things like that,” she said while shopping at the Talmadge Road store last week with her mother, Dawn Badhorn, and her 5-year-old nephew, Gavin Zacharias. Ms. Badhorn said her husband, Ken, would browse every aisle in the hardware department. “And my dad used to call this the $100 store — because he couldn’t get out of here without spending $100,” she said. Professor Gleim said customers who took the versatility for granted may be especially disappointed.  “The void [The Andersons] filled is it offered everything under one roof. Now people are going to have to go to Home Depot and Kroger. They’re going to have to make multiple stops,” Mr. Gleim said. Some customers already are starting to recognize that they will need to change their shopping patterns. Toledoan Gloria Bunker has shopped mainly at The Andersons for 44 years for its convenience and proximity to her home. “Now, I guess it’ll have to be Kroger’s,” she said with a sigh. Two customers told The Blade they used The Andersons in remodeling their kitchens, and experts said the expertise that stores employees imparted to customers will be missed. “Their people were very knowledgeable. We felt very comfortable sending our customer to them,” said Jason Arnold, owner of Arnold’s Home Improvement. Mr. Arnold said do-it-yourselfers will miss The Andersons stores.  “They didn’t mind helping you with the small things, matching paint colors and such,” he said. Kelly Heidbreder, The Blade’s gardening columnist, said she relied frequently on gardening expertise she received from The Andersons. “I went to them often because I feel, as a family business, they really cared about their customers and that got down to the quality of the plants they would sell,” she said. Debbie Cramer, of Sylvania Township, said she trusted The Andersons to provide landscaping for both her home and a family cottage in Indiana. She also had them remodel her kitchen, and even adopted a dog at a pet rescue event The Andersons sponsored. “I buy everything here,” she said while shopping at the Maumee store last week with her daughter, Ashley Potts. “From plywood to nursery stock to gourmet food. And really everything in between. I just bought my last Christmas tree here.” Meanwhile, The Andersons employees are being sought. At job fairs last month, Meijer, Kroger, Sofo Foods, and other competitors came to recruit workers, and some employees said dozens of co-workers secured replacement jobs to begin after their current ones end.

He urged Cummins to turn himself in. Cummins and Thomas were reported missing on March 13. The last confirmed sighting of the pair was two days later at an Oklahoma City Walmart. Police have issued an Amber alert for Thomas and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. A tree was planted in honor of Thomas in a Tennessee park Wednesday as part of national crime victim’s rights week.

But businesses are deeply split over whether to support the "centerpiece of the Republican tax overhaul effort," said Nicholas Confessore and Alan Rappeport at The New York Times. House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed a "border adjustment tax" that would put a 20 percent tax on imports coming into the U.S. "In theory, this would buttress domestic manufacturing and make American products more competitive with foreign goods." The revenues generated by the tax — as much as $1 trillion over the next decade — would also make possible the Republican dream of lowering the corporate tax rate without adding to the federal budget deficit. Major U.S. manufacturers like Boeing and Caterpillar are behind the idea. But retailers like Target and Ikea, as well as other companies that import most of their goods, are lobbying furiously against it. So are several deep-pocketed conservative groups, including the political network backed by billionaire businessmen Charles and David Koch, who see it as anti–free trade. "Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would have a chilling effect on job creation and the budgets of working families," said Judson Phillips at the Washington Examiner. Not only would it drive up costs for small retailers and manufacturers that rely on imports but also "the cost of big-ticket items like cars, electronics, and appliances would all rise." The National Retail Federation estimates that the average American family will pay $1,700 more per year in higher prices on goods. It's also never smart to anger retailers, said Dylan Matthews and Matthew Yglesias at Vox. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, whose state is home to Walmart headquarters, is a "vocal opponent" of the border tax and gearing up for a fight. Consider also that manufacturers typically have to entice only executives to buy their products, while retailers "are extremely good at selling stuff" directly to the public. "Which do you think is going to be better equipped to persuade voters to call their senators and representatives about the border-adjusted tax?" "Just saying 'no' to the border adjustment tax will not work," said Derek Scissors at The Hill. Everyone agrees that our corporate tax code needs "profound change." A border tax would allow us to meaningfully lower the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent without blowing up the deficit, and encourage companies "to locate and hire in the U.S." It also puts the U.S. on more even footing with countries that impose value-added taxes on American goods. So opponents "need to do more than object; they should offer a replacement." We can debate the border tax all we like, but it's dead on arrival, said Peter Coy at Bloomberg. The opposition to it is just too powerful and united. And without the added revenue, Republicans are going to have to settle for much smaller tax cuts. So instead of the 15 percent corporate tax rate President Trump has promised, companies might face something more like 28 percent — "the same corporate rate that President Obama sought." Trump desperately wants a major legislative win after the health-care debacle. But it looks as if whatever he manages to get done on taxes "is likely to be small-bore."

Allen Leave a Comment Migrant dairy worker feeds cows. Photo by Terry J. Allen/VTDigger Editor’s note: A shorter version of this story was published in The Guardian: “My undocumented friend: Carlos does the work few in Vermont want to do.” Silhouetted by summer sun, Carlos stood at the front door of my house. “Hey, come on in,” I told him. “No,” he said pointing to his work boots, heavy with mud and manure. “But can you help me?” Carlos was one of the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 undocumented, mostly Mexican migrants employed on Vermont dairy farms. The actual number, like most of the workers who entered the country illegally, is hidden. Carlos (not his real name) had come to Vermont after a year working construction in Texas where he could blend into the large Latino diaspora and its familiar culture. Vermont is an alien world, with dark winters and light people. When dairy workers venture off their isolated farms, they stand out. In a blend of Yankee pragmatism and ordinary decency, many Vermonters, including police and officials, quietly welcome — and often protect migrant workers. I met Carlos several years back when, as part of an informal volunteer network, I’d occasionally ferry migrants to medical appointments or to supermarkets, where they buy the kind of calorie-rich processed food that horrifies kale-munching locals. I helped filled out forms enabling them to wire money to family in Mexico, lending my name and return address, and wondering what the IRS would make of my sending thousands of dollars to small towns in Tabasco and Chiapas. After Vermont approved a special driver’s license not requiring legal status, I taught a few guys to drive so they could shop for themselves, get a maple creemee at a roadside stand, and visit relatives and friends on other farms. Several migrants had given me snippets of their tales — always without embellishment, self-pity, or drama. But it was years before Carlos — bright and charming, but guarded — opened up. Perhaps fording the flooded Rio Grande and hiking five days through the Texas desert — helicopters thumping the sky; hunger, thirst, and border patrols stalking the ground below — seemed so common as to be unremarkable, or too painful to recall. Though Carlos has learned useful and colorfully idiomatic English, he speaks hesitantly, especially with strangers, and misunderstandings are possible. The favor he came to ask that sun-painted day was that I go with him for a “check-up.” “Well,” he hesitated, “to get tested for STI” (sexually transmitted infections). “Are you sick? Do you need to go immediately?” I asked. “No, I’m fine. I just want to get tested. Soon.” The community clinic I phoned required two appointments, one for paperwork and another for testing. Two days interrupted, during haying season. To save time, Carlos suggested going to a “doc in a box” in a strip mall. At the generic office, which looked like it could be selling insurance, which Carlos could never buy, I asked the cost. “$100 for the visit.” As he started taking bills from his wallet, I motioned him to stop. “And for the lab tests?” The young woman rummaged behind the counter. “$500, so $600 total,” she said. “You’re kidding,” I nearly shouted. “For standard lab tests?” “No way,” I told Carlos, who was probably deeply embarrassed by me. It wasn’t that he couldn’t afford it, but I knew how he sweated for that much money. I phoned the health clinic to compare costs, and the scheduler asked why didn’t I go to Planned Parenthood. It had never occurred to me that the organization served men. Except for a locked front door, security at the controversial nonprofit was unobtrusive. Joining three pregnant women in the waiting room, Carlos and I made quite the intriguing couple: an aging white woman and a handsome young Latino. When we came to the part of the form on income, Carlos asked me what to do. I said he could report whatever amount he wanted. No, he corrected, do they want hourly, weekly, or what? He knew what I had meant, but had no inclination to cheat. He wrote $30,000 a year. The receptionist quickly scanned his paperwork. “We have a sliding scale,” and with obvious pleasure, told Carlos, “You just qualify for free services.” Vermont, she said is the only state fully covered by the Access Plan which includes birth control, annual exams, STI testing and treatment, patient education and counseling for both men and women who are uninsured and earn less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level. It is a practical policy, given the long-term economic and public health benefits of diagnosing, treating, and preventing the spread of communicable diseases that can lead to AIDS, cancer, sterility, and more. How else are males served? By way of reply, the receptionist reached under the counter. “We distribute these,” she said, handing me a football-sized clear plastic bag filled with condoms, individually wrapped in colorful foil decorated with hearts and flags, kissy lips, and stars. When Carlos returned from the exam room, he was assured, although a few tests were pending, that he was clean. I tossed him the bag, and we all laughed. As we left, I spied him slipping a donation, three $20 bills, onto the counter. In the car home, curiosity overcame discretion. I probed. He hesitated. And then his face lit with pleasure. “I have a girlfriend, and she said, ‘No sex until we are both tested.’” “Now, that is a great girlfriend,” I said. Smiling, we rode back under a cloudless sky to his farm, where the ripe fields glittered green and the cows, udders swollen, jostled in line for afternoon milking.

Allen/VTDigger Latino migrants fill a gap The presence of foreign-born migrant workers like Carlos is just the latest transformation of Vermont agriculture. A century ago, the state was 70 percent cleared agricultural land, 30 percent forest. Today, the ratio is approximately reversed. Older Vermonters still remember when, in the 1940s, some 11,000 small, family farms the dotted the land. Kids hand-milked fawn-brown, doe-eyed Jerseys before breakfast and then hitched rides to one-room schoolhouses on the beat-up trucks or horse-drawn wagons that hauled metal jugs of milk — topped with unctuous, yellow cream — to central collecting stations. The number of farms continues to decline — from 1,030 to 825 just in the last decade. Strained by the high costs farming, taxes, and land prices, many have been drawn over, like an artist’s repurposed canvas, by malls, ski resorts, and summer homes. The last time Vermont had more cows than people Eisenhower was president; today there are 625,000 people and only 129,000 cows. Nonetheless, milk production is up. On many farms, Jerseys have been replaced by black and white Holsteins, a large, ungainly breed that can churn out massive quantities of milk — 20,000-plus pounds a year — before their productivity wanes and they are ground into hamburger, pet food, or buried in the fields they once fertilized and grazed. Along with the switch to Holsteins, federal and state tax abatements and subsidy programs, the increased cache and cash for the Vermont-branded and organic products, larger scale production, mechanization, and a new generation of back-to-the-land growers have allowed some farmers to survive, and a few to thrive. What keeps the owners awake at night — besides the vagaries of weather and fluctuating milk prices that sometimes fall below costs — is finding and keeping cheap labor. Most have tried locals, and some have turned to former prisoners. But few stick it out. It is little wonder that Americans with other options do not last. With two milkings a day, 12 hours apart, farms must be staffed 14 to 16 hours a day. Cows don’t get Christmas off, and neither do dairy workers. Latino migrants are filling a gap and saving America’s farms. Nationwide, immigrants, many undocumented, comprise 51 per cent of the nation’s dairy industry, according to a 2015 study by Texas A&M University for the National Milk Producers Federation. If these workers were deported, the report concludes, milk prices would rise 90 per cent, and cost the U.S. economy more than $32 billion. Without “our guests,” as then Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin called migrant farm workers, much of the state’s milk industry would likely dry up. Say goodbye to affordable Cabot cheddar; kiss Vermont-sourced Cherry Garcia sweet adios. And farewell to much of the $2.2 billion in annual economic activity dairy brings Vermont — the only state in which more than half of farm income comes from a single commodity. But beyond its economic contribution, dairy farming defines Vermont’s landscape, culture and allure. It shapes the landscape and life here, it lures tourists and helps retain residents through seven leafless months. Farms keep the pastures open — golden and green in summer, glistening white like polished steel in winter. River valleys and soft hillsides speckled with black and white cows embody Vermont’s old-fashioned beauty: its working landscape. Vermont dairy farm fields. Photo by Terry J. Allen/VTDigger The lure of Vermont Carlos just wanted a job. “It’s hard, hard work,” he says. “But you came to America to make money and go back quick. So you come to Vermont.” At his previous job, construction for a large company in a mid-sized Texas city, the hourly wages were comparable to dairy, but the potential earnings and the cost of living were not. The Vermont jobs include housing with heat and other utilities, isolation that brings fewer spending temptations, and an opportunity to work up to 90 hours a week. Although he expected the long, difficult hours, Carlos never anticipated winter’s malice. “I still remember asking my brother, who came a few months before I did, ‘How is Vermont?’ and he said, ‘Don’t come here. It’s horrible.’ He came in winter,” Carlos adds, grinning, “But I came anyway, in a van with my cousin and some others. I saw snow for the first time. I was, ‘What is this?’ he chuckles. ‘What am I doing here?’” At this first farm, “they taught me to milk cows,” and now he lets out a loud laugh at the absurdity, “in one afternoon.” “The next day Auntie Linda arrived. She speaks Spanish, and all the patrons know her. They all call her and say ‘We need one guy, two guys.’ She was a grumpy old woman, a big curser. We laughed at her swearing, but we didn’t care. I’d like to talk to her today and thank her. She gave me a pair of boots. They went through the whole winter.” Brokers like Auntie Linda, the “coyotes” who smuggle migrants across the border, the people who run safe houses, the van drivers who make regular interstate and cross-country runs, and the farmers are part of a complex, underground system powered by cell phones and money. Sex traffickers are a small part of that network. Most of the dairy workers are young men stuck on rural farms with no transportation. Enter the pimps who, exploiting the loneliness and isolation of the workers, drive women to remote farms. A prostitution ring in Vermont came to light in 2011, when police arrested two men who brought women to have sex with workers for $60 a trick. “They just bring girls, Mexicans and Colombians, mostly Latinas, but sometimes [women] from here, too,” Carlos explains reluctantly. “They just show up. It could be months between visits, or could be the next weekend. You never know. They never came to our farm, and I know one thing, I’m not paying for that,” adding with embarrassment and exasperation, “Jesus, why are you asking me about this?” A few times a year, officials from the Mexican consulate in Boston travel to areas with unauthorized Mexican citizens and, after careful screening, provide legal identification papers. The document allows migrants to buy a plane ticket to return to home, to prevent their being mistaken for criminals if picked up by authorities; and, in Vermont and 11 other states plus DC, to obtain a restricted “driving privilege” license. A group of Vermont volunteers helps facilitate the consulate event, organizing car pools and providing medical and legal resources and a communal meal. While the Mexican IDs are useful, they do nothing to change U.S. legal status. And impediments to obtaining lawful visas are nearly insurmountable. Most non-professional immigrants who qualify for a green card (permanent residency) gain it through a family relationship to a U.S. citizen. Temporary H-2A agricultural visas last for months and are only for strictly seasonal jobs like planting and picking crops. So with no legal options, and the workers’ importance to the economy, most of Vermont turns a blind eye, even a welcoming hand. That extends to “sanctuary” towns and a Fair and Impartial Policing policy, which enjoins police from profiling and targeting “illegals” or checking status when not specifically relevant. It’s “human rights 101,” Montpelier Police Chief Anthony Facos told the local Times Argus newspaper. In 2015, a Grand Isle sheriff arrested Miguel Alcudia, a Mexican national, whose only crime was illegal entry, and turned him over to Customs and Border Patrol. Activists, including other unauthorized farm workers applied political pressure. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders, and Rep. Peter Welch and Gov. Peter Shumlin supported Alcudia’s case. A few months later, Alcudia was freed, and the sheriff’s department was fined nearly $30,000 for discrimination. No similar outcome is likely for Enrique Balcazar, Zully Palacios and Alex Carrillo. Recently Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents targeted and detained the three prominent activists with Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based group advocating for dairy workers’ rights. The detentions were denounced in public demonstrations and a sharp letter from the state’s congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Phil Scott. Enrique Balcazar, 24, from Mexico, and Zully Palacios, 23, from Peru, are both well-known advocates for human rights in the state of Vermont. Courtesy photo Support for the migrants is not universal among Vermonters. Some workers at the Department of Motor Vehicles contacted authorities to drop the dime on people with “South of the Border” names who applied for the special driver’s licenses, according to emails obtained through a public records request by Migrant Justice, a local farmworker advocacy group. One email gloated: “I’ve emailed the docs to Border Patrol and they will research further and get back to me. They sound pretty excited. I let them know [applicant] has re-scheduled for this Friday. I will also contact [DMV employee] and let him know what is going on, should he have to play stupid.” Another email warned, “We are being over run by immigrants.” Targeted detentions and the Trump administration’s threat to deport migrants have sent waves of worry through farmers and workers alike. “Are you afraid of immigration authorities?” I asked Carlos on the trip back from Planned Parenthood. “I used to think about it every day,” he said, “but now it doesn’t matter if they send me back, because that’s where I belong. I always tell my parents, I’m coming back this December, and they get a piglet to raise for a big party. And then I stay yet another year.” It is not only money, and perhaps a girlfriend, that link Carlos to Vermont, but also the farm itself. Self-reliant and smart, Carlos has made himself valuable by learning to handle the farm’s large stock of trucks, manure spreaders, balers, tedders and other machinery. “I work sometimes 70, often 80 hours a week, sometimes 90. “Never, never 60 hours a week,” Carlos notes with pride. Farm labor is specifically excluded from U.S. overtime pay regulations. Although his wages rose to $11.30 an hour plus a $150 monthly bonus when milk quality tests high, Carlos clears only about $9 hour. The difference is taxes. When they arrive at a farm, the migrants provide Social Security numbers. “They are all fake,” says Carlos, matter-of-factly. “Somebody just gives you one.” To stay legal, farmers withhold and file taxes — the benefits of which the worker can never collect in social security or unemployment benefits. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump called CNN’s Erin Burnett “naïve” for suggesting “illegal immigrants” pay taxes. But nationally, they contribute an estimated $11.64 billion a year in just state and local taxes, with at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households filing tax returns, according to the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Vermont’s undocumented pay almost $4 million a year in state and local taxes. Migrant dairy workers at a rally for fair pay. Photo by Terry J. Allen/VTDigger One of the few advantages of lacking an agricultural visa, which is tied to a specific employer, is that unauthorized farm workers can switch farms, relying on a grapevine to avoid abusive bosses. Carlos says that his patron, a tough taskmaster and a hard worker himself, “was always fair.” Their relationship, however, started badly. “When I got here, I didn’t know English and it was rough for me, and for him, I think. He would try to tell us what to do [in English] and he would get mad if something was not done how he wanted. It was always our fault. I couldn’t explain myself. I think that’s what got me to learn English.” Over time, the two men grew fond of each other. “Now I know a little English and I can tell him what’s wrong. And he always jokes that, ‘I don’t know if I liked you better when you didn’t know any English.’ So like, yup, this is what it is. And he always pays us on time.” That is not the case on all farms. Because of their status, undocumented workers are vulnerable to exploitation. “Some farmers never pay more than pay $7.50 an hour,” says Carlos. “I know a guy that the boss didn’t pay him, just fired him when he asked for money. But Migrant Justice went, and the farmer had to pay.” Migrant Justice and others have also intervened to address living conditions. Some workers share a room in the boss’s house, some live in poorly insulated trailers or are crammed into bunkhouses. The worst-off sleep in the barn. “I know a farm where they almost sleep with the cows,” says Carlos. “They have a little room off the milking parlor and just a door to divide them from the cows. I was at a farm like that the other day and I was like, “Where’s your house?’ ‘This is where we live,’ he said, and I was like ‘What?’ I didn’t ask how many people lived in the room.” Carlos and the other workers at his farm have their own rustic, but comfortable, house with TV and wifi, cable, a stove and refrigerator. Free accommodations facilitate the real goal: putting money aside for a better future for themselves and family back home. Despite one “really dumb” purchase of “that no-good Mustang,” Carlos has been able to save and send back enough to buy land, “build my house, buy 10 cows,” and help out his older siblings and parents. Migrant workers like Carlos can, if they are careful, pare down out-of-pocket expenses to food they cook for themselves, phone service, and clothing. At their store of choice, Walmart, they buy up jeans made in Mexico that cost less than they would back home. Once, I took a worker who was returning the next day to Mexico to the “fancy store,” J.C. Penny, to buy presents to bring his wife. The saleswoman stalked us nervously as we examined filmy lingerie and nearly intervened when he held a red and black lace bra up to a mannequin to gage size. Dairy farm in winter. Photo by Terry J. Allen/VTDigger The long journey A week or so after the Planned Parenthood visit, Carlos and I had lunch and I asked, promising anonymity, if he would talk to me — as a journalist — about his experiences. He started reluctantly. He was 16, he said, just out of high school with a bit of technical school when he took the two-day bus ride from Tabasco to Reynosa, a bitter, hardscrabble border city, deep in poverty, guns, gangs, and drug violence. There, he and his older brother met the man who might lead them safely to a job in America, into the hands of border agents, or to death in the desert. Some coyotes are professional “guides” doing an illegal and dangerous job for which they expect high pay; some are con men bent on exploitation. “If you come to the border alone, you will always find a coyote,” Carlos told me, “but you never know if it is someone who is reliable or will just take your money.” One way to mitigate the risk of rip-offs and scams is by making arrangements ahead. Five years before, “my father made it to the states and knew which coyotes to trust,” said Carlos. In Reynosa, “someone would phone us and tell us the color of the car or truck, red or green, that would take care of us. But we never ever communicated with the coyote himself in any way until the moment we were on the border and we met in a bus station parking lot.” “My coyote was one of the better ones,” Carlos said. “But all of them. It’s just about the money.” And even the better ones cannot guarantee a successful crossing. “It’s a risk we all take,” said Carlos, “and you never know how it will end.” In 2011, the year Carlos crossed the river, Customs and Border Patrol apprehended 327,577 people in the U.S.-Mexico border region. Nearly 16,000, like Carlos, were “unaccompanied alien children,” under 17 years old. The agency documented 375 deaths. The ones who made it safely joined America’s 11 million unauthorized immigrants, who, in 2014 accounted for about 5 percent of U.S. civilian labor force, the Pew Research Center estimates. Six million Mexicans, about half that total, are mostly concentrated in farming (26 percent) and construction occupations (15 percent). Some migrants who make the crossing, especially those from Honduras and Guatemala, are escaping gang wars and may be eligible for refugee status. But almost all Mexicans are economic migrants seeking to better their lives. “My papa, he grows watermelon and corn,” Carlos tells me, “and was the first to come to America. And when he was here, we always had something to eat. I came five years after [he returned]. “Now I am always helping them. I send money. My sister and brother [who are also in America illegally] can’t so much, because they have families to support, but I don’t.” Carlos is the youngest of five siblings. “My family [in Mexico] is doing fine and if they need something, they let us know, and we will get it for them. They never suffer for lack of food, gracias a dios.” It was agreed, then: Carlos would pay his coyote $500 before they left Reynosa and arrange for someone to deliver $1,500 once he reached a safe house in Texas, far enough from the border that he could move on or blend in. “They always need that money punctually, or it is dangerous. They can do anything to you.” In Reynosa, the coyote took Carlos and his brother to a series of houses. “When they are ready to cross the river, they gave me a life vest, and we start to walk. It had been raining a lot, so the river was very high. It was during the day, because in the night, there were others crossing.” The coyote led them to an inflatable boat and asked who knew how to swim. “I told them I didn’t, and that’s what you are supposed to say so they don’t throw you in the river.” The Rio Grande was swollen far into the trees on the U.S. side, and the dozen travelers, including three or four women, plus the coyote, had to leave the boat, which couldn’t navigate through the trees, and walk through chest-high water.” Carlos brought water “aspirin and lemons, in case we run out of water.” The coyote gave them food to carry. “The meals, like beans, were all cans. And a lot of bread, tortillas.” Once on dry land, with the thwack of helicopters “always, always,” beating the sky above, they walked rapidly, seeking cover while trying to evade sensors in the ground, cameras, and law enforcement patrols. After several more hours, the group reached a road where “we met a little truck. And we drove through a normal neighborhood … to a house where there were about 30 women, men, and children, not only Mexicans, but also Columbians and Hondurans.” “They gave us food and a place to sleep. And some clothes and shoes, because ours were wet. You just take whatever fits you.” The next day, they boarded a truck that dropped them in the desert. The Border Patrol calls the area the Rio Grande or McAllen Region. Spanish explorers had a more descriptive name: El Desierto de los Muertos, the Desert of the Dead. Carlos became quiet, reached for a glass of water and stared at the table. Then, as if a switch had flipped, he began talking rapidly. “I walked for five days,” he said, and when he saw me wince, added with annoyance at my pity, “That’s nothing compared to people I know; 15 days, 16 days in the desert, a month. That’s why people die, or they go with the wrong coyote, and then someone gets tired, they just leave them there. “I saw a woman who was exhausted, and she was in our group. The coyote said ‘It’s her or all of us.’ She was in her 30s. He didn’t really want to leave her where no one would find her, so we went to a place where he thought the Border Patrol might pass. He gave her a bottle of water and left her there. She said nothing, didn’t even cry. “Hours after we left her, we started to hear footsteps like someone is behind us and thought it was immigration. It was her. I can’t explain it, how she did it. She was almost about to die when we left her. Somehow she came. “After three days, we ran out of water. I remember that was horrible, and then food was getting scarce. I was doing fine, but my brother, he was the one who was very exhausted, and a friend of mine, too. But we continue and continue. And the coyote, he always says, ‘We just have to get to that light.’ He tries to give us hope. ‘Are you ready to make dollars?’” “We were just exhausted. I remember I got dizzy a little and felt like we are walking in the same way all the time. “And then we waited at the side of the road. Waiting and waiting and helicopters are always flying. And it was terrifying. Then a truck shows up and quick, we all ran into it.” “For hours, we couldn’t move. And that was horrible in the truck, all packed together. And all like this, like this.” He draws himself into a tight knot. “I still remember a child, maybe he was 14, crying. He says he just wants a little bit of water, but they can’t stop. ‘No, you are almost there. Almost there.’ “And then we got to a house, and there is a guy at a table, and he is phoning people, saying, ‘Hey we got your son, your daughter.’ My dad sent someone with money to pick us up. And that friend took us to an apartment.” Eventually through a network, Carlos found the construction job and stayed in Texas for a year, until he decided Vermont was worth a try. “So I have been here five years,” Carlos says. “I never thought I would stay that long, but I got used to it. I like Vermont. The people are really nice, but,” he grinned, “the winter, not so much.” Editor’s note: This story was based on conversations in Spanish and English, and one interview aided by a bilingual interpreter.

A combined 60,600 retail job losses over the past two months have had less to do with the health of U.S. consumer spending than with changes in buying habits. In the age of Amazon, traditional stores, from J.C. Penney to Macy’s, have accelerated store closures and are experimenting with the use of fewer employees to staff the remaining stores. A sales clerk arranges towels that are part of a 'Buy One Get One for a Penny' sale at a J.C. Penney store, in New York. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The industry has also been bruised by a string of bankruptcy filings, most recently from Payless ShoeSource. The company announced this week that it was closing nearly 400 stores, nearly 10 percent of its fleet. The job cuts in the retail industry, unwelcome as they are, are still a relatively minor burden for the overall U.S. economy. But for Americans seeking a foothold in the job market, the pullback represents a painful obstacle. Retail accounts for nearly one-third of first-time jobs in the United States, so a retrenchment by the industry’s employers can block access to the job market for many. As shopping on the web has expanded, retail jobs have represented a declining share of the labor market. They now account for 10.9 percent of jobs, compared with 11.6 percent in 2000, says Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, a research firm. And experts expect more store closings — and job losses — in coming months. “It’s principally about the impact of online shopping and how consumers are shopping differently than ever before,” Niemira said. “It’s harder for the industry to consistently do well and make money.” Take Fernando Ramirez, a 19-year-old restaurant server and college student, who was looking Friday to buy some sweaters at a Kohl’s in Tustin, California. Ramirez said he stops at a department store or mall once or twice a week to see what’s available. But most of his buying is done on the web. “It’s mostly to browse and see what they have,” said Ramirez, who lives in Tustin, Calif. “I do more of my purchasing online now.” The two-month contraction in retail jobs — 30,900 lost in February and 29,700 in March — marked the largest two-month decline since December 2009, when the industry shed 62,200 jobs. That month’s loss had signaled the end of a prolonged decline in the industry resulting from the Great Recession. The retail industry losses for February and March were contained in Friday’s U.S. jobs report from the government. The report offered an overall mixed message: Hiring in the United States dropped to its weakest pace in nearly a year, but the unemployment rate managed to reach its lowest level in nearly a decade. The jobs report pointed to dire problems confronting many of the stores populating shopping plazas and malls. Department and general merchandise stores — a category that includes Macy’s and Wal-Mart — shed 34,700 workers last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Retailers involved in high-priced big ticket items such as furniture stores and auto dealers barely added jobs. Nor are wages keeping pace. Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 percent average increase for all U.S. workers. The struggles of many traditional retailers can be traced most of all to Amazon and other online retailers. Amazon’s Prime membership program, costing $99 a year, has been a juggernaut, with services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members disproportionately buy more and spend more. In the process, Amazon has redefined the standards for its rival retailers. They now feel more pressure to limit costs while expanding services and offers for shoppers, from free shipping to non-stop discounting, which take a toll on profit margins. It’s hardly just Amazon. One online-only retailer, Chewy.com, sells an array of pet supplies beyond what’s generally available in physical stores, including high-end organic pet food. The fast-growing company plans to add about 3,200 jobs this year, raising its head count to 6,900. Though traditional retailers are expanding their own online presences, those operations require far fewer workers. The labor involved in selling an item online through a distribution center can be 50 percent less than if it were sold in a store, estimates Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners, LLP, a consultancy. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC, a research firm, says he expects earnings for the first quarter for the 113 retailers he tracks to drop 6.8 percent. That would be the worst quarterly performance since 2013. Stores are also increasingly adopting technology that reduces the need for employees, like shopping kiosks and iPads where shoppers can buy online while in a store. And some traditional stores like Macy’s are testing self-service in some of their shoe departments. In the restaurant industry, executives have touted the benefits of automation for customers. Ordering kiosks, for instance, can help speed up lines and improve order accuracy. Though it’s still early, chains including McDonald’s and Panera have introduced ordering screens in some stores. And some sit-down chains have introduced table-top ordering tablets. One of the hard realities of the new shopping era is evident at the Richmond Town Center outside of Cleveland, where the number of employees working at stores appeared to exceed the slim number of shoppers on a cold spring afternoon Friday. Two of the mall’s three anchors— Sears and Macy’s — have closed in the past year. The third, J.C. Penney, is slated to close in June. Tiffany Fulton was cutting through J.C. Penney to get a new battery for a watch. She doesn’t shop at the mall regularly, she said, and her buying habits, especially for clothes, involve stocking up “every blue moon” and then not shopping again for six months or even a year. She said she goes to the mall every once in a while for some “retail therapy.” “If I need to feel better, I might stop by,” Fulton said.

The final tally is still 5050 the zone believe it during the break the callers have spoken and on the Texas have too by the way. It is pretty unanimous among the book among the techs and the calls during the break that John Hamas yeah. Well I will. Always for coming. Analysts say every texted this morning for two months into.

Indeed a comic all like music I mean obviously Brett joke you the album. And then Dale's like my three kids and now I did not like how odd to look at 92 Ford Taurus right so than Curtis thinks it's wetter. And I went to saint Paul's view as a prep school and there. And he's like keep was the only kid at saint Paul's in the ninety Taurus I guess insinuating. I've been hiding all the Stanley wealth right so loaded icon from money that's got that it's my triggers Evan is. When people assume that everybody went to a prep schools it's filthy rich like they only allow the Vanderbilt in the Kennedys to go to prep school he's angry I guess I'll multiple sources and kitchen with in this building that says that he was.

I was stunned honest to god I did not I thought that was going to be a even on. Tomorrow she said on Monday. At families like Hulk he was this that Kirk it's such an easy field right. That was going to be a joke. I 99 on and on and off. And no there early returns just stock went like 62 to. 38 oddly racist Boston personal. We were so does the mayor elect have a conversation about the Saddam talk to him about his experience what he's experienced some Boston I think you spoke with him impress people. Or I highly doubt it's gonna come by at the finish line Alan I don't think he's gonna make an appearance. On the Tuesday April 4 edition of key NC which were battery get three ships that it does pretty well it's that's a lot to get through but we get muddy and with Kirk and year but took a beating I would say. She'll be 8 o'clock segment probably we can't complaining to sound out seems to be some Kerr fought for behind the scenes but the the scoreboard update was getting tarnished it was it was a tough Tuesday for much. Applause today with the with cork out. Though it was a little goes where it's started to sort of organic thing of explaining you know. There was a joke and hang of explaining you know there was a joke in there about the final four. You college basketball North Carolina and Inzaghi here and on a flight to station WEEI beginning at 732. We got. Goldman Sachs mock UNC. The national championship game. And in the process of getting good joke. Zag wins my wife is gonna beat me in our bracket challenge means I have a lot of want to do for next week I think that there. So that a segment of a certain broadcast is good banter back and forth between my apartment in my different Pittsburgh did witty repartee. And be. The intent as the play that in sort of focus on the printer and Jerry and Kirk sort of fixated on com. The scoreboard element of said segment. And the scores that were being discussed which is not. Well it's a little bit of an insult to segment. I guess but really they were criticizing much creative liberties in choosing to update the brewers game in particular which. A little bit honestly I would put in Mike Trent. You did discuss an exodus and yawkey way wow that's the whole team it's my guys that's my squad Friday noted Abram Friday rim not a out. Does so is and I thought it was all good fun I. Listen I S senate Tuesday at thing Peter Clarke are with the best our yesterday.

Lying two weeks ago about the wiretapping claims and I think about this and just letting Jerry Trainor illegal out of a thought was good. I was a very you know a little long but good fifteen minutes sort of back and forth in headlines and you know overall I thought. Today moved and I was insured not just because Kirk result but because of the topics what was really gonna stick mineral disorder known to. For that money in training and it worked together. It's true that could have been awkward at the dual two pros they have the well what do you by the way. Training new show tentatively start she really seems to Alicia fakes it well enjoy the radio.

Ryan Anthony Johnson, 27, was charged with first-degree assault, reckless endangerment and attempting to elude officers, Investigator Randy Angle said on Thursday. Johnson was a suspect in a hit-and-run earlier in the day at the intersection of 11th Street and Quintard Avenue, Angle said on Wednesday. The wreck injured two in the other vehicle, Angle said, which made Johnson’s hit-and-run a felony offense. Angle said he attempted a “front-to-front traffic stop” on Johnson pulling his vehicle up to the front of the Honda the 27-year-old was driving. According to an incident report, Angle attempted that stop at the intersection of Virginia Road and Eulaton Road around 2 p.m. “He hit the gas and tried to run me over,” Angle said. “The side mirror hit my arm.” After attempting to find Johnson at his home, officers found the vehicle on McClellan Boulevard near Wal-Mart around 3:30 p.m., according to an incident report. Angle said Anniston officers and officers with the major crimes unit tracked Johnson from McClellan Boulevard to Alexandria Road, where he continued until it dead-ended at U.S. 431. Johnson then turned right onto U.S. 431, Angle said, then right onto Bynum-Leatherwood Road, where his vehicle crossed the yellow line and continued down an embankment to the right of the northbound lane. “We never got in excess of 40 mph,” Angle said. By the time the chase was over, Johnson allegedly had attempted to run over three officers, Angle said. Johnson was taken to Regional Medical Center in Anniston with minor injuries and was arrested around 7 p.m., according to an arrest report. He remained in the Anniston City Jail with bond set at $500 for the reckless endangerment charge. No bond had been set for the other two charges, according to the arrest report. ​Staff writer Kirsten Fiscus: 256-235-3563. On Twitter @kfiscus_star.

In the age of Amazon, traditional stores, from J.C. Penney to Macy’s, have accelerated store closures and are experimenting with the use of fewer employees to staff the remaining stores. The industry has also been bruised by a string of bankruptcy filings, most recently from Payless ShoeSource. The company announced this week that it was closing nearly 400 stores, nearly 10 percent of its fleet. The job cuts in the retail industry, unwelcome as they are, are still a relatively minor burden for the overall U.S. economy. But for Americans seeking a foothold in the job market, the pullback represents a painful obstacle. Retail accounts for nearly one-third of first-time jobs in the United States, so a retrenchment by the industry’s employers can block access to the job market for many. As shopping on the web has expanded, retail jobs have represented a declining share of the labor market. They now account for 10.9 percent of jobs, compared with 11.6 percent in 2000, says Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, a research firm. And experts expect more store closings — and job losses — in coming months. “It’s principally about the impact of online shopping and how consumers are shopping differently than ever before,” Niemira said. “It’s harder for the industry to consistently do well and make money.” Take Fernando Ramirez, a 19-year-old restaurant server and college student, who was looking Friday to buy some sweaters at a Kohl’s in Tustin, California. Ramirez said he stops at a department store or mall once or twice a week to see what’s available. But most of his buying is done on the web. “It’s mostly to browse and see what they have,” said Ramirez, who lives in Tustin, Calif. “I do more of my purchasing online now.” The two-month contraction in retail jobs — 30,900 lost in February and 29,700 in March — marked the largest two-month decline since December 2009, when the industry shed 62,200 jobs. That month’s loss had signaled the end of a prolonged decline in the industry resulting from the Great Recession. The retail industry losses for February and March were contained in Friday’s U.S. jobs report from the government. The report offered an overall mixed message: Hiring in the United States dropped to its weakest pace in nearly a year, but the unemployment rate managed to reach its lowest level in nearly a decade. The jobs report pointed to dire problems confronting many of the stores populating shopping plazas and malls. Department and general merchandise stores — a category that includes Macy’s and Wal-Mart — shed 34,700 workers last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Retailers involved in high-priced big ticket items such as furniture stores and auto dealers barely added jobs. Nor are wages keeping pace. Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 percent average increase for all U.S. workers. The struggles of many traditional retailers can be traced most of all to Amazon and other online retailers. Amazon’s Prime membership program, costing $99 a year, has been a juggernaut, with services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members disproportionately buy more and spend more. In the process, Amazon has redefined the standards for its rival retailers. They now feel more pressure to limit costs while expanding services and offers for shoppers, from free shipping to non-stop discounting, which take a toll on profit margins. It’s hardly just Amazon. One online-only retailer, sells an array of pet supplies beyond what’s generally available in physical stores, including high-end organic pet food. The fast-growing company plans to add about 3,200 jobs this year, raising its head count to 6,900. Though traditional retailers are expanding their own online presences, those operations require far fewer workers. The labor involved in selling an item online through a distribution center can be 50 percent less than if it were sold in a store, estimates Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners, LLP, a consultancy. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC, a research firm, says he expects earnings for the first quarter for the 113 retailers he tracks to drop 6.8 percent. That would be the worst quarterly performance since 2013. Stores are also increasingly adopting technology that reduces the need for employees, like shopping kiosks and iPads where shoppers can buy online while in a store. And some traditional stores like Macy’s are testing self-service in some of their shoe departments. In the restaurant industry, executives have touted the benefits of automation for customers. Ordering kiosks, for instance, can help speed up lines and improve order accuracy. Though it’s still early, chains including McDonald’s and Panera have introduced ordering screens in some stores. And some sit-down chains have introduced table-top ordering tablets. One of the hard realities of the new shopping era is evident at the Richmond Town Center outside of Cleveland, where the number of employees working at stores appeared to exceed the slim number of shoppers on a cold spring afternoon Friday. Two of the mall’s three anchors— Sears and Macy’s — have closed in the past year. The third, J.C. Penney, is slated to close in June. Tiffany Fulton was cutting through J.C. Penney to get a new battery for a watch. She doesn’t shop at the mall regularly, she said, and her buying habits, especially for clothes, involve stocking up “every blue moon” and then not shopping again for six months or even a year. She said she goes to the mall every once in a while for some “retail therapy.” “If I need to feel better, I might stop by,” Fulton said.

The family has proposed developing the Atascadero ranch into a residential community with 494 single-family lots of at least 1 acre, 93 units of multifamily housing, 2,285 acres of open space and 16.9 miles of public trails. Victor Montgomery with RRM Design Group talks about the major aspects of the Eagle Ranch project. David Middlecamp The Tribune A view from Eagle Ranch near Atascadero. Judith Hildinger 1 of 2 i By Bob Kelley LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Hearings have begun in Atascadero on whether the city should annex the proposed Eagle Ranch project. Looking at all of the maps, pictures and proposed benefits of the development, some people may say, “What a great project!” While serving on the Atascadero Planning Commission for seven years and the City Council for eight years, I was somewhat involved with the project getting to where it is today. That process has taken close to nine years, mostly in an attempt to come up with an environmental impact report that may be acceptable. On three occasions, I met with the owners of the ranch and their consultant. At each of those meetings, I said it appeared the project would not pencil out or, in other words, was not revenue neutral. They agreed. I have always wondered why anyone would want to go forward and support what appears to be a failed project from the beginning. I still feel that way today. Current Mayor Tom O’Malley is on record from a previous joint Planning Commission and City Council meeting stating that the Eagle Ranch project would have to be “revenue-neutral at a minimum.” I, too, took that position. One point of concern: In 1996, the incorporated cities in the county came to an agreement that if county property were to be annexed into a city, the county would retain two-thirds of the property tax revenue and the city would get one-third. It has always been said that residential properties do not generate enough revenue from property taxes to support needed services. Consider: With the base tax rate at 1 percent, owners of a home valued at $600,000 pay $6,000. From that amount, the city of Atascadero normally gets about 16 percent, or $960. But under the revenue-neutrality agreement, the county would retain two-thirds of that amount, leaving the city with just $320. I have asked for years what the amount of tax would have to be in order for a residence to be revenue neutral. I have never received an answer because I think there is no answer. The discussion of renegotiating the property tax issue with the county so that the city of Atascadero could receive its rightful share has been going on for years. To the best of my knowledge, nothing has changed. Any change in the agreement has to be done in a public forum. It needs to be considered by the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors and requires a positive majority vote. (The Atascadero City Council also would have to approve a new revenue-neutrality agreement.) Until that time, there should be no decision of any type on the Eagle Ranch project. At this time, the project is not revenue neutral. Even if the county agreed to give Atascadero its full share of property tax revenue, it still appears the Eagle Ranch project in no way can come close to being able to cover future costs of the infrastructure and services it will require. The city does not have a good record of structuring financial conditions for projects that require expensive improvements. For example, had the Wal-Mart project gone forward, taxpayers would have been left with an unfunded $8 million tab to complete the 101/Del Rio roundabouts. People of Atascadero need to become proactive and require the city to disclose the financial agreements that will be in place between the city, the county and Eagle Ranch prior to any acceptance of any portion of the project. This time, don’t settle for hearing the city say, “We have it handled.” Should the city approve this without ample proof of revenue neutrality, the only ones to benefit will be a government bureaucracy that will require more taxes from all of us to support what they have approved — a financially negative project. Bob Kelley is a former Atasacadero city councilman. He also served on the city’s Planning Commission.

We hope you're not eating right now, because the latest food recall is sure to make you retch. No, we're not talking E. coli or listeria: Fresh Express packaged salad mix is being recalled because a pair of unlucky diners found a bat in their greens. Yes. A salad bat. Advertisement Mashable reports that Fresh Express, which is available at Walmart stores nationwide, recalled a selection of its salad mixes after the incident. But wait, just to be clear, people found a bat in their salad mix. To make matters worse, the couple had already been chowing down on the green stuff when they found the unwelcome extra ingredient lurking in their salad. Anyone brave enough to check their bagged salad should look to make sure it's Fresh Express' Organic Marketside Spring Mix before overreacting and eating nothing but Soylent (wait, on second thought...). The FDA is recalling salads distributed in the Southeastern U.S. According to the FDA's recall site, the questionable mixes are in a clear container with production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of April 14, 2017, and UPC code 681131328975. Walmart removed all packaged salads from the same lot at the location that sold the bat salad. "The recall was necessitated when Fresh Express was notified that extraneous animal matter was allegedly found in a single container of the salad," the FDA statement reads. "Out of an abundance of caution, all salads manufactured in the same production run are being recalled." According to the Centers for Disease Control, after the "extraneous animal matter" arrived for testing, the bat was "in such deteriorated condition" that health officials couldn't even subject it to tests for rabies. But the CDC adds that contracting rabies by ingestion is extremely rare since the virus cannot survive outside of a host. The couple that reported finding the bag has begun post-rabies exposure treatments, however. Both are in good health and have not reported any symptoms. The government organization adds that no one has reported additional instances of bat-laced salads, though we've lost our appetites and can't imagine ever looking at a bowl of salad the same way ever again. If you do have one of the salads in your fridge right now, you can call the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center at 1-800-242-5472 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. EDT or return it to Walmart for a full refund.

Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 percent average increase for all U.S. workers. 1|2|Next Page>> PREVIOUS ARTICLE London finance chief upbeat after Brexit trigger NEXT ARTICLE Oil company finds another problem in Alaska Cook Inlet marine pipeline Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Now that the US is out, Beijing authorities may be interested in attending TPP talks 2 Reports of TSMC's US plant rattle Taiwan 3 TSMC still considering plans for 3nm chip production 4 Why analysts believed TSMC was looking elsewhere 5 Wanda ends bid for US producer 6 Brazil investment plan under discussion: Taiwanese IC company 7 China's Premier Li arrives in New Zealand for talks 8 Wistron shares soar on earnings, Apple orders 9 American Airlines buys stake in China Southern Airlines 10 Debt, low wages signal rise of youth poverty: job bank Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

The Centers for Disease Control is working with state health officials and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to figure out how the bat ended up inside the Organic Marketside Spring Mix. According to a release sent out by the CDC on Saturday, the two people were already eating the salad mix before realizing the dead bat was inside. The bat was sent to get tested for rabies, but because of its condition, the CDC says they can’t get a good result back. The people who ate the salad were treated for rabies just in case. Fresh Express says the salads have the production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of APR 14, 2017 located on the front label. The company says the Organic Marketside Spring Mix was only distributed to Walmart stores in the Southeast. If you have the recalled salad and notice any animal matter inside, you’re asked to contact your local health department immediately.   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent Tensions high as fire threat continues in Oviedo Fire damage inside Camp Mah-Kah-Wee in Chuluota Fire evacuees allowed back in Oviedo homes Ring found on cruise ship, reunited with owner 6 arrested after protest turns violent Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

The conversation moves to the Celtics and who they might take in the draft. They finish over the hour recapping the 2017 Masters. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. These seasonal market and decent show and strive very. The ball game is over there right side not the 500 is they'd lose to the tigers the finals Detroit forward crossed the one. There's no other option right now because of so many injuries and it's so much sickness and man oh whatever is going now with the ballclub right now no to finally get right back and get a list of books certainly not a 100% yet. So like we can go home and quit. Against Renner there you know get a job doing now. You were traded just can't do it just to dealings with strong opinions and a handful of brain cells what's up big daddy. It is yes good drive didn't show it in good hands mark has his opinion but he's got a ball. Other things got. She's just going swimmingly ET I NG shopping jobs doesn't have the market is back up that is back I don't see him up there anyway the but I was wrong now it's time for the market increase in show our sports Radio One 03 point seven WEEI. I welcome into the mark and Jason show. Good to be back today and how about this new studio to talk about the new studio last week and I couldn't help but not a okay this studio. I'd give anything to Yates because you do I want it eaten off this cable directly like. Is so clean and perfect it is nice. I'm black I was some baby leave for one week vacation. Not exactly did not doing diaper changes but it's good to be back we have a lot to get to today. Bruins Celtics Red Sox obviously we'll toxin patriots I know you have a feeling to about Brad marsh and you do that at all yesterday we had Scott can he can get we did and we'll talk about that a little bit I have something to say about. But there's a lot to get to and I wanna just give an opening take. We. Of an optimist dom but I've been an optimistic guy in terms of the Bruins despite my. My you know doubts about two grass I've been optimistic thinking that hey I think that they can do something in the playoffs when the time arrives. Am feeling a little different and I just got out as it came down the stretch we see a little bit more out of them against especially lots of what was and we did not. Seattle game was frustrating because you lost crude in that game we don't know how long that he's going to be out and he really is honestly. The way that they play now how they get the puck out of their loans on with the defendant one of their defensemen usually crew skating out of that. He's really good at that first pass to get out of their opponent and now that they don't have him that puck carrier that puck moving defenseman. That's going to be a big problem for them and we don't know how long Carlos can doubt that they are scholarly but yesterday. Looks like to a concussion from all indications of how he was. Struggling to get upn and kind of woozy when he was when he was walk him when he was getting help back to the bench so now you're down two defenseman. In this this leads me to kind of my question that I hope they don't do I hope they don't. Activate back or because in all likelihood of west Toronto loses today you're going to be playing Washington in the first round. Hey I don't think it's right to throw the kid in there in a playoff game against the number one seed in the east that you are going to lose do. I don't see them beating them because yesterday and beat that backup goaltender. Washington did play most of its players but yet the back of goaltender yet OP. With the with the Bruins had an an immense difficulty he owns yeah operates yeah Boston roots up he did what he does what are the broad genes that the Celtics. This week Brady told me. Eleven Joseph. Against the Bruins 945 save percentage one point eight goals against three shots to grass meanwhile against the capitals in one in 98087. Save percentage. Threw for four goals against. This series won't be series if they end up playing Washington now is why I don't understand. And this stuff you know what drives me crazy but I do not understand why Bruce Cassidy did not try to. Do everything that they could to beat Washington and to avoid Washington. I don't wanna see Washington labors are they played your goalie. They played goalie listen. I've already admitted that I was wrong about that I know down the stretch Google Rask was the right decision distort we got so many ways the goalie I don't you know I. I can't win here with the goal is. He is is what I wonder about this a couple questions recommend this when you talk about the decision yesterday to play you'd open. Let's by the way does he didn't feel well right unbelievable. While I mean look I'm not dragged out of that we use is a questions that that should be asked if about that situation yesterday eight was it the was it a situation where the Bruins are managing to cook is we've heard that all you are in this so. Did you Google up to them and say no I want to play and if they said no if they told them now. Then that's on them. And if Rask in bothered to be bothered by it. Then you've asked that it would bother to be bothered by if you wasn't frustrated by the fact that they were playing him instead of Udoh Brin and he's. Not complicit with that. But OK with the decision he's just kind of like okay is one on one of my days that they gonna management. Then he probably that probably that's our great lucky there on his part celebrated. Either way it doesn't look good yeah you know either way it doesn't look good because I you know I just don't get it that you're not playing until either Wednesday or Thursday. It out and looks like they're going to be playing on Wednesday are excuse me on Thursday with against Washington. I'm because sadly the Celtics are home Wednesday in the last game. So I just I don't get it you you you wanted the too big even as ugly as those games are against dot org you would think that. You'd have a better chance definitely 100 million in a series against them over washing 100 gave no chance against Washington not a hero Don. No not at all and book again let's go back to the marsh on suspension because. It you know just because you don't like what he did. Against a deadly game against Tampa Bay. On Tuesday it does it mean that you don't appreciate waited for the rest of the season what were your thoughts on the suspension and what he deserved it 100% deserve to and it's a completely on him. It was a selfish move. And he didn't seem to remorseful laughter in the only thing that he said was. Well you know I I feel like. I feel like god the only place people that mattered to me of the players. On the ice my teammates and my family. And you know if you ever played hockey you don't understand what's gore okay well we do because there's cameras everywhere Brad we understand that there's a little bit of a cross checked by adoption. Which was a light tap to say Elise it was just a minimal minimal love apt. That every defense he gives a guy that's in front of the net that sound off what is and you. And you know two to sit there and and try and defend what you did it just it blows my mind I I. I don't I don't buy. That yes has the play that way. That sort of stuff cat that's sort of stuff he doesn't have to do to be woody is because a by the way the people let's say that I guess they forget that when he was at. Before he got drafted by the Bruins in the third round in the third round it's a pretty important tech. You expect those players to contribute. You would play for the Canadian junior team by the white. So this guy's not subscribe they just made his name. Made his name by. By you know being of Pratt and being dirty in doing stupid stuff from being an agitator. Is a difference between being an agitator on the ice into what he did. Against Tampa let me ask your question do you think that at all in this situation. There was some bad luck involved. I mini game a little jab not how stupid that was I was about you know he's gonna hit him in the not yes he did it definitely without saying we just knew he was gonna mail write cannot with. How question that he's Canadian there's not a fan is now that there's no edit. You know he was just trying to get a little note that in a little message quick one get him into help get him in the in our guest star maker decided they know what you know when you see the replays. From the point where there's a snapshot taken by defenseman and they score from the point because the traffic of run and that you see the replay. And you see the composite stick bend a little yeah a lot. Well when Marchand hit him in the junk. Dubbed the state banks so there was no. Accidental swing there was no. I didn't mean to hitch their body now that was purposeful. He was pit stop dating get it a cross check penalty called Biden called on Dotson. A couple seconds before it happened was just don't I agree so there's just dull the conclusion is that he got emotional lost his cool and herta Steve. Which is on except the up and not acceptable and they've lost him now for the last two games they lost in the last giant dam could use them against that Ottawa you tell me how to think they would have been able to capitalize on some of their chances. In that game that they had against Ottawa out and maybe they wouldn't even have to have worried about not worried but you would have been able to do whatever you needed to do in the last game of the season against the capitals. Listen you know I just it's frustrating because you know the people that say well he's gonna continue to play that way that's who we as well you know what they'd get ready for life without Brad Marchand for for a majority of time do you Gloria is no exit. Okay that's right. You know what that's specialists isn't going away his reputation as a gonna go away. What he did isn't going away. And he's gonna get suspended for more games. In he's got to continue to get suspended so the people let's say well that's sorting is gonna continue to play that way are well they get ready for life put up Marchand for a significant amount of time because. He's gonna keep getting suspended is not get the all the sudden I don't wake up and feel bad form and be like OK I'll Brad birdied your break this time now. Carrie we'll talk to Jamie Murphy covers the Bruins at 1020 we'll get his take. On marsh and then the rest of the Bruins situation is or is the playoffs go on listen. I don't know if so Tai Anderson they've really got our comp. He seems he seems to agree with me or I agree with him Harvey wanna put it that they would have a better chance against Ottawa. However I will say 0144. Games that's pretty good sample size they gonna win any game now jar somewhere close that. You know I don't like either match up. I U I from everything I've gathered at the big advantage Ottawa hagee is their coaching and that's why all. So yeah I'd rather see them not understood why winning goal Wally and as far as Bruce Cassidy goes why he mingle all in to try to beat Washington to avoid playing. I don't. Now there's not much to get about it it doesn't make a lot of sense I mean the Ottawa game was what laws you know they are. But they were that they were without Marchand and they lost group that was a uphill battle that they had you. Had to fight the entire game this seems it try to get back into that game and you know there. Again you could use Marchand and I came out did you use him in the shootout and set to have amber Trotter or excuse me sort out there which is big he can be used in there where he's pretty damn good. Yeah I you know I don't like where this is going because. You know I'm just thinking here over the course the last few weeks especially since the match ups have come into play a little bit where we know they're gonna face either Ottawa or Washington I'm getting less and less confident not that I had a ton of confidence in the Bruins before that not getting less and less confident. And unfortunately unfortunately. Are starting to feel that way regarding the Boston Celtics I don't know why maybe it was the cavs game maybe it's just. Say you were right today I was just you were right it's easy to say. Why wait a minute what what you're right about what I've been saying this all year about this team that they are not alone I'm not I. I am one of the few people that have been I said that from the very beginning of the season now I'm not convinced they're getting out of the first round I they should. They show it dear I'm not convinced that it. I'm not convinced of that I'm sorry. Before we get into that. Full throttle let me ask you this if they don't get out of the first round and what kind of scenario does that present. Well I think it a restarting those right on about my wallet already talking about not I don't think yet with Steve O Jack I don't think that was Stevens but I think a roster shake up jerked the roster should be on the writing assured the writing should be on the wall about Isiah. Was that I welcome I think he's a good player but I think there's a very very very small window that you're dealing with a view if you resign him. And in I don't know that's the direction that the team once ago why didn't they why did they add pieces at the trade deadline if they felt that Thomas was one of those guys dig to build around. You know for all the talk about how much they've problem and how much they love this team and a score. There's some decisions that have to be made within have to be made in the off season with this team that are pretty significant ones. Avery Bradley's gonna be up after next year mark Smart can be up that's next year. There's his decisions that have to be made on some pretty significant players on this roster that may or may not be here. When this team is actually contending for a championship which is the way I felt about it for a long time and I understand it's a long approach and people don't wanna hear that. But sometimes that's also the approach that you need to take because that's the safest way of acquiring a superstar. People that think that they again Paul George up I just don't believe that I think these guys off to highlight his agent is set so glad that he wants to play that and it doesn't. That doesn't set in the it's it's not set in stone that he's gonna deal Laker but it it's up ahead. And you know what else that. Present today thought that I had a few weeks ago or last week forget when but. Com you know we were talking a little bit I think the last time I was in about the draft and who we want the Celtics take your more of mark helpful skied and one's a ball that I want Alonso ball however I did remember. What his father said and yes the Celtics could draft him and he could play impossible but who's to say the first chance he gets to go to the lakers he would ring gall. Yeah I don't know if I'd wanna dance with him now you know that's another thing to take into consideration I don't know what that we're I want to Iowa were more I would worry about the idea you boy player you draft a manual if you like him a job in my particularly not a huge fan of his game I think is a little bit overrated I don't think he's a particularly. Good shooter. I don't think he does a lot of things well. That when well did things that he does well I don't necessarily think that they're gonna translate. To the to the NBA he's a great passer but what is esteem need it's delicious say if they made the decision that Isiah is not to be part of the future. The agony is score. Ball is far from that he's a good players great facilitator is a great passer but he's not he's score a little bit a little yeah apps only ten. But I'll just share of faults is the more well rounded player. There's a lot more of his game that I like that I think can translate any six sport he's not tiny easily you know he's not diminutive you know a story about that. Two ways weighs 64 pretty pretty big guy to play the point are positioning he's really more of like that hybrid guard its commitment to leaflets or other well like Westbrook no way. Like west Westbrook who can do at all is more for shooting guard replace the point he's a great. Great passer. Fultz is a good passer I don't know if I outweigh. Balls passing ability you know if they get fortunate and get that pick over somebody who has some much more complete game to mark Al faults if the Celtics. Started the playoffs right now may be that you see that they would face the pacers who looks like it mom. Obviously that would be an unacceptable series loss was a fun. I'm not crazy about the match up just for example George but. They should be that I should be about forty and forty they should be that is that that would be unacceptable they lose to vote to vote. Pictures of all he did this year this is a better mess Alia be so they can't lose that then you would face most likely either Toronto or Washington if they stayed in QC com. And then they could lose one of those series you'd avoid Washington at things shook shook out the way they share if everybody one that was at the top foresees one. Toronto will play Cleveland in Washington were played the Celtics I think that's what both Boston and Cleveland. I don't know of Cleveland who want that. Know probably so because Washington seems to be a bad matchup for them or at least they haven't played well against Washington this year but how's that again we saw. What happened this week when the Celtics kind of dished. Pulled their drug out and put it on your forehead and said you really figure out our level. You're not on a level. And it was really in there was really. If it it was encapsulated in about one minute a basketball where LeBron James went down the lane. And dunked over the entire Celtics team and then sprinted the other end of the floor and swatted markets smarts layup attempt. With two hands went into the stands it was that being with all of the Celtics fans in in the stance. That that was kind of encapsulated right there wasn't great sequence that was not a good look for the Celtics at all. So we'll see if you know for a minute there everybody get excited that they were vying for the ones he wouldn't really make any they're gonna do you mood they're gonna contend with yeah Cleveland. It's just a long series and nom you know LeBron James made those comments earlier in the week. And nobody wanted to hear him talk like that it was kind of unbecoming of him but is due chic I agree with everything set and this man has been to the finals for. Six straight years or whatever it's bad. These games. Just don't matter and they matter to teams like the Celtics but to hit and you know what he did he say you know what are 55. Everyone. I'll I'll you know embrace this game. And I will be coming gates and he did and look what happened yet you know they and he said okay we wanna make it a game day. They these games mean something when they want them to mean something when that team wanted that went like they said okay Celtics are making a big deal out of it we're going to just go out there and do we do we're gonna player get more or show home. Well playoff basketball is going to be all about if date basis in the conference finals. I'm not even sure that this Celtics and again this is developing opinion but I'm ready meat should this Celtics team is better than that 0102 team the one that loss of the nets in the Eastern Conference finals. There's Antoine Walker knew it and maybe not because view up Paul Pierce and Amare did write a month and although others said they were better I don't known now. Not that it really that he I'm just thinking about team wasn't there it it was Pearson it was walker and it was nobody else. It was a great roster not related to Walter McCarty yeah but it would it was a great roster but having Paul Pierce there I mean. Real quick before we go to break Russell Westbrook MVP. Did it shouldn't even be questioned it shouldn't when it really shouldn't be MB. One of two players in NBA history to do that and I think there was an article that was written by as Kennedy was Chris Forsberg or somebody wrote wrote about Westbrook and I'll find the article I actually printed it in. He. He he accomplished this in ten less minutes per game then Oscar Robertson that. So you know eight in a lot of is a lot of issuable bubbles were done by. The fourth quarter there was like four from that were done by halftime so he had completed the feat of getting a triple double within the course of the game. Early on in these games so wasn't something that was hanging over the team or something that the team may have been not focusing on the trying to get endure. To that triple double yeah in the fourth quarter and the real thing about it's in our in the fourth quarter way more efficient. Way more efficient. And his production is off the charts compared James Harden and I know they don't have the best team but did the six seat currently in a difficult Western Conference he has in the playoffs without without him they're not there at the top of the lottery or near or not maybe not top water but the certainly not a death let us know what to their in the lottery and he hasn't in the playoffs right now. That combined with the triple double record forget it I Jim Hardy in nice player James. Now I'm not going there and Russell Westbrook is the MVP are we get accurate market Jason shell. I've another Celtics dot plus we're gonna talk about a few other things leading up to Jayme Murphy and twenty when it's a masters partners well this the mark and Jason show one of two point seven WER. When a playoff series and we'll talk until I wanna do when a playoff series and so. I'm stuck I'm stuck in the way of sticking with that I I don't think they're any better in Washington Toronto. And they do have a rebound weakness that we known for you know jump street that hasn't been rectified. Sells a lot like Gil. Bob Bryan Smart guy and her comment there on the bus rarely great hall of fame writer very bright individual act agrees you're here's. What I think the Celtics are kept. You remember in college you'd go to a party sometimes or did you show up toward disaster because show but party in this guy brings this really smoking hot girl. And the girls at the party and throughout the party she's kind of doing her wrong thing the guys doing his staying stuck in his buddies she's talking to people she's talking to this one guy this one guy won't stop talking indoor you know she's engaging him he's having a good time he's overzealous he's excited she stock enemy attack. But at the end of the night. You know we should go on and not back that that guy the overzealous exciting guy that's the Celtics that it's nice to girls talking to him during the party. But at the end of the night gives him a little bit of any goes right in the next I feel good about yourself even an exciting goes out and fines for you know meets ago bar because he's a little bit more confident from talk of rigor it demanded that I you know. Who she's going homeless and it's not you know. The cavs are taking the girl home and I think that's kind of what was on display last week. Especially that we should after all the build up and LeBron making those comments kind of re engaging himself in the rivalry air quotes. And they went out to get to the Celtics and I think that's what we'll see in a class Jewish we're gonna get to the red sex here in just a minute give thought to wrap up the Celtics. Oh. My favorite my favorite thing about the Celtics the way Al Horford is playing. There's really really well here we go really good basketball for 3030 million dollars by the late great basketball. 80211 games that you say like. Pipe dreams of all played street at the Celtics make it to the conference finals right they play they play the cavaliers while. In eleven games vs Cleveland out or for its teens are all in the let it. All in eleven. And Al Horford the Max contract thirty million dollar player does all the great things I you don't if you don't you don't understand basketball if you don't she how goody is what he can watch out what he does story on the fourth value sets screens like you read about the unbelievable I do the same screen it's like art it's like watching Picasso on before when the guys at the screen it's amazing yeah ten and a half points a game. Four point four rebounds per game and 2.3 assists per game shooting 51% from four only took a hundred shots averaging about eleven shots attend eleven shots a game. Or excuse me a little bit under ten shots a game and it's my favorite one he is a minus. 139. When he is on the floor vs the cavaliers. They got that's right close Izzy dizzy refinements there's I did it myself it's called research mark catcher tries its antibody. It's I mean it just kind of hammers home the point to me what that guy is an end this delusional thought. Of what type of play you were getting a Max money. I never said that the guy's not a good player I think he is and I understand what he does well on the floor and how he spaces the floor for Isaiah. But he's not particularly athletic yep he's thirty years old he is not a great defenders not a terrible defender not a great defender. He's shooting from outside is fine OK he's not a good rebounder. There is a lot of things about him that. Are negative in the sense that I'm not paying that guy thirty million dollars in sorry I'm not there is no higher level than a Max contract player and that's what you get that's at that the money he got. And he's just not that type of player. 417371287. Is the phone number give his collar texted 37937. You said it's the pipe dream of ultimate pipe dreams are something you did I I wouldn't go that far those being you know oh is overstating handled yeah just to get to I mean if you wanna talk about winning the championship we could say it happened. Just getting to the Eastern Conference finals. When I go that far. I'm okay. So I'm going to switch gears real quick as the Boston Red Sox started their season they were to an all too good games at Fenway Park then they go on the road. And the thing that a lot of us were worried about. The open and I proved a lot of people right within the way the bullpen performed especially in that third game first game in Detroit on Friday. You know I'm not gonna panic it's not time to do anything like that obviously but. This is the Boston Red Sox right now we were worried about the bullpen and now the bullpen in a situation where they need to come through couldn't that's you know if it looks like a duck and quacks like a dot. Guess what. And that was situation gathered that Darian there really struggling with. Not having not haven't spent there and I haven't or break okay it's not like they're like hi I think it Thornburgh reserve it would help a little bit but that still be a lot of moving pieces going around in the bullpen I want you to explain to me I keep hearing about while they're not analysts admit they don't have Thornburgh. How good are these guys I mean are these guys really is that it amazing Smith Harrison Smith Smith was a very very top of. He was the top of that probably type of bullpen guy when he was healthy okay Seattle are biased in it's out but he was he was really really good his yeah I hope your right. I ice keeps see hear about these guys Smith Barney in the you haven't seen him yet account yeah haven't seen him yet our and he certainly need to help right now they have a AAA bullpen in the getting Tripoli results yeah yep and you know their day don't have an eighth inning guy because hitting middle relief that you sets seven dating guys questionable we're you gonna bring in it's going to be in certain situations and back and fortune edged. The way it's going to be and this is something that Dombrowski is had a track record of I mean the reason. The overriding thought in Detroit is why that team who was super talented in the rotation. In their lineup was it was unbelievable why they couldn't win a World Series is because they're ball it was awful. The open was terrible that was built by Dombrowski and he has a track record. Of not being able to put together a bullpen in that can cost teams championships in critical moments is you need your bullpen to step up. And they bend they've been terrible you know the one guy that you can look at and say OK maybe this guy's carved out a role from self when everybody's healthy is patella. He's a pretty good for them so far. He's been pretty but that's about it yeah Joseph Kelly can't find strikes on every time the guy throws a fastball gets wallop or he walks guys. Agreed to tell it to get runners and Keith Embry. Okay he's okay but he has his control issues you know who else do you turn to. Robbie Scott. Really young guy I mean in and that was one of the problems I had nineteen Friday well you know that if Detroit's gonna bring up if there's a lefty coming up to the plate that. Detroit in your gonna bring out Robbie Scott the face and you know Detroit's gonna count or bring upper right so what did you sleep every and they are the face a guy because every has better stuff the Robby Scott. But he's got a soft toss starring lefty specialist. That. Is lucky to get a guy out lucky. He's not a great reliever now you know I like the guy with the stuff over the guy. Over over the over the lefty specialist because you're lefty specialist is that good you know it's even more frustrating about this whole situation I don't think there's anything that I can't stand more than. Sox bullpen talk. And I just think Eric. But the bullpen is bad you have to address sin. The bullpen you know the just as a really light my fire often but what I mean look you don't mean it doesn't get it like it's just. The bullpen you can talk about sexy pitchers back there and flatter than like talking a bottom get used to it I don't it's a long season my friend long season but. You know you can talk about the offense. Bogart's not be in there again that's not be there again yeah and Haley not being there while the float. So we've all had the flu Dave O'Brien left the game yesterday with a glorious feeling ill and that's too bad you don't like to see that these guys are sick. Hanley. Even make the trip Detroit needing to make the trip bu Q was feeling ill. I don't know he was available to pit. It's just unbelievable I mean they've had an unbelievable spring in terms of health right I mean this team. Pretty banged up pretty unhealthy. Considering they were. Training and usually doesn't get better as the season goes on all easily there tomorrow more more guys that are gonna suffer injuries. Throughout the course of the seas I am glad though. I was not with you when Chris Sale pitch the other Nikes he was good he was good and I do not want to see whatever you were doing by yourself at home wife and we know how much you love him you probably sweating. You know some tissue and heavy padding he had this that I didn't not interested in now but he did pitch very well he's awesome ya and I'm really like he was electric yeah I mean you watch him pitch in. And end. You see why the excitement level is there for a guy like that. And in the U you hope that it's got to stabilize. Stabilize your rotation for at least the time being and maybe maybe. Kinda get a little bit of a competition going you thought it lottery does he look good for the first cup few innings and then he exploded on Saturday. You know couldn't find the sharks are out just had a bad ending in the fifth inning when it wasn't able to make it out that through. Through you know 41%. Of his eighty pitches were were were strikes that's that's that's pretty terrible had trouble finding strikes on the whole game but. The one shining the one not shining light put the one. The one nice thing about the season so far was set up. Gossip as advertised fantastic. Was a fishing that's big and in the guy pitches so. That I expect that pay that pace of that game was you know had they been able to win that came in in nine innings that was gonna be on pace like a two and a half hour game. And he's not dealing with the flu which is nice when she pitch again. He is young he's going to be picked on guy and he's going to be pitching mound tomorrow because Parcells on right. Okay so we did see him again com. And yeah reports cell was what I needed him to be. Efficient. Good you it would it would eat you after it was that you an arm he wasn't great he was okay here's our he wasn't getting a lot of run support early in the game they had away it was until the fifth inning when the Red Sox were able to he was going toe to toe there. For most of the game so that's good to seek is it taking get that out of him and sale a sale. They'll be in a good spot yep you know just get over this flu get this flu lot of my face because I you know you don't have time for this kind of thing Baltimore looks good in the Yankees. They have been disappointing. Yet while they they're going to be I mean they're going to be an up and our team until they figure out what the rotations going to be like in their offense is gonna struggle at times because. It's an extremely young team and until you get some. Some stability in the lineup in the rotation I think that's what's that's what they're going to be. I mean once once Hanley and Bogart's and vets are all back then you can. You know watch a team fur for a week or so orange is starts have a feel for what the offense is going to be capable adorned. Because right now the only. Really reliable that's that you're having here in the in your lineup are bent and the US gotten off to a great start he had that home run in the first game which fantastic. In Saint Paul Sandoval had a good start to the year you know which is nice is she's well yes. It's big opposite field homer on three run home run on Friday thing was to give the Red Sox lead that they couldn't hold on to take one thing that drives me nuts. This whole thing about Craig Kimbrel. And not being able to pitch in anything but he save a clean inning safe situation. Is so soft it is wet toilet paper. I cannot stand it. It drives me crazy. John Farrell saying after the game ball you know it's not who will eventually it may be in a situation where it's not a savory as you get more than three outs but not in game three. The fact that this guy needs so much time to figure out a way to deal with those situations and he's useless in them. Is so disgusting and so mentally weak in my mind I can't stand it hate it. Yeah he's Andy but you know Ben go look at his numbers in the eighth inning when he's had. Hard not save situations and he's not good now. Not good at all and there's no reason for denying it's correct so light that at some point you're going to need you're gonna need you're gonna need your closer to be able to give you more than three outs is just gonna happen the threat and if you can't lie especially when your middle relief. Los. You might need that closer to come in their now it's early. But I just don't like how we sit well you know we're gonna work we're gonna wipe his ass harder and then we'll eventually will will get to the Puerto Rico white pumps off. I now. Why can he be prepared to do that I I just hate the whole situation and I think that you know honestly. Outside of like guys like Marriott Mariano Rivera. And there there a lot of a lot of closers have that and that issue whatever whatever it is it's got to be some sort of mental block. When there is nothing in you know that Karrie is in dangling robbers shot and now that issue and they won the World Series while he's different. I'm saying guys like humor different there are you know he's a different breed. Erica you know I I I and I we go I want whatsoever I throws hard Kimble look I we're all part he's got a close I would put him in his category. He's just a very he's a higher level closer than then I think Craig Kimbrel composing good close habit is not eased out of level overall the Chapman. I would have put him in that category there is something. Is it is a mental thing with these guys were they can't seem to be able to figure out that Obama on the game's tied we still needs to pitch well. And it it's especially bad with Campbell it was awful last year. In non save situation is terrible. And you know if you can't rely on him for that. At certain points of the season and that's going to be a problem you your eighth inning guy who ever the hell it's going to be but to be lights out. If you can't rely on him in the eighth inning of game relying Campbell the common answer. Situations and a bit attendee three for fifteen or homer and three RBIs follow cent of all three for twelve homer and four RBIs. I mean a home run is nice each had three run home runs those are big hits arm. So yeah I'm optimistic about those guys is a big X factors coming into the season. And they really could use their back considering Ortiz isn't there and when you have some bullpen issues you you need guys to step up and those guys. Three for fifteen isn't great but let's give him a little time. Big home run up side I'll take. Yeah and didn't and I honestly think that he's better than I think people thought he was going to be coming out. Is that a lot of people said he was a plus plus average hitter and a guy with a little bit of power he may have more power then people originally gave him credit for. To whatever offseason. Program that he went to in the to get a little bit bigger and added forty pounds of muscle you can tell Arianna you got a little bit bigger. So you know that shouldn't you said he said it shouldn't affect his swing at all. That the balls are just gonna fly further than it did last year which is great I love the attitude I think he needs somebody like that baseball. No you don't have enough of those you know those hockey at its price hopper and who else in baseball in its ice hockey. A is pretty docket real yeah. Good fine yeah he needed he needs it has no slack good little felt a little bit attitude for the steam correct you know because I don't think you have that I think that's a boat writes nice kids great players. Great players that they don't have like. That personality that Ortiz that. That kind of Drury incident team. A case of the Red Sox are trying to figure out a way to get off this year neither on little two game losing streak. But they do give the ball to report sell both Cy Young winner last year so. A very dismissive and not enough he's EU will see if he can keep it going tiger he won the Cy Young good first start with sleeping keep it going. That's what you have these pitchers for. When you're losing two games in a row when things aren't going well you put. I on the mound and he turns it around so he had him yet sale. And should be of that Colorado X games with those guys those guys pitching absolutely are we get back you're in the market Jason show. More from the Red Sox and I have a thought on the patriots that I wanna get to some rumors regarding the patriots Robert how ski a few things there. 417371287. Is the phone number this is the mark in Jason she'll. Jason show on sports Radio One 03 point seven WEEI. Looks remarked on Twitter at mark dent aero. Follow Jason on Twitter at G terra bella WEEI. I welcome back to mark and Jason Joseph you know it's frustrating and maybe this symptom network we're kind of Greg are you a little bit but when I feel like we're having better conversations during the breaks and on the air. You just tell me about your desires impassioned to go play soccer in Europe I was a kid. I was a kid. Hey hey I mean if you're that good at soccer I was an idiot like yourself playing soccer and pleading you're simple answer on the dominance. That's why. It made out it and it over there sign up pretty loud K anyway speaking of Europe to Europeans atop the masters leaderboard. And you asked me was that you really funny we can consider that the senate this sit out on US revote is gonna walk that fast as it was Venus might asset. I yes I'll what I'll watch the message today it's food one in my Super Bowls of the year. This this leaderboard here. Just. So juicy. I love it. We have we want to win that I want to opt. And that's exactly right before the tournament began who I want to win. Was somebody that I had heard of I did not want a well known name winning this tournament Trevor Immelman or Danny Willett I do not want that I like when that happens. Outside of a guy whose when he or 21 but young young young you know not winning that's different I haven't heard of him. But I wanna see god and I know win. And right now I'm in position that to happen Sergio Justin did the final pairing followed by Ricky follow work. And speak. Towards speed will be in the final so I wanna see one of those four preferably went if I had a root for somebody every roofer Rickie Fowler. I think Debbie good for golf that he could win masters. Mom never won a major won the players championship a few years ago never won a masters and one major even put pretty good golf yeah correct over the past about you last year yet rue really good year and he's got to continue that continuing that and this year. The course is just immaculate as we know now based on what I've heard it's funny I lived in Georgia around the course. I think five minutes away there's a Wal-Mart. I mean it's not everything it saw it looks like right around Augusta Georgia not exactly not exactly Blake kind of tells the story is yeah it's it's different situation. So she'll economically buffalo house I don't I'm not looking outside the gates I'm looking at TV event off how those places it is thus are you kidding me you still live in Waffle House when I was in Georgia and Mississippi we have a ring Columbus but anyway. I'm excited about this leaderboard Sergio Garcia is never won a major. We know but the history of that guy he chokes every time so I can't wait to see how they'll choke if he'll choke given the do it a say if he'll choke even though I think there's a chance something about how I OP wins in excel I like we might see and that I wouldn't mind seeing them. I think I like him I've always liked him I was like the way he plays I I think he's of these good for the game. And in finally getting over the hall opened in winning a big would be huge for Justin Rose is nails Rory McIlroy. Lurking could you say he's working he's even par. He has a big I mean rose yesterday and in the third round was. Five under which he could put around our that are like so so for McIlroy to be really considered in the hunt I think he'd have to get. The three under by the mid point of his round and hope that the other guys are shoot par right. Yeah I'm. And the just just to be consider any needs far away but it's not something that's. Are you seeing guys who forged Qaeda throw up all of a two was a Jordan's beat a couple of years ago in the twelfth hole judge threw up all over himself and really kind of gave away the lead is so radical or do it it's eleven it's possible but I mean it's a big it's a big ask for back got to really get back into the are speaking about a big ask. The final round the final pairing rose Garcia Europeans Britain for them follower speak Americans. All what I love to see some kind of a Ryder Cup feel to Sunday at the mass with a tight kind of gone back and forth well the history even from the crowd now the match yes too classy for that that's what I mean but this is what golf needs it doesn't need people calling in. An error or are a violation all those people are those people who have been there the war sacks and I mean golf in that regard in America is gonna get into Alexis Thompson thing we talked during NASA's. Last week but. Golf in that regard he said doubt the NFL's mentality once the the next plays run whatever happened is over. What's the next shot is he's hit. It doesn't matter what up repeating such great then. There's enough time in between shots is a lot of into your rules that Stupak roll it hurts the game that that don't need to be in there and I think two people are too nice to each other and golf. When she should imagine she's an attitude welcome rivalries or I wanna see somebody. You're somebody you're the golf guy what's the what's the tournament in Phoenix where the crowd and I love that they don't Waste Management open I think yes they and they just it the eighteenth hole there are crowded around everybody and they're going nuts when when somebody's you know hits a good shot and there really engaged and in in the about the whole week we asked them that crowds like really not a you know they'd they'd. Course Drake and have a good time and enjoy themselves but they also aren't invested in the tournament and and show the support of the you know you can tell what a guy it's a good shot. On you know the seventeenth. If you're over at the eighteenth op on the greens and that those fans are into when you need a little bit more that. I'm all for sportsmanship but you need a little more edged we don't have time to get into this now but if you meet Karen you know what I would do with golf which you do. And there's there's weather involved I understand. Com. I think I wish you could be eighteen sport. I wish there were teams I think that would add to that I think that would. Pars banned them goes okay like like I'm like what if they have like which they got lake not only an individual championship at the end of the Arab alike. Point total for the Europeans in the Americans that they tallied up. For however those not either way I played a decent day you can make the PGA to war. And I decision doesn't have a ton of thought to it but if you could make the PGA tour and American League where it was. Cities had golf teams and the match the majors remain individual events now and the rest of the time. It was a team sport did you figure this at lake Ariel pointed out earlier change and I heard that I had a good thing. There if you could make it also each city was represented by a group of golfers I just feel like more cities who become involved every weekend. And you have almost maybe like a football kind of I don't know I too wish it to its it's a long. That the Darrell Korea. I put more into income measure it you should put up a little bit at the end of that but I'm. Don't really care about these these these you know he's mid level tournaments in the middle of the summer there may be if there's a team. I don't know it is something more in any amaze those individuals some of the more on the linemen then though I guess I disseminate data that would make the FedEx cup playoffs a little more into staying you know if if Jordan speed. Was playing for Boston that would make him more relevant in certain cities where Jersey. Now I'm just saying you play for the city and you represent the city not in a height do home games. Or let's. I don't think I'm a big thinker and you know it's our shot tech market. Is slightly higher up put together business plan presented. I don't think I mean it he's got to be away you brought that the shark tank they'd they'd give you thumbs down you've got that you begin a hard Nolan now one. Listen I'm this and is a I want I think there's ways for golf listen to I had more icy slope and it's been a long week you've had very little sleep there is tired. Okay we gotta yeah we excuse you for this week thank you walk. But yeah as far as the masses goes he should be a great finish with big names and that's what I'm looking for. From a tournament of this stature so we'll see Rory get an eagle on the first hole and then there Yeltsin. I don't know I -- to really kind of get get the crowd even mourn in the only bad part about that it it's just frustrating when a guy has come from that far behind in the he's done yeah still early yet and is waiting for the other people. You like for hit bad whatever our anchor find a way to play itself back towards the top of the leaderboard I don't care when he finishes just get up there like I said and mean if he has a good first. First first nine holes and he gets that three or four under ya. I mean then you got you got not morals are really to really get back into it and to be in contention for the sake I'll be honest that he no surprise me and maybe I just missed it. I can't believe that I haven't seen one thing from Tony Romo. At this golf tournament I got with a big signing yes as well yes with Manson and add CBS they were gonna we'll roll him out there. They haven't to a couple hits put among them. I don't know on the eighteenth hole I concede anything unless I missed it. But Tony Romo did it surprise you that he retired by the way. A little bit because I thought there you know he is here yeah I I think that the doctors told him that if he takes another hit. That it could be some serious problems for his back in the you know in the near future I think that's maybe but you know if he comes back. You rule out that he comes back. I'm not I mean it's it's it's just an odds I always comes back during the game get to call and during the game there's an awkward situation where he's talking about maybe having to be most pleased that you might not go black and not during that game and saying like hey next week. You know laugh at age I don't know Houston Lou you loses savage or or whatever else causes of his bill Sams I don't know if that could happen but I would love to see that meets these and that's all I'm saying it mid season. Can you imagine mid season something came up where he got a chance to send the blue CBS be pets I don't know why they put him in the number one Booth. I armaments battle like that I write up I Aaron I was really I'm really don't like that I mean give it to somebody that's earned it. You know I understand he's a quarterback he probably understands the game are pretty you know much better than. All of us do were talking about it sure but you know. I wrote I would think that you would want given opportunity is somebody that maybe is are there are on their role who may be but. Maybe you know get a little bit more high winds blew Troy Aikman spent some time doing NFL Europe games or something like yeah I mean you work anyway he wasn't the number one guy when he got immediately to foxy was number we was doing the best in rec games right away and he's awesome. Ending Collins were at they think are really good people. Collins worth because he's honest RB you know thirty you know there's thirty teams in the league that it. Thirty teams fans that hate and because he's honest about what he sees on the field in the same thing with same thing with Dayton. Are we get back some patriots stock we'll stick with football is the mark and Jason show won a three point seven WEEI.

Mexico’s cross-border plants in the border with the United States where on their golden age, until the uncertainty of the Free Trade Agreements and tax reforms proposed by US’ republicans became a cloud on their horizon. Published: 18:24 April 9, 2017 Jumana Al Tamimi, Associate Editor   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: US President Donald Trump has promised to fix what he described as the previous administrations’ messes, including renegotiating NAFTA, the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. His repeated statements raised questions over whether Washington’s position could actually annul existing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and over the legality of the expected protectionists’ American measures. While trade experts criticised the positions taken by President Trump, they offered different scenarios of what could actually happen. “I don’t see anti-FTA sentiment as global — it is really only Trump’s declaration that protection is good and the US trade deals need to be renegotiated,” said Richard Baldwin, a veteran Trade expert and Professor of International Economics at the Graduate Institute, Geneva. He pointed out to Gulf News that even the UK, which left the biggest FTAs, EU, actually wants to sign new deals. In addition, there is “some acceleration” between non-US nations, including EU, Japan and Canada, Other experts offered similar views, and expressed doubts that any of the “existing agreements will be terminated … but they may be modified in a less liberal direction,” according to Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a Washington-based expert with a long standing experience on international trade, and a coauthor of several books on the subject. Protectionists measures Amid all this debate and arguments, one agreement is expected to be re-discussed and possibly renegotiated: the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed more than 30 years ago with both the northern and southern neighbours of the US. The focus is on the southern neighbour. Introducing protectionists measures, trade experts said, would set the global liberalisation efforts back. “In my opinion, Trump’s rhetoric has truly dampened international willingness to move forward on a liberalisation agenda,” Hufbauer told Gulf News. Responding to a question on the impact of the expected American protectionism policy, Hufbauer said most of the countries took a position on the opposite side. “Many countries in Asia and Latin America [Pacific Alliance], as well as the EU, and President Xi of China, have said all sorts of good things about globalisation in response to Trump, and have talked about fresh policy liberalisation. So far, it’s talk, not action,” said Hufbauer, who is currently Reginald Jones Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in 1998. Moreover, protectionism, experts stressed, constitutes a violation of international trade rules and laws. “The measures threatened by [President] Trump violate the WTO and existing US FTAs, which are all part of international law. The US has bound its tariffs at very low levels, and promised national treatment for imports from other countries. These commitments have all been questioned by [president] Trump,” said Hufbauer. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to make “America First”, “make America great again”, and to bring back and create jobs for Americans. However, trade experts say achieving these goals would not be through revoking existing trade agreements with other countries. Instead, there is a need to adapt local labour markets to global trade changes, they said. Adjust certain elements “In our view the US could be as much a loser as a winner from the taking down of trade deals,” said Dubai-based Gary Dugan, Chief Investment Officer, at the Wealth Management at Emirates NBD. “Bottom line we expect the vast majority of trade deals to remain in place but President Trump may wish to adapt and adjust certain elements of some trade deals to fulfil his promise to put the US first and to protect some US jobs from what he may see as unfair competition. But to be clear, the reason that US jobs were lost to overseas manufacturers was because the US was an expensive place to manufacture that particular product,” Dugan said. In order to bring jobs back to the US, American workers have two options, either to accept a lower pay to produce a competitive product, or American consumers have to accept a higher price for products produced on American soil, rather than abroad with lower cost of labour. “Protectionism is per se bad for world trade. However, there are different forms of protectionism,” said Dugan. “Protectionism where poorly performing industries hide from global competition benefits no one. Protectionism where a country tries to build a strategic industry that it could in the long term have a competitive advantage in is understandable.” At the same time, the US complains about losses from trade agreements with other countries is not only limited to the US, as there “are always tensions” between countries over trade and “ongoing arguments” as whether treaties are far or not to the signing parties, trade experts said. In particular, “international treaties are by their very nature are not fair to all sides. They are a compromise,” said Dugan. Losses to Mexico According to a draft memo prepared by Stephen Vaughn, Acting US Trade Representative addressing the US congress, which was leaked to the press recently, the US is going to ask Mexico to open its market “a lot, while the US don’t do much,” as one of the experts put it. Mexico, according to earlier press reports, has also suffered some losses because of its free trade agreement with its northern neighbour. Many unskilled Mexican labourers lost their source for bread and butter after the subsided American products reached Mexico and were sold at cheaper prices than local Mexican products. As a result, unskilled labourers lost their jobs and ended up migrating to the US illegally looking for jobs, according to press reports. In addition, when the Big American companies, such as Walmart, entered Mexico, they ended the small Mexican enterprises who were offering similar products. Many believe NAFTA was concluded mainly because of political reasons, with the aim of winning Mexico on the American side, rather than other emerging powers, according to press reports. Daily trade figure On the other hand, the Mexican government said it is committed to preserving NAFTA and to protect the bilateral daily trade between the two countries estimated at $1.4 billion (Dh5.14 billion). Mexico said it is open to modifications. However, it made it clear that any renegotiations of the deal should also include border security and immigration. Mexican officials and business leaders have also said that if negotiations go downhill, they are prepared to walk away from NAFTA, said a New York Times report. If it happens, renegotiating NAFTA is not expected to be swift. President “Trump has talked about renegotiating them, but that takes a long time and Congressional approval — all of which means that the FTAs in force will probably remain in force for another year or two at a minimum,” Baldwin said. “My guess is that the Trump administration will get bogged down in renegotiating NAFTA especially once the US Congress starts to get involved,” he continued.   More from Economy Ecuador has emerged from recession, Correa says CII Business Confidence index hits record high Non-oil firms bring 69.5% of Abu Dhabi’s GDP London finance chief upbeat after Brexit trigger Economic reports sets confident tone for week US puts world liberalisation efforts on hold ECB’s Mersch urges ‘orderly’ policy exit talks Mexico sees swift Nafta rewrite tags from this storyDonald Trump follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNJapan follow this tag on MGNUnited Kingdom follow this tag on MGNCanada follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessEconomy tagsDonald Trump follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGNJapan follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In EconomyEcuador has emerged from recession, Correa says Business Gallery Pictures: Gitex Shopper Spring 2017 Manufacturing is order of the day Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries 01UAE salary guide 2015: Are you getting enough? 02Non-oil firms bring 69.5% of Abu Dhabi’s GDP 03London finance chief upbeat after Brexit trigger Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 11Images Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Mar 21, 2017 1Image Pictures: Nokia 3310 comes back to life at MWC Feb 27, 2017 36Images Robots, apps and 3D printing at Gitex Oct 22, 2015 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Isra'a Wal Miraj holiday announced in UAE Anchor reads news of husband’s death 2017 UAE holidays Tough times ahead for Karama’s strip mall Massage card barrage frustrates residents Emirati girl, 5, killed in Dubai fire Man jailed for forcing woman into sexual act Indian man killed in US gun attack Officer asks Modi, Hasina to 'step down' Close Recommended For You Russian techie 'held over US election virus'PUBLISHED ON Apr 10, 2017 US ramps up pressure on RussiansPUBLISHED ON Apr 10, 2017 Career: 5 interview questions to not answerPUBLISHED ON Apr 10, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Solis) (Newser) – A bag of salad mix went a little heavier on the "mix" than the "salad," reports CNN. Two people in Florida are now being treated for rabies exposure after finding a dead bat in a bag of Fresh Express Organic Marketside Spring Mix. Just in case you were considering ever eating anything ever again, the CDC has this little piece of reassurance: "The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies." Their risk of contracting rabies is low, but not zero, the CDC says. Fresh Express has since recalled salads sold in Walmarts in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   9% Hilarious 1% Intriguing 6% Depressing 1% Brilliant 75% Scary 8% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 21 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 21 comments lilycat Apr 9, 2017 7:59 PM CDT Ewww!!

A trio of assets that swooned after Donald Trump’s surprise election on speculation that he’d rush to reorder global trade have since snapped back as the administration’s talk softened. Those trades -- in the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking Chinese assets, the Mexican peso, and U.S. retail stocks -- could reverse again as Donald Trump sits down with Xi Jinping. “The probability of U.S. protectionism is rising,” said Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB economist Andreas Johnson in a note to clients Thursday. “The risk of a decline in support among Trump’s core voters following his failure to make good on election promises creates an incentive to launch trade measures against China, possibly in 2018, ahead of midterm elections in early November.” Read More: China Market Access in Spotlight as First Trump-Xi Meeting Nears China ETF Rising Despite Trump’s rhetoric that China manipulates its currency and benefits from unfair trade, U.S. investors haven’t soured on assets from the world’s second-largest economy. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF tumbled almost 10 percent in the six weeks following the election before surging 14 percent as of 2:43 p.m. in New York. Worst to First The Mexican peso’s borne the brunt of angst that a Trump win would damage trade policy. The currency weakened nearly 20 percent from the election to the day before the inauguration. It has since appreciated by almost 15 percent as talk of a hefty tariff turned into measured discussions about renegotiating the Nafta trade agreement.  While Mexico may not come up in Trump’s discussions with Xi, China has moved to tighten its ties to Mexico in recent years. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in March the “real” negotiations to revamp Nafta won’t happen until later this year. Import Tax Trump’s efforts to reinvigorate American manufacturing, presumably at the expense of China, have included talk that Congress might push for a border adjustment tax. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in mid-February that U.S. retailers have the “most to lose.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other businesses that rely on overseas manufacturing, including in China, have opposed the idea. The sector’s been rising since Trump’s election on speculation lower taxes will encourage consumers to step up discretionary spending.

(KFSN) KFSN By Corin Hoggard Saturday, April 08, 2017 08:38PM FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- Easter came eight days early for some Fresno kids who might not otherwise be able to celebrate the holiday. When Matthew Cromer and his two boys walked into Catholic Charities for the first time, it wasn't for a photo opp with the Easter bunny. The guys were really in distress, but not for long. "We felt very comfortable," Cromer said. "We didn't feel like they looked down at us at all." Four months later, Cromer and the kids joined the festivities as Easter arrived for about 150 kids and their families. Games like the cake walk led right to more serious food on the way out the door, all courtesy of Catholic Charities and a group of volunteers from San Joaquin Memorial - the Junior Ministers of Presence. "They're from low-income families who don't have much so we just try to give them a good experience to really have fun," SJM freshman Tess Solomon said. "We give them toys and we also do arts and crafts, like painting on their face," sophomore Reed Walker said. "It's so important because we get to give back to children in our community and see the children's smiles on their faces when they come," student Francesca Wood said. And volunteers could paint a smile on their faces too. They also delivered Easter baskets that can change people's outlook on the upcoming holiday. "It means a lot," Mikah Broom said. "My kids, it's been a rough month, so it's nice to see that my kids are going to have something to open on Easter." Of course, Easter celebrates a rebirth, and in Cromer's case, there's no better place for that than Catholic Charities. On that first visit in December, he'd just gotten custody but he had nothing. The volunteers didn't stop at feeding the three of them. One woman, he calls an angel, left and came back with a big Walmart gift card he used to buy toothbrushes, clothes, and even car seats. "It blew my mind," Cromer said. "Sometimes you can get in a rut of thinking the world is lost, everybody is all about themselves. You walk into a place like this and you get your doors blown off." And through that door, Cromer marked his rebirth as a parent. Related Topics: sportssocietyfresnocharityFresno Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 KFSN-TV. All Rights Reserved.)

Joining them for the presentation was Penny Stumpf, health promotion and wellness manager. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Just because you're on a tight budget doesn't mean you can't have healthy meals. Jessa Hatch, public information officer, Kathy Anderson, community health navigator, and Penny Stumpf, health promotion and wellness manager, with the Northeast Colorado Health Department, gave a presentation on "Cooking on a Dime" at Sterling Public Library's It's Not Rocket Science program last week. Hatch and Anderson made up a batch of chili for the event because, they said, it's easy, you can feed a lot of people with it, it's cheap and it's healthy. "What I love about chili is you can add everything to it, and everyone makes it differently, and everyone has different sides," Hatch said. Jessa Hatch, public information officer for Northeast Colorado Health Department, holds up a bag filled with ingredients to make a cheap meal as guests at the department's "Cooking on a Dime" presentation try to guess how much the meal costs to make. The winner got to take home the bag of ingredients to make the meal for themselves. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Ingredients used in the chili included: One can of corn, one can of black beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of chili beans, one can of tomato sauce, one can of chili-ready tomatoes, one onion, one pound of beef and one package of chili seasoning. Total cost of the meal, which serves six to eight, was $11.17, about $1.86 per person for six servings. "You can't really go anywhere and get cheaper than that and the really nice thing, like Jessa said, is you have control of what you're putting in it," Anderson said. If you're trying to stretch your chili and make it go farther, or make it healthier for children who don't like to eat vegetables, Anderson recommended adding corn, celery, zucchini, diced peppers, etc. Advertisement Hatch recommended when shopping for canned foods, look for no salt added or lower sodium, because it's much healthier. Also, always look at the unit price on canned food, because while two cans of beans, for example, might be the same size, they are often different prices and if you're looking at a bigger versus smaller can, while the bigger can might seem like the better deal that's not always the case. They used a package of chili seasoning for the chili they made, because it was less supplies to bring with them, but Anderson encouraged people to buy bottles of individual spices and not the seasoning packets, because while you may have to pay a little bit more up front for the individual spices, they will last a whole year, so you will be able to use it for more than one meal, ultimately saving money. Plus, Hatch noted, a lot of times the seasoning packets have a lot of salt and added sodium. Additionally, Hatch recommended buying fruits and vegetables when they're in season, because prices tend to rise when they're not in season. Anderson talked about the benefit of making a meal at home versus eating out, because it's usually cheaper. If you buy a hamburger at a restaurant, for example, it will only feed one person, but if you buy one pound of ground beef at the store you can easily make four quarter pound hamburgers. You can also buy larger packages of beef and freeze all of it or part of it, to make it last longer. The U.S. Department of Agriculture offers several nutrition assistance resources such as MyPlate, Community Corner, Recipe Finder, and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). A USDA information sheet that was shared at the program, offers a number of tips for saving money when shopping for groceries. First, look at your resources. Know how much money you have to spend on food; make a shopping list based on the money you have; buy only the amounts of fresh foods you can use before it spoils; and consider frozen or shelf stable items that last longer. Before going to the grocery store, check what foods you already have. Once that's done, ask yourself: What meals and recipes can I make using the foods I have? Can I mix foods together to make a tasty and nutritious meal? Which foods do my family need for good health? Then, plan what recipes you will make using your list of foods and use other foods on your list, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains to complete the menu. Once you plan your menus, make a new list for missing foods you need to buy. Don't go shopping when you are hungry, so it's easier to stick to your shopping list. To get a good deal, you can use bargain saving apps such as Savings Catcher, a Wal-Mart app, or ibotta; use couponing apps and websites, such as bargainrate.blogspot.com; turn your receipt into cash with apps such as receipthog.com; or search newspapers and other places for local deals. Also, Anderson mentioned if you have a coupon for something and the store is out, ask for a rain check. "There are lots of good ways to save money if you're willing to look around," Hatch said. The next "It's Not Rocket Science" program, Tuesday, April 25, will be on cake decorating.
