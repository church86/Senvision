Skip to content People Pets Dogs Cats Adoption Funny Videos Celeb Pets Pets Impatient Dogs Drive Car into Walmart While Waiting for Owner to Finish Shopping By Kelli Bender•@kbendernyc Updated August 2, 2016 at 3:18pm EST Share Tweet Email Two dogs itching to get a good deal crashed their owner’s car into a Walmart in Wayne, West Virginia, on Friday. According to WSAZ-TV, shoppers who witnessed the scene said one of the pups was at the wheel of the vehicle, the other in the passenger’s seat, when it slowly careened into the wall of the store. No people or pooches were injured in this incident pulled straight from the funny papers. Surveillance video of the accident shows the automobile crawling across the lot, attracting several concerned citizens and then finally bumping into the front of the store. One of the dogs reportedly rolled down a window following the slow-motion crash. The elderly owner of the daring dogs says she left her car running in the parking lot, with the A/C on, so the canines could stay cool while she went into Walmart for a quick shopping trip. She figures one of the pups managed to get the car out of park, allowing the duo to slowly steer into the Walmart. The car and Walmart only received minimal damage. The owner of the dogs was able to drive everyone home after the incident. This is a reminder that while you should never leave your pets in a parked, hot car with the A/C off, it is also not the best idea to leave them in the car with the A/C running. To prevent any problems, try to only bring your pets on errands where they can accompany you.

For shoppers on Iowa sales tax holiday, ‘every little bit helps’ By Paige Yowell / World-Herald staff writer Paige Yowell Aug 6, 2016 (…) REBECCA S.

GRATZ/THE WORLD-HERALD Signs remind shoppers about the tax holiday at J.C. Penney in Council Bluffs. REBECCA S. GRATZ/THE WORLD-HERALD Lynne Pedersen of Bellevue helps her daughter, Lillian, 3, try on shoes alongside her son, Samuel, 2, at Walmart in Council Bluffs on Friday. REBECCA S. GRATZ/THE WORLD-HERALD Shawna Reed of Omaha scans the T-shirts while shopping for her three sons at J.C. Penney in Council Bluffs on Friday. Konni Lorenzo wrangled her five kids, ages 11 through 3, and headed out Friday morning for what might seem like a monumental task: back-to-school shopping. But when she got to the Lake Manawa-area Walmart store in Council Bluffs she was met with a pleasant surprise: Friday kicked off Iowa’s annual two-day sales tax holiday, when clothing, shoes and other items priced less than $100 are not charged sales tax. “Now I just want to buy everything,” Lorenzo said, pushing Zion, 3, and Sanett, 5, in the cart. The Council Bluffs mom was specifically on the hunt for clothes for Sanett, who is heading into first grade at the end of the month. Lorenzo expected to save about $15 in sales tax alone at Walmart. “It’s better than nothing when you have five kids,” she said. That was the sentiment among most parents shopping Friday. While the sales tax savings might not amount to much — about $7 for every $100 spent — they say it’s worth it when you’re stocking up on back-to-school clothing this time of year. Joanne Farmer of Glenwood, Iowa, takes advantage of the holiday every year to shop for new clothes for her three kids, ages 10, 5 and 4. “I don’t expect to save a lot, but I just look at it as ‘Hey, every little bit counts,’ ” she said. Farmer planned to purchase shoes for the kids from the J.C. Penney store at The Marketplace, plus one new outfit each, and school supplies. (The Iowa tax holiday includes only clothing and shoes; school supplies such as pencils, notebooks and backpacks are excluded from the tax break.) Many Nebraskans cross the river to cash in on the savings. The Nebraska Department of Revenue said Nebraskans still owe sales tax during tax season on the goods they purchase in Iowa but use in Omaha. People who buy items tax-free in other states are supposed to list those items and pay sales tax come tax time on their Nebraska taxes. Nebraska does not have a sales tax holiday. Lawmakers have considered it in the past. For Lynne Pedersen of Bellevue, the Lake Manawa-area Walmart is closer than many stores in Omaha, anyway, she said. She was busy picking out a pair of shoes for 3-year-old Lillian, who is starting prekindergarten this fall. Stacey Anderson of Omaha said any savings will help. She lost her job in June and has four grandkids to care for, ranging in age from 12 to 7. She expected to save at least $50 from the tax-free holiday. “This is definitely worth it, especially with my circumstance, losing my income,” Anderson said. Store managers in Council Bluffs said the weekend is second in store foot traffic only to the hectic Black Friday weekend after Thanksgiving. At the Lake Manawa-area Walmart, tax-free weekend is the biggest weekend for apparel sales, Co-Manager Nels Nelson said. “We’re probably five times busier than we would be at this time on a normal day,” he said Friday morning. Business typically peaks Friday evening, when people are off work, and Saturday. The Marketplace J.C. Penney even had shoppers waiting outside, Black Friday-style, before opening at 10 a.m. Friday, Store Manager Anita Hart said. But just as with Black Friday, the weekend doesn’t necessarily result in more total sales for retailers. “It shifts the business, is really what it does,” Hart said. Many critics of the holidays agree. Most stores staff up on registers and sales floor workers. At J.C. Penney, employees are treated to free lunch. “We try to make it as easy as possible for them,” Hart said. Austin Meston, manager of the Target store in the Metro Crossing shopping center in Council Bluffs, said for busy weekends, including this one, managers and employees bring in food for everyone. “We’ve got a bunch of home-baked treats this weekend, and a bunch of pizza we’ve brought in,” Meston said. The store also livens things up with sales competitions among employees. Meston said traffic was about three times what it would be on a normal Friday, but he said he wouldn’t know how the weekend fared compared with past years until the end of the day today. The two-day holiday lasts through today.

Link to photo of Day Two leader John Cox Link to HD video of Cox's weighing in his leading limit on Day Two After the last fish had been brought to the scale, John Cox of DeBary, Florida, extended his Day One lead Friday by weighing in a five-bass limit totaling 15 pounds, 10 ounces. Cox's two-day total of 10 bass weighing 32-5 gives him a 6-pound, 7-ounce lead heading into Day Three, with Jacob Wheeler of Indianapolis, Indiana, in second place with 10 bass weighing 25-14. "Today was pretty good for me," said Cox, who has already earned more than $144,000 this season in FLW competition. "I caught seven keepers out of the same hole that I was in yesterday. I went past where I stopped yesterday – I hit a couple of logs running in and a couple of logs running out – and I thought it was going to be better, but the fish that I thought were in the back were making their way out." Although he was not ready to get specific, Cox said that he caught his fish Friday on two different baits – a topwater and a plastic worm. He said that he planned to start tomorrow in the same location, but wouldn't hesitate to change things up if he has to. "Things are going pretty good right now, but you never know what's going to happen and things could change tomorrow," he said. "I've only fished that one spot so far. I've got a backup spot, but I'm going to wait and see. It's similar, but it's a different tributary and I'd rather not use it right now if I don't have to. "I'm really looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow," Cox continued. "We're on the Tennessee River and there are a lot of big fish in this place. I'm going back to the same spot tomorrow and we'll see what happens. I think that if I can catch 15 (pounds) tomorrow and 10 (pounds) the last day, it ought to be enough to get it done."

No one was charged in the incident but an investigation is still open. John Crawford’s family says no one is being held accountable in their son’s death and it’s been two years. One of the biggest pieces they’ve been waiting for is the Department of Justice investigation. Thomas Hagel, Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Dayton says, “I think it’s absolutely inexcusable that after two years they can’t come out with some findings.” Two years have passed and still not a word from the department of justice on their independent review of the John Crawford case. It all started when he made a trip to Walmart in Beavercreek. As seen on security footage, he takes a call and starts walking around the store, picking up a fake bb gun from one of the shelves. Someone sees him and calls 911 assuming it’s a real gun. Police respond. Officer Sean William’s and Sgt. David Darkow find Crawford. According to police reports, the officers confronted him, demanding he drop his weapon. Seconds later, he was shot by Williams. Both officers saying he did not obey their commands. It was later discovered it was a BB gun. The incident brought national attention to the Miami Valley town with protesters saying officers didn’t give Crawford time to react and they didn’t need to shoot him. A grand jury declined to bring any charges but the Department of Justice said they would look into the incident. That was in September of 2014 and we haven’t heard from them since. “I can’t imagine why it’s taken over two years for the Justice Department of the United States with all their resources to not be able to come up with some type of resolution,” says Hagel. UD Law Professor, Thomas Hagel says this should have been a straightforward case. There’s video and not that many witnesses. He can see how the delay is frustrating those in the community. “There’s members in this community where they think there are conspiracies or whatever and all this does by the delays just feeds this.” 2 NEWS Investigates found the DOJ has opened and closed similar cases such as with Michael Brown. He was fatally shot by an officer in Ferguson Missouri after Crawford was shot. Hagel says the amount of recent incidents involving black men and police officers could play into the delay. When asked why he thought it was taking so long, Hagel said, “the tone of the country in the sense of the anger that’s out there toward the system and the lack of unity among various groups I think that would feed into this thing.” 2 NEWS Investigates contacted the Department of Justice to see where the investigation stands and what is the hold-up. We were told they can’t comment on ongoing investigations. We checked and found both officers involved in the shooting at the Walmart still work for the Beavercreek Police Department. Officer Williams who fired that fatal shot is still on administration duty pending the outcome of this DOJ investigation. Hagel says he hopes there’s a decision soon to give some closure to the community. “Regardless of what the resolution is there’s going to be people who will disagree with it for various reasons but at least there will be a resolution and you can move on past that.” 2 NEWS Investigates’ Natalie Tendall did request an interview with the Beavercreek Police Chief but he denied it at this time because their department is still in a civil lawsuit with Crawford’s family. She was told that the Beavercreek Police department has recently been re-accredited which means they’ve had to re-examine all aspects of their agency including use of force and training of personnel.

Ala., Aug. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Fifty of the best professional bass anglers in the world continued their four-day competition for the top cash award of $300,000 at the Forrest Wood Cup presented by Walmart, the world championship of bass fishing, at Wheeler Lake in Huntsville, Alabama, on Friday. Link to photo of Day Two leader John Cox Link to HD video of Cox's weighing in his leading limit on Day Two After the last fish had been brought to the scale, John Cox of DeBary, Florida, extended his Day One lead Friday by weighing in a five-bass limit totaling 15 pounds, 10 ounces. Cox's two-day total of 10 bass weighing 32-5 gives him a 6-pound, 7-ounce lead heading into Day Three, with Jacob Wheeler of Indianapolis, Indiana, in second place with 10 bass weighing 25-14. "Today was pretty good for me," said Cox, who has already earned more than $144,000 this season in FLW competition. "I caught seven keepers out of the same hole that I was in yesterday. I went past where I stopped yesterday – I hit a couple of logs running in and a couple of logs running out – and I thought it was going to be better, but the fish that I thought were in the back were making their way out." Although he was not ready to get specific, Cox said that he caught his fish Friday on two different baits – a topwater and a plastic worm. He said that he planned to start tomorrow in the same location, but wouldn't hesitate to change things up if he has to. "Things are going pretty good right now, but you never know what's going to happen and things could change tomorrow," he said. "I've only fished that one spot so far. I've got a backup spot, but I'm going to wait and see. It's similar, but it's a different tributary and I'd rather not use it right now if I don't have to. "I'm really looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow," Cox continued. "We're on the Tennessee River and there are a lot of big fish in this place. I'm going back to the same spot tomorrow and we'll see what happens. I think that if I can catch 15 (pounds) tomorrow and 10 (pounds) the last day, it ought to be enough to get it done." The top 20 pros that will continue to Saturday's competition on Wheeler Lake are:                 1st:           John Cox, Debary, Fla., 10 bass, 32-5                 2nd:          Jacob Wheeler, Indianapolis, Ind., 10 bass, 25-14                 3rd:          Michael Neal, Dayton, Tenn., 10 bass, 25-14                 4th:           Darrel Robertson, Jay, Okla., 10 bass, 25-3                 5th:           Todd Auten, Lake Wylie, S.C., nine bass, 25-2                 6th:           Bryan Thrift, Shelby, N.C., 10 bass, 24-10                 7th:           Walmart pro Mark Rose, West Memphis, Ark., 10 bass, 24-4                 8th:           Bill Chapman, Salt Rock, W.

Tetrick had impressed leading Silicon Valley venture capital firms by getting his eggless Just Mayo product into Walmart, Kroger, Safeway and other top supermarkets within about three years. What Tetrick and his team neglected to mention is that the startup undertook a large-scale operation to buy back its own spread, which made the product appear more popular than it really was. At least eight months before the funding round closed, Hampton Creek executives quietly began a campaign to purchase mass quantities of Just Mayo from stores, according to five former workers and more than 250 receipts, expense reports, cash advances and emails reviewed by Bloomberg. In addition to buying up hundreds of jars across the country, contractors were told to call store managers pretending they were customers and ask about Just Mayo. Strong demand typically prompts retailers to order more and stock a product in additional stores. Expense reports reviewed by Bloomberg show contractors bought back jars of Just Mayo from Safeway stores. Former workers say Hampton Creek also purchased its own products at Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Target and Whole Foods locations across the country. While a November 2014 email from the corporate partnerships team said the company would stop store buyouts, three former contractors who worked for the company in 2015 say the practice continued, and directions were given verbally. “We need you in Safeway buying Just Mayo and our new flavored mayos,” Caroline Love, the San Francisco company’s then director of corporate partnership, wrote in an April 2014 email to contract workers known as Creekers. “And we’re going to pay you for this exciting new project! Below is the list of stores that have been assigned to you.” Love’s memo also referenced a key competitor: “The most important next step with Safeway is huge sales out of the gate. This will ensure we stay on the shelf to put an end to Hellmann’s factory-farmed egg mayo, and spread the word to customers that Just Mayo is their new preferred brand. :)” CEO Tetrick said the primary purpose of the purchases was to check the quality of the spread. “Because of this, we now understand the impact of trucking and shipping our product and enabled the system we have today that mitigates the risk of extreme temperatures,” Tetrick wrote in an email. “Assessing the product from the customer perspective, more than anything, gets us out of the bubble of typical manufacturing. This was and always will be the primary purpose of it, which is why we’ll continue doing it.” Melanie Myers, an executive who worked in the company’s corporate partnerships team, said in a statement that the program was primarily for quality-control purposes but “we also thought it might give us a little momentum out of the gate.” Tetrick said the program has cost about $77,000, representing less than 0.12 percent of the company’s sales. Tetrick provided 15 emails to contractors referencing quality-control assignments. He also presented a database showing surveys that Creekers were asked to fill out after going to stores, checking jars for misaligned labels, breakage or ingredient separation, which he said occurred when early versions of the jars were exposed to extreme temperatures in transit. The workers were sometimes instructed to purchase substandard merchandise and send it to headquarters, he said. However, the survey database — containing almost 3,900 entries in 15 states from March 2014 to January 2015 — didn’t account for hundreds of Just Mayo purchases by Creekers during that period, according to emails, receipts and expense report records seen by Bloomberg. Five former Hampton Creek contractors and two ex-senior staff members said the buyback assignments were separate from quality checks at stores. The ex-contractors said that in most cases, they were told to simply buy jars at nearby stores and were free to consume or discard them — not look for quality issues, as the company says. “It is highly questionable for a company to purchase its own goods,” said David Larcker, a professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Revenue is an important number for evaluating growing companies, but the companies need to be transparent about the source of that revenue. They also need to be transparent about their growth. If the sales are not generated from legitimate customers, that needs to be disclosed and is important information for investors to evaluate.” Hampton Creek’s approach to quality control is also unusual. Companies typically ensure the quality of products before they leave the factory, said Kurt Jetta, who runs a retail and consumer data company called Tabs Analytics. If they do find issues in stores, food makers usually don’t buy the products. Instead, they give the retailer a credit. “There’s no legitimate explanation for a manufacturer buying significant quantities of their own product from the shelf,” Jetta said. Founded in 2011, Hampton Creek marketed itself as a food technology company that ferrets out new plant proteins and uses them to reformulate everyday grocery items like mayonnaise and cookie dough. Tetrick, now 36, approached Silicon Valley investors vowing to disrupt the food industry and won over such leading VC firms as Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures. Today, Hampton Creek says its backers include several billionaires, such as Hong Kong’s Li Ka-shing and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang. Despite criticism from other investors who say the company is less an innovator than a deftly run marketing machine, Hampton Creek has raised $120 million and turned Just Mayo into a cherished brand among sustainably minded consumers. Thousands of new packaged food items are introduced each year in the United States, and a majority of them fail. For a young company, it’s critical to perform in a test market, with those results used by retailers to justify increasing distribution, said Jim Hertel, a grocery industry analyst at Inmar’s Willard Bishop. Sales from a major retailer can also be used as part of the pitch to investors. “If you’re an early-stage company, there’s a lot of pressure to demonstrate results,” Hertel said. In-store marketing is a crucial way for a young company to build a brand and boost sales. Hampton Creek held Just Mayo tastings and other demonstrations in supermarkets around the country. Wearing the required uniform of a black hat and T-shirt with the startup’s three-leaf logo, the Creekers were supposed to persuade shoppers to try the product and then to buy a jar. In 2014, the job changed, according to five former Creekers who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. The company began asking them not simply to promote Just Mayo but to start buying it as well — an initiative the company dubbed “Special Project” or “Buyouts,” they said. Love, who has since been promoted to Hampton Creek’s vice president of mission, suggested ways that Creekers could do this most effectively in an April 2014 email to a contractor. “I might go through the self-checkout lanes, or make several transactions going to different cashiers each time to avoid questions like, ‘Why are you buying so much mayo?!’” Love wrote. “Make sure you are not wearing your HC gear when you go into Safeway. This is an undercover project.” In interviews last week at the San Francisco headquarters, executives emphasized that quality control was the main goal of the buyback program. “These folks did an awesome job for us, primarily in helping us improve our quality,” Love said in a statement provided by Hampton Creek. “They were our eyes and ears on the ground. I’m proud of what we did and how we continue to do it.” One former contractor assigned to buy Hampton Creek products provided receipts showing purchases of more than 140 jars of Just Mayo in a day. Another contractor described buying at least 20 jars per store and said Hampton Creek gave workers directions to visit more than a dozen stores in less than a week. Ex-Creekers say they were told to do whatever they wanted with the product after finishing the job. Some donated the supply to food shelters or handed them out to friends and family, but most say they threw it in the trash. Emails from Love show the buybacks took place in the Mid-Atlantic, Southwest and Pacific regions. The five former Creekers say they happened all over the country. Hampton Creek also paid contractors to pretend they were customers and call store managers of Whole Foods, Safeway and Kroger locations to stoke demand, according to emails reviewed by Bloomberg. “You will be calling Whole Foods Market locations as a customer to create buzz and increase demand for Just Mayo flavors and Just Cookie Dough in these stores, putting pressure on the Regional Buyer,” says a March 2015 correspondence signed by Myers of Hampton Creek’s corporate partnerships team. Emails from Myers list about 100 store locations for each contractor to call in places such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Texas. The emails also directed contractors to conceal their identities and fib if questioned on the calls. “Remember, you are calling as a customer,” says an email addressed to a contractor and signed by Myers, whose title now is Ingredient Sourcer. “The conversation should go something like this: Hi, I’m doing some catering and I’m looking to pick up this new mayonnaise. I think it’s called Just Mayo ...” In another script, contractors were told to say, “Hi! I’m hoping you can help me out. I’m planning a Back to School event and I’m looking to pick up this new mayonnaise. I think it’s called Just Mayo ...” Two ex-contractors for Hampton Creek, who sued their former employer in February seeking unpaid wages, reference an assignment to “buy out shelves” of the company’s products in a lawsuit filed in a federal district court in New York. The suit also says Hampton Creek failed to provide them with detailed documentation of their compensation and work-related expenses for tax-reporting purposes as required by state law. In an email, Tetrick said that team of contractors helped improve quality control and “gave us a push when we landed in our first conventional account, which is why all of us will always be proud of their work. A handful of folks don’t represent the views of everyone.” In at least some cases, Hampton Creek lumped in expenses related to buying its own products with wages paid to contractors, according to five former workers. All five said money that they were given to buy jars of Just Mayo were treated as taxable income, making them liable for a higher tax bill than their actual earnings would require. One former contractor provided H&R Block tax records showing this to be the case. Another Creeker asked the company in an email to separate the expenses from taxable income. But the request was ignored, the contractor said. Hampton Creek declined to comment about the alleged practice. “Treating reimbursement of business expenses creates a compliance burden to the contracted employee,” says Joseph Carcello, a University of Tennessee professor who sits on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s investor advisory committee. “There’s no way this reimbursement approach is in the best interest of the contractor, and there are limitations to what the contractor can deduct.” Two former senior staff members who worked closely with Tetrick in 2014 and 2015 say the Hampton Creek CEO initiated the buyouts partly to make sales look better to potential investors. One said Tetrick didn’t disclose the practice to would-be backers during fundraising pitches in 2014. Fundraising pitches reviewed by Bloomberg do not reference the buyouts. “We always comply with our disclosure obligations to prospective investors,” Tetrick said in an email. This year, Hampton Creek was looking to raise additional funds to help pay for an ambitious vision that imagined as many as 560 new plant-based products, which could include vegan “oysters,” “blue cheese” and an egg-substitute product it calls “Just Patty,” according to an investor presentation reviewed by Bloomberg. The company is still trying to close the round and is seeking investors in Asia, according to two people familiar with the matter. Olivia Zaleski is a Bloomberg writer.

Traditional items such as shirts, pants, skirts, sweaters, dresses and shoes are included, but so are disposable diapers, formal wear and wedding apparel. Visit www.tax.ohio.gov for a complete list. • The exemption only applies to items selling for $75 or less. If an item of clothing sells for more than $75, the tax is due on the entire selling price. In addition, retailers cannot split items that are normally sold together in order to fall under the sales price threshold. . • School supplies are defined and include items such as crayons, notebooks, binders, book bags, calculators, composition and spiral notebooks, etc. Visit www.tax.ohio.gov for a complete list. • If a retailer offers a discount to reduce the price of an eligible item to $20 or less (applies to school supplies) or $75 or less (applies to clothing), the item will qualify for the exemption. This applies to all discounts even if a retailer’s coupon or loyalty card is required to secure the discount. Source: Ohio Department of Taxation Shoppers flocked to local retailers during the first day of the sales tax holiday weekend, and store managers are expecting crowds to grow throughout the next two days. Ohio’s sales tax holiday, which started Friday and ends at midnight Sunday, offers sales tax exemptions on certain items. The deal includes clothing priced up to $75 and school supplies and instruction materials priced under $20. At the Walmart Supercenter located at 8800 Kingsridge Drive, customers crowded aisles of back-to-school items. Workers said they expected business to a get more “hectic” in the evening and throughout the weekend. Stephanie Watson, a resident of West Carrollton, said she plans on going to multiple stores during the weekend. At Walmart, consumers filled their carts with glue sticks, folders, crayons and themed backpacks. “You can barely get through the aisles with all the people and their carts,” she said. Ashley Phillips, store manager of the Kingsridge Walmart, told the Dayton Daily News that the weekend is really about providing relief to parents who have increased expenses as the academic year starts. The National Retail Federation estimates the average family will spend $674 per household on back-to-school supplies, up from last year’s $630. Candace Jones of West Carrollton said she waited to go shopping for her children’s clothing until the sales tax holiday. She filled her cart with clothing for her daughter and son at the Kohl’s at Austin Landing. “It’ll save a fair amount of money, probably $60 in taxes,” she said. “I think it’d be great if it was every year, especially for people in need with more kids than me.” Several retailers offered additional deals to bring customers in. Cincinnati-based grocery retailer Kroger announced all Marketplace stores would provide additional discounts on apparel on top of the tax-free benefits. The store offered a 15-percent-off coupon and customers can earn four times the fuel points for gas when they purchase gifts cards at Kroger. Kohl’s also promoted the tax-free weekend, touting its inventory of exclusive brands for school fashion. Kristina Herwald of Springboro browsed the children’s clothing section in Kohl’s on Friday morning. Herwald recently moved from Lexington, Ky., and said this was her first time participating in a sales tax weekend. “I don’t know how much we’ll save, but I was disappointed I already bought school supplies,” she said. “We’ll head to Dayton Mall for clothes and some things needed for school.” The sales tax holiday is currently a one-time event. The Ohio bill creating the holiday is only for 2016. State Rep. Niraj Antani told the Dayton Daily News that legislators will try to pass a deal next year to make it a reoccurring, permanent tax break. “School starts earlier,” said Shelley Glueckert of Miamisburg, who went shopping at Austin Landing on Friday. “It’s the perfect timing.” View Comments 0 Most Read Health Inspections: China Garden Buffet Newborn baby gets first shampoo video | Dayton Ohio flatpage-for-wraps Things To Do Add Event + See More Weather and Traffic 40 45403 17 Most Read Health Inspections: China Garden Buffet Newborn baby gets first shampoo video | Dayton Ohio flatpage-for-wraps Things To Do Add Event + See More More from daytondailynews.com Topics News  Sports Business Community Life  Entertainment Englewood Englewood Holiday Open House scheduled Crime Rally’s customer, employee jailed after assault in Dayton Sports Miami basking in glow of historic turnaround Local Middletown woman finds $1,400 inside $2 purchase at estate sale News Fire contained to wall at Red Lobster in Butler Twp.

Walmart Customers Report Barrage Of Password Reset Requests Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Customers Report Barrage Of Password Reset Requests Image courtesy of Patrick August 5, 2016 12:55 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler what's with the emails? walmart email password reset security retail breach hack attack Getting an email from a retailer telling you to reset your password because you may have been the victim of a data breach is alarming enough. Imagine you’re one of the Walmart.com shoppers who say they have received dozens of emails directing them to reset their login credentials. BGR reports that Walmart.com customers began sharing news of the emails on social media on Thursday. While Walmart has yet to confirm that it is the latest victim of a hack attack or that it is aware of the potential phishing attempt, the customers concerned that the emails are a phishing attempt say they appear to be from a legitimate Walmart.com address. Unlike traditional phishing scams, the emails don’t take users to an external link to reset their password, but instead mimic the email one would receive when they simply forgot their password. This was an unsolicited email from @Walmart. Change your passwords people. There may have been a system breach. 😬😠 pic.twitter.com/bUaDWf5Ugt — Amelia Parrish (@abparrish083) August 4, 2016 “Please enter the following verification code on our website, and you’ll be able to rest your password. If you didn’t request a password change, please visit out Help Center. Please do not reply to this email. This mailbox is unmonitored.” It’s unclear how a scam would work using this type of email, BGR reports, but it appears the number of times someone can request a reset password is unlimited. One user posted on Twitter that he had received more than 1,000 reset emails from Walmart.com. @leolaporte I was sent 1,088 password reset emails from @walmart in 1hr😦 pic.twitter.com/UUDGDrUAtn — Josh Oakes (@JoshOakes) August 4, 2016 @walmart I am getting constant emails from you about verification codes to reset my password.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Watch out for a Walmart phishing scam, coming soon Chris Mills BGR NewsAugust 5, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Over the past couple of days, Walmart users have been seeing unsolicited password recovery emails pop up in their inboxes. There's clearly something fishy going on, but it doesn't seem to be a simple hack: it's likely the precursor to an ambitious phishing attack on Walmart.com users. Speaking to BGR, a Walmart spokesperson confirmed that there's an increase in password recovery emails, but doesn't think that any accounts have been compromised -- yet. Instead, Walmart thinks that a hacker is using Walmart's password recovery system to prepare for a future phishing attack. DON'T MISS: The only bad cell company is Sprint Walmart's password recovery system is like most others: input an email address, and it sends a recovery code to that email address. But unlike some others, Walmart's system confirms or denies whether there's a Walmart.com account associated with that email. "The hackers are likely using the system to validate emails, confirm whether they have a Walmart account," a spokesperson said. "They are probably preparing for a future phishing attack." Once the hacker has verified that an email address does have a Walmart account, they can create an email purporting to be from Walmart, telling the user to click on a link and log in with their ID. If they do that, the hacker will have captured their username and password, and be able to access the Walmart account. Dimitri Sirota, CEO of data security firm BigID, agrees with that theory. "Phishing attacks are very successful, since people are so inured to the possibility of being breached." Using the password recovery system to validate emails is a common technique, either to prepare for a phishing attack, or to verify the validity of data dumps bought on the Dark Web. Seeing the groundwork for a phishing attack being laid is worrying, but the steps for customers to remain safe are simple. Sirota says that he "very rarely click on a link in an email" -- you're much better off going to a website directly, and logging in through there. Walmart's spokesperson also emphasized that it's "very unlikely" that any user accounts have been breached so far, and all customers need to do in the future is remain vigilant. If you're particularly concerned, you can change the email address and password associated with your Walmart account.

Sales tax holiday big hit with local shoppers Craig Shoup , Reporter 12:19 p.m. EDT August 5, 2016 Buy Photo Amy Schoch and children Addison and Blake Shoch took advantage of the sales tax-free weekend to pick up school supplies. (Photo: Craig Shoup/The News-Messenger)Buy Photo 28 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE FREMONT - Local families took advantage of a newly renovated Fremont Wal-Mart to save money during the annual Ohio sales-tax holiday. The sale gives shoppers a chance to stock up on school supplies and clothing in preparation for the upcoming school year. Many families, including Amy Schoch and her four children, use the weekend to stockpile notebooks, markers, crayons and uniforms. "It's huge. I look forward to this every year," Shoch said about the sale. "I get a little bit extra during the sale. I am shopping all weekend. I spend hundreds." Shoch said the sale tax holiday allows her to buy an entire year of supplies without having to run back to the store during the school year to buy notebooks. "It's great. I can get it all now, and when we run out during the year, we will have extra," Shoch said. The holiday includes items of clothing that cost $75 or less, school supplies that cost $20 or less, and school instructional materials that cost $20 or less, all normally taxed 7.25 percent in Sandusky County, according to the Ohio Department of Taxation. As shoppers enter the store, school supply lists for area school districts are available, but Shoch said the tax exemption allows her to buy some items not on the list. "It gets as busy as going into Christmas," said Fremont Wal-Mart store manager Robert Hershey. "Yeah, it's only about 7 percent, but if you've got three children, your school supplies, apparel and certain electronics, it adds up. You're saving $20, $30, $40." Buy Photo  (Photo: Craig Shoup/The News-Messenger) The sales tax exemption began Friday morning and will end at 11:59 p.m. Sunday night. For the Fremont Wal-Mart, the statewide sales tax holiday came at the right time, as the company kicked off the sales by unveiling a multi-million dollar remodeling project, featuring bright white lighting, improved scanners and an open floor plan allowing customers to see several departments at once. "The biggest change people will notice is the lighting. It is white, so when someone looks at produce in the light, it won't be a different color when they take it home," Hershey said. The remodel unveiling also gave the store a chance to get community leaders together to dole out more than $4,000 in donations to Fremont City Schools, $1,500; Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library and Museums, $1,500; Bellevue Hospital, $575; and Sandusky County Positive People, $500. "It's the right thing to do," said Hershey. "I've been 10 years now (as manager) and I started here 19 years ago." Buy Photo  (Photo: Craig Shoup/The News-Messenger) After 10 weeks, Wal-Mart staff celebrated the remodel with larger aisles, an expanded waiting area for pharmacy, and new rollback prices. "You used to only be able to get one cart down an aisle, now it's almost 9 feet wide. Opening it up really helps out people," Hershey said. "Everything is easy to see and get a hold of now. It's great for us to spread out." Another upgrade that may go unnoticed by customers is a better scanning system at checkout lines, Hershey said. "People didn't like self check out because the scanner worked 50 percent of the time. Now we have eight and you can even Wal-Mart pay with your phone," Hershey said.

(Photo: BOB BIELK/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)Buy Photo With back-to-school shopping in full swing, Neptune resident Connie Williams is just checking out the sales. Press on Your Side saw her walking through the aisles, near the backpacks, at Walmart in Neptune. "We go around and see what the stores have available," Williams said. Her 14-year-old daughter is getting ready for high school. "Everybody has backpacks, but you find different prices in different places. LIke Walgreens might have one price, Walmart has a variety of prices." Retailers are "extremely aggressive" with sales and promotions, according to a National Retail Federation spokeswoman. They're offering price matches, free shipping and web purchases that can be picked up at the store. (They hope you'll pick up something extra once you're there.)

SCHOOL GRADES: PARCC passing rates rise in every grade, subject Buy Photo  (Photo: BOB BIELK/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) Big spending For stores, there's a lot at stake. The retail federation said families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade plan to spend an average $673.57 on clothes and accessories, electronics, shoes and school supplies, a few dollars more than last year's $630.96. All in, it accounts for $27.3 billion in spending, the NRF's survey states, up 9.6 percent over last year. Shoppers hit the stores for back-to-school shopping early this year. "They are making sure they are getting the best deals available with every single item," NRF spokeswoman Ana Serafin Smith said. Just ask Neptune resident Venneta Phillips. She is seeing sales on stationery, notebooks and pens. "I look for the rollbacks, the 50-percent-offs and stuff like that," she said.

Budget it. Figure out how much you have to spend and use it to "shape your shopping list" so you only buy the items you need, the Better Business Bureau said.  List it. Making a list of what you need, by child, will avoid multiple trips to the store. Shop it. A good bargain hunter looks everywhere. Williams is not tied to any one store. "It's wherever you get the best for your buck," she said. "It's savings." Phillips shops around too. "I go to Kohl's. I go to Target," she said. Don't forget to look for bargains at small stores too. Clip it. Check newspaper circulars, store fliers and websites for coupons that can help you boost your savings. Press on Your Side loves stacking paper coupons with the Internet coupons that are connected to store loyalty cards. If an after-purchase rebate is offered, don't forget to claim it. Reuse it. Younger children in a family might benefit from their older siblings' hand-me-downs. Why buy five new shirts when you can buy three instead? Research it. Check for reviews and opinions while you shop for laptops and other big ticket items, the BBB said. Group it. The BBB suggests that parents join forces and shop in bulk. Good idea! Save it. As always, make sure you save your receipts in case you need to make a return or an exchange. You'll need to take note of a store's return policies. Do you have a consumer problem that needs solving?

The department released surveillance camera photos of the suspect, who was wearing tan shorts and a white T-shirt. The man appears to have a tattoo sleeve on each arm and possibly tattoos on his legs, police said. Anyone seeing the man should use "extreme caution," authorities said. The incident occurred Tuesday at about 11 p.m. at the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 2799 W. Thomas St. The woman got into her vehicle and was preparing to leave when a man approached and prevented her from closing the car door. He put a knife to her chest, police said. A witness confronted the man, who then ran away north toward U.S. 190. The woman was treated at the scene for minor cuts on the leg, authorities said. Police have said they do not know the man's intentions. Anyone with information about the incident was asked by authorities to call the Police Department's criminal investigations division at 985.277.5740 or the Crime Stoppers of Tangipahoa anonymous tip line at 800.554.5245 (JAIL).

The world's largest retailer has acknowledged in the past that customer service needed to improve as it was hurting sales growth. Wal-Mart is investing $2.7 billion on pay and benefits and has led major retailers in raising minimum wages to $10 per hour. Wal-Mart's new scheduling system could prompt others to follow. REUTERS/Rick Wilking The system, called Customer First Scheduling, was launched in all of Wal-Mart's 650 small-format Neighborhood Markets in the last week of July with plans to eventually roll it out across the entire U.S. store network, although the company gave no timeframe. "If customers are coming in at a different time we have to be there at a different time. We will not last very long if we don't do that," Mark Ibbotson, vice president of central operations, told Reuters. "At the same time ... associates have the option to choose what hours they want and see if they are available," he said. The electronic system can prioritize scheduling for peak shopping hours by taking into account foot traffic and sales data from every department in each store. Staff are then allocated to the remaining shifts in order of importance. Wal-Mart began last year to try and improve customer service with faster checkouts and better-stocked shelves. The new system also aims to give employees more certainty over shifts and should cut down on the need to schedule employees on short notice. Labor activists, unions and politicians have been pushing retailers, including Wal-Mart, to offer workers more predictable hours. The new system allows some workers to have a fixed schedule with the same hours and days for up to six months. Those with unfixed schedules will only be slotted to work when they say they are available and will not be expected to be available on short notice. Currently, Wal-Mart managers allocate hours within the times employees say they are available to work. EARLY PROBLEMS The new system is ostensibly designed to increase workforce retention, but it was not immediately clear how it will affect overtime opportunities, an important component of low-paying retail jobs. Ibbotson declined to comment on whether the system will affect the availability of overtime. Labor groups, which have been calling for change, had mixed reactions to the new system. Our Wal-Mart, a labor group that focuses on representing the retailer's employees, said in a statement that the policy makes some improvements by adding fixed shifts and prioritizing peak hours. But it said the system does not address the problem of inadequate hours. The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which has worked to unionize Wal-Mart employees but does not count any of the company's employees among its members, said in a statement it was not clear whether the changes will make a material difference in the problem of scheduling. Fears of a cut in overtime pay led to worker protests across three cities in China last month when Wal-Mart launched a new but different scheduling system there. Electronic schedules generated by the new U.S. system, which Wal-Mart developed with workforce software company Red Prairie, have thrown up some early problems. "Some days it will schedule one person on the entire front end from 7-11 a.m. and other days it just won't schedule at all until 1 p.m.," said a store worker who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I didn't have a single cashier come in one day until mid-morning," the worker said.

The notice disclosed that the Mobile County Commission will discuss an agreement with Wal-Mart at its June 30 meeting. The notice says the company will construct, equip and operate an “import intermodal facility,” which will serve regional distribution centers with products shipped through the Alabama State Port Authority’s port in Mobile. WKRG reported on Friday the 2.9 million square foot distribution center will be located at the intersection of Interstate 10 and McDonald Road in Irvington. County Commission President Jerry Carl said this afternoon the facility will be Wal-Mart’s third “super regional facility” in the country, bringing 550 jobs to the area as well as additional seasonal jobs. “This is a huge development for Mobile County,” he said. “We competed with dozens of other cities and counties for this, and I feel this is just the start, just the beginning. If you know anything about Wal-Mart, where they go, everybody follows. I can see us becoming a major distribution center for the East Coast.” According to the notice, the county will expend up to $2.3 million for capital expenditures, site acquisition costs, development costs, access and other costs including permitting, design and engineering. Carl said the deal gives “way more bang for the buck” than the county’s investment in luring both ThyssenKrupp (now Outokumpu) and Airbus. “These are great jobs for people in my district,” he said. “It’s not like highly technical jobs, it’s not like assembling an aircraft, but I can get my CDL license and drive a forklift or truck.” Carl said the commission was unanimous in courting the project and agreeing upon the incentive package. The property is owned by the family of Jim Atchison, who historically used it to farm potatoes and corn for the Frito Lay corporation. The notice also says the city of Mobile will expend up to $2.3 million on the project and together, the city and county will advance approximately $741,052 for initial site acquisition costs, which will be reimbursed. Wal-Mart will also receive roughly $7 million in incentives from the state of Alabama, according to news reports.

Miller August 5 Follow @MikeMillerDC Former Portsmouth, Va., police officer Stephen Rankin in court. (WVEC TV via AP, Pool) It was early on the morning of April 22, 2015, when Portsmouth, Va., police officer Stephen Rankin received a call about a suspected shoplifting. Responding to the local Walmart, Rankin spotted a young black man walking through the parking lot. The policeman radioed his dispatcher to say he was approaching. Sixty-two seconds later, after a scuffle, Rankin fatally shot that young black man, 18-year-old William Chapman II, in the chest and face. On Thursday, a jury convicted Rankin of voluntary manslaughter, rejecting his claim that the shooting was justified. The same jury, however, also rejected more serious charges and recommended a sentence of two and a half years for the former officer — a quarter of the punishment requested by prosecutors. “It’s not enough,” Chapman’s mother, Sallie, said of the recommended sentence, according to the Virginian-Pilot. At the time, the killing did not draw the type of national attention seen in other police slayings of black men. Rankin’s trial, however, came on the heels of the fatal police shootings last month of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. Tensions remain high over the issues of race and policing in America. Some African American activists saw the trial as a litmus test for American law enforcement. “The criminal justice system is hell-bent on favoring those in law enforcement,” James Boyd, president of Portsmouth’s NAACP chapter, told the Associated Press before the verdict. “We see these violent injustices happening time and again without any sense of accountability. This trial has implications for every citizen, but specifically for every black American in this country.” Rankin’s attorneys unsuccessfully tried to delay the trial, claiming the ex-cop could not get a fair trial in the current climate. They also said the case should not be judged in the context of police shootings elsewhere in the country. “The factual scenario is so totally different than what has happened in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis and with Michael Brown [in Ferguson, Missouri],” defense attorney James Broccoletti told the AP before the trial. “I don’t think it would matter if this individual were black, red, purple or orange. It was the conduct of the person that generated the response.” Friends of William L. Chapman II hold hands and form a circle during a May 1, 2015, candlelight vigil in the parking lot of Wal-Mart in Portsmouth, Va., where Chapman was shot by Portsmouth policeman Stephen Rankin. (Bill Tiernan/The Virginian-Pilot via AP) Adding to the trial’s intrigue was the fact that Rankin had fatally shot an unarmed white man in 2011. Judge Johnny Morrison did not allow prosecutors to tell the jury about the previous shooting, however. Instead, the four days of testimony focused on those 62 seconds last spring. [North Miami police shoot black man with his hands up as he tries to help autistic patient] The incident began when employees at a Walmart in Portsmouth, a majority black city of 100,000 near Norfolk, called 911 at around 7:30 a.m. to report a shoplifter. According to Rankin’s court testimony, the officer approached Chapman and said, “I suppose you know why I’m here.” The teenager walked away briskly and put his left hand in his pocket, Rankin testified. “I think he’s reaching for something and I need to detain him,” he said on the stand, according to the Guardian. When Rankin put Chapman on the hood of his patrol car, however, the teenager allegedly tried to get away. “Take your hand out of your pocket or I’m going to tase you,” Rankin recalled telling Chapman. “You’re going to tase me when I didn’t do nothing to you?” Chapman replied, according to video footage from Rankin’s Taser that was played in court.

The two scuffled, and Rankin’s Taser was knocked to the ground. Rankin said he pulled his pistol and aimed it at Chapman, who was roughly six feet away from him in the parking lot. According to the officer, he ordered Chapman onto the ground but the teen instead taunted him, saying “Shoot me.” Chapman then “came towards me aggressively,” Rankin claimed. “I thought he was coming to kill me,” he testified, according to the Guardian. The officer opened fire, striking the teen in his chest and face. Some witnesses supported Rankin’s version of events, while others contradicted it. “He was throwing fists like he was street fighting,” Paul Akey, a crane operator working nearby that morning, said of Chapman, according to the Guardian. “I saw the officer draw his weapon and the man was just throwing his arms up like he wanted to fight,” testified Steve Price, another construction worker. “He threw his jacket off and he proceeded to the officer kind of aggressively like he wasn’t done fighting.” The two construction workers, both white, also said Chapman “charged” the cop. A black witness described the altercation differently, however. [Racism? By whom? This video of Texas cops stopping a black professor is a racial ‘Rorschach test’] Gregory Provo, a Walmart security officer, testified that Chapman never charged. Instead, he made a “gesture” or “jab-step” towards Rankin, as if to make him flinch, Provo said. Whatever happened, it resulted in Rankin firing twice at the teenager. “This is my second one,” the officer said after the shooting, a witness testified. It was an apparent reference to the last time Rankin killed someone. In 2011, the officer shot and killed Kirill Denyakin. The 26-year-old hotel cook had been loudly banging on an apartment door where he had been staying with friends. After someone called 911, Rankin arrived and confronted Denyakin.

The officer said he was afraid the cook was reaching for a weapon. Rankin shot him 11 times. A grand jury declined to indict the officer, however. Denyakin’s family sued Rankin for $22 million but another jury also sided with the cop. The officer and his attorneys made similar arguments in court earlier this week. ““I thought he was coming to kill me,” Rankin testified, according to the Norfolk Virginia-Pilot. “I felt I needed to save my life,” Rankin testified, adding that he didn’t want to hurt Chapman and that he tried to save the teen by performing CPR after the shooting. “He didn’t have a choice. He didn’t have an option. He didn’t have anything else left to do,” his lead attorney, James Broccoletti said during closing arguments Tuesday, according to the Guardian. “It’s easy for us to ‘Monday morning quarterback’. It’s easy for us to look back with 20/20 hindsight and say ‘shoulda, woulda, coulda’.” Stephen Rankin stands between two Portsmouth Sheriff’s Deputies Friday, July 29, 2016 as they wait for members of the jury to look over the scene in the corner of a Walmart parking lot in Portsmouth, Va., where William Chapman II was shot and killed by Rankin last year. (Bill Tiernan/The Virginian-Pilot via AP) Prosecutors, however, asked why Rankin, a Navy veteran with martial arts skills and a two-inch advantage on Chapman, would feel so threatened by the teen. They claimed the cop acted with premeditation after Chapman resisted arrest and defied orders. “The law does not say that because you do not comply, you have to die,” Portsmouth commonwealth attorney Stephanie Morales said during her own closing argument. Chapman, she said, should have “lived to face prosecution.” Rankin “brought a gun to what at worst was a fistfight,” Morales said. Judge Morrison did not allow prosecutors to inform jurors of Rankin’s involvement in the 2011 shooting, however. The judge also did not allow Rankin’s ex-wife to testify that he “fantasized about line-of-duty shootings,” according to assistant commonwealth attorney Brandon Wrobleski. Similarly, Morrison barred Morales from mentioning “mobile messages” that Rankin sent to a police dispatcher less than an hour before shooting Chapman. “I hate this job. The whole world.  The city sucks and so does the rest of the world.  People are just bad,” Rankin said in the messages, which were read during his bond hearing but not at trial. “I think the story was that God would have spared Sodom and Gomorrah if they could have found just 10 decent men….” “An hour before he killed my son, that he hates the world, and he hates the people in it,” Sallie Chapman told WAVY after the bond hearing. “So that means he woke to kill.” Earl Lewis, cousin of William Chapman II, right, gestures during a heated discussion with Bill Garrett with the Chesapeake Citizens Police Academy Alumni Association in front of the Portsmouth Judicial Center Wednesday morning, July 27, 2016, Portsmouth, Va. (Bill Tiernan/The Virginian-Pilot via AP) Even without that information, the jury of seven women and five men — eight black and four white — still heard four days of testimony. Rankin was charged with first-degree murder and using a firearm to commit a felony, but Judge Morrison instructed the jury it could convict him of lesser charges. After 13 hours of deliberation, the jury did just that Thursday, convicting Rankin of voluntary manslaughter. Prosecutors then urged the jury to punish Rankin with “every second and every minute of the 10 years that you are able to give him,” according to the Guardian. Instead, the jury recommended the former cop spend two and a half years behind bars. Rankin might end up receiving even less punishment. Under Virginia law, Judge Morrison may reduce, but not increase, the recommended sentence when Rankin returns to court for formal sentencing on Oct. 12. The manslaughter conviction and recommended sentence was a double blow for Chapman’s family and supporters. Had Rankin been convicted of first-degree murder, he could have received life. Some, however, hailed the conviction as a crucial moment for the Black Lives Matter movement. Rankin is only the 13th officer nationwide to be convicted of murder or manslaughter in a jury trial since 2005, the Virginian-Pilot reported. “We had to start somewhere,” Earl Lewis, a cousin of the victim, told the newspaper. “This was the beginning.”   Read also: ‘I can’t breathe!’: Walmart employees charged with fatally crushing suspected shoplifter Outrage after video captures white Baton Rouge police officer fatally shooting a black man Video: Austin police body-slam black teacher, tell her blacks have ‘violent tendencies’ national morning-mix Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

According to the First Selectman Steve Vavrek, this Walmart would be constructed at 5 Victoria Drive, right off Route 25. He said there are developmental problems and a big one is the timing of many inspections from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). The chairman of Planning and Zoning Department of Monroe, Patrick O’Hara said this project is stalled because it needs a septic system, which is regulated by DEEP and they are waiting for an approval from this agency.     According to the Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT) director of communications Judd Everhart, additional permits are needed before the construction of Walmart can begin. The Office of State Traffic Administration (OSTA) has approved this project regarding traffic on Route 25, even though it has been a problem on this route for a long period of time. The executive director of the DOT’s OSTA, David Sawicki said on December 22, 2015, the traffic administration granted Walmart permission for the project. According to Vavrek, the Metro COG is investigating a plan for extensive lane reconstruction at the intersection of Route 25 and Route 111. First, Walmart must retrieve a certificate from the DOT, Sawicki said. Then, they must either receive a permit of encroachment from the district or a building permit from Monroe. When it comes to obtaining a certificate, Walmart must follow imperative conditions in the OSTA approval. This includes the posting of bonds in the town. They must also follow the process of securing the property for the DOT’s right-of-way, in which Walmart does not control. Sawicki said their files do not reveal the satisfaction of these terms. Also, the district has yet to gain an application for an encroachment permit. Many believe a Walmart in town can be a beneficial feature. “First of all you are talking about jobs, second of all, you’re talking about tax revenues, and developing a site that’s lot has remained vacant as an industrial zone going back to I believe the 1950s,” said O’Hara. However, some feel that small stores still have enough to offer. “Personally, I do as little shopping in a mall or big box stores as I can. We have many great small-to medium-sized ‘mom and pop & family owned’ businesses coming to and expanding in Monroe,” Vavrek said. O’Hara is hopeful for this project. “My viewpoint is once the Walmart goes in, the surrounding lots [around Victoria Drive] will also go in,” he says. “I think we’re going to see some development in Trumbull because we got Walmart coming in.” Related posts: Big box store application: Trumbull drops suit against Monroe Letter: Monroe needs more business Town offices closing early, all meetings canceled Chalk Hill potential home for Probate Court Tags: business, Monroe, Monroe Walmart, News, Walmart Previous Post Police crack down on distracted driving Next Post Library Notes Aug. 5 About author Julie Baumgart Tweet By participating in the comments section of this site you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy and User Agreement Latest Tweets Tweets by @MonroeCourier HAN Network News Sites Live.HAN.Network | Bridgeport News | Darien Times Easton Courier | Fairfield Sun | Greenwich Post Lewisboro Ledger | Milford Mirror | Monroe Courier New Canaan Advertiser | Redding Pilot | Ridgefield Press Shelton Herald | Stratford Star | Trumbull Times Weston Forum | Wilton Bulletin Arts & Leisure Advertise Classifieds Article Reprints Print Archives Subscriptions Privacy Policy & User Agreement Follow us on Twitter Like us on Facebook 100 Things to Do Monroe Answerbook About Us Contact Us Submissions © HAN Network.

A buyout would allow Walmart to further expand its reach beyond its brick-and-mortar retail stores. More importantly, it would bolster the company’s online presence which, by proxy, would put it in a much better position to compete with e-commerce giant Amazon. Unlike other e-commerce outfits, Walmart already has a nationwide network of warehouses in place to service online shoppers. What’s more, the company is well-versed in retail and is among the most well-known brands around. Terms of a potential deal haven’t yet been hammered out although one source claims Jet could be valued at up to $3 billion. If the deal does go through at that valuation, it would represent Walmart’s largest acquisition since paying $2.3 billion for South African retailer Massmart Holdings in 2010. Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Gildenberg said that although Walmart could certainly use some energy with regard to its online efforts, he’s struggling with the math of why they would pay that much for this type of business model at this particular time. Walmart isn’t new to the e-commerce game but its efforts have thus far failed to come close to Amazon’s. Last year, for example, Walmart’s e-commerce division generated sales of nearly $14 billion, just three percent of its $482 billion in annual revenues. In comparison, Amazon as a whole brought in $107 billion (including revenues from AWS).

Two years after a white policeman fatally shot John Crawford III on Aug. 5, 2014, in a Wal-Mart store in the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek, Ohio, as Crawford carried an air rifle picked up from a store shelf, the U.S. Justice Department has yet to conclude its investigation and won't say why, despite the family's push for an update. (Courtesy Family of John Crawford III via AP, File)  (The Associated Press) COLUMBUS, Ohio –  Two years after a white policeman fatally shot a 22-year-old black man in an Ohio Wal-Mart who was carrying an air rifle that he had picked up from a store shelf, the U.S. Department of Justice has yet to conclude its investigation and won't say why, despite the family's push for an update. Some questions raised by the Aug. 5, 2014, shooting of John Crawford III at the Beavercreek store, near Dayton, have been answered, but others linger. WAITING AND WHY Crawford's relatives wonder why the review has taken this long and hasn't been finished, but federal officials won't say, citing the pending investigation by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The family holds police responsible and wants charges filed, but even if that's not the conclusion reached, they want the investigation wrapped up because it's delaying their civil lawsuit against police. In a letter last month, the family's attorneys asked U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the federal prosecutor in Cincinnati to update them on the status of the investigation and announce results soon. A department spokesman couldn't confirm Thursday whether Lynch had received the letter. AVAILABLE EVIDENCE Officers went to the store after a man called 911 to report, in a recorded call, that someone was walking around waving an apparent rifle and "pointing it at people." Police said they believed Crawford had a real weapon and didn't respond to commands to put it down. The surveillance video of the shooting is soundless, so it can't prove what was said. OTHERS INVOLVED A group of people who took interest in the shooting used comparisons of the video and 911 audio to push for prosecution of the 911 caller — the only person to call police before shots were fired. The special prosecutor who presented the case to a grand jury said it concluded that the shooting was justified and that charges weren't warranted for the caller. The prosecutor said he found no evidence that the caller knew he was providing false information. ALSO STILL PENDING The Crawford case isn't the only fatal police shooting in Ohio that remains under federal review. A civil rights investigation also was launched after the death of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy who was shot by a white rookie policeman while playing with what turned out to be a pellet gun near a Cleveland recreation center in November 2014, just months after Crawford's death.

OTHERS INVOLVED A group of people who took interest in the shooting used comparisons of the video and 911 audio to push for prosecution of the 911 caller — the only person to call police before shots were fired. The special prosecutor who presented the case to a grand jury said it concluded that the shooting was justified and that charges weren't warranted for the caller. The prosecutor said he found no evidence that the caller knew he was providing false information. ALSO STILL PENDING The Crawford case isn't the only fatal police shooting in Ohio that remains under federal review. A civil rights investigation also was launched after the death of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy who was shot by a white rookie policeman while playing with what turned out to be a pellet gun near a Cleveland recreation center in November 2014, just months after Crawford's death.

Some questions raised by the Aug. 5, 2014, shooting of John Crawford III at the Beavercreek store, near Dayton, have been answered, but others linger.

The four-day competition, which awards a top cash prize of $300,000, will feature a full field of anglers Friday before cutting to the top 20 on Saturday, and to the final 10 on championship Sunday. Link to photo of Day One leader John Cox Link to HD video of Cox's weighing in his leading limit Pro John Cox of Debary, Florida, weighed a five-bass limit totaling 16 pounds, 11 ounces, to take the early lead after Day One on the water. Cox holds a slim 1-pound, 13-ounce, lead over Brandon McMillian of Clewiston, Florida, who caught five bass weighing 14-14, good for second place. Cox said he spent his day on the south end of the lake dissecting a 300-yard creek arm off of the main river. He said it was one of four arms that he had hit during practice. "I was on my way into a hole that I figured no one could get to, and I ended up catching them on the way back there," said Cox, who won the FLW Tour event on Lake Hartwell earlier this season. "It took about 40 minutes to get in there. There were a lot of logs I had to go across." Cox said he caught 10 fish along his path using a variety of baits including a buzzbait, spinnerbait and a Yamamoto Senko. "I saw some duckweed in a tree and caught one on a frog, and then another from a clump nearby," said Cox. "I flipped and casted all day. I caught my largest fish in the morning – a 3-pounder – when I finally got to the back of the creek." Heading into Day Two, Cox said he is confident that some sizeable bass will still be in his area. "I'm thinking I can go back in there tomorrow and catch them again," said Cox. "The fish were healthy, thick and eating good. I like how the area was setting up. I don't know if I can get the same weight as today, but 13 pounds is a definite possibility." The top 20 pros after day one on Wheeler Lake are: 1st: John Cox, Debary, Fla., five bass, 16-11 2nd: Brandon McMillan, Clewiston, Fla., five bass, 14-14 3rd: Bryan Thrift, Shelby, N.C., five bass, 14-7 4th: Joseph Webster, Fulton, Miss., five bass, 14-2 5th: Walmart pro Mark Rose, West Memphis, Ark., five bass, 13-15 6th:  Bill Chapman, Salt Rock, W.

KTRK By Tracy Clemons Thursday, August 04, 2016 HOUSTON (KTRK) -- A southwest Houston woman was nearly killed in a Walmart parking lot over the weekend. Yvonne Jones tells Eyewitness News all she wanted was a blouse when she went to the Walmart at the Beltway near Bissonnet Saturday evening. Moments after the U.S. Army veteran walked out the store with her bag in hand, she was hit by a car that was turning into the parking lot. "I had no scars before this," Jones said. The scars and casts remind Jones that she survived. She was walking in the parking lot when Houston police say a speeding car hit her from behind. "I could have died," she said. "I'm down on the ground begging people. I felt like a dog. I was down on the ground saying please help me, somebody please help me. I'm bleeding. Some people just drove by." Jones was transported to Memorial Hermann Southwest with major injuries. She has a broken neck, back and leg. Police say it was a red Pontiac Grand Prix that hit her. She says a young black couple was driving, likely in their late 20s or early 30s. "The lady had no remorse. The reason I say that is because I heard the guy tell her, 'You need to call the police. You gotta call.' He was on the passenger side," Jones said. She says the woman ran off. Police tell Eyewitness News the man called 911, told Jones the police were on the way and then drove off. "I thought he should've stayed until the police came," she said. Her husband, Errol, says this is a perfect example of how quickly lives can change. "She says she's in a lot of pain right now. I thank God for the pain because that means she's not paralyzed and it means she's not dead," he tells us. Both Yvonne and Errol say they want these two caught -- but they hold no malice toward them. "Accidents happen. They made a foolish mistake that's going to alter their life. I feel a lot of sadness for them, too," Errol said. Yvonne spoke with us from the hospital in hopes police catch the couple who hit her and to warn people to watch their backs. "I just wanna tell people they need to be very careful in these parking lots. Both, but mainly people driving because you can kill us," she added. Anyone with information should call HPD's Hit and Run division at 713-247-4065. Related Topics: newswalmarthit and runparkingHouston Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2016 KTRK-TV.

The system was launched in late July and could be eventually rolled out to all 4,600 U.S. Walmart stores, said Mark Ibbotson, Walmart’s executive vice president of central operations. There are about 62,000 hourly workers at the neighborhood stores where the new system is being deployed who now have two scheduling options. Those choosing fixed shifts are guaranteed the same weekly hours for up to six months. The remainder will stick to the current system of having three weeks advance notice and being able to choose their hours based on what’s available. Ibbotson said that he’s still not sure what the breakdown will eventually look like. Walmart said the new software program will better predict staffing needs during peak hours, as well as and where and when to best deploy workers. The goal is to be more transparent when offering employees hours. The changes come amid pressure from workers at Walmart and elsewhere for more control over their schedules. After Starbucks employees complained about securing enough shifts, CEO Howard Schultz said the company would work to ensure they have enough hours. Walmart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, has been looking at different ways to give more flexibility to its 1.5 million hourly U.S. workers over the past year and a half. And the new system comes as Walmart has invested $2.7 billion in higher wages and improved training over a two-year period. The plan is part of an overall strategy to boost customer service at the stores and therefore boost sales. “We are cautiously working through the big change,” Ibbotson told The Associated Press on Thursday, referring to the new system. “We are pleased with what we have seen so far.” Ibbotson noted that Walmart is going to monitor the changes through the New Year, looking at such metrics as whether the lines to the cash register have been reduced and whether it has offered the right amount of flexibility to workers. OUR Walmart, a non-profit worker group, said in a statement that it “does not actually address the number one problem facing workers, lack of hours and for customers, understaffing.” Dave & Buster’s opens in...Best and worst things to...   Submit a News Tip Most Popular First a team, now an identity for Las Vegas’ NHL expansion entry Las Vegas’ NHL team officially named Vegas Golden Knights Raiders owner Mark Davis remains ‘committed to Las Vegas’ Legendary Tempest Storm says she’s done with Burlesque Hall of Fame event Man sentenced to life in prison for rape and murder behind Las Vegas strip mall Columnists Features Road Warrior Time to take down those political campaign signs across Las Vegas Valley   Inside Gaming Stay tuned for e-sports betting in Las Vegas casinos   Real Estate Insider Las Vegas retains title of underwater homes capital   On Education Emotions run high in charter battle between 2 school districts in Southern Nevada   More Columnists NFL Team Bar Directory Here is the Review-Journal's 2016 directory of NFL team bars in the Las Vegas area.   Electric Daisy Carnival The world’s largest dance music event   Hockey in Vegas A look at NHL expansion news in the Silver State.   Neon Rebirth The post-recession American Dream in Las Vegas   More Features   CALENDAR WED 23 THU 24 FRI 25 SAT 26 SUN 27 MON 28 TUE 29 A All Week   Loading...

Seattle-based Amazon now accounts for 31 percent of e-commerce sales in the US, according to Euromonitor. Meanwhile, Walmart and Target, despite the dominance of their brick-and-mortar chains, each get a piddling 3 percent of the online market. The gap with Amazon looks daunting, but Walmart still looks poised to leapfrog past Target if it makes good on its reported talks to buy Hoboken, N.J.-based Jet.com, according to Slice Intelligence, a San Francisco-based research firm. “Target and Walmart have been neck-and-neck in online sales for the past 12 months,” according to Slice Intelligence analyst Ken Cassar. In a pool of sales reaped by Walmart.com, Target.com, Kmart.com and Jet.com combined, Walmart’s share is 45.8 percent, while Target’s is slightly higher at 46.2 percent, Slice said. Meanwhile Jet’s share of that pool — and, accordingly, the size of the percentage-point advantage it would give Walmart over Target — is 6 percent, Cassar noted. (Kmart.com’s share is 2 percent.) That’s despite the fact that Jet only launched in July 2015. In May, Jet said it logged $85 million in sales, giving it an annual run rate of about $1 billion. The talks between Walmart and Jet, first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, could result in a deal worth $3 billion. Both companies have declined to comment. Acquiring Jet could give Walmart a particular boost in consumer packaged goods, Cassar notes. Groceries, as well as health and beauty products, accounted for a quarter of Jet’s sales. By comparison, those fast-moving products only accounted for 5 percent of sales on Walmart.com — despite the fact that they’re key categories at Walmart’s retail stores.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Jet.com's potential $3 billion sale to Walmart shows a new trend shaking up the e-commerce space (WMT, AMZN) Thursday Aug 4, 2016 at 8:03 PM Eugene Kim Freebies2deals The e-commerce store Jet.com is reported to be in talks to be sold to Walmart for $3 billion. The deal shows Jet.com may have struggled to reach its lofty goal of becoming a $40 billion company within 5 years. It's also a sign that Walmart is serious about expanding its online presence. But the merger would also highlight a new trend that's increasingly sweeping through the online commerce business: expansion to physical retail space. "The future of retail is the integration of physical bricks and online clicks. This is true because the customer experience needs to address anywhere a customer wants to shop," market research firm Cowen & Co.'s analyst Oliver Chen told Business Insider. It's unclear how Jet.com plans to leverage Walmart's massive physical store network to grow its online business. But it's not hard to imagine seeing some form of partnerships take place, like using Walmart as a pick-up location. And Jet.com certainly won't be the only e-commerce company seeking opportunities from physical retail stores. Amazon, for example, just opened its first physical bookstore last year and plans to have several more, possibly in other categories as well. Other companies that originally started online-only, like Blue Nile and Warby Parker, have also expanded to physical retail in recent years. Even smaller players like Birchbox have launched pop-up stores to reach customers in-person. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a recent interview with Recode that having a physical store does help and could make a big difference for the customers. Search first, then visit "There are a bunch of very small things and it makes a very big difference in the customer experience. It’s something that’s easier to experience," he said. Cowen's Chen says the obvious benefit to having a physical presence is the reach and convenience. It gives companies another channel to acquire customers while providing a faster purchasing experience. "Opening stores can make sense as you try to broaden your reach," he said. It also doesn't hurt that almost 90% of US retails sales still come from physical stores, while most people first search online before going to the store to buy the product. According to GameStop, a game retailer with over 6,000 stores worldwide, nearly 80% of its customers first search the product online before making the actual purchase at the store. It still remains to be seen how the Walmart-Jet.com deal ends up helping either company. But Chen believes it could be a sign of more online stores expanding offline. "The trend will continue because these brands are looking to offer the customer touch points across all channels. The store experience is critical to the brand," he said.  NOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled Tesla's 'top secret' master plan  here are the details See Also:How a mystery employee made Amazon give chopsticks to the whole companyAmazon just found out it sold another $120,000 worth of products to Iranian officialsAmazon CFO had to explain it's not a bad thing Amazon had its highest quarterly profit ever SEE ALSO: How a mystery employee made Amazon give chopsticks to the whole company About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Yellow Pages Vacation Hold Market Place Classifieds Find Independence jobs Cars Real Estate FindNSave Boats Magazine Online Submissions Engagements Weddings Births Anniversaries Sister Publication Boonville Daily News Linn County Leader Lake Sun Leader Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune The Examiner Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

A worker pushes shopping carts in front of a Wal-Mart store in La Habra, Calif. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) Employees at Walmart Neighborhood Market stores have received more control over their work shifts -- and the new system could come to all 4,600 of the chain's stores in the U.S. Walmart launched a new scheduling system last month at the 700 smaller-format neighborhood stores to give workers the ability to have fixed shifts every week for six months, or to be able to choose hours based on those offered, the Associated Press reports. The goal is to raise worker morale by giving employees more control and more predictability to their shifts. Walmart has already taken other steps that it hopes will improve the lives of its employees, including raising wages, and mollify critics. Walmart says the new system is an improvement because is it also allows it to better forecast how large of a workforce it will need during peak hours. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2aHqf99

A number of people have reported receiving unprompted password recovery emails from an address that originated with the retailer. This afternoon, Gizmodo received a few tips about emails like this from Walmart. Our tipsters provided us with some screenshots of the messages: Meanwhile, if you search "Walmart password reset" on Twitter, it becomes clear they're our tipsters aren't the only ones.. It seems most people only received one message or maybe a couple, but one unlucky dude received more-over a thousand in the space of about an hour and a half, he said. "I was awoken half way through due to my phone vibrating every few seconds with a new email," Josh Oakes told me in an email. "I do web development myself so I find it very insecure there is no limit to how many password reset codes someone can generate especially since they can be as simple as a 4 digit code." The sender on the emails is listed as customerservice@walmart.com. When reached by phone, a Walmart spokesman confirmed that it was a valid Walmart address. One of our tipsters told us that he bought something through Walmart's website in May, but he never set up an account. He said that his wife also received an email, though she didn't remember ever creating a Walmart account, or even buying anything from Walmart's website. The other tipster told us the account through which he received the password reset email had been involved in a previous data breach, a claim backed up by searching his email address in the HaveIBeenPwned database. Some of the puzzled people out there warned the emails were part of a phishing scam, but Walmart's spokesman told Gizmodo this didn't appear to be the case-instead, the company believes someone was simply using Walmart as a way to check whether certain email addresses were valid. "Someone likely obtained a list of email addresses, and used software to validate whether an address exists," the spokesman said. If the attempt was successful-in other words, if the person received a notification that a password reset email was successfully sent to the address-then he or she now knows it's a valid address. "They might [then] use it for phishing scams," the spokesman suggested, but he confessed that "we don't now for sure why" it happened. He added, "it's unlikely that a customer's walmart.com account has been comprised." The spokesman wouldn't confirm how many email addresses were involved in this bizarre situation, but said the company was still monitoring the situation. While Walmart's theory sounds plausible, the fact that users who don't even have Walmart accounts are claiming to have received emails throws a kink into this theory-which in turn suggests that no one really knows what the hell happened for sure. If you input an email address that's not associated with an account into Walmart's forgotten password form, nothing happens. It's possible the email addresses could have been obtained in a previous data breach, and the messages could be an attempt to get ahold of a user's login information, or it could simply be a bored hacker who wants to spam a good number of people. In any case, if you received an email, it's probably a good idea to keep an eye on your credit card statements-or better yet, change your password.

Lore would stay in that role for longer than the two-plus years he spent at Amazon.com Inc., said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. The deal combines Jet’s proprietary technology, customer data and Lore’s e-commerce know-how with Wal-Mart’s extensive supplier relationships and its $480 billion revenue stream that can be used to fight Amazon, the online market leader. Marc Lore is "one of the smartest people in e-commerce" who will bring a new kind of thinking to Wal-Mart to help it transition to digital commerce, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. "Wal-Mart still struggles with things like third party marketplaces which Marc and his team have successfully built," she said. In teaming up with the world’s largest retailer, Lore would get deeper pockets and a longer runway than he’s ever had to take on Amazon. Lore, 45, duked it out with Amazon as founder and chief executive officer of Quidsi, best known for Diapers.com, before a protracted price war and tight credit market during the Great Recession forced him to sell to his competitor for $550 million in 2010. After working for Amazon as part of that deal, he emerged with Jet in 2015 and a plan to challenge Amazon yet again.

The question is whether Wal-Mart’s vast inventory and supplier relationships can be used to sweeten the sales beyond what Hoboken, New Jersey-based Jet has done, such as savings of about 10 cents to double a toothpaste order, he said. “The gains with Jet alone are not compelling right now,” Kalyanam said. “If Wal-Mart helps make the gains for shoppers more compelling, it may have some legs. It’s something unique and fits with Wal-Mart’s desire for shoppers to have a large basket at checkout.” Amazon is changing the way people shop by offering inventory on its web store larger than any big-box retailer’s and delivery in as little as one hour in many cities. Its $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership provides free two-day shipping on millions of items, encouraging consumers to shop online and save themselves a trip to the store. Savings Model Jet initially offered a similar membership model that cost $50 a year, looking to undercut Amazon, but quickly canceled the fee and offered free shipping on orders of at least $35. It sought to lower costs by matching shoppers with inventory closest to them, tapping retail partners including Wal-Mart. Jet sought to emphasize savings over Amazon’s emphasis on fast delivery. Wal-Mart’s online sales were about $14 billion last year, 14 percent of Amazon’s product and service revenues of $99 billion. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said last month that e-commerce is a priority and has taken too long to grow. Jet achieved a $1 billion gross merchandise run rate in just a little more than a year, a pace that appealed to Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. Brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to blunt Amazon’s momentum in e-commerce. The Seattle-based company first afflicted book chains, then electronics stores and now is adding clothing and household goods in a threat to department stores and big-box retailers. Wal-Mart has spent billions trying to expand online to compete with Amazon, including hiring thousands of workers, opening two Silicon Valley offices and building massive e-commerce distribution centers. It has also begun an annual subscription service similar to Amazon Prime offering two-day shipping for half the price of Prime. Jet has raised more than $500 million from investors including Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Fidelity Investments, Accel Partners, New Enterprise Associates and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The Wal-Mart offer came as Jet was looking to raise an additional $640 million from retailers looking to take on Amazon, according to one of the people familiar with the deal.

Crunch Network Tesla’s best-laid plans will have a challenge in convergence Posted Aug 6, 2016 by Richard Hui (@rjh_richard) 0 SHARES Next Story Stand up against the stand-up Richard Hui Crunch Network Contributor Richard Hui is CEO of WarrantyLife.com. More posts by this contributor: With changes to price-matching, Amazon and Walmart usher a new era of retail The Future Of Retail Won’t Be So Good For Consumers How to join the network Driverless cars and ridesharing are poised to bring about the next big tectonic movement that technology provides for the human experience. In much the same way that the mobile phone has transformed the way we live, autonomous vehicles and transportation sharing promise to change the way we move. Tesla’s recent announcement of its Master Plan, Part Deux exemplifies the convergence of these technology trends. For Tesla, this is a natural evolution for the business that makes complete sense. There are many hurdles to overcome, but as these technologies develop, local and federal regulations may be the largest. Tesla’s plan believes that proper testing will require approximately 6 billion miles (10 billion kilometers) in testing before worldwide regulatory approval will be achieved. There is little doubt that cars will reach a level of self-driving competence at some point. However, what driverless, shared vehicles mean and how they become adapted into today’s infrastructure could create problems as governments wrestle with existing infrastructure and deeply entrenched financial interests. Today’s trend The PC evolution, the internet, the switch from cell phone to smartphone, tablets and laptops — these are a few of the examples of profound introductions of new technology to our society that have managed to cause evolutionary changes in our lives. Now both driverless vehicles and ridesharing can be added to the list. Auto manufacturers are already experimenting with and making investments into these capabilities: GM recently invested $500 million in Lyft, with Toyota following suit in Uber and VW investing $300 million in Gett, a Tel Aviv-based ridehailing startup that operates in dozens of cities across Europe. The race is on. Mary Meeker, in her recent state of the technology industry presentation, devoted a few slides to the intersection of ridesharing and autonomy. The benefits of rideshare and driverless cars working together seem to far outweigh excuses to stay with the status quo. “Google wants to leapfrog straight to fully self-driving cars, which could take a while, Tesla wants to iterate its way there despite the risks of semi-autonomy and traditional car makers are combining the approaches while making strategic investments in ride-sharing startups… UberPool has succeeded in de-stigmatizing car sharing, and could achieve mass adoption as the time saved offsets the slightly higher cost compared to public transportation… Fascinating questions to debate about how transportation will change as autonomy makes cars into mobile living rooms.” The writing is on the wall The benefits of rideshare and driverless cars working together seem to far outweigh excuses to stay with the status quo. With the high costs of owning a vehicle, reduced interest in driving and potential revenue opportunities by sending your car out to earn income via rideshare, the new model feels overwhelmingly compelling. As outlined by Meeker’s slide: “Car ownership will wane as its high costs and inefficiency give way to ride sharing.” As vehicles get into the market of being driverless-ready, rideshare companies provide an interesting option for owners of these vehicles. Although we are not quite there yet, solving the technology challenges that will enable this new phase will eventually happen. The revenue opportunity is too great and will drive the innovation to commercialize as quickly as possible. Right now, most of the talk and focus has been on gaining acceptance by government regulators, mostly to do with security and safety concerns. “U.S. regulators are embracing self-driving cars faster than tech in the past, poising the nation for gains from the auto industry shift.” Knee-jerk reactions now could create large pileups down the road. Still… there have been significant, and tragic, accidents that may slow the adoption of autonomous technologies. With the death of a Tesla driver using autopilot in Florida on May 7, 2016, government regulators may be forced to be more circumspect in their attitudes on how this technology progresses. To further add concern, another recently crashed Tesla on autopilot certainly won’t help government speed regulation. Technology always evolves far faster than governments can keep up with. And as autonomous vehicles merge into the fast lane, understanding how they influence economies will be critical. Knee-jerk reactions now could create large pileups down the road. The local government conundrum Real-life examples of governments wrestling with ridesharing services are evident already. Take a look at Austin, where recent intervention by the city’s government prompted Lyft and Uber to pull out of what had been a successful area for them. Some local governments have banded together to come up with solutions on how to best handle how rideshare companies integrate with their cities. From New York and Toronto to Athens and Barcelona, mayors are forging alliances to deal with the changing situation. By combining ridesharing and driverless cars, companies are creating the potential for even more pressing issues for local governments on the horizon. The driverless car and rideshare mashup won’t be easy With increasing populations and aging infrastructure, the cost of road maintenance and public transportation infrastructure seems to increase every year. The typical strategy has been to offload those additional costs through taxes on things such as gas, parking, insurance payments, tolls or even pay-per-mileage recently introduced in Oregon. Driverless cars and rideshare have the potential to significantly reduce cars on the road and negatively impact revenues needed to support local transportation infrastructure. As owners of cars look to contract out their vehicles for usage in rideshare services to help support the cost of ownership, you’ll see fewer vehicles on the road. With EVs, hybrids and more fuel-efficient vehicles, fuel taxes are also at risk for decline. The government is in total control of when and how these new technologies get introduced. Increased carpooling will also impact a reduction in the use of public transportation. Reduced parking and toll revenue will combine with the aspects noted above, and will jeopardize the amount of money that’s collected and needed to support local infrastructure. If driverless cars and ridesharing are going to be the next big thing, local governments need to look for ways to secure, grow and sustain revenue for the future. This dilemma potentially creates a barrier to the widespread adoption that would change the way we live. On one hand, you’ve got a technological and cultural shift about to happen, but from a tax point of view, governments will create a problem for themselves by supporting this change. Despite doing what’s right for people and the environment, we don’t always see that playing out in economics. Uber isn’t accepted everywhere because it threatens local regulated, revenue-generating taxi services, even though it’s a great service for consumers. Meanwhile, people in communities where rideshare is restricted continue to pay higher prices to own vehicles. Until this problem is solved, you’ve got some local governments unwilling to move. Weave into that driverless cars, and you have government’s seemingly working against themselves — if they aren’t careful, they’ll legislate themselves into a deficit. The government is in total control of when and how these new technologies get introduced. Maybe they’ll decide to de-couple the rideshare from the driverless car, where people could still own driverless cars, but not use them to subcontract for rideshare services. Then you’ve got to restrict rideshare companies from owning their own vehicles now or face the same problem. Big decisions fraught with peril become evident from many angles. Related Articles Austin police are now impounding drivers in the peer-to-peer ridesharing group The 3 factors behind Uber and Lyft’s regulatory win in California An open letter to Tesla and Google on driverless cars The overwhelming benefits will ultimately see driverless cars adopted everywhere. And those cities that restrict rideshare will be faced with even more questions by local residents critical of the decision that blocks communities from the inherent benefits. Governments will have to come up with different ways to pay for the system they’ve built, but their revenue requirements won’t go away. Perhaps driverless busses will reduce the costs of transportation. Parking fees could be recovered by mileage tax, or charging drop-off and pick-up fees for rideshare trips. Maybe you’ll see chargeable driverless car “waiting areas” pop up. Or insurance cost-savings created by a decline in accidents could be offset by higher taxes underneath the noses of the consumers. One thing is for sure, these revenues will have to be made up somewhere. The question is where? With these questions still open, and a whole bunch of change coming, governments will soon be in No Man’s Land.

It's a scam Print Email Matt Gray | For NJ.com By Matt Gray | For NJ.com Gloucester County Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 06, 2016 at 10:04 AM, updated August 06, 2016 at 10:08 AM comments Officials are warning residents about a scam with links to Spain. Fraudsters are trying to trick residents into becoming "mystery shoppers" and participating in a quality control program on behalf of Walmart, according to a press release issued by Gloucester County. No such program exists. Scam victims encouraged to report international fraud The scammers have tricked citizens into revealing personal information and exposing themselves to bank fraud and theft, county officials said. A West Deptford resident reported receiving the scam in the mail this week. They are using Walmart logos and promising that participants will make money, explained Freeholder Lyman Barnes, liaison to the county Office of Consumer Affairs. What really happens is much different. Scammers send victims a check for $1,992.65, then tell them they must send back a personal check for $350, according to the county. Victims are told they can keep the remainder of the money. A few weeks later, victims learn that the check was phony and that they owe their bank more than $1,900. "Walmart has advised consumers that they do not participate in any type of 'Mystery Shopper' programs," Barnes said. "County residents should know that under no circumstances should anyone answer an ad or mail inquiry asking them to be a mystery shopper." 4 popular phone scams and how to avoid them If mailings with these offers persist, residents are encouraged to contact the county Office of Consumer Affairs at 856-384-6855. Walmart includes extensive information about scams on its website. Matt Gray may be reached at mgray@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @MattGraySJT.

But with just a few tweaks to your lifestyle, you can easily free up time in your day and money in your budget. GOBankingRates.com asked some of the best personal finance experts for their top money tips for busy people. Find out how these money hacks can make managing your finances a cinch. 1. Get Free Shipping and Earn Cash Back Shopping at cash-back and rewards websites can help you earn money and points on your everyday purchases. But savings expert Lauren Greutman uses a hack to save even more money, as well as time that you might otherwise spend wandering the aisles. "Order online at stores like Walmart and Target through Swagbucks, and earn points that you can cash in for free gift cards to stores like Amazon and PayPal,” she said. “During your order, select 'ship to store,' pick it up for free, and you have just earned cash back on your purchase without having to pay for shipping." 2. Use Apps to Track Your Finances Angie Nelson from The Work at Home Wife is a huge fan of using technology to save time and money. "Sign up for a money monitoring service like Mint or Personal Capital," she said. "Unnecessary expenses and avoidance of saving can add up quickly when your busy mind is on other things. A quick glance or notification will let you know if you are on track or falling behind.” 3. Meal Plan Like a Boss A little old-fashioned meal planning can help you save hundreds on groceries per month, said Greutman. It can also save you a lot of time by having your meals prepped ahead of time. “I like to make a month’s worth of meals in one afternoon," she said. "For only $150, I can make 20 dinners in just under three hours. I use ingredients from ALDI, and this helps me keep my grocery bill low and my stress level down.” 4. Set Calendar Reminders Reviewing your accounts is crucial to your financial well being. It can help you keep tabs on your spending and make sure you're on track to meet your goals. Furthermore, keeping a steady date with your finances can help you spot potential problems early on, before they become more challenging — and time-consuming — to resolve down the road. "Set a recurring event in your calendar to review your financial accounts at the same time and day each week, month, quarter or year,” said Taylor Schulte, a certified financial planner and founder of Define Financial. “Just like everything else in your busy life, if it's not on the calendar, you probably won't get to it. This hack will also help develop a healthy habit, and eventually you might not even need to rely on your calendar." 5. Sell Your Old Stuff Online You can also save time and money by selling your old items, or items you find at thrift stores, on eBay for profit, Greutman said. “One way that I make extra cash is to buy name-brand clothing at thrift stores and sell them for profit on eBay," she said. "I find a dress for $4 and sell it for $50. This is a great way to make extra cash from home.” 6. Monetize Your Down Time Another way you can make money during your free time is by watching videos and taking surveys online on a site like Swagbucks, said Greutman. “I love taking surveys and watching videos in my down time," she said. "I may as well be making money while relaxing.” 7. Use Your Credit Card for Everything Teresa Mears, CEO of Living on the Cheap, saves time and money by paying for everything with her credit card. Keeping most expenditures on one account can help streamline your budget-tracking and bill-paying process. "I charge everything I can to one credit card, and then pay it off manually once a month," she said. "I get email alerts for the accounts, like electric and water, that I can't charge to the card automatically.” 8. Do a 5-Minute Money Checkup If you can spare just five minutes each day, Greutman has a money hack that can help make managing your finances a breeze. “Every morning, my husband and I sit down and do a five-minute money checkup," she said. "That way, we talk about what we have to spend money on that day, review the budget, and we both know what the day's money movement is.” 9. Digitally Capture Your Receipts If you find it difficult and time-consuming to track your spending, there's a hack for that. “One of the fastest ways for me to track spending is to take pictures of all my receipts," said Mike Delgado, director of social media at credit reporting agency Experian. “I use a nifty app called Shoeboxed Receipt and share the account with my wife so we can share receipts with each other and categorize spending easily." 10. Stop Credit Card Fraud in Its Tracks In addition to using Shoeboxed to capture your receipts, Delgado said it also helps him to spot any suspicious account activity at a glance. “Shoeboxed also automatically adds your spending data into a downloadable spreadsheet so you can compare receipt data against what’s reported in your credit card transactions," he said. "This can help you identify fraud faster — and find any discrepancies in what is reported in credit card transactions.” 11. Make Frequent, Small Credit Card Payments If you're struggling with managing your credit card bills, this money hack can help make your life easier. By making small but frequent credit card payments, such as 1 percent to 2 percent of your balance every other week, you could get out of debt faster and avoid racking up interest. 12. Turn Your Credit Card Into a Debit Card Using your credit card to earn rewards and cash back takes discipline. However, if you make sure you don't overspend and you pay your balance in full every month, this strategy can be quite lucrative. Fortunately, there's a money hack that can help you build credit and earn rewards without going into debt. One financial tool, Debitize, automatically sets aside money from your checking account after every credit card purchase, then pays the bill in full when it's due. So, it essentially helps you use your credit card like a debit card, and takes some of the guesswork out of getting rewards. "Our users earn hundreds of dollars of credit card rewards by using their rewards cards, but they don't have to worry about getting surprised by a big bill at the end of the month,” said Liran Amrany, founder and CEO of Debitize. 13. Round Up Your Purchases to Save More Automation can also help you stash more money in your savings account. One app, Qapital, lets you set up spending rules that trigger an automatic deposit into your savings account. You can set spending challenges, where if you spend less than an amount you set, the remainder is sent into savings. Another feature rounds up the change from each purchase and puts it into your savings account. Qapital said its average user saves $44 per month with this feature. 14. Get Tax Advice If you find yourself in hot water with the IRS, getting expert advice can save you thousands of dollars. “I made a client $120,000 in eight hours,” said Dean Ferraro, an enrolled agent with Authoritax. “I had one client who didn't file his taxes for 10 years. Since he didn't file his taxes, the IRS did them for him, and said he owed $200,000.” “The IRS doesn't give you any deductions or even the correct filing status; they max out your taxes and fees when they file your Substitute for Return," he said. "We filed his back taxes correctly, the IRS agreed, removed the SFRs and guess what his total taxes due were? Only $80,000. He saved $120,000. Moral of the story: Do your taxes." A tax professional can help ensure you're filing your taxes properly in the first place, and can offer the guidance to address problems when they do arise, potentially saving you a bigger, more expensive and time-consuming headache down the road. 15. Buy in Bulk Buying in bulk can save you time and money each month, said Deb Shaw, COO at international money transfer service ForeignExchange.com. “Examine what you purchase repeatedly every month, and buy those products or services in bulk," he said. "For me, this means household items and food with a long shelf life." "But buying in bulk doesn’t always apply to food," he added. “I always make sure to go for the year-long membership plan at my gym rather than paying month to month. This strategy not only lowers the price per unit I pay, but also saves me time so I don’t have to buy the same things over again.” 16. Save Before You Pay If one of the first things you do when you get your paycheck is pay your bills, you might want to reconsider that. “The best money hack I know is to pay yourself first: Put your budgeted savings into your account before you pay your bills or make any other expenditures,” said Mike Catania, co-founder and CTO of PromotionCode.org. Saving becomes a priority rather than an afterthought, and can help ensure that you stash your money away before you can spend it. “It's a common trope for investors, but it's equally applicable to everyone, and it has the added advantage of helping you mentally shift into prioritizing yourself," he said. "You're more than a bill-paying machine for corporate profit, so treat yourself that way.” 17. Call Your Cable Company A short, single phone call once a year to your cellphone and internet provider could save you hundreds each year, said Bruce Harpham of Project Management Hacks. Do your research ahead of time to see what various deal packages your providers offer, which can give you a cost range to aim for. “Cellphone and internet companies are focused on customer retention," he said. "That's why it pays to ask for a better deal. In a 10-minute call with a multibillion-dollar telecom company, I achieved over $150 in annual savings.” Read: 35 Life Hacks That Will Save You Thousands Harpham also offered tips to negotiate your cable bill. “In the call, point out how long you have been a customer, point out your good payment history, if applicable, and ask for any special promotions currently offered,” he said. “Patience and a bit of luck is required, but the payoff is great.” 18. Take Online Courses If you want to go back to school, but can’t imagine spending the money or the time, Adrian Ridner, CEO of Study.com, said online courses can help you achieve this goal in less time and with less money. “You don't have to pay full price for college. By using online courses to supplement the traditional college experience, students can earn the same degree but pay thousands less,” he said. The average student loan debt is $28,950, and the average bachelor’s degree holder takes 21 years to pay off their loans, added Ridner. “Online competency-based courses offer tuition relief [for] students, helping them save an average of $1,000 per course at public schools and as much as $3,000 per course at private schools," he said. “Online courses allow students more flexibility with scheduling and can help students catch up if they fall behind so that they can still graduate on time.” 19. Buy an Affordable Quality Car Nothing beats that new car smell, but the type of car you choose can have a major impact on how much time and money you spend maintaining your ride. "As a financial planner, I see a lot of people in their 50s and 60s decide that they need a luxury vehicle whether they can afford the car or not," said Damon Gonzalez, CFP, RICP at Domestique Capital LLC. “Humans are really good at adapting to their environments, and the newness of vehicles wears off quickly. You are much better off buying a quality car and keeping it for 15 to 20 years.” “I sold my 16-year-old Toyota Camry with 240,000 miles to a neighbor two years ago, and I still see it driving around," he added. "Next time you need a car repair of $1,500, stop and think about how that is only three car payments. In most cases, you are better off paying for the repair instead of shackling yourself to 60 months of car payments.” 20. Automate Everything Automating can also help you stay on track to meet your investing and debt payoff goals. “The answer to saving time and money is very simple: automation,” said John Luskin of financial planning website UncleDMoney. “This way, you're saving and/or investing automatically. You don't even have to think about it." Automating doesn't mean hands-off, though. You should still keep a close eye on your statements to track your spending, watch for signs of fraudulent activity and make sure your automated transactions are going through.

SHARE Man, ‘no stranger’ to police, held John McDugle By Duffy Hayes Saturday, August 6, 2016 A homeless man well-known to local law enforcement appeared in Mesa County court on Friday, accused of theft, burglary and trespass charges that will end up being his 11th pending case. Prosecutors said John McDugle, 55, has 26 prior misdemeanor convictions, and had 10 pending court cases when he on Thursday allegedly tried to walk out of Walmart, 2881 North Ave., with electronics items worth about $33 in a plastic bag, without paying for the items. McDugle was banned from any Walmart location in October 2014, and now faces possible charges of second-degree burglary, third-degree criminal trespass and shoplifting. Mesa County Chief Deputy District Attorney Mark Hand said the Grand Junction Police Department had specifically reached out to the district attorney’s office about McDugle, concerned about the amount of time and resources the department has spent dealing with him. Yet McDugle “continues to violate the law,” Hand said in court Friday in arguing for a cash bond. “He continues to be a significant issue for law enforcement.” Mesa County Court Judge Bruce Raaum followed Hand’s recommendation Friday, issuing McDugle a $1,000 cash-only bond, with additional pre-trial conditions that restrict him from consuming alcohol and allow testing for it. McDugle’s public defender said Friday that while the court is “no stranger” to McDugle, and that he has “quite a history,” his convictions have all stemmed from incidents involving alcohol and have all been non-violent. McDugle is set to return to court in his latest case on Aug. 11. COMMENTS Commenting is not available in this channel entry.

CDT August 05, 2016 Stephen Rankin gives testimony during the sentencing phase of his trial.  A jury convicted Rankin of voluntary manslaughter in the death of William Chapman. (Photo: 13News Now) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WVEC) - A jury has found Stephen Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of William Chapman. After further deliberations on Wednesday afternoon, they then recommended to a judge that Rankin serve two and a half years in prison. Prosecutors had sought a maximum sentence of 10 years. Rankin was not taken into custody. The judge will make the final decision on what Rankin's sentence will be at a future court date. The jury did not convict on the first-degree murder charge prosecutors sought in the case of the Portsmouth police officer, who was fired as he awaited trial. But criminal charges are rare in police-involved shootings, and convictions are even more uncommon. Rankin shot 18-year-old William Chapman in the face and chest outside a Walmart last year, after a security guard accused the teen of shoplifting. No video recorded the killing, and testimony conflicted on the details. Vol manslaughter means this was a heat of passion killing, not that there was premeditation— Laura Geller (@13LauraGeller) August 4, 2016 After the verdict was read, witness testimony was given for the jury to consider with the sentencing.  Rankin himself went back on the stand. When asked if he had anything he wanted to tell the Chapman family, Rankin replied, "I've actually wanted to say this for some time: I think this is a terrible tragedy. I wish it never occurred."  Some people leaving the courtroom are NOT happy with sentencing...calling it ridiculous. #Rankin— Chenue Her (@ChenueHer) August 4, 2016 Before the jury had reached a verdict Wednesday morning, defense attorneys filed a motion for a mistrial, and offered security video that showed a Chapman family friend interacting with a juror on Wednesday. The woman, identified in court as Ms. James told the judge she recognized the young man, but didn't realize he was a juror. She told the judge that when she realized he was, she and him took separate elevators. On Thursday, Broccoletti said that after court Wednesday, he and Belote saw Sallie Chapman hugging Ms. James in the grassy area between the Pavilion and the back of the courthouse. Broccoletti said James then got into Sallie Chapman's car and left. He stated this is further proof that Ms. James should be banned from the courtroom, but the judge denied that request. William Chapman II   (Photo: Family photo) The jury, made up of seven women and five men, had the following charges to consider: 1st Degree Murder 2nd Degree Murder Voluntary Manslaughter Use of a fire arm in commission of felony Since the jury found Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter, he cannot be convicted on the use of a fire arm in commission of a felony. According to Jon Babineau, the attorney for the family of William Chapman, tells 13News Now that the family will be filing a lawsuit against Rankin and the City of Portsmouth in the next few weeks. Rankin will be officially sentenced October 12 at the Portsmouth Circuit Court. Attorneys for Rankin cannot file for appeal until after the formal sentencing.  PHOTOS: Former officer Stephen Rankin murder trial Loading... Stephen D. Rankin's booking photo Portsmouth Police Dept.

Feds still reviewing 2014 Wal-Mart shooting of Fairfield man Kantele Franko, Associated Press 4:51 p.m. EDT August 5, 2016 This undated file photo provided by the family of John Crawford III shows him with his mother, Tressa Sherrod. (Photo: AP) COLUMBUS – Two years after a white policeman fatally shot a 22-year-old black man in an Ohio Wal-Mart who was carrying an air rifle that he had picked up from a store shelf, the U.S. Department of Justice has yet to conclude its investigation and won’t say why, despite the family’s push for an update. Some questions raised by the Aug. 5, 2014, shooting of John Crawford III of Fairfield at the Beavercreek store, near Dayton, have been answered, but others linger. CINCINNATI.COM As mom grieves, Wal-Mart shooting death unresolved WAITING AND WHY Crawford’s relatives wonder why the review has taken this long and hasn’t been finished, but federal officials won’t say, citing the pending investigation by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The family holds police responsible and wants charges filed, but even if that’s not the conclusion reached, they want the investigation wrapped up because it’s delaying their civil lawsuit against police. In a letter last month, the family’s attorneys asked U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the federal prosecutor in Cincinnati to update them on the status of the investigation and announce results soon. A department spokesman couldn’t confirm Thursday whether Lynch had received the letter.  (Photo: AP) AVAILABLE EVIDENCE Officers went to the store after a man called 911 to report, in a recorded call, that someone was walking around waving an apparent rifle and “pointing it at people.” Police said they believed Crawford had a real weapon and didn’t respond to commands to put it down. The surveillance video of the shooting is soundless, so it can’t prove what was said. CINCINNATI.COM Walmart shooting victim was 'figuring out his next step' OTHERS INVOLVED A group of people who took interest in the shooting used comparisons of the video and 911 audio to push for prosecution of the 911 caller — the only person to call police before shots were fired. The special prosecutor who presented the case to a grand jury said it concluded that the shooting was justified and that charges weren’t warranted for the caller. The prosecutor said he found no evidence that the caller knew he was providing false information.  (Photo: AP) ALSO STILL PENDING The Crawford case isn’t the only fatal police shooting in Ohio that remains under federal review. A civil rights investigation also was launched after the death of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy who was shot by a white rookie policeman while playing with what turned out to be a pellet gun near a Cleveland recreation center in November 2014, just months after Crawford’s death. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Amazon’s Cargo Plane Is Cool Amazon While the interwebs fixate on the great cargo shorts debate, Amazon unveiled a new look for hauling its gear that it doesn’t have to hide in shame: the first Amazon-branded cargo plane. The Amazon One is one of forty air cargo planes the world’s biggest online retailer recently agreed to lease in an ambitious effort to streamline the logistics behind Prime, its $99-a-year super-fast delivery service (among other things). Amazon has contracted with multiple air cargo outfits to operate the aircraft, including this Boeing 767-300. The company says it already has 11 planes flying for Amazon and will continue to send more airborne over time. The tail number of the first plane Amazon revealed is N1997A, the year Amazon went public. It’s also a prime number (ha ha). And lest you forget where you’re getting your Vitamix blender from, the company has emblazoned “Prime Air” on the sides. Amazon says the planes are intended to speed delivery, but they’re just one piece in the retail company’s already sprawling, intricate logistics network. To get its goods on customer’s doorsteps as if by magic, Amazon has built a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers and 20 “sortation centers” around the world, employing hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers as well as its own couriers and even robots to keep orders moving. The company has its own branded trucks and its widely publicized experimental drone delivery program. An Amazon subsidiary, meanwhile, will reportedly operate cargo ships carrying goods between China and the US. All of this tracks with the company’s longstanding strategy of spending big on infrastructure in order to maintain its retail dominance. In the past that’s eaten deeply into Amazon’s balance sheet, but more recently, it’s an approach that seems to be paying off. For the past few quarters, Amazon has delivered consistent profits for its investors, who in turn have made Amazon the fourth-most valuable company in the world by market cap—worth more than blue-chip titans like Berkshire Hathaway and Exxon Mobil Corp. For so long, Amazon has prioritized growth over profits. Now, it seems, that move has paid off enough that the company can enjoy both. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The company said orders for that sale, open only to Prime members, rose 60 percent worldwide and 50 percent in the US on Tuesday compared to Prime Day 2015. The event was the company’s single biggest sales day for Amazon devices. And third-party sellers saw orders nearly triple year-over-year, Amazon said. But the company did not provide Prime Day’s total sales, making it hard to know exactly how successful it was. Instead, it offered qualitative descriptions: “Prime members have voice shopped with Alexa, purchasing enough toilet paper to span to the International Space Station,” Amazon said yesterday. The company did reveal that Prime Day 2015 accounted for 2 percent of Amazon’s third quarter growth—about $400 million in additional revenue. That’s nothing compared to the $14 billion Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba earned with its own invented holiday, Single’s Day, in November—though it isn’t quite a perfect parallel to compare the entire Chinese consumer market to Amazon’s customer base of Prime members. As with last year, customers had complaints—particularly with adding items to their shopping carts. Still, Amazon’s stock rose 6 percent in the week following last year’s Prime Day. This year,  shareholders didn’t settle for anything less than exceptional. During Prime Day, Amazon shares hit a new intraday high of $761. Today, the day after Prime Day, stocks are flat, trading at $745 as of this writing. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Amazon eCommerce Retail Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

That’s right: San Franciscans who already enjoy unlimited two-day shipping and video streaming for $99 a year can now also get food from 117 local restaurants delivered in about an hour. Available in 33 zip codes across the city, the service is Amazon’s biggest rollout of Prime Now food delivery to date, the company says. Prime members place their orders through Amazon’s standalone Prime Now app, which also offers one-hour delivery of a wide range of everyday products. Aside from the Prime subscription fee, food delivery comes with no additional markups or fees. Amazon is also guaranteeing that people will pay the exact same price as is listed in restaurant menus. If you spot an item that’s priced higher on an online menu within 24 hours of placing the order, Amazon says it will refund you the price of your order. At first blush, launching food delivery in San Francisco, where the field is already stuffed with rivals, might seem daunting. There’s Caviar and Munchery, Postmates and Sprig. Even Uber has jumped into the food delivery game. But Amazon may be in a unique position to succeed. If its food delivery service works as well as Prime Now does for other products, Amazon already has an efficiency engine that seems tough to top. As a company that’s built its fortune on logistics, Amazon can seemingly just flip the switch to bring any new item into its delivery infrastructure. The company first introduced Prime Now restaurant delivery in Seattle last September. Today it’s live in eight cities across the country, including Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Austin. While Amazon hasn’t guaranteed that food delivery will be free forever, at the moment it’s yet another perk that could rope customers into a Prime membership. In the end, getting more and more people hooked on Prime is exactly what Amazon wants. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Amazon Food Delivery logistics Prime prime now Skip Social.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 02.22.16. 02.22.16 Time of Publication: 1:00 pm. 1:00 pm Now Amazon’s Free Shipping Will Cost You at Least $49 Amazon wants you to go Prime. It wants this so much that if you still haven’t signed up for Prime’s well-known deal—free two-day shipping plus unlimited video streaming for a $99 a year—the company is making it hard to get any kind of a deal on shipping at all. This morning, Amazon raised its free shipping minimum to $49 for its non-Prime customers for most products. That’s up from $35—the first time it increased the minimum order requirement since 2013. At least one category isn’t affected, though: book orders only need to hit $25 to qualify for free shipping. The company isn’t offering an explanation for raising its order minimum, but one obvious rationale is to push even more customers towards a Prime subscription. Not that the retail giant isn’t doing well on that front: In its last quarterly earnings report, Amazon revealed that paid Prime membership had increased 51 percent worldwide and 47 percent in the US in 2015. At the same time, Amazon’s shipping costs grew 37 percent to $1.8 billion last year—one of its biggest expenses. Amazon is getting more aggressive with its shipping and delivery initiatives. It’s ramping up its one-hour delivery service, Prime Now. And it’s reportedly building out a global delivery network that could ultimately put Amazon in complete control of the flow of goods in its supply chain, from factories in China and India to last-mile delivery to customers’ homes. But of all the elements of its logistics strategy, Prime is still Amazon’s biggest asset. Now the company is nudging customers even closer to a place where it doesn’t make sense to use Amazon without going Prime. For anyone who shops on Amazon even just a few times a year, it’s an obvious deal: fast, free shipping, plus extras like great original shows. And if that carrot doesn’t work, Amazon seems to be saying, maybe the $49 minimum-order stick will. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Amazon Amazon Prime logistics prime now Skip Social.

Amazon has long shunned profits in favor of growth, and over the past 20 years has poured resources into building a massive logistics infrastructure—much of it kept hidden from public view. The idea, which Amazon has discussed before, is to have that blender you ordered appear on your doorstep as if by magic. That “magic” is a highly coordinated system that includes vast fulfillment centers, aka warehouses, across the country and around the world; an army of warehouse robots, human couriers and other employees who number in the hundreds of thousands; and, soon, drones. Now, Amazon is adding trucks. At an event today in Chicago where employees packed 2,000 care packages for soldiers abroad, the company announced that it is rolling out thousands of tractor-trailers to make deliveries even more efficient. Those trailers won’t be schlepping stuff to customers’ doorsteps, though. Instead, they’ll move all the crap you order between its warehouses and shipping centers. The company will continue working with all of its trucking partners, who will use their own trucks to haul Amazon-branded trailers. This comes at a pivotal time for the Empire that Bezos Built. In its last two quarters, Amazon actually saw a profit—suggesting the truckloads of money it’s dumped into its logistics network are finally paying off. Customers, meanwhile, are starting to think of Amazon as the place to do online shopping. A recent survey from Survata found 44 percent of respondents searching for products online went directly to Amazon. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, e-commerce date company Slice Intelligence found Amazon was the clear leader on Black Friday, accounting for a little more than one-third of e-commerce spending and absolutely trouncing Best Buy, Macy’s, and Walmart (3.35 percent). Amazon obviously wants to continue this momentum, so gaining ever more granular control over its logistics makes sense. Last year, the company had package delivery troubles after a late surge in holiday sales, in part because UPS and FedEx capped air express deliveries. Amazon may even eventually want to cut those players out entirely and make deliveries itself, something it’s seemingly testing by using couriers in its Amazon Prime Now program, which delivers items in as little as an hour. So even if the news isn’t as exciting or flashy as drones, it shows that, when it comes to moving goods, trucks remain essential. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Instant gratification for everyone! The world’s largest online retailer is creating 100,000 seasonal jobs, it announced today with a press release. That’s up 25 percent from last year, when Amazon hired 80,000 temporary workers, and it doesn’t include the more than 25,000 full-time workers Amazon already hired in the US in recent months. According to The Wall Street Journal, it’s also more than the number of seasonal workers Target (70,000), Macy’s (85,000), and Wal-Mart (60,000) each hired in anticipation of the retail world’s busiest time of year. Unlike Amazon, these companies are reportedly holding steady on their seasonal hires this year. Plus, Amazon continues to expand its infrastructure in support of its massive logistics goals for this holiday season. According to calculations from ChannelAdvisor executive chairman Scot Wingo, an analyst who tracks Amazon closely, Amazon has expanded to 173 facilities worldwide, up from 155 warehouses last year. That helps the company shrink those crucial delivery times and costs down to as small a margin as possible. “Other retailers are going to struggle to come close,” Wingo writes in a blog post. “They do not offer nearly the same level of selection and efficiency that Amazon’s logistical network provides.” A New Narrative in Retail That’s the prevailing narrative: e-commerce is still experiencing crazy growth, while traditional retail struggles to keep pace. The US Department of Commerce recently estimated that the US retail e-commerce sales for the second quarter of 2015 reached $83.9 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent from the first quarter of 2015 and an increase of 14.1 percent year over year. E-commerce sales in the Q2 2015 also accounted for 7.2 percent of total sales in the US, according to the department. Meanwhile, total retail sales on the whole grew by just 1.6 percent from the first quarter of 2015 and 1.0 percent year over year. Just look at the paths of Amazon and Wal-Mart. In July, Amazon surpassed Wal-Mart as the world’s largest retailer by market value after a surprise second quarter profit. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart recorded its biggest one-day decline in almost three decades after it announced, to stunned investors, that it expected its growth over the next three years to be a paltry 3 to 4 percent, and would likely see profits drop up to 12 percent next year. After the news came out, investors saw over $20 billion in market value vanish in one day—and saw $83 billion disappear this year. The reason why it’s doing so terribly: It’s investing a ton of resources in things like wage hikes for employees to keep them happy, building out online grocery shopping, trying out subscription shipping. Basically, it needs to fend off Amazon, which is doing great in those areas. Attractive Innovation Investors just seem to view Amazon as a better bet these days, a company that, even after 21 years of existence, is still unafraid to try new things and see what turns out to be its next breakout hit. It’s already seen massive success with the cloud and (less conspicuously) its third-party online marketplace. It just launched Handmade, an Etsy competitor for artisanal goods, and Flex, an Uber-like platform where on-demand workers could pick up shifts delivering packages. It’s still visibly innovating in a lot of ways, which is attractive to potential shareholders. So, this upcoming holiday season, expect the differences between these massive players in retail to be thrown into even sharper relief. Amazon’s likely to keep crushing it—and it’ll have the workforce and the infrastructure that enables it to do so. Now, if it would only make a better effort than its recent misguided attempts to fix its culture image problem. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 09.29.15. 09.29.15 Time of Publication: 11:22 am. 11:22 am Amazon Wades Further Into the Complex World of the Gig Economy Drew Kelly for WIRED The instant gratification economy is still very much in vogue, and that means the demand for on-demand workers is high. Now, an entrenched tech giant and an early pioneer of the entire concept of “on-demand,” Amazon, is wading further into the gig economy. The online retailer has for weeks been quietly operating a new program called Amazon Flex, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, and has been testing it in its hometown of Seattle. Flex works in much the same way as other popular on-demand companies, including Uber and Postmates, do under the so-called 1099 model: Using an app platform, a network of independent contractors can sign up for flexible delivery shifts. On Amazon Flex, the company has these independent contractors collect packages from warehouses and bring them to customers’ homes in an hour or so. According to the Journal, the program works hand in hand with Amazon’s Prime Now service, where customers who sign up for the company’s $99-a-year unlimited shipping program can get items delivered to their doorstep for a fee in an as little as an hour. Prime Now is available in 13 cities, and the company will eventually expand Amazon Flex to cover those areas in addition to Seattle, the WSJ reports. This move is not surprising. Flex fits neatly into Amazon’s ultimate goal to own all retail. Over the years, Amazon has built up a massive logistics infrastructure to make convenient deliveries scalable. It’s poured money into building huge fulfillment centers near major metro areas, which has eaten hugely into the company’s bottom line. Now, owning a platform for on-demand workers on top of all that could help the company hammer out streamlined delivery routes using tracking software. The move also aligns with the company’s smart growth-before-profits strategy, which it’s ridden to great success (though, according to recent reports, oftentimes at the expense of a healthy work-life balance for employees). That’s a very different tack from most on-demand companies, which typically keep overhead costs low and rely on a vast pool of independent contractors to offer various services to consumers, ranging from deliveries to instant rides, home-cleaning, and laundry. With Flex, Amazon has adopted the on-demand worker strategy, and it has the added advantage of a sprawling logistics infrastructure to boot. It’s worth noting that Amazon has operated its Mechanical Turk platform for a while—where workers completed micro-tasks like transcription, data entry, image identification—but now apparently, Amazon thinks on-demand work can transfer well to maximizing the company’s operations in package logistics, too. But Flex does make Amazon yet another player in the contentious debate over whether independent contractors in the “gig” economy should be considered as employees. Recently, a slew of lawsuits have been filed against on-demand companies that employ 1099 contract workers, a model that gives contractors the option of flexible work at the expense of labor protections. This month, a federal judge in San Francisco granted class-action status to a suit brought by Uber drivers against the on-demand ride company. In a couple of instances, California state agencies have ruled that two ex-Uber drivers were employees of the company, not independent contractors, and were entitled to benefits. And in June, FedEx agreed to a settlement compensating around 2,000 delivery drivers who were deemed employees of the company, not contractors–a setup it’s hard not to compare to Amazon Flex. This is the complex legal mire Amazon is wading into with Flex. But even still, where efficiency is the name of the game, having its own on-demand workers might make good enough sense to justify the potential messiness.

This is down 2 percent from 2,931 incidents from January to June of last year. The northeast portion of the city still counts for most of the criminal activity (59 percent) with 1,707 incidents, a 9 percent increase from last year’s number of 1,558. Airway Heights Sgt. Robert Swan said the area, which includes Walmart, Cedar Summit Estates and Northern Quest Resort and Casino, generates many calls for the department. “You have people who camp at the casino, steal or prowl vehicles near Cedar Summit or at Walmart,” Swan said. “They affect the whole area.” Crime in the northwest part of the city was at 504 reports, a 23 percent decline from last year. The southeast portion of the city had a decrease in incidents (518-511) as did the southwestern area (302-258). Although overall crime stats are down, the Police Department conducted 636 reports, investigations and arrests, which is a 12 percent increase from last year. Traffic incidents increased. From January to June there were 816 traffic incidents, 127 more than last year. Leading the category were traffic tickets (402) and driving while license suspended/no valid driver’s license incidents (95). Injury collisions were at 13 and non-injury collisions were at 18. “I think they’re going to do some work at that intersection (in the future),” Swan said. “Accidents are up from last year (at Highway 2 and Hayford Road).” Incidents at Northern Quest dropped from 262 to 229 calls. The majority of the incidents were traffic violations (60), agency assists (82) and warrant arrests (31). Overall, agency assistance reports were at 339, which is 44 less than last year. Swan said the department recently hired a new officer, Erin Lance, who is “doing quite nicely.” He expects the department will hire more officers once the Spokane Tribe Economic Project is built. The department is also switching over to a new computer-aided dispatch and automated records management system with the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office and the cities of Spokane and Liberty Lake. Swan said the new system will change how officers fill out reports and the calls they’ll have on the computer. He added that the system is set to deploy on Oct. 3. “This is a huge thing for Spokane County, the city of Spokane and us,” Swan said. “We’re very excited. We’ll be on the same page as a lot of jurisdictions in the county.” Al Stover can be reached at al@cheneyfreepress.com.

Indeed, when the dog began barking, she had no idea what the commotion was about. “I heard a pop, and then another pop,” she said on Saturday afternoon. “I came out to the porch, and then I just saw the fire ball go up, and at that point, you just pray that whoever it was got away from it in time.” She called 9-1-1, she said, thinking perhaps a tractor had exploded in the neighboring pasture, and then went inside her home, waiting for the Maxwell Volunteer Fire Department to arrive and do their jobs. It wasn’t until nearly an hour later, when the Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides “chase team” arrived, just before 9 a.m. that Wylie began to understand the magnitude of what had just happened. As it turns out, the fire ball was the result of the tragic crash of the hot air balloon that went down after colliding with the LCRA high-power transmission lines that frame Wylie’s neighborhood, killing 16. The crash has been identified as the deadliest hot-air balloon crash in American history, and in fact, the second-most fatal in recent world history. Sharing the preliminary results of a Federal investigation on Monday afternoon, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) spokesman Robert Sumwalt said it appeared as though the craft was attempting to land, based on information received from members of the chase team, as well as physical evidence at the scene. “The top flap of the envelope (the balloon) was open, which would be consistent with bringing the craft in for a landing,” Sumwalt said. “The chase team said they had communicated with the pilot and he relayed his location [via a commercial smart phone app], which is the procedure for landing the craft and telling them where to pick up.” The last communication with the craft was at 7:26 a.m., Sumwalt said. Sometime between that communication, and the initial 9-1-1 call at 7:43 a.m., something went terribly wrong. “A very preliminary examination of the envelope shows no evidence of a pre-existing failure, or technical problems with the balloon itself,” Sumwalt said, noting that unlike airplanes, hot air balloons do not have “black boxes,” so piecing together the final moments of the flight would be difficult. He did note, however, that the envelope was rated to carry between 4,200-4,400 pounds, in addition to the weight of the envelope in conditions such as those that existed on Saturday morning. He said that NTSB would be investigating thoroughly to make a final determination, but speculated that the payload weight was likely not a factor in the crash. Sumwalt said interviews with the chase team indicated the crew had encountered heavy, patchy fog on their journey from the WalMart parking lot in San Marcos, where the crew initially met with their passengers, and the launch point at the SkyDive San Marcos airfield in Fentress. Despite the general beauty of Saturday morning, that fact, coupled with the rapidly rising temperatures and the size of the cornfield adjoining the crash site, allows for speculation that a phenomenon known as “corn sweat” contributed to lowered visibility in the area. “Corn sweat,” is a common term for the natural phenomenon of evapotranspiration, which, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, means that corn acts as a wick, sucking the moisture from surrounding soil and sloughing that moisture off into the atmosphere, adding to humidity rates and, in certain conditions, patchy fog. While there was no fog in the area as the 9 o’clock hour drew near on Saturday morning, a haze hung in the air, which burned off as temperatures climbed. Examination of the transmission lines near the crash site revealed evidence of arcing and showed a 30-foot area of “abrasions,” Sumwalt said. That, along with other collected evidence, suggested some part of the craft, likely the gondola, made contact with the transmission lines likely causing the gondola to plummet to the ground. The envelope was found, largely intact, nearly a mile away. A source with information on the investigation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was likely the 16 victims of the crash were killed instantly upon the craft’s contact with the lines. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the gondola’s cramped confines, the passengers and crew would have created one large circuit, allowing the current to transmit one to another at breakneck speed, likely taking their lives before they had the chance to realize it had happened. Until the tragedy struck, it seems, the flight itself was uneventful – merely a pleasant Saturday morning journey amongst old and new friends. Additional information on the flight’s final moments will be available in the coming days and weeks, as the investigation proceeds. The Investigation Details remain sketchy and speculation looms while Federal, State and local crews sift through mountains of evidence related to the hot air balloon that crashed in the Maxwell area on Saturday morning, killing all 16 souls aboard. The craft, a Kubicek BB85Z hot air balloon, is one of only a handful of the specialized, high-tenacity polyester balloons (approximately 110) in operation in the United States. The manufacturer, based in the Czech Republic, has historically manufactured fewer than 100 balloons per year. The company also manufactures baskets which accommodate up to 32 passengers, though it is unclear what type or size basket was attached to the Heart of Texas balloon when it went down. According to Robert Sumwalt, a spokesman for the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB), the remains of the balloon (envelope) and the basket (gondola) are being transported this week to an aircraft salvage facility in the Dallas area, where they will be kept in a secure location for further study and investigation. “Our primary goal is to find out why this happened, so we can keep it from happening again,” Sumwalt said. What is known, Sumwalt said in a press briefing on Monday afternoon, is that the craft launched from the Fentress Airpark (Skydive San Marcos) after 7 a.m. on Saturday morning, for what was expected to be a one-hour tour. The crash occurred, some 40 minutes later and eight miles, as the crow flies, just past the intersection of Jolley Road and Cistern Road, near Maxwell. “The chase team said they maintained contact with the pilot through a [commercial smart phone] app,” Sumwalt said. “At 7:26 a.m., the chase team said they had contact with the pilot, who gave them a location, which is generally an indication that the craft is about to land.” Sumwalt said the app, known as “Glimpse,” is not Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved, but is rather a commercial application available to the public. It was unclear, he said, how far the crash site is from the coordinates the pilot shared with the chase team. However, he said that communication was the last the chase team had with the pilot. They spent more than an hour, he said, attempting to raise the pilot via cell phone, and even calling passengers on the balloon, before stumbling on to the crash scene, just before 9 a.m. on Saturday. Despite better than two days of near-continuous information-gathering from Saturday morning until Monday afternoon, details remained in short supply when NTSB officially closed the scene on Monday, transferring their investigative efforts to labs and data centers in Washington, D.C. “Many of our investigators have left today, and the rest will be leaving tomorrow, or at the latest, Wednesday,” Sumwalt told the Monday afternoon press gathering. “But this is just the first step of this investigation.” He said personal electronic devices, including cell phones, cameras and tablets, had been collected and were being shipped to Washington as part of the investigation. “Of course, if people… if family or friends have photographs, videos, or anything else [the victims of this tragedy] sent out before or during the flight, we want to see those,” he said. Any information, he said, would help investigators to piece together what brought about the tragic end of the Saturday morning flight. Sumwalt said there were three main factors at play in determining the cause of the crash: the equipment, the operator and the environment. The equipment, according to Sumwalt, appears at first blush to have been effective and up-to-date. He said the equipment log on the balloon itself dated from the 2014 production date until September 2015, and showed a current maintenance and inspection record. However, records after September 2015 were unavailable. Sumwalt said the current maintenance log may have been on board at the time of the crash, and hence destroyed in the blaze. However, inspection and registration on the craft were timely, he said, and the envelope showed no immediate signs of defect or technical deficiency. The pilot, identified by Heart of Texas Balloon Rides as owner and lead pilot Alfred “Skip” Nichols, was lauded by many former passengers as “a great pilot,” who loved sharing the joy of the first flight with his passengers. Though a past record of substance abuse issues has come to light in recent days, Nichols was largely regarded as a “safety-first” pilot, who had no qualms about cancelling flights if conditions were not favorable for ballooning trips. Nichols received his commercial balloon pilot license in 1996, and friends say he had been in recovery for his prior substance abuse issues for more than four years. The environment is somewhat of an “X-Factor.” Ground crews reported incidences of heavy fog in low-lying areas, during their van journey from the WalMart parking lot at San Marcos, to the launch site in Fentress. Sumwalt noted the crew launched “test balloons” at both locations to determine wind direction and atmospheric conditions. However, he said, it is difficult to ascertain whether wind speeds or other conditions changed during the course of flight. It could be weeks, or even months, according to NTSB, to determine the totality of the factors that brought Saturday morning’s flight so tragically to the ground. The Loved Ones Lost Voices have raised in support and grief since Saturday morning, as details emerge identifying the 16 victims killed in the tragic Maxwell-area crash. Caldwell County Justice of the Peace Matt Keily, as of Friday, had confirmed the names of 13 of the victims. The three remaining victims will be identified using either dental records or DNA. However, social media and other sources have been more forthcoming, as friends and families take to the Internet to remember 16 men and women who set out for a Saturday morning adventure and, heartbreakingly, never came home. Paige and Lorilee Brabson (Confirmed) Setting out for a day of mother-and-daughter fun, Lorilee and Paige Brabson boarded the gondola on Saturday morning after posting several silly selfies, as they set out to enjoy a girls’ day out purchased by Paige, a cosmetology student and server at La Hacienda in San Antonio. Paige was the mother of an 11-month-old daughter; it was the child’s father who initially broke the tragic news of Paige’s passing on social media. The trip was reported to have been a gift from Paige to her mother, who family members said had a “bucket list wish” to take a hot air balloon ride. The pair, both natives of Colorado Springs, Colo., were said to have moved recently to San Antonio. Both posted several photos and videos to their social media accounts, according to family members, and appeared to thoroughly enjoy the trip before tragedy struck. Paige leaves behind her infant child and a brother, while Lorilee leaves a son, siblings, and several other family members. A GoFundMe account has been set up to benefit Paige’s daughter, and services have not been announced as of press time.   Ross and Sandra Chalk (Confirmed) The Wimberley couple, evidently celebrating their first anniversary, will be remembered for their kind spirits and acts of service in their community, and through their jobs. Scott and Laura Douglas (Confirmed) Scott, 47, took his wife, Laura, 46, a Realtor whom he married only three years ago, on what friends called a “romantic getaway.” Neither could have known the day would end in heartbreak. Scott met his wife at Caterpillar, Inc., in Victoria where both worked. According to a friend, the two hit it off instantly, and Laura wanted to take the balloon ride to do something “fun, different and romantic.”  Scott changed careers, moving to Multi-Chem in 2014, according to friends. He later transferred to a division of Occidental Chemical Corporation, and the couple planned to sell their Victoria home and move to the beach, a friend told the Victoria Advocate this week. Social media posts to the couple’s accounts suggest Laura had a son, and the couple shared a dog together. Services for the pair have not been announced. John and Stacee Gore (Confirmed) For some time, John and Stacee Gore planned to celebrate their May 18, 2013, anniversary soaring through the clouds on a hot air balloon. Earlier trips had been cancelled, but the pieces fell into place, and the couple were able to travel from their Mineral Wells home to San Marcos for their long-awaited third anniversary celebration. John, 33, was the father of two sons, Tyler and Kyle. His wife Stacee, 31, brought to their blended marriage her two children, Daysee and Devin. Together, the two were preparing to take life by the horns, with their children, one who suffers from autism, tucked safely between their wings. Both were active in Cavalry Baptist Church in Mineral Wells, and both hoped to enroll their children in a Christian school. Suffering setbacks several years ago related to alleged arson cases in 2011, family members said John was committed to turning his life around, and building a life with his new wife. The pair leave behind their four children, their parents, and many loving siblings, family members and friends. A joint memorial for the couple is slated on Saturday, Aug. 6, at 10 a.m. at First Baptist Church in Mineral Wells. Holly Huckabee Holly Smith Huckabee, 50, was a founding member of The River United Methodist Church in Richmond. Friends said she was so eager for the dawn balloon flight that she asked to take off work early on Friday, in order to prepare. Church members expressed their condolences on the congregation’s Facebook page, noting her unshakeable faith, her caring and service to her family and her church, and her infectious smiles. The Church said services would be announced when information became available. The Katy-based paralegal and native of Jal, N.M., posted a photograph of the Heart of Texas Balloon Rides gondola on her Facebook page shortly before the launch, friends said. She leaves behind a son, a daughter and two grandsons. Brian and Tressie Neill (Confirmed) At 3:53 a.m. on Saturday morning, Tressie Neill posted a “selfie,” proclaiming she was “up early heading out to the anniversary surprise Brian’s had planned for months.” The San Antonio couple was celebrating 23 years of marriage. Her final social media post came at 6:12 a.m., a message stating, “Do you ever look at your child and start smiling? Not because your child did something amazing, just smiling because that’s who God blessed you with.” Friends seized on the message, noting that even to the last, Tressie loved her children and her God. While the balloon was in the air, husband Brian texted his brother a photograph, asking, “can you see our reflection in the clouds?” A GoFundMe.com page dedicated to helping to raise money for their funeral expenses notes, “Both believers in Jesus, we know both of their souls are now with the Lord, and our family will forever see their reflection in the clouds.” The pair leave behind two daughters, aged 16 and 20. Services have not been announced. Alfred “Skip” Nichols (C0nfirmed) Balloonist and dog lover, Skip Nichols, 49, will be remembered as a friendly and free-spirited man, who loved sharing his passion with his passengers. The owner and chief pilot of Heart of Texas Balloon Rides, Nichols often posted photos and videos of himself and his passengers to his personal and business social media feeds. Without exception, the photos illustrate what his friends’ accounts have said, that Nichols loved life, loved flying, and enjoyed being able to share the experience with others. Apart from balloons, Nichols’ social media accounts were flooded with photos of his beloved pets. Indeed, when news of the crash broke, friends attempted coordinate almost immediately the care of the animals, knowing that it was what Nichols would have wanted. Though he had rocky times and substance abuse issues, friends said Nichols had been sober nearly four years, and suggested in that sobriety, Nichols was able to find even more joy and passion for life. He leaves behind his mother, his sister, and many loving friends, both in Texas and in his native St. Louis, Mo. Joe and Tresa Owens (Confirmed) Joe and Tresa Shafer Owens, of Katy, will be remembered as caring friends and devoted, loving parents. According to his Facebook page, Joe worked at H-E-B, and checked into the San Marcos Comfort Suites at 4:07 p.m. on Friday, before joining “my love and bestest friend, Holly [Huckabee]” for dinner at the Root Cellar later that evening. Friends said Tresa had been an employee at Katy’s Tiger-Land Day Care for nearly 25 years, a place where Joe was often a fixture, as well. “The school does a Thanksgiving dinner, and Joe always takes a vacation day from work to come and help,” one said. The pair leave behind three children and four grandchildren, who are frequent fixtures on their social media accounts. There was no record of services scheduled at press time, but family friends had opened a GoFundMe.com account requesting help for the children to finance their final arrangements. They were believed to be traveling with Huckabee, and the three had apparently been looking forward to the trip for some time. Matt and Sunday Rowan (Confirmed) Matt and Sunday Stewart Rowan, both 34, were avid volleyball players. It was, in fact, Matt’s missing a volleyball tournament that triggered friends to wonder whether he and his new bride, only just married in February, had been involved in Saturday’s tragedy. Matt, a researcher and Aggie (Class of ’04), was recently promoted to chief of clinical trials for burns and trauma at Brook Army Medical Center’s Institute of Surgical Research. His wife, described as “perpetually cheerful,” was an employee at San Antonio Boutique Crazy 8. They leave behind Sunday’s son, and a host of family members and friends.

Since oil prices began to fall in mid-2014, cheap crude has been blamed for 195,000 job cuts in the U.S., according to a report published on Thursday by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. It’s an enormous toll that is especially painful because these tend to be well-paying jobs. The average pay in the oil and gas industry is 84% higher than the national average, according to Goldman Sachs. Those are good paying jobs that are not easy to replace, and unfortunately the jobs losses appear to be accelerating.  In their new report, Challenger, Gray & Christmas went on to say that 95,000 of those job cuts have come in 2016, and 17,725 of them were in July alone. We also got some other bad news for the U.S. economy on Thursday. Factory orders are down again, and at this point U.S. factory orders have now been down on a year over year basis for 20 months in a row.  That is the longest streak in all of U.S. history. Needless to say, we have never seen such a thing happen outside of a recession. In addition, it is being reported that U.S. banks have been tightening lending standardsfor four quarters in a row. Once again, this is something that has never happened outside of a recession. On top of all that, tax receipts continue to plummet.  This is a very bad sign for the economy, because falling tax receipts are usually a sign that we are headed into a recession.  The following comes from Zero Hedge… July “Withheld” receipts – those tax and withholding payments that come straight from wage earner pay stubs – are down 1.0% year over year.  This data series can be choppy, and looking at the three month trailing average yields a 3.1%.  That’s a touch slower than the 2016 YTD comp of 3.3%, and tells us to not expect too much from Friday’s number. Also worth noting: YTD non-withheld tax receipts (such as those that come from “Gig economy” workers) are down 6.5%, and July’s comp is 15% lower than a year ago. Last, corporate tax receipts are down 11% YTD, and if the current pace of these payments holds it will be the first negative comp since 2011. Bottom line: if the tax man isn’t as busy, can the U.S. economy really be expanding? Are you starting to see a pattern here? And let’s review what else we have learned over the past couple of weeks… -U.S. GDP growth came in at an extremely disappointing 1.2 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and the first quarter was revised down to 0.8 percent. -The rate of homeownership in the United States has fallen to the lowest level ever. -The Wall Street Journal says that this is the weakest “economic recovery” since 1949. -Barack Obama is on track to be the only president in U.S. history to never have a single year of 3 percent GDP growth. Meanwhile, things continue to get worse around the rest of the planet as well.  For example, the economic depression in Brazil continues to deepen and it is being reported that the Brazilian economy has now been shrinking for five quarters in a row… Brazil’s economy, the world’s ninth largest, contracted by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, marking the fifth straight quarter it shrank. Last year, Brazil’s gross domestic product fell to its lowest level since 2009. Inflation has also shot higher recently, rising 9 percent in 2015, from 6.3 percent in 2014, according to data from the World Bank. Energy as a percentage of exports, meanwhile, fell to 7 percent in 2015, from 9 percent in the previous year. And of course Brazil is hosting the Olympics this summer, and that is turning out to be a major debacle.  Many of the international athletes will actually be rowing, sailing and swimming in open waters that are highly contaminated by raw sewage, and Brazilian police have been welcoming tourists to Rio with a big sign that says “Welcome To Hell“.  And let us not forget that right next door in Venezuela the economic collapse has gotten so bad that people are killing and eating zoo animals. As the global economy continues to deteriorate, what should we do? Legendary investor Bill Gross shared some of his thoughts on the matter in his latest Investment Outlook… “Negative returns and principal losses in many asset categories are increasingly possible unless nominal growth rates reach acceptable levels,” Gross said in his latest Investment Outlook note published Wednesday. “I don’t like bonds; I don’t like most stocks; I don’t like private equity. Real assets such as land, gold, and tangible plant and equipment at a discount are favored asset categories.” I tend to agree with Gross.  Bonds are in a tremendous bubble right now, and the stock market bubble has grown to ridiculous proportions.  In the end, the only wealth that you are going to be able to fully rely on is wealth that you can physically have in your possession. As you have seen in this article, signs of economic decline are all around us. And yet, many people out there are still convinced that good times are right around the corner. What is it going to take to convince them that they are wrong? http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-has-lost-195000-good-paying-energy-industry-jobs Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket Related This entry was posted in News.

I work for the First United Methodist Church as an outreach person. At our harvest table dinner, we feed over 100 individuals every Tuesday night. On the nights we have a free pantry, which is every second and fourth Tuesday of the month, we distribute groceries to 120 families and clients. Besides all this we offer a free breakfast to the public, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m .to 9 a.m., and at least 30 to 40 people participate. The breakfast is solely funded by donations as we are running on a shoestring budget. Since I started working here over four years ago, I have seen an increase of about 45 percent in the people who are looking for help. More than half have low-paying jobs and are barely making it. What we need in Pittsfield is industry jobs or some type of stable jobs that offer a survival rate of hourly pay. It is a shame that after a pantry night, the pantry is almost bare. It's a good thing that nothing gets wasted, but this shows us that there are a lot of people who need extra help. Joseph J.

EST August 05, 2016 Stephen Rankin gives testimony during the sentencing phase of his trial.  A jury convicted Rankin of voluntary manslaughter in the death of William Chapman. (Photo: 13News Now) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WVEC) - A jury has found Stephen Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of William Chapman. After further deliberations on Wednesday afternoon, they then recommended to a judge that Rankin serve two and a half years in prison. Prosecutors had sought a maximum sentence of 10 years. Rankin was not taken into custody. The judge will make the final decision on what Rankin's sentence will be at a future court date. The jury did not convict on the first-degree murder charge prosecutors sought in the case of the Portsmouth police officer, who was fired as he awaited trial. But criminal charges are rare in police-involved shootings, and convictions are even more uncommon. Rankin shot 18-year-old William Chapman in the face and chest outside a Walmart last year, after a security guard accused the teen of shoplifting. No video recorded the killing, and testimony conflicted on the details. Vol manslaughter means this was a heat of passion killing, not that there was premeditation— Laura Geller (@13LauraGeller) August 4, 2016 After the verdict was read, witness testimony was given for the jury to consider with the sentencing.  Rankin himself went back on the stand. When asked if he had anything he wanted to tell the Chapman family, Rankin replied, "I've actually wanted to say this for some time: I think this is a terrible tragedy. I wish it never occurred."  Some people leaving the courtroom are NOT happy with sentencing...calling it ridiculous. #Rankin— Chenue Her (@ChenueHer) August 4, 2016 Before the jury had reached a verdict Wednesday morning, defense attorneys filed a motion for a mistrial, and offered security video that showed a Chapman family friend interacting with a juror on Wednesday. The woman, identified in court as Ms. James told the judge she recognized the young man, but didn't realize he was a juror. She told the judge that when she realized he was, she and him took separate elevators. On Thursday, Broccoletti said that after court Wednesday, he and Belote saw Sallie Chapman hugging Ms. James in the grassy area between the Pavilion and the back of the courthouse. Broccoletti said James then got into Sallie Chapman's car and left. He stated this is further proof that Ms. James should be banned from the courtroom, but the judge denied that request. William Chapman II   (Photo: Family photo) The jury, made up of seven women and five men, had the following charges to consider: 1st Degree Murder 2nd Degree Murder Voluntary Manslaughter Use of a fire arm in commission of felony Since the jury found Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter, he cannot be convicted on the use of a fire arm in commission of a felony. According to Jon Babineau, the attorney for the family of William Chapman, tells 13News Now that the family will be filing a lawsuit against Rankin and the City of Portsmouth in the next few weeks. Rankin will be officially sentenced October 12 at the Portsmouth Circuit Court. Attorneys for Rankin cannot file for appeal until after the formal sentencing.  PHOTOS: Former officer Stephen Rankin murder trial Loading... Stephen D. Rankin's booking photo Portsmouth Police Dept.

(AP) -- Investigators of a bus crash that killed four passengers in Central California are collecting the driver's medical records and lining up interviews with his family. Robert Accetta of the National Transportation Safety Board says his team wants to know how much rest 57-year-old Mario David Vasquez got in the days leading up the crash. They want to determine whether fatigue played a role. The bus veered off a San Joaquin Valley highway before dawn Tuesday and struck an exit sign post. It tore through the vehicle, which was carrying 27 people. Federal and CHP investigators are also checking the bus company's records and making detailed inspections of the damaged bus, the highway sign and the roadway to determine what caused the crash. Special prosecutor named for Laquan McDonald murder case CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge on Thursday appointed a special prosecutor to handle the murder case against the white Chicago police officer who shot a black teenager 16 times, video of which led to large protests and the eventual ouster of the city's police superintendent. At a hearing, Cook County Circuit Judge Vincent Gaughan swore in Kane County State's Attorney Joseph McMahon to handle the prosecution of Officer Jason Van Dyke. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder last year in the 2014 killing of Laquan McDonald just hours before authorities released the police dash-cam video showing him repeatedly shooting the teenager. After the hearing, McMahon told reporters that three prosecutors from Kane County and one from Winnebago County will assist him in the case. Rare conviction made in shooting by police officer PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) -- Prosecutors in Virginia won a rare conviction of a white former police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen suspected of shoplifting. But the guilty verdict Thursday was for voluntary manslaughter, a lesser charge than the original first-degree murder count. And the jury recommended a 2 ? year prison sentence for Stephen Rankin, a punishment far below the decade prosecutors had sought. The outcome is typical of the rare conviction that follows a shooting by police, said Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Juries are very reluctant to convict on-duty officers of murder "because they all recognize that policing is difficult and violent," Stinson said. Arrest made in deaths of twins found in hot car in Georgia CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- An arrest has been made in the deaths of twin 15-month-old girls found in a hot car in northwest Georgia. News outlets report the girls' father, Asa North of Carrollton, was arrested early this morning. Online jail records show North is charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of reckless conduct. Carrollton police say someone discovered the twins unresponsive in the back seat of an SUV parked in front of a duplex Thursday night. Arriving officers found people holding the girls in a nearby baby pool, trying to cool the children off. Some had ice packs. The twins were taken to a hospital, where they were pronounced dead. Police said the mother was in Atlanta at the time. It isn't immediately clear if North has an attorney. Sheriff: Jail inmate slugs man charged in church massacre CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Dylann Roof, the white man charged in the massacre of nine black parishioners at a Charleston church, was slugged Thursday by a black inmate at the South Carolina jail where he is being held, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said. Dwayne Stafford ran down the stairs from his cell after Roof went to the shower around 7:45 a.m. and hit him, bruising Roof's face and back, according to a police report. The 22-year-old Roof was examined by jail medical personnel and returned to his cell at the Charleston County Detention Center, Sheriff's Maj. Eric Watson told The Associated Press. Although authorities initially said Stafford would be charged with assault, Cannon told reporters that Roof and his attorneys don't want to press charges. The 26-year-old Stafford is awaiting trial on first-degree assault and strong-armed robbery charges. Wal-Mart launches new scheduling system NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart is launching a new scheduling system in nearly 700 Neighborhood Market stores that gives hourly workers more certainty about their schedules. Executive Vice President Mark Ibbotson said Thursday it was launched in late July and could be rolled out to all 4,600 U.S. Wal-Mart stores. Workers have two options. Fixed shifts guarantee the same weekly hours for up to six months. Those with unfixed schedules can choose based on the hours offered. Wal-Mart says it will better predict the staff needed during peak hours and where and when to deploy them. CDC director: Miami mosquitoes succumbing to aerial sprays DORAL, Fla. (AP) -- The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says aerial spraying of the insecticide naled is killing many mosquitoes in a Miami neighborhood where the insects apparently transmitted Zika to 15 people. Dr. Tom Frieden says aerial spraying that began Thursday quickly killed adult mosquitoes that pesticides on the ground couldn't reach. Puerto Rico's governor wouldn't authorize naled's use because of environmental concerns, despite widespread Zika infections there. Frieden says minuscule amounts sprayed at dawn and dusk have no effect on people. Appeals court rejects request to postpone voter ID decision RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- An appeals court has quickly decided it won't delay enforcement of its ruling striking down North Carolina's photo identification requirement and other election restrictions, including reducing early in-person voting by seven days. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the stay Thursday, one day after state leaders' attorneys requested that last week's ruling be set aside as they prepare to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case. A 4th Circuit panel had determined a 2013 law Republicans approved amounted to intentional discrimination of black voters. Thursday's order says the harm to disenfranchised voters outweighs granting a delay. Last week's injunction means no voter ID mandate and 17 days of early voting with same-day registration. The state has other options to seek a delay. 12 killed, 15 injured in rebel attack in India's Assam state GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Officials say that at least 12 people have been killed and 15 others injured after rebels opened fire in a crowded market in Assam state in India's remote northeast. Top local police official L.R. Bishnoi said that six rebels fired automatic weapons and lobbed grenades today in the market in Balajan, an area just outside the town of Kokrajhar in western Assam. Bishnoi says one gunman was killed by security forces and troops are pursuing five others who fled. Several homes and shops were badly damaged in the attack. Police blame a faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland for the attack. The group is seeking an independent homeland for the region's Bodo tribespeople. Malaysia confirms Flight 370 course was on pilot's simulator KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia acknowledged for the first time that one of the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had plotted a course on his home flight simulator to the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing jet is believed to have crashed. Australian officials overseeing the search for the plane last month said data recovered from Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah's simulator included a flight path to the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysian officials at the time refused to confirm the findings. South Africa's ruling party suffering biggest electoral blow JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- With 95 percent of votes counted in municipal elections, South Africa's ruling party appears to have suffered its biggest electoral blow since it won power at the end of the apartheid era 22 years ago. The results remain too close to call in the country's largest city, Johannesburg, and the Tshwane region around the capital, Pretoria. The opposition Democratic Alliance is challenging the ANC in both areas. The ANC has lost a key municipality named after its star, Nelson Mandela Bay, to the Democratic Alliance. South Africa's ruling party, formerly the main anti-apartheid movement, has lost some support from people who say their hopes for economic opportunities have not been fulfilled since the end of white minority rule. Scandals swirling around President Jacob Zuma have also hurt the ANC.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/23/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Monday, November 21, 2016 Volunteers to cook up holiday spirit in city with meal delivery Saturday, November 19, 2016 Experienced core will be key for Northville Friday, November 18, 2016 Mayfield returns four starters; also has talented 6-foot-5 eighth grader in the mix Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Fulton County supervisors give approval to $97M draft budget Friday, November 18, 2016 From The Recorder Archives Saturday, November 19, 2016 Thomas to replace Cramer as undersheriff Saturday, November 19, 2016 Sophie Malkowicz Friday, November 18, 2016 City gun buyback yields less, but still viewed as a success Thursday, November 17, 2016 Police report Friday, November 18, 2016 Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Jury convicts Thomas Mair of murdering UK lawmaker Jo Cox (0) Oh please, not another gratitude list (0) The News in Brief (0) University police officer shot in head (0) Airstrike hits bridge, disrupting IS supply lines (0) Trump taps Gov.

A worker pushes shopping carts in front of a Wal-Mart store in La Habra, Calif. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) Employees at Walmart Neighborhood Market stores have received more control over their work shifts -- and the new system could come to all 4,600 of the chain's stores in the U.S. Walmart launched a new scheduling system last month at the 700 smaller-format neighborhood stores to give workers the ability to have fixed shifts every week for six months, or to be able to choose hours based on those offered, the Associated Press reports. The goal is to raise worker morale by giving employees more control and more predictability to their shifts. Walmart has already taken other steps that it hopes will improve the lives of its employees, including raising wages, and mollify critics. Walmart says the new system is an improvement because is it also allows it to better forecast how large of a workforce it will need during peak hours. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2aHqf99

He spoke with eMarketer’s Lauren Fisher about the industry’s cross-device attribution capabilities. eMarketer: How critical is it to crack cross-device attribution in today’s marketing world? Michael Lampert: Right now, the channels are innovating faster than we can come up with ways to count them. With the explosion of all of these different devices, the industry is looking to give proper credit in an ecosystem that just got more complicated than it ever was when we were just doing this between search and display. “If you’re Wal-Mart, Amazon or Target and you can use your own data and tie it back to in-store activity or brick-and-mortar activity, you’re the exception, not the rule.” eMarketer: Where does this leave companies like [digital ad agency] 360i trying to make sense of this increasingly complex world? Lampert: I think companies are doing the best they can, given the fact that there is no perfect solution. If you’re Wal-Mart, Amazon or Target and you can use your own data and tie it back to in-store activity or brick-and-mortar activity, you’re the exception, not the rule. We are a ways away from the perfect attribution for digital, but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I just think the attribution is mirroring the complexity. The attribution companies can’t customize a product for every client, so they try to create things that are useful to the majority. In my experience, third-party attribution is really for guidance: It’s not 100% useful because with all of the different data sources that you’re being asked to own, track and integrate, unless you have one corresponding data-management-platform-like object where everybody can go in and access the same data set, it’s very hard to come up with the true value of the impression. eMarketer: What are agencies doing about this? Lampert: A lot of agencies like us are investing in advanced analytics practices where we have guys with PhDs in linear math looking at terabytes of data to try and find patterns within campaigns that can help us optimize better and look at the way we allocate dollars across channels. Because of this, you also see a lot of agencies looking at marketing mix model products to take that campaign response data and look at the relationship between channels in order to answer that very important question of “Where should the next dollar go?” We also use some third parties to tie back digital exposure to offline purchases, which we think is very important considering potentially 80% to 90% of purchases are not happening on-site. There has to be a way to tie back digital exposure to offline purchases. Purchase data is really mission-critical now. “There has to be a way to tie back digital exposure to offline purchases. Purchase data is really mission-critical now.” eMarketer: How satisfied have you been with existing capabilities for matching digital and offline data? Lampert: There are limitations, but I’m willing to accept some gray area in the absence of a perfect model. There’s no one unifying way to tie back everything from search data to direct mail files. And then you have to match those files up to devices, transactions and then some sort of closed loop. Obviously, there are challenges with device matching, whether it’s shared devices or cookie deletion. And then consider that any given financial services provider using purchase data only has access to their own purchase data.

Zoerhof, a Criminal Intelligence Command special agent assigned to the Marine Corps Detachment at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo. and an instructor for the U.S. Army Military Police School, brought a man back to life after he was suffering from a suspected heroin overdose. Zoerhof was in Charleston last weekend to teach a criminal investigation course to a group of U.S. Army Reserve special agent soldiers from the 200th Military Police Command, staff there said. On Saturday, July 30, Zoerhof was leaving Wal-Mart with his co-worker, Martin Schultz, when the pair saw a woman struggling to keep a man upright. Schultz said they were about to exit the parking lot when Zoerhof saw the struggling man fall. He said they made a U-turn and went to check on the couple. "I asked the lady, 'Ma'am, is he OK?' and she just looked at me with a glossed looked in her eyes, and I knew right away that she was high on something or just drunk," Zoerhof said in a press release issued by the military. "When I told her to call 911, she said, 'No, don't call 911!' and I told her, 'Look lady, he's going to die. I mean he's dead right now.'" Zoerhof said he called the paramedics right away and informed them there was no sign of life and the man's eyes had rolled back in his head. "While I was on the phone with the 911 operator, I told her I was going to start chest compressions, and she asked if I was CPR certified and if I had a dephibrillator," Zoerhof said. "I was like, 'Lady, I'm 400 yards from Wal-Mart.'" Zoerhof, once a CPR instructor, said he began chest compressions on the victim while on the phone with 911. It was his first real experience - he had never actually performed CPR on anyone but mannequins. "All I can remember is when you start chest compressions, you can't stop until paramedics arrive," Zoerhof said. "Once you sink 2 inches down into the chest, even if you hear a rib crack, you have got to keep going. All I could think was, 'Please Jesus, don't let this guy die. Put life back into him. Anything.'" 60 compressions in, the man's heart began to beat again. And around the 200th compression, paramedics arrived on scene. Schultz said paramedics were familiar with the man and his drug use habits. They gave him two pumps of Narcan, a drug used to counteract opioid overdoses, but he didn't budge. Zoerhof said he learned the man was released from the hospital later that day. "I wanted to visit that guy in the hospital and tell him he should really rethink his life and that it was no coincidence that I was there," Zoerhof said. "I mean, the odds of us going to Wal-Mart at that time and missing the items we missed in the check-out line that we had to go back for made the timing too perfect for him to not die."

But, the human resource departments of quite a few Indian companies are not taking any chances and have already started holding brainstorming sessions on the wildly popular augmented reality game’s impact on the workplace. The reason for their worry: Poké-trouble at the office has gone viral on social media, with several companies in the US and Australia grappling with the issue of how to deal with their Pokémon-obsessed staffers. There has been an avalanche of reports of employees who lost their jobs, or almost did, because they played Pokémon GO at work. Boeing has reportedly sent out a company-wide memo announcing that employees are banned from playing the game at work due to "a near-miss for a user getting hurt while playing the game”. And one Reddit user, who claims to be a manager at a Walmart location, posted in the Walmart subreddit that a supervisor had to be fired for neglecting his duties at work in favour of catching a Pokémon. But, it isn’t the big boys alone who are worried about the game that has surpassed Twitter as the most popular current mobile app. Earlier this month, Imgur user Richard Korry posted a photo of a notice that his company had left on his desk warning employees of consequences if they are caught playing the game at work. The notice says: “We are paying you to work, not chase fictional video game characters with your cell phone all day. Save it for your break time or lunch. Otherwise, you'll have plenty of time unemployed to 'catch them all'." Another post says: “This game is the perfect antithesis to 21st century bosses who want to make you work like a donkey”. There are tweets galore on employees’ concerns. While one says he hates waking up earlier than usual for work so that he has enough time to play Pokémon on the go, yet another recounts a job interview that left the employer stunned. The conversation went as follows: Interviewer: “Why do you want to work with us”? Answer: “Because there is a Blastoise here”. Blastoise is one of the top monsters in the game. There is more. According to one post by a 23-year-old employee, company officials confiscated his iPhone when they discovered he was using his phone's camera to play the game which, as one employer said, has all the trappings of mega distraction with its mystery, fantasy and escapism. Another message on Twitter quotes an employee as saying she is happy that her place of work is located on a Pokéstop and how the game has become her life now.  Even the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) has cautioned employers on the potential for an employee to be hurt and the company to be culpable for the injury. This is a real concern for employers, who anyway cite smartphone texting as the biggest distraction, followed by general non-work related internet use and workplace gossip. For them, the invasion of Pokémon GO is a much bigger problem that has the potential to bring down productivity. But HR managers can take heart from the fact that not all is lost. Many say the game has several positive qualities that can facilitate bonding among employees during free time, as it gets people talking, working together and sharing something that is not only exploratory, but competitive. In any case, it’s unrealistic to assume that a majority of employees would be dropping their duties to play the game. Also, in the end, it’s just a game and something fun that may encourage social interaction with co-workers. What is required is a well-formulated strategy on how employers might need to adjust things to make sure they can maintain an appropriate level of productivity. Instead of panic reaction, employers need to communicate their rules around mobile device use during working hours so that boundaries are set for employees and they know clearly where to draw the line. A little bit of counselling in some cases will do no harm.

The move is expected to give Wal-Mart an improved e-commerce solution to better fend off Amazon, which has recently become the largest retailer by market cap. Sources claim Jet could be valued as high as $3 billion, even though it has been unprofitable since launch. Jet launched last year as an "Amazon killer" but it has yet to make a dent. The company also had to backtrack on a subscription fee they began charging after sales were significantly affected. Wal-Mart could certainly use the e-commerce help, as the company's e-commerce sales were just $14 billion last year, a measly 3% of their total revenue. Online growth has been slowing for two years, as well, while Amazon's has done nothing but grow at an exponential rate for the last decade. Jet, started by Diapers.com founder Marc Lore, has some interesting technology. The company is able to reduce prices (and usually undercut Amazon, others) using sophisticated pricing algorithms that take into account the size of your cart, your proximity to suppliers, and more.

The Jet.com experience is bland, boring, uneventful and doesn't do well to engage me in anything other than what I specifically came to buy. Amazon draws me in to other stuff effortlessly. I always thought Jet was doomed but Walmart buying them should be interesting if not funny. yet another frivolous venture by fatcats that have so much money to waste and burn in lark ventures that all too often don't pan out and fail. This will be one of them. I don't see Jet doing ANYTHING for Walmart that they haven't already tried to no avail. 27.8.2016 15:48 Mrguss Send private message to this user Senior Member Amazon get Diapers long time ago and it was their best move ever...buying Jet was just to make sure the Amazon success. Jet isn't go to nowhere. Live Free or Die. The rule above all the rules is: Survive ! Capitalism: Funnel most of the $$$ to the already rich. 314.8.2016 0:28 Bryan3404 Send private message to this user Junior Member I am not impressed with Jet anyway. I wanted to buy a sound system they had on their website for $250. I waited a day to buy so that I could measure my living room space to make sure it fit. The next day they had jacked up the price to $299.99. There was no way that I was going to pay a $50 mark up in one day. I noticed that Walmart had it cheaper at like $265 and so I messaged the people at Jet to see it they would give it to me for the original price and that Walmart even had it for cheaper. They told me that if Walmart had it for cheaper than to buy it from them. What?? This is not a way to do business. I then saw it on Amazon for $217 and bought it from Amazon.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala., Aug. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Fifty of the best bass anglers in the world converged on Wheeler Lake in Huntsville, Alabama, this morning for the Forrest Wood Cup presented by Walmart, the world-championship of professional bass fishing. The four-day competition, which awards a top cash prize of $300,000, will feature a full field of anglers Friday before cutting to the top 20 on Saturday, and to the final 10 on championship Sunday. Link to photo of Day One leader John Cox Link to HD video of Cox's weighing in his leading limit Pro John Cox of Debary, Florida, weighed a five-bass limit totaling 16 pounds, 11 ounces, to take the early lead after Day One on the water. Cox holds a slim 1-pound, 13-ounce, lead over Brandon McMillian of Clewiston, Florida, who caught five bass weighing 14-14, good for second place. Cox said he spent his day on the south end of the lake dissecting a 300-yard creek arm off of the main river. He said it was one of four arms that he had hit during practice. "I was on my way into a hole that I figured no one could get to, and I ended up catching them on the way back there," said Cox, who won the FLW Tour event on Lake Hartwell earlier this season. "It took about 40 minutes to get in there. There were a lot of logs I had to go across." Cox said he caught 10 fish along his path using a variety of baits including a buzzbait, spinnerbait and a Yamamoto Senko. "I saw some duckweed in a tree and caught one on a frog, and then another from a clump nearby," said Cox. "I flipped and casted all day. I caught my largest fish in the morning – a 3-pounder – when I finally got to the back of the creek." Heading into Day Two, Cox said he is confident that some sizeable bass will still be in his area. "I'm thinking I can go back in there tomorrow and catch them again," said Cox. "The fish were healthy, thick and eating good. I like how the area was setting up. I don't know if I can get the same weight as today, but 13 pounds is a definite possibility." The top 20 pros after day one on Wheeler Lake are: 1st: John Cox, Debary, Fla., five bass, 16-11 2nd: Brandon McMillan, Clewiston, Fla., five bass, 14-14 3rd: Bryan Thrift, Shelby, N.C., five bass, 14-7 4th: Joseph Webster, Fulton, Miss., five bass, 14-2 5th: Walmart pro Mark Rose, West Memphis, Ark., five bass, 13-15 6th:  Bill Chapman, Salt Rock, W.

The global glut of oil isn’t showing any signs of ending the historic lows in Texas’ gas prices. According to a news release from AAA Texas, the state average for a gallon of regular unleaded gas is $1.96. That’s some 16 cents cheaper than the national average price of gas, which stands at $2.12. In Texas, the price of gas is 4 cents cheaper than last week and 49 cents less expensive than this time last year. Of the major Texas metropolitan areas, AAA said Amarillo drivers are paying the least on average for a gallon of regular gas at $1.86, while drivers in El Paso are paying the most on average at $2.09. Gas in the Killeen-Fort Hood area is even cheaper. According to GasBuddy.com, which tracks gas prices via users in real time, the cheapest gas locally is in Harker Heights, where the H-E-B at 601 Indian Trail and the Murphy USA gas station at 2010 Heights Drive have historically been the least expensive by several cents. Both were selling gas for $1.69 Saturday. Drivers could find the next cheapest gas in Copperas Cove at the H-E-B at 2990-A E. U.S. Highway 190. It was selling gas for $1.79. The Corner Store at 101 S. Main Street in Nolanville also was selling gas for $1.79. Killeen’s gas stations weren’t too far behind with gas at the Corner Store at 4897 Martin Luther King Blvd. selling gas for $1.82. “Gas prices across most of the country continue to slide during the peak road-trip season due to abundant supplies,” AAA said in the release. “As of earlier this week, more than 40 percent of gas stations nationwide were selling gasoline for $2 per gallon or less, compared to just a handful at this same time last year.” GasBuddy.com analysts used Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’” hit to describe gas prices in a recent news release, saying price cycles in the Great Lakes and in California could help keep prices down. “For the week ahead, barring any major disruption, GasBuddy expects the national average to continue declining,” the release stated. cthorp@kdhnews.com | 254-501-7552 cthorp@kdhnews.com | 254-501-7552​ Discuss Print Posted in Local News on Saturday, August 6, 2016 6:22 pm.

Even upscale retailers are cashing in on Black Friday Woman says Skechers fired her because she was pregnant Walmart has another bad quarter, thanks to food deflation After a horrible first half of the year, retailers are going high-tech to rescue the back-to-school season. Traditional department and discount store chains are trying to win over shoppers — and compete with online titan Amazon — by converting their brands into omnichannel retailers that make it easy for shoppers to buy online, in-store or from a mobile device — and move seamlessly among all three options. “Growth … looks different today,” said Brett Biggs, chief financial officer of Walmart, at an analyst presentation in June. “It’s still about comp sales and … building stores. But now it’s about mobile e-commerce … fulfillment capabilities … and developing new services.” The back-to-school season generates an estimated 18 percent of annual sales for apparel retailers, second only to the holidays’ 19 percent, according to Cowen & Co. While the National Retail Federation expects back-to-school and -college sales will jump substantially, to $75.8 billion this year, every dollar will be hard won. Stores are under pressure not only to generate strong sales, but to turn a profit while offering the speed and convenience customers expect. However, most retailers will face the challenge of implementing a tech upgrade for millions of customers without a hitch. Cutting shipping time from two days to one, for example, can add 30 percent to a retailers’ cost, said Kumar Venkataraman, a partner in consultant A.T. Kearney’s retail practice. The majority of back-to-school shoppers plan to visit traditional stores; however, the crowded aisles are losing luster. Nearly a third of shoppers surveyed by Deloitte said they’ll buy online and pick up in-store instead. Millennials in particular prefer shopping online because of free shipping, as well as not having to “deal with people” — or even wear pants — according to a survey by mobile commerce platform Branding Brand survey. Here, a look at new omnichannel efforts by major chains. Improved apps: Walmart, JCPenney, Macy’s and Target have all redesigned their apps. Macy’s main app now has an image-search function, allowing customers to photograph an item and locate a similar one in-store. Walmart rolled out a proprietary payment system to all of its 100 stores in New York state, as well as nationwide, at the end of June. This summer, Target made its Web site the same for mobile devices or desktops, and is testing direct-manufacturer coupons. Fast shipping, free or cheap: Taking a page from Amazon Prime’s $99 annual fee for unlimited two-day shipping, Walmart has launched an unlimited two-day shipping program for $49 a year, dangling a 30-day free offer last month to boost membership. In June, Staples launched $9.99 same-day delivery in Manhattan for online orders. Sears offers free shipping for items ordered on its app while shoppers are in-store. Blended online and in-store shopping: JCPenney’s “buy online, pickup in store” program includes more than 150,000 items for back-to-school, while Target has more than tripled its assortment in the last three years to 120,000 items for order pickup. Kmart has a no-money-down layaway program offered in stores, or for 1 cent online or on its app, while Sears customers can shop online or via app and have the item delivered to their car outside a Sears store.

Within minutes of Betters’ story airing,  a man, who wishes to remain anonymous, called in to the station to offer a helping hand. "Just with it being on the news yesterday, last night, just overnight, that quick, the whole situation has turned around," Betters said. "He asked me how much and I told him whatever your heart wants to give, that’s good enough for me." But before Betters could make it to Walmart to pick up the money a man in the community sent to her, the Economic Opportunities Advancement Corporation also decided to help Betters. "We’re what you consider a hope program. We provide hope for those who feel like there’s no other way out," said Carla Minniefield, a case manager with E.O.A.C. "Making a difference in someone’s life, that’s my purpose. I get up everyday and go to work everyday to make a difference in someone’s life." Betters said help from the E.O.A.C is going to make a big difference in her life. "They’re moving me...they’re gonna help me move into a house," she said. "Now I’m looking for a house. That’s what I’m doing now. I’ve been in the Thrifty Nickle, and my sister will take me around a bit, and we’ll ride around until we find something." Minniefield said seeing a story she could relate to made her feel like she had to do something to help betters "I was a single parent. I understood the struggle, and with her having the six children, I definitely understood," she said. "We’re put here to serve people and I just have to help her." E.O.A.C serves McLennan, Falls, Bosque, Limestone, Hill, and Freestone counties. Minniefield said anyone who needs help can call 254-753-0331, and ask for the community programming department.  Copyright 2016 KXXV.

Solo climber sets new record conquering Yosemite's El Capitan Iran to US: honor nuclear deal, or else Finding the patterns Yes, free trade and the cheaper goods it provides have cost the American jobs, but not as many as feared.   By Patrik Jonsson and Simon Montlake, Staff writers August 6, 2016 Save for later Saved Eric Mosley works on the factory floor at RoMan Manufacturing, a Grand Rapids, Mich., firm that makes electrical transformers and welding equipment. ANN HERMES/STAFF View Caption About video ads View Caption of Shelby, N.C.; Madison, Maine; and Grand Rapids, Mich. — Tom Fitch remembers attending a community meeting one night in 1997 at the North Lake Country Club here in Shelby, N.C., a small city of red-brick storefronts and wide boulevards. He listened as members of the local business establishment praised the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which three years earlier had opened up commerce with Mexico and Canada. The leaders envisioned the pact giving local businesses, including the textile plants that had operated in the area for decades, millions of new customers and boosting job growth. Tom Fitch, owner of a sign business in Shelby, N.C. PATRIK JONSSON/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR Not Mr. Fitch. The owner of a boutique sign business, he already stood out amid the suit-and-tie crowd in his jeans and beaked cap. His concern was that the implementation of NAFTA would flood the United States with cheap imports and shutter local mills. He turned out to be prescient. Shelby lost 40 percent of its factory jobs between 1999 and 2014 and saw the poverty rate rise to double the national average. “Here, these guys were saying how their profits had increased, and I stood up and asked them why they couldn’t see what was in front of their faces: This was going to destroy our town,” recalls Fitch. Yet today not all is dire. A small renaissance is under way in the area, some of which is tied to globalization. Schletter Inc., the US subsidiary of a German solar-panel manufacturer, has hired 305 people. Longtime furniture company Bernhardt has reopened a facility with 65 jobs. Clearwater Paper Corp. has added 65 positions, while automotive parts maker KSM Castings has taken on 189 new people.  Recommended: Ten states with the fastest job growth in 2016 “Up until a year and a half ago, people were still very much panicking about the future,” says Chris Carrigan, a sheet-press operator at a local printing plant. “But it seems like since then, the work has been steadier, and things are picking up.” Shelby’s failures and fortunes represent a microcosm of the US in the era of more open global commerce. As free trade has become a dominant issue in the US presidential campaign – perhaps more than at any time since the 1930s – it is often portrayed in stark, one-dimensional terms: as a menace that has cost the US millions of jobs while enriching countries such as China and Mexico.  There is some truth in this dark narrative, as put forth most vociferously by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and, during the primaries, by insurgent Democrat Bernie Sanders. Free trade has resulted in a vast number of US manufacturing operations moving offshore. It has caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and hit certain communities, like Shelby, particularly hard. It has helped hold down the incomes of low-wage workers, and engendered a sense of angst among working-class Americans that has been overlooked by much of the political establishment.  CONTAINER SHIPS LOAD AND UNLOAD GOODS IN THE PORT OF OAKLAND, CALIF. ALFREDO SOSA/STAFF/FILE Yet free trade has not been universally villainous. American consumers have saved millions of dollars by buying foreign electronics, cars, and couches for less than if they had been made domestically. The pacts have led to the rise of many higher-end manufacturing operations here. Free trade may have helped some American companies survive when they otherwise wouldn’t have: They were able to compete in the new global environment by moving manufacturing plants to low-wage countries and keeping better-paying administrative, marketing, and other operations here. Perhaps most significant, many of the jobs that have been lost in US manufacturing in the past 10 years were not the result of malevolent free-trade deals at all. They were caused by the inexorable rise of automation, even though that fact provides little solace to workers shorn of their paychecks. “The fundamental betrayal goes beyond trade – it’s a sense that we’re working hard and we’re getting screwed by the system ... a sense that, ‘This isn’t the America I grew up in, or the America I expected,’ ” says I.M. “Mac” Destler, a University of Maryland political scientist and author of “American Trade Politics.” “And that’s why trade is more prominent today than it’s been in any presidential campaign since, well, the Great Depression.” All this is important because the next president will face major decisions about how open global commerce should be.  The US seems likely to retreat somewhat from the freewheeling free-trade ethos of the past two decades no matter who wins the White House. Even Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has supported free trade in the past, says she now won’t support the Trans-Pacific Partnership – a massive trade pact involving the US and 11 other countries. The question is: How much should the US pull back from free trade – if at all? And how much has the country really been hurt by the freer cross-border flow of everything from mufflers to muffin tins?   About video ads •     •     • For nearly a century, Shelby was a thriving notch in a Textile Belt that ran from the western Carolinas into northern Georgia. At its peak it had more than a dozen mills that produced yarn and fabric for apparelmakers and other outlets, employing thousands of workers, among them legendary bluegrass banjo picker Earl Scruggs, one of Shelby’s favorite sons. An eponymous music center now stands downtown to honor the late musician. In 1970, more than 2.3 million Americans worked in garment and textile factories. By 1993, the year President Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, that number had fallen to about 1.6 million. Then came a surge in foreign fabric imports and the rise of China as a low-cost manufacturing colossus. Towels and bed linens sold at Wal-Mart were no longer made in American mills. In Shelby, some factory owners invested in new machinery to automate processes and cut labor costs. But few survived the onslaught of foreign competition. One by one, the mills closed, leaving middle-aged workers with no paychecks or pensions.  This decline mirrors a broader trend: Since 1970 total US employment in manufacturing has fallen by nearly a third. But the trend in output is going in the opposite direction. In 2015, the US produced goods valued at $2.2 trillion, up from $1.7 trillion in 2009 at the peak of the Great Recession.  Simply put, American factories and workshops are producing more by using less labor and more machinery, a process of capital investment and automation that has also transformed American farms.  A WOMAN LOOKS AT REFRIGERATORS IN A STORE IN PENNSYLVANIA. FREE TRADE HAS MADE GOODS CHEAPER FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. GENE J. PUSKAR/AP/FILE The effect of automation on labor markets is deeper than the disruption caused by cheap imports. A 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study by economist David Autor and two coauthors found that inexpensive Chinese goods accounted for about a quarter of the decline in US manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, a period that includes the adoption of NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. But their data also suggest that many more jobs were lost because of robots, computers, and sensors.  Combined, the forces of automation and trade competition have decimated blue-collar jobs and the wages they pay. In 2003, the median hourly wage in a US automotive parts factory was $18.35; a decade later it was $15.83. The 2008-09 recession only added to the woes of the working class. While the presidential campaign has highlighted the backlash against free trade among Rust Belt workers – who happen to live in valuable swing states – the same competitive forces are roiling industries elsewhere.  In Madison, Maine, a one-stoplight town on the banks of the Kennebec River, the closure of a paper mill in May has stirred debate over cheap imports abetted by foreign subsidies. The difference is that the villain is not China or Mexico, but Canada.  The closure of the cavernous, blue-roofed pulp and paper mill with the loss of more than 200 jobs ends more than a century of paper production in Madison (pop. 2,630.) It’s one of several paper mills in Maine that have closed in recent years, undone by a shrinking market, high energy costs, and competition from Canada. “We’re losing jobs in America,” says Russ Drechsel, president and chief executive officer of Madison Paper Industries. “It’s an unfair trade. I don’t believe in subsidies.” On a recent morning before the closure, he walked through the mill, which sits on 30 acres that hug the Kennebec. A giant roll of proto-paper the width of a bus spun on cylinders, then passed through roaring dryers to wring out the pulp’s water and bond the fibers together. The heat required to turn logs into pulp, and then steam and dry the paper, meant that the mill consumed roughly double the power that its two hydropower dams produced. Inside a control room, Mr. Drechsel talked to workers about their severance and benefits and asked if they had all the information they needed. He noted that he had employees who had followed their parents into the mill. One young recruit who joined in 2015 was a third-generation millworker. Each job, local officials say, helps support as many as five people in Madison and other towns, from restaurant workers to barbers, real estate agents to mechanics. At its height in the 1960s, the paper industry employed more than 18,000 workers in Maine. By 2011, that number had fallen below 6,000. Since then, four of 11 mills have closed; Madison is the fifth. The company’s problems began in 2012, when the provincial government in Nova Scotia stepped in to rescue a bankrupt paper mill in Port Hawkesbury, providing loans and subsidized power to save hundreds of local jobs. By 2015, Madison was reducing shifts and idling machinery after a severe winter that drove up energy prices. Together with another paper company, it filed a petition with the US Department of Commerce seeking import duties on the Port Hawkesbury mill for unfair subsidies. Last November, the Maine plants won their case: The US imposed countervailing duties of 20 percent on imports from the Nova Scotia plant (an appeal is pending). But it came too late to save Madison Paper. Drechsel says that even with the import duties on Canadian paper, it would be hard to compete because the strong US dollar makes Canadian imports much cheaper. The loss of Madison’s biggest taxpayer is a blow, but it represents only a fifth of the town’s tax base, much less than in the past. The town is hoping to find another tenant for the mill site, though it’s more likely that a buyer would want just the hydropower plants. “Growing up here, we were always told that the day that mill closes up, we’re going to dry up and blow away,” says Tim Curtis, the town manager. “It won’t be easy. It’s a loss.” AN EMPLOYEE WORKS IN AN AUTO PLANT IN CHINA. CHINA DAILY/REUTERS Yet even in a struggling industry, opportunities exist. Ever since the closure of Madison Paper was announced earlier this year, its skilled workers have been getting offers from other paper mills. Those with the right résumé can get hired – provided they are willing either to commute or to relocate to another mill town.  For generations of Americans, this was a way to survive in bad economic times: Move to where the jobs are. From the gold rush to the Dust Bowl exodus, pioneers, dreamers, and immigrants have built America by migrating to the next opportunity.  Lately that spirit of mobility has diminished, undermining a key shock absorber of the US economy. No one is quite sure why. An aging nation might be less footloose. Certainly the rise of dual- earner families means it’s harder for two people to uproot and leave. Soaring housing costs make some cities unaffordable. Underwater mortgages make other cities hard to leave. But one theory points to something deeper: Americans have adopted a bunker mentality as wages have stagnated. “Something is shifting in how workers make transitions in the labor market,” says Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist at Notre Dame University in Indiana and coauthor of a 2014 study of internal migration. Her research suggests that fewer Americans find it’s helpful to move, because the chances of finding a significantly better salary are low and the chances of being laid off again are high. Without the possibility of better work, mobility has slowed. This trend began in the 1970s and cuts across industries, socioeconomic classes, and generations.  During the Great Recession, mobility did pick up. But the movement of job seekers didn’t correspond with the regions mired in the deepest downturns. For example, job-related moves rose in states such as Florida that had plentiful construction jobs. The highest out-migration rates during 2007-10 were in Idaho (2.1 percent), Nevada (1.6 percent), and Alaska (1.2 percent). The rate in Michigan, where factory employment took a huge hit, was only 0.3 percent.  “The ‘worst’ places in America are not the ones that are losing population,” says Mai Chi Dao, an economist at the International Monetary Fund who has studied labor mobility. “If [mobility] comes down, it means it will be a longer recovery and more pain after each recession.” This raises the question of whether the US will need to act more like Europe, where mobility within national borders has long been less prevalent – and where countries have to spend more to retrain workers. “When you have a less mobile workforce the need to retrain becomes far more urgent,” says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. In the US, federal aid for workers who lose their jobs because of foreign trade comes via Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA. It offers extended unemployment benefits, occupational retraining, and relocation money.  Through 2021, Congress has allocated $450 million a year in grants for TAA-qualified workers – less than what the US spends on unemployment benefits in a week and much less than what other advanced nations spend on trade adjustment. In 2011, the US spent 0.1 percent of its gross domestic product on active labor market policies, primarily TAA. This compares with 0.3 percent in Canada, 0.8 percent in Germany, and 2.3 percent in Denmark.  Studies show that people who take TAA training find jobs at higher rates than people who simply look for work while cashing unemployment checks. But older workers have less success in finding work and earning comparable salaries. For Mohamed Moussa, a third-generation autoworker, the opportunity for retraining was transformational. While working at a Ford Motor Co. plant, he had managed to study part time and get a bachelor’s degree in radiation therapy in 2005. So when he lost his job in 2008 he was ready to start a new career. Five years later, he had a medical degree and was working as a resident in a hospital emergency room. Unlike many of his classmates, he was only $50,000 in debt. “It’s been a long winding road,” he says. “I try not to lose sight of that.” Terry Hernden has benefited from starting over, too. When he was laid off in 2011 from his job at an injection-molding plant, he used TAA funds to enroll at a community college to study information technology security. After two years, he had an associate degree that he parlayed into a full-time job at Quicken Loans, a Detroit-based mortgage lender. Today, Mr. Hernden works long hours – usually 12-hour shifts. But he earns more than he did in the auto industry and is upbeat about his prospects. “You definitely have to work hard,” he says. “It’s not like it used to be when you could walk into Ford and get a good job.”  Terry Hernden, who went back to school after being laid off and now works for a mortgage lender. ANN HERMES/STAFF Not everyone will have to retool their career in order to find work. As some of the emerging new industries in Shelby show, the story of US manufacturing is not all layoffs and closures. Since the Great Recession, a number of plants have reopened or expanded operations in the area. The local economic development office says that Cleveland County, of which Shelby is a part, has created 1,863 new jobs and attracted $1.8 billion in capital investment in recent years. This is giving a boost to other businesses: Shelby now has a trendy tapas restaurant and a craft brewery. Nationwide, what’s left of the US manufacturing sector is relatively healthy. In fact, in some regions, the problem isn’t whether plants have too many workers. It’s whether they have too few.  The National Association of Manufacturers projects that more than half of the 3.5 million factory job openings in the next decade will go unfilled. The reason is a general shift: Tens of thousands of boomers are now retiring each year, and Millennials are reluctant to take their jobs. They prefer to work in other industries that pay just as well – and that don’t come with  the stigma of 40 years of downsizing. “We’ve never had so much attention from manufacturers,” says Julie Parks, executive director of workforce training at Grand Rapids Community College in western Michigan. “They’re calling and saying: ‘Can we meet your students?’ They’re asking, ‘Why aren’t they looking at my job postings?’ ” The Grand Rapids area offers a contrast to Detroit’s gritty struggles. Unemployment is low (around 3 percent, compared with a statewide average of 5 percent). Few workers are waiting for a job. And the need is high: 1 in 5 people works in manufacturing, churning out auto parts, machinery, plastics, office furniture, and medical devices. Other industries, including agribusiness and life sciences, want the same workers. The talk in the area is of growing trade and attracting foreign investment, not erecting barriers.  At RoMan Manufacturing Inc., a maker of electrical transformers and welding equipment, president and chief executive officer Robert Roth closely monitors the age of his nearly 200 workers. Five are retiring this year. Mr. Roth, whose father cofounded the company in 1980, has three community-college students enrolled in a work-placement program, with a starting wage of $13 an hour that rises to $17 after two years. At a worktable inside the transformer plant, young Jason Stenquist is trying to assemble some copper coils. It’s his first week on the job. In high school, he considered pursuing a medical career but then switched to electrical engineering. “I love working with tools,” he says. “I love creating.” To win over these young workers, manufacturers have to overcome the taint of the past. Millennials “remember their father and mother both were laid off,” says Birgit Klohs, president and chief executive of The Right Place, a business development agency for western Michigan. “They blame it on the manufacturing recession.” The agency supports a public-private initiative that promotes the virtues of manufacturing to the next generation by hosting job fairs and sending a mobile demonstration vehicle to rural schools. One of the group’s messages is that factories are no longer dark, dirty, and dangerous. Workers today are more apt to run a sophisticated computer system than to grease ball bearings, and recruits can receive apprenticeships that include free tuition for college classes. “[Workers] are harder to find and they have job offers,” says Jay Dunwell, president of Wolverine Coil Spring Company, a family-owned firm in Grand Rapids. “They may be coming [into the workforce], but they’ve been plucked by other industries that are also doing as well as manufacturing.” The competition for workers is evident in Charlotte, N.C., 40 miles east of Shelby. The city is booming on the back of foreign trade. Nearly 1,000 foreign companies have taken advantage of tariff reductions to open facilities in the area, including a German specialty chemicals company, a South Korean plant that makes sheet-metal components, and a Chinese yarn-spinning firm. Charlotte’s population has grown by more than 50 percent since 2000. It is rated No. 5 among large cities in the country for job growth. Yet many of the new workers aren’t getting rich: In 1999, the median household in Charlotte earned $5,000 more than the US average; by 2014, it was only on par. As with so much of the national debate on trade and globalization, how people view the issue often depends on where they started and where they stand now.  “In these trade agreements, the winners in America hugely outweigh the losers,” says Matthew Gold, a former deputy assistant US trade representative who now teaches law at Fordham University in New York. “The political problem is that the losers know exactly who they are, exactly how much they lost.”  The above story was a digest of the five-part series that appeared in June.  Free Trade in America Part 1: The harsh downside of free trade – and the glimmer of hope Part 2: The surprising truth about American manufacturing Part 3: What 'good' free trade looks like Part 4: Why, this time, free trade has hit American workers so hard Part 5: What can be done about free trade's 'victims' Next up Ten states with the fastest job growth in 2016 US adds 255,000 jobs in July: 'Everything you could have asked for'?

While the sales tax holiday is scheduled the first weekend in August to give families and students a break when purchasing school supplies and clothes for the new school year, any shopper can benefit from the discount on qualifying items.   Most school supplies and regular clothing valued at less than $100 are eligible for the discount. A few items, such as certain sports equipment, shoes and accessories do not qualify to be tax-free Aug. 5-7, even though they are priced at less than $100. For a complete list of what school supplies and clothing qualify and which don’t, visit TexasTaxHoliday.org. CANHelp asks local businesses, groups and individuals to consider using a portion of the money they saved to help disadvantaged families provide school supplies for their children by donating school supplies or funds for supplies during the annual Pack the Bus drive Saturday. “The cost of school supplies can be high and many families struggle to provide what is needed for their children to start school,” said Shanna Martin, CANHelp executive director. “That is where we step in to help. We try to remove some of that burden from the parents and even the schools.” To make it easy for potential contributors to donate to the school supply drive, the yearly school supply drive will be conducted Saturday, during the tax-free weekend, in Walmart parking lot. Just look for the big yellow school bus, loaned by Sulphur Springs Independent School District to CANHelp, and drop off donations of school supplies between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Aug. 6. Last year’s school supply drive provided almost 250 school-aged children with a new packpack filled with school supplies to start the new school year. While the ultimate goal each year is to pack the bus full of backpacks and school supplies to benefit Sulphur Springs and Hopkins County school children, CANHelp would like to be able to help 350 students this year. And, any left over supplies will be donated to local schools. Thunder Country 107.1 radio will be broadcasting live from the parking lot, and Walmart will have “a mobile kiosk set up outside with easy access to purchase school supplies.” Items identified as most-needed supplies include Expo markers, highlighters, three-ring notebooks, wide-ruled paper, 16- and 24-count boxes of Crayons, 70-page wide-rule spiral notebooks, two-pocket plastic folders with brads, backpacks, composition notebooks, pencils, school boxes and stick glue. Those who can't make it to the live event can make donations at the early drop off locations established at Alliance Bank's downtown location, at 100 West Jefferson St.; Verizon, 380 East Shannon Road.; and CANHelp, 613 Gilmer St. Supplies can be dropped into the blue barrels located in the lobby of each location. Families in need of help to provide school supplies for their children can visit CANHelp, 613 Gilmer St., from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday, Aug. 8-15, to register. Parents and guardians will be required to show their driver’s license or other valid photo ID which shows proof of a Hopkins County address, and other proof of Hopkins County address, if it’s not shown on the photo ID; each child’s Social Security card and proof of income or proof of food stamps, TANF, Medicaid and/or CHIP. Parents and guardians who want to get a head start on the registration process can download the form from CANHelp’s website, complete it, then bring the completed form along with required documents to CANHelp during registration dates and times. For more information, call CANHelp at 903-885-9797, ext. 3, or visit canhelponline.org.

Bloomberg 5:33 This startup is trying to reinvent the piston engine CNN Money 3:25 How close does Trump remain to his foreign businesses? CNN Money 2:31 UP NEXT Many investors have taken to wondering how they might cash in on “Trump stocks” or “Clinton stocks.” Truth is, trying to divine which stocks will benefit after November’s presidential election is frivolous and even dangerous to your wealth. The folly of trying to turn current events into investment hunches just played out on a grand scale in Great Britain, where bookies and investing experts alike were sure that the vote to leave the European Union would be defeated. Moreover, if Brexit passed, the British stock markets would tank. The oddsmakers were wrong, and so were the market observers, because although Brexit triggered a knee-jerk downward reaction, the British stock market then raced off to record highs. The Brexit investment-wager silliness subsided just as the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions ramped up, which is why the popular sport right now in the financial media and on the talk shows is to cover what stocks to buy for each presidential contender, and which industries are likely to prosper with their election. Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, for example, picked the seven “best stocks” for each candidate’s potential presidency. Companies tied to Trump included Coach – because Trump plans to cut taxes on high earners, so they will have disposable income, and for-profit prison operator The Geo Group (because of his law-and-order pledge) and gun-maker Smith & Wesson . Clinton stocks included HCA Holdings Inc. SunPower and Wal-Mart Stores, due to her support of the Affordable Care Act, a pledge to install 500 million solar panels by 2021, and plans for tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners. © Provided by MarketWatch Why investing in ‘Trump stocks’ or ‘Clinton stocks’ is a wasted vote Likewise, S&P Global Market Intelligence issued a research report about how the election could disrupt certain sectors. While noting that neither candidate may have the juice after election to follow through on their campaign promises, the firm nonetheless tied key issues to market sectors. Accordingly, consumer-discretionary stocks could be impacted by the outcome of minimum-wage legislation (more likely hurt by Clinton and helped by Trump), health care by the Affordable Care Act (helped by Clinton and hurt by Trump) and industrials, aided by defense spending (both candidates are seen as hawkish, thus good for industrial companies). Purported analysis abounds, with some experts suggesting that it’s time to make moves now, because the swings that could occur once the outcome is clear could be major. Market strategist Lawrence McDonald said this week on my show, “MoneyLife with Chuck Jaffe,” that we “must prepare ourselves for a Trump presidency.” He made it clear he was not making a political statement, but that he believes “social tensions are playing right into Trump” and that he expects the vote won’t be close. McDonald suggested that, among other things, a Trump win would trigger a major sell-off in Treasurys, meaning investors would “want to start getting out of bonds.” By comparison, McDonald noted that a Clinton presidency, from an investor’s perspective, would offer “more of what you have right now.” But for any long-term investor, the idea that you would overhaul a portfolio on the whims of the voters is ridiculous. David Trainer, president of New Constructs Inc., an investment-research firm, called the political plays being discussed now, “Yet another baseless theme to encourage investors to trade on non-fundamental but entertaining factors. In the end, the result is mostly that unsophisticated investors further line the pockets of the more-sophisticated investors that create baseless trends to exploit them.” It’s a bit like using the Super Bowl indicator — where the direction of the stock market for the year is supposedly foretold by the outcome of the game — and putting real money behind what amounts to a coincidence. Sure, history shows that this coincidence occurs about 80% of the time — there are some variations in how the Super Bowl indicator is tallied, giving comfort to true believers — but you still wouldn’t want to lay down big market bets after just three quarters, when the game is too close to call. Making Trump or Clinton stock plays right now is no different; interesting to talk about, dumb to wager on, and dangerous as a basis to overhaul a portfolio now. That said, there are plenty of studies to show that U.S. presidential election years typically coincide with favorable markets, and that the market’s long-term trends don’t seem to be affected by the party that holds the presidency. Ignoring logic to invest on the outcome of a political event and its potential impact makes no sense. Investors would be better off looking at the fundamentals of the companies that pique their interest, although that takes work that betting on a political kick doesn’t. “As a short-term trade you can find a reason to buy or sell anything, whether it’s a newly elected president or the NCAA tournament,” said Brian Frank, manager of the Frank Value Fund    “Long-term, your buy valuation and fundamentals are the only thing that matter.” So enjoy the conversations about which stocks may profit from politics, but don’t bet on them without first removing your red- or blue-tinted blinders and making sure you invest in a solid business or industry that can succeed regardless of who is in the White House..

Muslim convert Sebastian Gregerson, aka Abdurrahman Bin Mikaayl, from Dearborn, Michigan, has been accused of stockpiling weapons to carry out an attack. The 29-year-old, who has worked at Target and Wal-Mart, has been charged with unregistered possession of a destructive device and unlicensed receipt of explosive materials. The complaint reveals a counterterrorism investigation that began in April 2015 following a tip that Gregerson had an arsenal of weapons - including a bazooka, a legally-owned grenade  launcher. He is also said to have had rounds of AK-47 ammunition, tactical gear, ski masks and a training video for using a Russian assault rifle  Alleged ISIS sympathizer Sebastian Gregerson, 29, from Dearborn, Michigan, has been arrested after buying explosives from an undercover FBI. An image on his Facebook (above) shows a man riding a horse and carrying the Islamic State flag  The FBI said he bought grenades on Sunday from the undercover agent in Monroe. He was then taken into custody.   Documents said he purchased 'an arsenal of weapons, ammunition, tactical gear and tactical training materials.'  Court papers say Gregerson has had several recorded conversations with an undercover agent during which he allegedly talked about grenades and grenade launchers He said he possessed a legal grenade launcher and described tactics he would use to commit an attack on a building with the grenades, according to the FBI. Gregerson also talked about how he could make homegrown high-explosive grenades, which are illegal, using hollow shells.

GREGERSON'S 'ARSENAL'  Bazooka Grenade Launcher Grenades  Road Spikes  Handguns AK-47 ammunition  Tactical gear Ski masks Training video for a Russian assault rifle  WHAT HE WANTED TO BUY Smoke grenades Fragmentation grenades Ati-personnel mine - that contains C4 explosive and hundreds of steel balls that rapidly shoot outwards upon detonation In June, the FBI said Gregerson bought road spikes online that can be used to slow or disable vehicles.  Other purchases included tactical training items, including handguns and dummy rounds. 'The purchase of training versions of these weapons makes it unlikely that the weapons were purchased for recreational use, such as hunting,' the complaint states. Gregerson made an initial appearance Monday in U.S. District Court and is being held pending a Thursday detention hearing. He appeared in ankle chains and handcuffs with his  long brown beard and nearly waist-length hair. Gregerson is facing up to 10 years in prison if convicted. A Facebook account belonging to a user with the same name includes an image of a man riding a horse and carrying an Islamic State flag. Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told the Detroit News Islamic State supporters have used the same photo in the past. 'That suggests to me that he is a supporter (of the Islamic State),' Hughes said. The Detroit News, which first reported the allegations, said two of Gregerson's supporters declined to comment outside of court.  The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Gregerson's court-appointed lawyer, Miriam Siefer.    Read more: FBI: Detroiter built up arsenal, talked of an attack Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Bukaty/AP Photo Shoppers at a Target store in South Portland, Maine. Target Corp. has resumed selling Amazon.com Inc.’s tablets and e-readers on its website and plans to bring them back to its stores, marking a detente between one of the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailers and its chief online rival. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 777.65 -7.68 -0.98% Target Corp TGT ▲ 78.83 +0.96 +1.23% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.74 +0.62 +0.88% Best Buy Co Inc BBY ▲ 47.09 +0.49 +1.05% Amazon’s Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets and Fire TV devices went on sale on Target.com on Thursday, and the merchandise will return to the retailer’s stores in October, just in time for the holiday shopping rush. When Target stopped carrying the devices in 2012, analysts hailed the ban as a savvy move to rid its stores of a Trojan horse. Amazon’s Fire tablet makes it easier to purchase items on Amazon.com, and its e-readers draw more customers to Amazon’s website, where it sells everything from shoes to shampoo, alongside its electronic books. A few months after Target’s decision, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. also stopped selling the devices. Some smaller chains, like Best Buy Co. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., kept them on shelves. “Target continually evaluates our assortment to deliver quality products at a great value,” the company said in a statement. “We know our guests love the many aspects of shopping at Target, and believe they will appreciate the convenience and savings of finding these items in our stores and on Target.com.” New Focus A lot has changed for Target and Amazon in the last four years. Target has a new chief executive officer, Brian Cornell, who has refocused the company on its kids, beauty, fashion and baby sections while also introducing new exclusive brands. The retailer’s sales have stabilized and it has revamped its online strategy, expanding its selection and getting more competitive on price. Based on customers’ feedback, the company expects Amazon’s devices to drive traffic to its stores and thinks they could give its lackluster electronics business a boost.

That ubiquity means there’s less risk today than four years ago that a Kindle device sold in Target will convert someone into a loyal Amazon shopper. For Amazon, which has been experimenting with its own brick-and-mortar stores, the deal with Target gives it 1,800 new showrooms for its products. Amazon has been at a disadvantage to Apple Inc., which has a fleet of sleek stores where customers can touch, feel and try out the latest devices. Amazon, which failed in its attempt to roll out a line of smartphones, sees its tablets as a key way to drive sales of its e-books.

John Williams, Jr., of Troy, N.Y., was driving a Ford dump truck south on Curran Highway Tuesday evening when he missed the right turn into Walmart and decided instead to make a quick left onto Curran Memorial Highway, according to police. As it attempted to cross two lanes, the dump truck struck a motorcyclist in the center lane, propelling him 70 feet, according to police. Matthew Wilson, 24, of Williamstown, was transported to Berkshire Medical Center with "non-incapacitating injuries," and his 2015 Honda motorcycle was totaled. There was no damage to the dump truck, according to police. Williams was arrested and charged with an unsafe lane change, failure to use care while turning, not having his license in possession, and operating with his license suspended in Massachusetts. He pleaded not guilty in Northern Berkshire District Court on Wednesday and was released on personal recognizance.

When his paycheck became too little to cover his rent, Bastos quit his job and started driving a taxi. Olympic-size troubles for Brazil’s economy Aug 6, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Wagner Bastos, a former hotshot car salesman in Rio de Janeiro, saw his fortunes plunge along with Brazil’s economy. When his paycheck became too little to cover his rent, Bastos quit his job and started driving a taxi. RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — When Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympic Games seven years ago, Wagner Bastos was a hotshot salesman for Rio’s Peugeot-Citroën car dealership. Some months he earned 17,000 Brazilian reals — about $5,200 now, but much more back then. But Brazil’s fortunes — and Bastos’ — have taken a sickening tumble. His monthly paycheck in June was for 1,400 reals ($425) — too little to cover his rent or school fees for two children. So Bastos, 54, quit and started driving a taxi. In the past, hosting the Olympics often allowed newly prosperous countries to strut onto the world stage and showcase their glitziest cities. Think Tokyo in 1964 or Seoul in 1988. And in October 2009, when Rio won the competition to host this Summer Games, the picture looked similar. Brazil’s emerging market economy was sizzling. It was one of the world’s economic superstars, along with Russia, India, China and South Africa. But the 2016 Games, which kicked off with the opening ceremonies Friday night, come at a dire moment for Brazil, which is enduring myriad calamities: A deep recession. A political crisis. Widespread street protests. Reports of filthy waterways. And a health emergency caused by the Zika virus. “There have been political and economic problems in other (Olympic) host cities,” said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College who has studied Olympic Games, “but the combination here has probably been as foreboding as any I have seen.” Brazil’s economy shrank 3.8 percent last year and will likely contract an additional 3.3 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. The economy was rocked by a plunge in prices for iron ore and other commodities it exports, partly a result of slowing and as China’s powerhouse economy decelerated. In the booming mid-2000s Brazilians celebrated their collective arrival in the middle class by borrowing heavily to buy cars, refrigerators and iPhones. Now they face diminished livelihoods. A political crisis has compounded the economic troubles. President Dilma Rousseff was suspended in May for allegedly violating budget laws. She is awaiting a trial this month in Brazil’s Senate that will determine whether she’ll be ousted. Business investment has been paralyzed by an investigation into corruption at the state-owned energy giant Petrobras. Once worth more in the stock market than either Microsoft or Walmart, Petrobras has been reduced to selling assets — from oil fields to corporate subsidiaries — to raise cash to offset lower oil prices. The Olympics might be making things even worse. To prepare for the Games, the state of Rio spent heavily. When it ran into financial trouble, the federal government stepped in to help share the costs, thereby deepening the country’s budget woes. The Brazilian real has plunged 47 percent against the U.S. dollar since Rio was awarded the 2016 Games. The weak real makes imports costlier and helps escalate inflation, which was running at an annual 8.8 percent in June. High inflation means Brazil’s central bank can’t slash interest rates to juice the economy, for fear of sending inflation even higher. As a result, the central bank has kept its key rate at a punitive 14.25 percent. Nationally, since the end of 2014, more than 5 million people have lost jobs. Unemployment has nearly doubled, to 11.3 percent. The anemic job market has depressed real estate. Gone are the bidding wars for choice apartments in Rio’s seaside neighborhoods. Office rents plunged 6.1 percent in Rio from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016, making it the world’s third-worst office market in that period, according to the real estate company JLL. Leo Ickowicz, who is Brazilian but has worked for two decades in South Florida real estate, has experienced the transformation. At the height of Brazil’s boom in 2010, when the economy grew a blazing 7.5 percent, many Brazilian clients sought to capitalize on the currency’s strength by buying Miami real estate as an investment or vacation property. Now his firm is busier than ever. Inquiries have quintupled. But his clients have a different goal this time: They want to leave Brazil for good. His company has had to add relocation services to meet the demand — everything from help in applying for visas and selecting schools to offering psychological aid to families victimized by Brazil’s violent-crime epidemic. Despite the litany of bad news, the Brazilian stock market has surged 30 percent this year. Investors have detected signs of hope. Commodity prices have stabilized, and investors have expressed confidence in the economic policy team assembled by interim President Michel Temer, which says it will get government spending under control. The IMF has also slightly upgraded its outlook for Brazil, predicting that the economy will shrink 3.3 percent this year, compared with its earlier forecast of a 3.8 percent contraction, and will return to growth in 2017. Investors appeared heartened when the economy shrank just 0.3 in the first three months of 2016 from the fourth quarter of 2015. It was the best quarterly performance since the end of 2014. But the economy was still 5.4 percent smaller than it had been a year earlier. And May retail sales were down 9 percent from a year earlier. “I don’t see where growth is going to come from,” said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “People are still being fired. We do not know when the labor market is going to stabilize. ... I do not see anything coming from consumption.” De Bolle said that although she is impressed with Temer’s economic team, she wonders whether it can get its plans for spending cuts through a dysfunctional National Congress. Bastos, the former car salesman, is trying to adjust. His wife’s job at a construction company looks wobbly now that the massive buildout for the Olympics has ended. He has stopped shopping at the supermarket in his middle-class neighborhood and now drives across the city once a month to pick up necessities at a wholesale market. He thinks he’ll have to get used to a more modest lifestyle. “This isn’t something that we can fix in one or two years,” Bastos said. “It’ll take Brazil at least 10 or 15 years to get back to where we were.” 2 Nebraskans who traveled to Zika-affected country contracted the virus, health officials say Both cases involved men, 40 to 55 years old, from northeast Nebraska. The men were not hospitalized, the Department of Health and Human Services said.

The hourly workers at the neighborhood stores now have two scheduling options. Those choosing fixed shifts are guaranteed the same weekly hours for up to six months.

Former head of Dallastown cheerleaders avoids conviction Liz Evans Scolforo , 505-5429/@LizScolforoYD 11:49 a.m. EDT August 8, 2016 Wendy Bisker (Photo: Submitted) Story Highlights Police said Wendy Bisker stole about $5,700 from the Dallastown Cougar Athletics' cheering program. At the time, she was commissioner of the cheerleading program, York Area Regional Police said. On Tuesday, she avoided a possible felony conviction but must pay restitution and perform community service. 96 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE The former head of the Dallastown Cougar Athletics' cheerleading program has avoided a possible felony theft conviction by being accepted into a court diversionary program. Wendy J. Bisker, 41, of West Maple Street in Dallastown, had been accused of stealing nearly $6,000 worth of funds from the program between March 2015 and October 2015, according to court documents. She had faced the third-degree felonies of access device fraud and receiving stolen property. On Tuesday, Bisker was accepted into the county's Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program, which allows first-time nonviolent offenders to avoid conviction by instead completing court-ordered requirements. Criminal defendants accepted into ARD don't have to admit guilt. As part of her ARD requirements, Bisker must be on probation for a year, perform 35 hours of community service, undergo a mental-health evaluation and comply with recommended treatment, write a letter of apology and undergo DNA testing, according to court records. She also must pay $5,719.20 in restitution, those records state. YORK DISPATCH Police: Woman stole nearly $6K from Dallastown cheerleaders The background: Bisker had been in charge of Dallastown Cougar Cheerleading and was given a Visa debit card to use as part of her duties with the organization, according to court documents. But officials with the athletics program began to notice "considerable activity on the account" from the card issued to Bisker, documents state. "When those transactions were examined, they found that there were charges to Walmart, Giant Food Store, Kmart, Home Depot and Rite-Aid," as well as multiple transactions in which she got cash back and several charges for reloading prepaid Visa cards, according to charging documents. There were multiple ATM withdrawals made with the card and several cash advances from Giant and Walmart, documents allege, as well as gift cards for $500 and $100 that were never received by the organization. YORK DISPATCH Police: Vo-Tech worker stole $34K from school York Area Regional Police allege she bought food, merchandise, DVDs and other items not related to the cheerleading program. In all, Bisker charged more than $5,700 on the card, court documents state. Officials canceled the card and notified police, documents state. 'Over her head': Bisker — whose official title for the cheering organization had been commissioner — told Detective Sgt. Weyth Barley that she mixed personal purchases with cheering purchases and got in over her head, according to documents. By that time, Bisker was no longer with the organization, documents state.

(WAVY) — Police have released Taser video showing the confrontation between former Portsmouth police officer Stephen Rankin and William Chapman II. On Thursday, a jury found Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter in Chapman’s 2015 shooting death. FULL COVERAGE: Stephen Rankin Trial The two videos released Friday show the moments before and after Rankin fired his gun outside the Walmart on Frederick Boulevard. “Take your hand out of your pocket.” Rankin can be heard in the first video repeating the command several times during the scuffle with Chapman in the 11-second video captured from the Taser. Then, the video cuts out out. In court, witnesses testified that Chapman knocked the taser out of Rankin’s hand. Taser International said the fall could have potentially affected the recording. Others testified that Chapman had his hands up before shots were fired. The video doesn’t show the final moments. The second video — also from Rankin’s Taser — begins recording after the shooting, from the street. “Don’t die on me boy.” In the video, it sounds as if Rankin is saying, “don’t die on me,” as a witness watches. About two minutes later, sirens can be heard. A minute later, it appears Rankin is running back and forth in the video as the sirens grow louder, drowning out what’s said next. Soon, more officers arrive. They can be seen posting crime scene tape and walking back and forth for a few more minutes before the video cuts off again. The gap between the two videos is when Chapman is shot. The jury recommended Rankin spend two years and six months in prison. He will be formally sentenced by Judge Johnny Morrison on October 12. Rankin’s attorneys say they plan to appeal the verdict.

This happened in the parking lot where one employee said she saw the entire thing when a truck and a cop car came flying into the parking lot. "I just thought someone was getting pulled over. Then he pulled his gun out on him and then another cop car came by and two cops had their guns out on him. They got him out of the car, he got down on the ground and they put him in the cop car. pulled back, he started smacking his face off the window. So they put him in the ambulance and called the bomb squad in," said witness Aliesha King.

And Best Buy may be in a unique position to make bundles even more enticing than other retailers. MUST SEE: 10 awesome Galaxy Note 7 features you won’t find on any iPhone The Galaxy Note 7 will be available for preorder from a variety of retailers and carriers beginning on August 3rd, and will then be available to purchase in stores on August 19th. Amazon, Best Buy, Car Toys, Sam’s Club, Target and select Walmart stores will sell the phone, as will AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular and Verizon Wireless. Best Buy’s Galaxy Note 7 preorder deal will include either a free Gear Fit2 wearable (but not a new Gear VR headset) or a free Samsung 256GB memory card along with the purchase of a Galaxy Note 7 from a store, while supply lasts. Those deals are available across the board from all retailers, but here’s where things get interesting: Best Buy’s told BGR it would be “the only place” where customers will walk out with Samsung’s free item on launch day, implying that other retailers might ship your free wearable or microSD card only after the Galaxy Note 7 reaches you, once it’s in stock. Interestingly, if you don’t want to buy the Galaxy Note 7 now that you’ve seen it and you’d rather stick with a Galaxy S7 edge instead, you’re still going to be able to take advantage of the promotion. Samsung’s bundle deal also covers the Galaxy S7 edge, and you can get the free perk with either phone. Finally, Samsung also said that customers who sign up for Samsung Pay and make their first purchase they will qualify to $20 in rewards. That’s if you need more reasons to buy the Galaxy Note 7 or Galaxy S7 edge this month.

After the last fish had been brought to the scale, John Cox of DeBary, Florida, extended his Day One lead Friday by weighing in a five-bass limit totaling 15 pounds, 10 ounces. Cox’s two-day total of 10 bass weighing 32-5 gives him a 6-pound, 7-ounce lead heading into Day Three, with Jacob Wheeler of Indianapolis, Indiana, in second place with 10 bass weighing 25-14. “Today was pretty good for me,” said Cox, who has already earned more than $144,000 this season in FLW competition. “I caught seven keepers out of the same hole that I was in yesterday. I went past where I stopped yesterday – I hit a couple of logs running in and a couple of logs running out – and I thought it was going to be better, but the fish that I thought were in the back were making their way out.” Although he was not ready to get specific, Cox said that he caught his fish Friday on two different baits – a topwater and a plastic worm. He said that he planned to start tomorrow in the same location, but wouldn’t hesitate to change things up if he has to. “Things are going pretty good right now, but you never know what’s going to happen and things could change tomorrow,” he said. “I’ve only fished that one spot so far. I’ve got a backup spot, but I’m going to wait and see. It’s similar, but it’s a different tributary and I’d rather not use it right now if I don’t have to. “I’m really looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow,” Cox continued. “We’re on the Tennessee River and there are a lot of big fish in this place. I’m going back to the same spot tomorrow and we’ll see what happens. I think that if I can catch 15 (pounds) tomorrow and 10 (pounds) the last day, it ought to be enough to get it done.” The top 20 pros that will continue to Saturday’s competition on Wheeler Lake are: John Cox, Debary, Fla., 10 bass, 32-5 Jacob Wheeler, Indianapolis, Ind., 10 bass, 25-14 Michael Neal, Dayton, Tenn., 10 bass, 25-14 Darrel Robertson, Jay, Okla., 10 bass, 25-3 Todd Auten, Lake Wylie, S.C., nine bass, 25-2 Bryan Thrift, Shelby, N.C., 10 bass, 24-10 Walmart pro Mark Rose, West Memphis, Ark., 10 bass, 24-4 Bill Chapman, Salt Rock, W.

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Everyone gets a sales-tax break Friday Aug 5, 2016 at 7:20 PM Aug 9, 2016 at 12:33 PM By Maggie Menderski maggie.menderski@heraldtribune.com Rachel Walker couldn't stretch her son's clothes to make them fit. But she could stretch her dollars. Her son, Brandon, had hit a growth spurt last year, and nothing fit. The soon-to-be sophomore at Venice High School needed a new wardrobe on top of the traditional cartload of classroom school supplies. With a shopping list like that, every penny counts, so Walker and Brandon were up at 7 a.m. to take advantage of the three-day sales tax holiday, which kicked off Friday. “We've got a battle plan, and we're ready,” the mother said. “He has outgrown everything ... and that's why we're smart shopping because we have to replace basically everything that he has.” Back-to-school is traditionally considered the second-largest shopping season of the year. This year, consumers with elementary- and high school-aged children are expected to spend $27.3 billion before its time to truly hit the books, a survey from the National Retail Federation predicted. This weekend, the state is cutting shoppers a break on sales tax on qualifying apparel items and school supplies worth up to $60 and $15, respectively. Meanwhile, many retailers are pairing the 6 to 7 percent tax break with rewards, promotions, extended hours and major clearance events. The game plan Walker had printed off coupons and scoped out sales. She and Brandon loaded up a cart at Walmart first and were browsing the aisles at Westfield Sarasota Square's JCPenney by 10:30 a.m. The state had slimmed back this year's tax break from 2015's anomalous 10-day, double-weekend event. Walker thought the change back might spur crowds, and she wanted to finish before the mayhem started and the stock was picked over. “It forces everybody in, and it's just crazy,” Walker said. “So that's why we wanted to do it first thing this morning.” Aoibhin Boles, 12, and her mother were filling up shopping bags at Ellenton Premium Outlets. She still has four weeks until she heads back to her home and school in England. The family has a summer home not too far from the outlet mall, and they were very familiar with the sales tax holiday. Boles' mother had a fistful of bags, and by early afternoon the daughter was stocked up on clothes and athletic wear to take home for the school year. “I just wanted to bring some stuff home because I actually quite like the clothes here,” Aoibhin said. Beyond students Students weren't the only ones taking advantage of the savings. The state uses the term “school supplies” fairly loosely, and even adults can get a break on apparel if they are willing to face the crowds.  Tampa resident Ashlynd Bright had a friend in town from West Virginia, and the duo stopped at the Ellenton outlet mall for a quick trip to Nine West and New York & Company on their way south to Siesta Key.   The 20-something is done with school, and she was hoping to add to her professional wardrobe before hitting the beach. “We decided to stop in and shop,” Bright said. “It's tax-free weekend, and I actually had a gift card I've been saving specifically for this weekend.” The back-to-school sales tax holiday got off to a sleepy start Friday morning. Traffic was light up and down South Tamiami Trail and parking lots were thin. That is pretty typical for Sarasota, said Bob Parker, general manager at JCPenney, but he noted that there were some people ready to shop when he opened his doors an hour earlier than usual at 9 a.m. Ellenton Premium Outlets, too, had opened early Friday to accommodate the crowds, said Sarah Ozgun, the shopping center's director of marketing and business development. The east parking lot there was packed by noon Friday, and the walkways were bustling with shoppers laden with bags. Even as shoppers began to blanket his store, Parker didn't expect Friday's true peak at JCPenney to come until about 3 p.m. after parents clocked out of work.  The real boom will likely hit today. “Today's day will double yesterday's,” Parker said on Friday. “And then tomorrow's day will double today, and then Sunday will be the last mad rush for getting that last bit of tax-free that you can.”  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services FAQs Contact Us About Us Subscribe Now Vacation Stops/Restarts Manage My Account Submissions News Tips Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Letter to the Editor Business News Announcements Advertising Display an Ad Special Publications Classified Ads Place an Ad Advertise With Us Online Services RSS Feeds Print Archives Mobile App Text Alerts Newsletters Digital Services for Business Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Would consumers love “Just Mayo?” Well, consumers were buying it. Special consumers. Consumers paid by Hampton Foods to buy it. That’s according to a new exposé, which also alleged that Hampton Creek had contractors call grocery stores to ask about the controversial product. The startup is backed by high-profile Silicon Valley investors Khosla Ventures and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, along with Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Eight months before a $90 million funding round closed in 2014, “Hampton Creek executives quietly launched a campaign to purchase mass quantities of Just Mayo from stores,” according to Bloomberg. The news outlet based its report on interviews with five former Hampton Creek employees and more than 250 receipts, expense reports, cash advance documents and emails, it said. “In addition to buying up hundreds of jars of the product across the U.S., contractors were told to call store managers pretending they were customers and ask about Just Mayo,” Bloomberg reported. “Strong demand for a product typically prompts retailers to order more and stock it in additional stores.” Expense reports showed contractors had bought back the product from Safeway, and former workers said Hampton Creek had paid for its own products at Whole Foods, Cosco, Walmart, Target and Kroger stores across the U.S., according to Bloomberg. A purported April 2014 email to contractors known as “Creekers” highlighted the fierce battle for shelf space in the condiments aisle of supermarkets. Bloomberg reported that Hampton Creek’s then-director of corporate partnership Caroline Love wrote, “We need you in Safeway buying Just Mayo and our new flavored mayos… The most important next step with Safeway is huge sales out of the gate. This will ensure we stay on the shelf to put an end to Hellmann’s factory-farmed egg mayo.” Just Mayo’s lack of eggs gave it market appeal to vegans and health-conscious consumers, but it had also sparked a war with Unilever, the multi-national behemoth that owns Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Unilever had sued Hampton Creek over Just Mayo, accusing its much smaller competitor of false advertising, because mayonnaise by definition is made with eggs. Unilever later dropped the suit because the picking-on-the-little-guy optics were so ugly. Messaging from Love appears to have made it clear that contractors buying Just Mayo at Safeway were to fly under the radar. “I might go through the self-checkout lanes, or make several transactions going to different cashiers each time to avoid questions like, ‘Why are you buying so much mayo?!’” Love wrote. “Make sure you are not wearing your (Hampton Creek) gear when you go into Safeway. This is an undercover project.” Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick told Bloomberg that the buybacks were done mostly to check on the quality of the faux mayonnaise. “Assessing the product from the customer perspective, more than anything, gets us out of the bubble of typical manufacturing,” Tetrick said. “We’ll continue doing it.” A company executive named Melanie Myers provided the news outlet with a statement saying the program was primarily for quality control, however “we also thought it might give us a little momentum out of the gate,” according to Bloomberg. A former contractor showed Bloomberg receipts reflecting purchase of more than 140 jars of Just Mayo in a day, according to the news outlet. Another contractor said Hampton Creek instructed workers to hit more than a dozen stores in less than a week, and recalled buying at least 20 jars in a single store, Bloomberg reported. Companies usually focus their quality control efforts on goods that haven’t left the factory, consumer data analyst Kurt Jetta told Bloomberg. “There’s no legitimate explanation for a manufacturer buying significant quantities of their own product from the shelf,” Jetta said.   Photo: Mayonnaise (Flickr creative commons/Stacy Spensley) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Hampton Creek, Hellmann's, Just Mayo, mayonnaise, san francisco, startup, Unilever   More Posts in 1 Crucial Silicon Valley H-1B visa issue unclear under Trump November 21, 2016   Mark Zuckerberg shares Facebook’s plan to combat fake news November 19, 2016   Microsoft to tie executive bonuses to workforce diversity after two years of reduced female employees: report November 18, 2016       Share this Post Tweet       WARCHICK At the end of the day it still tastes like poo.

Fiji Time: 7:16 AM on Thursday 24 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business A waiting game Tk Jayaraman Saturday, August 06, 2016 THE US is the world's largest economy — GDP of $US18 trillion ($F37tn). Its exports are $US1.6tn ($F3tn), ranked as number three. But, it imports more: $US2.3tn ($F4.8tn): number one along with the European Union. America's annual trade deficit with China has been about $US366 billion ($F758tn), one billion a day. The US consumers at their Walmart and Target stores guzzle China's consumer goods to the delight of the Communist rulers. China successfully adopted the capitalist mode of amassing wealth, emerging not long ago as the world's second largest economy. China is the world's number one exporter: at $US2.2tn ($F4.6tn), amounting to 12 per cent of world exports. Did not Deng Xiaoping say: "Poverty is not socialism; to be rich is glorious." Exciting US elections Communist China's politics under one party government are predictable. Nothing exciting! But, uncertainties and political fireworks now seen on US TV Channels, televised all over globe, are a great entertainment to all. We all know there are no big differences between the two parties. If one party is for freedom, the other party wants more freedom, with no controls on acquiring guns. If one party is for enterprise, the other party wants rugged individualism! They are more like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the fictional characters from Alice in Wonderland. The US economy would grow regardless of party differences. It grew under both Democrat and Republican administrations. They were not just presidents of US. They were world leaders of great influence: Democrat presidents, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy; and the Republican Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. They supported world economic growth, as long as the methods were not socialistic. The great Chinese communist theoretician Deng reminds us again: "It doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice." With elections once in four years, the US and the world economy always gets going. Only when the US economy got into bad patches just as the 2008 financial crisis, the world had to grow slow. Even then, there was no problem during past eight years, as the US central bank pumped in money, through quantitative easing. The US investors took their funds out of America to emerging economies and the rest of the world seeking higher return. The world was not let down! The worried world The world is worried because the two parties are forging one common agenda. Traditionally, the Republicans are in favour of free trade. On the other hand, Democrats lean upon labour unions for political support. They oppose free trade as imports take away their jobs. Now with the Brexit vote in the UK which enabled Britain to vote itself out of the single European market, the two parties in America want to get out of free trade mania. US president BarackObama tried to get the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a recently negotiated trade deal between the US and 11 Asia-Pacific nations, ratified by the US Congress. The legislative approval of TPP looks impossible. Republican candidate Donald Trump has already taken the stand that he would oppose TPP. He has been accusing China of currency manipulation. He announced he would impose a 35 per cent tariff on imported cars and parts produced by Ford plants in Mexico and a 45 per cent tariff on imports from China. Republican senators have withdrawn support to TPP and are now seeking the working-class white men's support. Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton, at best a lukewarm enthusiast of free trade, now knows well why she lost the Michigan primary to her opponent, Senator Sanders. He rallied voters against "disastrous trade deals". Mr Sanders' supporters now want Mrs Clinton to maintain that trade was killing American jobs. So where is the world heading? If Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump take an identical stand, world trade would shrink. If US imposes tariffs, no doubt price level increase and domestic production would rise and new jobs will be created. Professor Barry Eichengreen writes in his latest syndicated column that such restrictions on imports would be welcomed against the current background of no job growth in the midst of liquidity trap and low interest rate. But if China and others retaliate with their own tariffs, US exports will be flattened. The total effect would be decline in the volume of world trade. The sufferers will be small nations. Already, Fiji and other Pacific Islands are experiencing slowdown in their commodity exports. Further, decrease in world trade volume would render smaller trade surpluses for richer nations. They will not be able maintain previous high levels of capital outflows to countries with capital shortages. With decreased economic activities, tourism would also decline. Last word Prof Eichengreen writes: "I want to be clear: there are other, better ways of raising prices and stimulating economic activity. The obvious alternative to import tariffs is plain-vanilla fiscal policy — tax cuts and increases in public spending." His final advice to the potential world leader, who has to be a diplomat as well: "Tariff protection may not be bad macroeconomic policy in a liquidity trap. But this doesn't make it good foreign policy — for Trump or anyone else." * Professor Jayaraman teaches economics at FNU.

Privacy Policy As Elizabeth Loebl cleared piles of dirt from a small stone building in Ellicott City, a historic district hit hard by a deadly flood on July 30, the 36-year-old volunteer gawked at the enormity of the task ahead. "This is just one building. Imagine what's down there," said Loebl, who lives in Ellicott City, minutes away from the area slammed by the flood. "We're going to be here for a long time. The cameras will be gone by then. But we will still be here," Loebl said. On Friday, a handful of volunteers including Loebl began cleaning up damage left by the flood, which claimed two lives, displaced dozens of residents and swept many small businesses into ruin. More than 30 vehicles are submerged in the Patapsco River and two buildings remain under the threat of collapse, said Ryan Miller, the county's director of the Office of Emergency Management. After more than 2,500 individuals contacted Howard County’s call center offering their help since flash floods devastated Ellicott City on July 30, the county announced that volunteers will be admitted to help with the clean up in areas deemed safe and with supervision. Volunteers gathered at the edge of Main Street to start chipping away at what they conceded would be a long recovery. More than 2,500 people had contacted Howard County's call center to offer help. Others showed up throughout the week at the site, shovels in hand but were turned away by police from the restricted area. On Thursday, the county's #ECStrong campaign announced that volunteers would be allowed to assist with cleanup efforts. The county has set up a volunteer center at the Walmart at 3200 North Ridge Road in Ellicott City to ferry volunteers to a parking lot on Ellicott Mills Drive and the west end of Main Street to begin clean up in areas deemed safe by the county. Staff pre-registered volunteers at the center - open from 8 a.m.to 4 p.m. Most of the west end has been cleared, Miller said. The day of the flood, Eric Jayne, a teacher at Pointers Run Elementary, planned to celebrate his 41st birthday at Bean Hollow, a quaint coffee shop on Main Street destroyed by Saturday's flood. In a sudden turn of events, Jayne stood on Friday just feet from Main Street, blocked off by police, shoveling mud from one of the old town's historic buildings. Ellicott City flood timeline Jin Kim Jin Kim "We're waiting. As soon as that police tape comes down, there is a community here ready to put this town back together," Jayne said. "This is going to take a true community effort." The county plans to rebuild the area so that it is "stronger than ever," said Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman. But Kittleman and other officials did not estimate how long the restoration would take. On Friday morning, the Howard County Council extended a state of emergency in Ellicott City until Sept. 7, allowing the county to limit public access to old Ellicott City. "We have seen an overwhelming response from the community," Kittleman said. "People are coming together in ways we haven't seen before. It's remarkable." Ellicott City Partnership, the nonprofit organization that manages the old town, has collected more than $100,000 in donations. On the corner of Main Street and Ellicott Mills Drive, volunteers shoveled piles of dirt from the inside of a small stone building that once was the town's first courthouse. Ironically, the building was turned into a center in 1998 to house information about fires and floods in the old town. The volunteer effort drew Joyce Tami from her home in Alexandria, Virginia. Putting her hands in the dirt transcended simply writing a check, she said. "We're lucky to be able to do this," Tami said. "All I can hope is I never need people to help me. We're so lucky to be helping." Ron Vogelsang, a 47-year-old park specialist with the county's Department of Recreation and Parks, said the county needs the extra hands to clear the area. Loaders designed to move dirt are too large to steer dirt in the narrow areas of the historic building.

(Fatimah Waseem) In his 21 years with the department, Vogelsang said "the damage is far worse than I could have ever imagined." For volunteers like Jason Dowling, 36, of Ellicott City, the clean-up effort hit close to home. Dowling spent much of his childhood on Main Street and used to work at Johnny's Bistro on Main, a restaurant on the street. Dowling often took popular "ghost tours," which walked tourists through the haunted history of the old town. Now, Dowling said the town will be haunted by the history of this year's flood. "The tours won't have the same effect. It won't be an old historic town anymore. When they rebuild it, people are going to think about that flood. They're going to think, 'When is this going to happen again?' It's scary."

Most importantly, for students and families facing financial challenges, assistance in purchasing school supplies and/or uniforms may be available. Many companies and stores also donate school supplies to the schools. Therefore, it is important for parents to contact your child's school directly, as soon as possible, for information and/or to sign up, depending on the school's procedures. Also, those facing financial challenges can contact the many nonprofits and organizations that provide school supplies for low-income families. For example, The mayor's Back 2 School Fest is an annual event. However, parents must register on the website. Upon registration, the location, date and time will be provided. Moreover, stores across the city that carry school supplies have pre-packaged deals, along with supply lists from area schools, as well as special buys for some of the most needed and required items such as spiral notebooks. A few of these stores are H-E-B, Kroger, Randall's, Wal-Mart and others. When it comes to deciding to purchase the pre-packaged, bundled items or buy items separately, it really depends on how much time you have and what store you visit. "At Office Depot, beginning the first part of August, we will have a special school supply item on sale each week for a penny, and parents appreciate the cost savings. We do not bundle our items, and most people buy the items separately, taking advantage of our sales find they spend less," said Blake Green, assistant manager at Office Depot, River Oaks. Although many Houston Independent School District campuses have similar requirements for requested school supplies, parents should check the HISD website, www.houstonisd.org, and type in school supplies in the search box at the top for the lists or contact their child's school directly to obtain a list before making their purchases. Moreover, schools' websites also offer calendars, bus schedules, student registration dates, and other important dates for parents and students to review. For more information about requested school supply lists for students, visit the districts' websites, listed below. However, be sure to check the individual school's supply lists to confirm these lists are complete. These websites serve only as a starting point. All Texas schools are listed at www.school-supply-list.com. Click on the grade level at the bottom and then type in your zip code to find your school, for the school supply lists.

JCPenney bringing appliances to the Shore Joan Verdon, @JoanVerdon 1:41 p.m. EDT August 5, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share 2016 Presidential Race; Pair robbed while playing Pokemon Go; Olympian arrested on suspicion of sexual assault Jeffery Hernandez, left, shows off an LG clothes washer to Pricilla DelRusso, right, and Faith Young of Newark at the new appliance section in the JCPenney at the Wayne Town Center. (Photo: CHRIS MONROE/CORRESPONDENT) JCPenney Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison has a theory about appliances. To sell them, according to Ellison, you have to understand women. And he’s confident that JCPenney stores, where 70 percent of the shoppers are female, knows how to sell to women. “We’re going to improve the way customers shop for appliances by building an emotional connection with the female shopper who already trusts JCPenney to furnish her home and wardrobe,” said Ellison when the retail store chain announced plans in January to test appliance sales in 22 stores California, Texas, and Florida. He believes the woman of the house casts the deciding vote when it comes to buying a dishwasher or dryer. Now, JCPenney is rolling out appliance departments in stores throughout the country, with six already open in the state, and plans to open seven more in New Jersey in coming weeks, including three in Monmouth and Ocean counties. WATCH:Primark opening at Freehold Raceway Mall Q&A: What is Primark? One of the biggest displays of JCPenney’s leap into appliances can be found at the store at Wayne Towne Center in Wayne, which has carved out a 4,800-square-foot space on the second floor to showcase 190 different makes and models of refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, dishwashers, washing machines and dryers. The JCPenney store at Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus has a smaller appliance display. Appliance showrooms also are open at the JCPenney stores at Newport Centre Mall in Jersey City, Rockaway Townsquare mall in Rockaway, Woodbridge Center in Woodbridge and Brunswick Square mall in East Brunswick. Stores in Freehold Township, Toms River, Eatontown, Trenton, Cherry Hill, Deptford and Mays Landing are expected to open their showrooms in the coming weeks. JCPenney plans to have appliance sales at 500 locations by the end of this year, covering about half of its stores. MALL: New plans for Monmouth Mall eliminate hotel RETAILING: Walmart jumps into mobile payment world PRICES: Restaurant charges more for debit, credit card  (Photo: CHRIS MONROE/CORRESPONDENT) At both the Wayne Towne Center store and the Plaza store in Paramus, the appliance department is designed to catch the eye of the female shopper, located near home bedding and housewares departments. In Wayne, the newest high-tech models are prominently displayed, including the Samsung Family Hub refrigerator, which has an interior camera and Wifi connection that lets the owner view what’s in the fridge from a smartphone, or leave messages on a video display in the door; and the LG All in One Washer and Electric Ventless Dryer that dries the clothes after the wash cycle ends. JCPenney used to sell appliances until the early 1980s, and even had its own house brand at one point, Penncrest, similar to the Kenmore brand owned by rival Sears. But JCPenney abandoned the appliance category 30 years ago to devote more space to apparel. But these aren’t your grandmother’s appliances, says Alan Wolf, CQ senior editor of the consumer electronics and appliances trade publication TWICE. “It’s become a sexy category,” Wolf said. Companies such as Samsung and LG, two of the brands featured in the stores, “which are tech companies essentially, have brought a lot of high technology into the machines that didn’t exist.” JCPenney, by adding appliances, is targeting a previous stronghold of its chief competitor, Sears. “Penney obviously saw a vulnerability with Sears,” Wolf said. “With Sears experiencing weakness now, particularly in its appliance business, its core appliance business, Penney saw an opportunity,” he said. “And appliances are a great category, with very solid margins,” he said.  (Photo: CHRIS MONROE/CORRESPONDENT) Jefferies analyst Randal Konik, in a note to investors, said Penney’s move into appliances has caused Sears to fight back with discounts and promotions. JCPenney, in rolling out the appliance showrooms, has offered up to 20 percent off on certain styles, no-interest financing, price matching and free delivery. Sears countered with up to 30 percent off, and its own financing and free delivery offers. Konik said that he was impressed with the JCPenney appliance assortment and concluded that the company “is well positioned to take share as it continues rolling out major appliances.” Employees at the Wayne JCPenney said the appliance displays are attracting a lot of interest from shoppers, many of whom say “I didn’t know you sold appliances.” The department has been open since mid-July and has sold a number of major appliances, including one large order to a customer who redid a kitchen. “The customers like the 24-month financing with 0 interest, the two- to five-day delivery and installation, and the chance to get JCPenney rewards on appliances,” said MaLisa Powell, general manager of the Wayne Towne Center store.

A host of delegates loyal to Senator Bernie Sanders were inside in large numbers exclaiming “No more war” during former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta’s speech and raising all kinds of progressive, rebellious signs and banners against the Hillary crowd. Although Hillary addressed them directly in her acceptance speech, “Your cause is my cause,” those dissatisfied delegates in the hall saw her rhetoric for what it was: insincere and opportunistic. She said she’d tax the wealthy for public necessities, but declined to mention a sales tax on Wall Street speculation that could bring in as much as $300 billion a year to support such initiatives. She opposed “unfair trade agreements,” but remarkably omitted saying she was against the TPP (the notorious pending Trans Pacific Trade Agreement backed by Obama that is receiving wide left/right opposition). She paid lip service to a “living wage” but avoided endorsing a $15 an hour minimum wage, which would help single moms and their children – people she wants us to believe have been her enduring cause. Few people know that it took until the spring of 2014 before candidate Clinton would come out for even a $10.10 minimum wage. News reports noted that Clinton, a former member of Walmart’s board of directors and Arkansas corporate lawyer, was wrestling with how to support $10.10 per hour without alienating her Wall Street friends. “Caring for kids” doesn’t extend to encircled Gaza’s defenseless children, hundreds of whom were killed by American-made weapons wielded by the all powerful Israeli military. Gaza is the the world’s largest open air prison and under illegal blockade. Remember, as Secretary of State, Hillary fully backed war crimes, condemned by almost all countries in the world. On the stage in Philadelphia, she spoke of backing Israel’s security without any mention of Palestinian rights or the need to end Israel’s illegal occupation of the territories. It is true, as numerous speakers repeated, Clinton is “most qualified and experienced,” but her record shows those qualities have led to belligerent, unlawful military actions that are now boomeranging against U.S. interests. The intervention she insistently called for in Libya, with Obama’s foolish consent, over-rode the wiser counsel of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (and his generals), who warned of the chaos that would follow. He was proven right, with chaotic violence now all over Libya spilling into other African countries. This is but one example of what Bernie Sanders meant during the debates when he referenced her “poor judgement.” The media coverage of political conventions tends to sink to the level of the circus. The PBS/NPR coverage with some half dozen reporters and two commentators proved to be thin, light, soft and superficial. Otherwise smart media communicators were reduced to very heavy focus on exactly what the Party’s manipulators wanted. “What is Hillary really like?” Of course the stage was filled with frothy admiration, awe and acclamation. But why didn’t the media point out some of the factual omissions, the contradictions to the endless sugarcoating of the nominee? To her credit, NPR/PBS reporter, Susan Davis, did blurt out that the Convention program was mostly about personality and character with little policy. Reporters did, however, point out that unlike all other candidates, Hillary Clinton has not had a news conference since last December to showcase her supposed experience, qualifications and knowledge! Why wouldn’t Hillary Clinton, in her attack on Donald Trump, demand the release of his tax returns? Hillary and Bill have regularly released their tax returns. Maybe because Trump would demand Hillary release her secret Wall Street transcripts of her $5,000-a-minute paid speeches to big bankers and other businesses. To her verbal credit, Hillary Clinton raised the “unpatriotic” charge against too many U.S. corporations (not all she added) when it comes to our country. Born in the U.S.A, grown to profit on the backs of American workers, bailed out by American taxpayers and occasionally by the U.S. Marines overseas, these giant companies have no allegiance to country or community. They are, with trade agreements and other inducements, abandoning America’s workers and escaping America’s laws and taxes. Hearing the word “unpatriotic” applied to those companies I could imagine these firms’ executives and P.R. flacks shuddering for the only time during her 55-minute address. The stigma of being “unpatriotic” to their enabling native country can have consequential legs for turning public opinion even more deeply against these monetized corporate Goliaths. Stung by the consistently high “untrustworthy” ratings since polling started asking that question (only Trump exceeds her in most polls), she declared again that no one achieves greatness alone, that it takes us working together, that it “Takes a Village,” alluding to her earlier book. If that is true, then Together must have more power than the Few. “Together” should include workers, consumers, small taxpayers, voters and communities who are excluded from power, from the tools of democracy – electoral reforms and clean elections, more unions and cooperatives, access to justice for wrongful injuries and against crony capitalism and corporate crime and greater citizen empowerment. Does she have an agenda for a devolution of power from the few to the many so that we can be “stronger together,” (her slogan for 2016)? No way. Mum’s the word! This immense gap has been the Clinton duo’s con job on America for many years. Sugarcoating phrases, populist flattery, getting the election over with and jumping back into the fold of the plutocracy is their customary M.O. An anti-Hillary campaign button sums it up. Imagine a nice picture of Hillary with the words “More Wall Street” above her head and the words “More War” below her head. Alert voters could see it coming at the Convention: the militarism for Hillary the Hawk on day four in Philadelphia and the arrival of the corporate fat cats. Or, as the New York Times headlined: “Top Donors Leave Sidelines, Checkbooks in Hand.” The best thing Hillary Clinton has going for her is the self-destructive, unstable, unorganized, fact and truth-starved, egomaniacal, cheating, plutocratic, Donald Trump (See my column “Cheating Donald”). That’s where our nation’s two-party political leadership is today. When will the vast left/right majority rise to take over and reverse the eviscerating policies and practices of this political duopoly?

Target is once again selling devices from the online retail giant on its website. Those looking for a Kindle e-reader, Fire TV streaming device or Fire tablets can now purchase them from Target's website today or from one of the company's retail locations starting in October. Amazon's popular Echo, Tap and Dot smart speaker line are not currently being sold by Target. While the devices have been available on Amazon's site and at retail locations such as Best Buy for years, Target stopped selling Amazon-made gadgets in 2012 amid concerns it was drawing consumers away from its stores in favor of Amazon. Rival Walmart followed Target's lead and pulled Amazon devices from its shelves shortly afterwards under similar concerns. It still does not sell the devices today. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that 63 million Americans, 52% of Amazon's U.S. customers, were subscribers to the company's $99-per year premium Prime service at the end of June. With such a large percentage taking part in Prime it's clear that pulling the devices from shelves hasn't stopped consumers from shopping at Amazon. Instead, by selling Amazon's devices, Target now hopes the high-profile name could give its electronics division a boost. USA TODAY 52% of U.S. Amazon customers belong to Prime For Amazon, the renewed partnership with Target and it's close to 1,800 stores gives its devices a nice bump as it looks to boost its physical retail presence. Amazon has dabbled with its own retail stores over the past year, opening its first bookstore in Seattle in November, with a second store slated to open in San Diego this summer. Rumors of an additional location in New York picked up steam last month following a New York Post report that the company was close to leasing a midtown spot in Hudson Yards. The stores sell books as well as showcase the company's gadget line.

Anthony Donavin Werden, 24, is charged with uttering threats, assault with a weapon, assault, possessing weapon for a dangerous purpose and two counts of possession of a controlled substance. Police reported that a shirtless, intoxicated male was observed threatening people with a knife and a screwdriver in Walmart around 9:30 p.m. July 27. Police located the male and arrested him without incident. Werden was sentenced to 14 months in jail in September, 2015 after pleading guilty to possessing a stolen vehicle, two counts of obstructing a peace officer, one count of breaking and entering and multiple breaches of probation. Read more: Man with ‘atrocious’ record sentenced During Werden’s sentencing in 2015, Crown counsel Nashina Devji called Werden’s criminal record “absolutely atrocious,” noting he had spent significant periods of time in custody for a young man and called him a “well-rounded offender.” During that sentencing Devji also noted that the 19-year-old Penticton teen who died of a heroin overdose told police Werden introduced her to injecting drugs, something Warden told the judge was a “touchy subject,” though Werden’s defence counsel at the time, Nelson Selmaj, noted that “there is no information that comes from these allegations and that’s not why Mr. Werden is before the court.” Werden faces an arraignment hearing on Aug. 10 in Penticton Provincial Court.

The deal, awaiting final judicial approval, was made just a few weeks after a federal court ruled that the state's 2011 voter identification law was discriminatory. Voters without the photo ID will be allowed to sign an affidavit certifying citizenship and presenting proof of residence with a document such as utility bill or bank statement. As courts nationwide continue to tip in favor of protecting the voting rights of Americans, it's affirming to see Texas take the right steps -- even if it made the decision under duress. DeSoto Fire Rescue Chief Jerry Duffield, left, talks with Hector Montoya, 11, right, for his donation of 125 smoke detectors to the department on Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2016. (Rex C. Curry/Special Contributor) Special Contributor Marveling at a Grand Prairie youth's generous spirit Hector Montoya discovered at an early age that not everyone was as lucky as his Grand Prairie family when it came to having a home smoke detector. Moved by the deaths of a Fort Worth mother and daughter in a house fire, the then 9-year-old decided to use the $300 he had saved for a PlayStation 4 to buy and donate smoke detectors to families who didn't have them. Now 11, Hector has donated 6,425 of the devices across North Texas. Just this week, he gave 125 kits to DeSoto Fire Rescue. With Wal-Mart and fire safety supplier Kidde behind him, Hector vows to cross the 8,000 mark by year's end. Hearty cheers for this generous youth and the many other young people who quietly do good works throughout our community. Well, that didn't take long. After just two months on the job, Dallas County GOP chairman Mark Montgomery has stepped down.  A tea party activist who ousted respected incumbent Wade Emmert in the spring primary election, Montgomery was unable to get traditional GOP donors to open their wallets. As a result, the group's bank account has dwindled from $30,000 to $180, a really bad sign with the fall general election just a few weeks away.  Blame for this leadership void goes to the inexperienced Montgomery and to Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, who U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions has said played a major role in supporting Montgomery's challenge to Emmert. Not again Texas apparently has never met a lawsuit it didn't like. State officials recently sued the Environmental Protection Agency over new federal rules designed to reduce methane emissions. If this sounds familiar, it should. Since Barack Obama became president, Texas has filed at least 40 lawsuits challenging environmental and other federal regulations. Rather than repeatedly running to the courthouse, state officials would be better served if by devoting that time and energy to complying with environmental rules that would prepare our economy for the transition to less dependence on fossil fuels. FILE - In this Oct. 16, 2014, file photo, a screen at a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is juxtaposed with the Goldman Sachs booth. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reports financial results Tuesday, July 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP Federal Reserve right to fine Goldman Sachs over confidential information In 2014, a Goldman Sachs employee received confidential information from an employee at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Both employees were fired, and New York regulators fined the bank $50 million for failing to adequately supervise its employee. That was well-deserved. This week, the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in Washington went after Goldman Sachs, too, imposing an additional $36 million penalty on Goldman Sachs, pointing out lax policies and training. That was the right move, too. It's good to see the Fed focus on Wall Street misconduct; institutions charged with maintaining the integrity of the financial system must be independent from the banks they oversee. Pope Francis speaks to believers before leaving the Porziuncola (Portiuncula) at Santa Maria degli Angeli Basilica, near Assisi. Pope Francis travelled to the Italian town of Assisi on August 4 for a private visit to mark the 800th anniversary of the 'Pardon of Assisi', under which the slates of sinners can be wiped clean. The 79-year-old pope arrived by helicopter in the hill-town in central Italy where his namesake Saint Francis of Assisi was born and found God, renouncing his wealth for a life of poverty and becoming an emissary of peace during the Crusades. GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP/Getty Images AFP/Getty Images Pope Francis right to study whether Catholic Church should ordain female deacons Neither this newspaper nor anyone else has the right to tell the Catholic Church who it will or will not ordain as a priest or deacon. But that doesn't stop up from applauding Pope Francis' decision this week to formally appoint six men and six women from around the world to study whether the church should end its long-held prohibition of woman from being ordained as deacons. On one level it's just one small step. But the formal commission, which includes one American theologian, is a welcome manifestation of this pontiff's willingness to reconsider church laws that many have seen as discriminatory. Dr. Wayne Aldredge, president of the American Academy of Periodontology, demonstrates how dental floss should be used in Holmdel, N.J. Itâs one of the most universal recommendations in all of public health: Floss daily to prevent gum disease and cavities. Except thereâs little proof that flossing works. When the federal government issued its 2016 dietary guidelines, the flossing recommendation had been removed, without notice. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) AP New Associated Press report finds no proven medical benefits of flossing Has Big Floss been stringing us along for decades? Turns out, there's little evidence for the medical benefits of flossing, according to a new report from The Associated Press. After looking into 25 studies conducted over the last decade, The AP found that the support for flossing is "weak, very unreliable," of "very low" quality, and carries "a moderate to large potential for bias." While the federal government has recommended flossing since 1979, that recommendation has been removed from the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which, as required by law, must be based on scientific evidence. It's troubling the government recommended flossing for decades without any solid proof. However, the revelation should help with some of that I-don't-floss-enough guilt. Investigators at the site where a hot air balloon crashed, killing 16 people, west of Lockhart, Texas, July 30, 2016. Officials said the craft caught fire in midair and plummeted to the ground in what appeared to be the worst balloon accident in U.S. history. (Tamir Kalifa/The New York Times) NYT FAA ignored calls for greater oversight of the hot-air balloon industry two years before deadliest crash in history On the morning of July 30, 16 people were killed in a hot air balloon crash near Lockhart, about 30 minutes outside of Austin. It was the deadliest balloon crash in American history, and the second-deadliest worldwide, after a 2013 crash in Egypt that killed 19. Just two years ago, in 2014, the National Transportation Safety Board wrote to the Federal Aviation Administration, "The potential for a high number of fatalities in a single air tour balloon accident is of particular concern if air tour balloon operators continue to conduct operations under less stringent regulations and oversight." The FAA rejected the recommendations, saying the risks were too low to need regulations. Will the tragedy in Austin make the agency rethink?

The ex-officer, Stephen Rankin, shot 18-year-old William Chapman in the face and chest outside a Wal-Mart store last year after a security guard called police to go after the young man. No video recorded the actual killing, and testimony conflicted on the details of what happened. But most witnesses said Chapman had his hands up, and prosecutor Stephanie Morales said the officer could have used non-deadly force. The officer "brought a gun into what is at worst a fist fight," Morales told the jury, which deliberated for nearly two days before returning its verdict. Rankin, 36, faced one to 10 years on the manslaughter conviction. Morales asked jurors to give him the maximum, while defence attorney James Broccoletti argued that no amount of jail time would bring Chapman back to life. Rankin, who was fired from the Portsmouth police force after being indicted, had already killed another unarmed suspect, four years earlier, and many in the mostly black city of 100 000 saw his trial as a chance for accountability as police shootings continue around the country. But his lawyers said this case had nothing to do with deadly uses of force against other black men. ‘Terrible tragedy’ "I think this is a terrible tragedy I wish it had never happened. I wish none of it had ever occurred," Rankin testified after being found guilty. "I can't begin to fathom how much pain that family is going through. I wish I could have done more to keep him alive," he added. Chapman's second cousin, Earl Lewis, also took the stand, speaking through tears about the family's struggle to find money to bury him. The jurors — eight black and four white — did not convict on the first-degree murder charge prosecutors sought. Criminal charges are rare in police-involved shootings, and convictions are even more uncommon. Experts say on-duty officers kill about 1 000 suspects a year in the United States, but only 74 have been charged since 2005. A third of these were convicted, a third were not and the other cases are pending. People tend to give police the benefit of the doubt, said Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. "Juries are very reluctant to convict an officer because they all recognise that policing is difficult and violent," he said. Broccoletti argued that Rankin had to shoot, because "everything he tried to do didn't work". And some witnesses backed Rankin's testimony. Paul Akey, a construction worker who was nearby, said Chapman "went after the officer with throwing fists, and it looked like he knocked a Taser out of the officer's hands." ‘Shoot me’ Rankin testified that he calmly approached Chapman to discuss the shoplifting accusation and was preparing to handcuff him when the teen refused to comply with his orders and a struggle ensued. He said he used his stun gun on him, but Chapman knocked it away. Both men then faced each other from a short distance. That's when he drew his pistol, Rankin said, and repeatedly commanded Chapman to "get on the ground". Instead, he said Chapman screamed "shoot me" several times before charging at him from about 2m away. He said he experienced "tunnel vision" at that point, and fearing for his life, fired twice to stop him. "I had no reason to think he was going to stop attacking me," Rankin said. "I was scared." But Gregory Provo, the Wal-Mart security guard who reported Chapman to police, testified that Chapman never charged at the officer. He said Chapman raised both hands, boxing-style, and said "Are you going to f---ing shoot me?" before Rankin fired at him from about 5m away. Rankin had been cleared of wrongdoing in his first on-duty killing. He said he fired 11 times at that burglary suspect because the white man charged at him while reaching into his waistband with his hands. The killing of Chapman "would not have gotten this kind of attention five years ago," Stinson said. Now of course, use-of-force complaints are getting more scrutiny, and increasingly become national news. Earlier on Thursday in Baltimore, a 15-year veteran officer was convicted of assault for shooting an unarmed burglary suspect in 2014, and his police commissioner was taking steps to fire him. Prosecutors said Officer Wesley Cagle approached that suspect as he lay wounded on the floor and shot him in the groin. The suspect survived.

Twtter CONCORD, N.C. - Three Charlotte men were arrested after police said they shot numerous people with a BB gun Tuesday in Concord. Officers were called to three separate incidents Tuesday where people reported being shot with BB pellets. One person was shot in the a parking lot at Concord Mills Mall, three others were shot in the parking lot of the Walmart on Thunder Road and another was shot in the parking lot of the Harris Teeter on Poplar Tent Road.

When police went to the house they found two people they said were involved and arrested them. An airsoft rifle was also found and seized. A third person turned himself in to police a short time later. Christopher Mangum II, 18, Jacob Lytton, 19, and Matthew Mallon, 19, were charged with five counts of misdemeanor simple assault.

Published Aug. 5 at 5:40 pm NP Shopping buys goods from various U.S. shops like Amazon, eBay, Walmart by itself, charging an additional 7 percent of the cost, and delivers them to Ukraine. Photo by AFP Popular on social media Bloomberg: Ukrainian protest prompts Central Bank to warn of instability 5 The Guardian: UN says 2016 will be the hottest year on record 5 Wall Street Journal: Poroshenko asks Trump to counter ‘Russian aggression’ 4 Private postal delivery and logistics company Nova Poshta has launched a forwarding service to make it easier for Ukrainians to shop in U.S.-based online stores. Called NP Shopping, the service helps users purchase goods from U.S. internet-based retailers by bypassing the requirement that сustomers have a U.S. postal address. A mail-forwarding service works by providing an intermediary U.S. address for customers. Purchased goods are mailed to the intermediary address on the customer’s behalf, and then shipped on to their final destination. As a result, users from outside the United States are able to buy goods online from e-shops that only ship to U.S. postal addresses. Nova Poshta’s NP Shopping offers just like that. Well, almost. A screenshot taken from the website of NP Shopping, the forwarding service of Nova Poshta, which the company launched on Aug. 3. The site is only in Ukrainian, as the company’s main target audience for the service is older Ukrainians who rarely buy online. It buys goods from various U.S. shops like Amazon, eBay, Walmart by itself, charging an additional 7 percent of the cost, and delivers them to Ukraine. While ordering and paying for a delivery, users have to copy the URL address of the product and paste it into a box on Nova Poshta’s website. There isn’t even a requirement to sign in. As soon as the company receives the customer’s shipment at its U.S. warehouse, it forwards it either to one of its Ukrainian outlets, or to the customer’s own home address by courier. Deliveries are supposed to take five working days or less. Parcels are limited in size to 122 centimeters in length, 102 centimeters in width, and 110 centimeters in height If the parcel is lost, Nova Poshta promises to refund all costs. In order to get, say, a gadget from Amazon that costs $100 and weighs 1 kilogram, customers will pay Nova Poshta $113 in total. However, if a product costs more than $165, customs clearance will cost an additional 35 percent of the excess sum. So, for example, an order for an item priced $1,000 and weighing 1 kilogram will cost $1,367. Payment can be by card or in cash at one of the Ukrainian company’s outlets, paid when customers pick up their delivery. The only catch is that the customer doesn’t just have to part with money – the company collects a range of personal data obtained from its users when they make a purchase in order to tune its marketing strategy to its users’ preferences. Nova Poshta cofounder Vyacheslav Klimov told the Kyiv Post the service was specifically designed for older Ukrainians who rarely make purchases online and who don’t speak much English. “About 80-90 percent of citizens from developed European countries and the United States – including those from the 50-plus segment and teenagers – buy everything on the internet: clothes, shoes, gadgets, books, household products, and so on,” Klimov told the Kyiv Post on Aug. 4. “In Ukraine, this is maybe just 10 percent.” Irina Kholod, the CEO of Ukrainian E-Commerce Expert, an e-commerce consulting firm, says NP Shopping may well be in demand. “Even though local shops have quite a wide range of goods, a large amount of various types of goods are still unavailable to Ukrainians,” Kholod told the Kyiv Post on Aug. 5. “Ukraine is still not included in the export area of many vendors, or their products are present here (in Ukraine) in limited quantities. And prices for many things are cheaper in the U.S. and Europe because of lower profit margins.” “This kind of shopping may be especially interesting during clearance sales, when discounts can reach up to 90 percent,” Kholod said.

George was standing in a Walmart parking lot at 6 this morning, all ready to talk about Oklahoma’s tax free weekend, when English noticed the couple arguing behind him. “Are they yelling at each other, Tom?” English asked George. Both George and co-anchor Leslie Draffin seemed like they wanted nothing to do with the domestic disturbance unfolding behind them, but English would not be deterred. Eventually George proved adept at conflict resolution by side-stepping the three-way conflict developing between English, Draffin and the couple by giving a short update on the fight and then resuming the newscast, pretty much telling everyone to go back to their homes since nothing more was to be seen in the WalMart parking lot at 6 a.m. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

(AP) — Prosecutors in Virginia won a rare conviction of a white former police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen suspected of shoplifting. Stephen Rankin (Image source: Portsmouth Police Department) But the guilty verdict Thursday was for voluntary manslaughter, a lesser charge than the original first-degree murder count. And the jury recommended a 2 ½ year prison sentence for Stephen Rankin, a punishment far below the decade prosecutors had sought. The outcome is typical of the rare conviction that follows a shooting by police, said Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Juries are very reluctant to convict on-duty officers of murder “because they all recognize that policing is difficult and violent,” Stinson said. In a similar case in Baltimore on Thursday, a jury convicted a police officer of assault for shooting an unarmed burglary suspect. He was originally charged with attempted murder. Stinson says too little data exists to predict any kind of trend. But the black community in Portsmouth, Virginia, hoped the murder trial of Rankin, 36, would be a turning point toward more accountability. “The sentence was not enough,” said Earl Lewis Jr., a cousin of the 18-year-old who died, William Chapman II. “This basically says to police officers that it’s still all right to kill.” William Chapman (Image source: WAVY-TV) Rankin’s formal sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 12. A judge cannot increase the jury’s recommended sentence, but he could reduce it. Rankin’s attorneys said they plan to appeal. Among their concerns was their inability to use what they said was Chapman’s violent juvenile history during the trial. Rankin shot Chapman in the face and chest outside a Wal-Mart store last year after a security guard had called police to go after the young man. No video recorded the actual killing, and testimony on the details of what happened was conflicting. But most witnesses said Chapman had his hands up, and prosecutor Stephanie Morales said the officer could have used force that was not deadly. The officer “brought a gun into what is at worst a fist fight,” Morales told the jury, which deliberated for nearly two days before returning its verdict. Rankin, who was fired from the Portsmouth police force after being indicted, had already killed another unarmed suspect four years earlier. But he had been cleared of wrongdoing and the incident was inadmissible at trial. Rankin’s lawyers said Chapman’s death had nothing to do with any other police shootings. “I think this is a terrible tragedy; I wish it had never happened. I wish none of it had ever occurred,” Rankin testified after being found guilty. “I can’t begin to fathom how much pain that family is going through. I wish I could have done more to keep him alive,” he added. During his trial, Rankin testified that he calmly approached Chapman to discuss the shoplifting accusation and was preparing to handcuff him when the teen refused to comply with orders and a struggle ensued. He said he used his stun gun on him, but Chapman knocked it away. Both men then faced each other from a short distance away. That’s when he drew his pistol, Rankin said, and repeatedly commanded Chapman to “get on the ground.” Instead, he said Chapman screamed “shoot me” several times before charging at him from about 6 feet away. He said he experienced “tunnel vision” at that point and, fearing for his life, fired twice to stop him. “I had no reason to think he was going to stop attacking me,” Rankin said. “I was scared.” Rankin’s attorney, James Broccoletti, argued that the officer had to shoot because “everything he tried to do didn’t work.” Some witnesses backed Rankin’s testimony. Paul Akey, a construction worker who was nearby, said Chapman “went after the officer with throwing fists, and it looked like he knocked a Taser out of the officer’s hands.” But Gregory Provo, the Wal-Mart security guard who reported Chapman to police, testified that Chapman never charged at the officer. He said Chapman raised both fists like a boxer and asked if the officer was going to shoot him before Rankin fired at him from about 5 yards away. Criminal justice professor Stinson said on-duty officers kill about 1,000 suspects a year in the United States, but only 74 have been charged since 2005. A third of these were convicted, a third were not and the other cases are pending. The killing of Chapman “would not have gotten this kind of attention five years ago,” Stinson said, but now use-of-force complaints are coming under more scrutiny. — Share Tweet Rate this story Recommended from the Web 139 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

"I can't begin to fathom how much pain that family is going through. I wish I could have done more to keep him alive," he added. During his trial, Rankin testified that he calmly approached Chapman to discuss the shoplifting accusation and was preparing to handcuff him when the teen refused to comply with orders and a struggle ensued. He said he used his stun gun on him, but Chapman knocked it away. Both men then faced each other from a short distance away. That's when he drew his pistol, Rankin said, and repeatedly commanded Chapman to "get on the ground." Instead, he said Chapman screamed "shoot me" several times before charging at him from about 6 feet away. He said he experienced "tunnel vision" at that point and, fearing for his life, fired twice to stop him. "I had no reason to think he was going to stop attacking me," Rankin said. "I was scared." Rankin's attorney, James Broccoletti, argued that the officer had to shoot because "everything he tried to do didn't work." Some witnesses backed Rankin's testimony. Paul Akey, a construction worker who was nearby, said Chapman "went after the officer with throwing fists, and it looked like he knocked a Taser out of the officer's hands." But Gregory Provo, the Wal-Mart security guard who reported Chapman to police, testified that Chapman never charged at the officer. He said Chapman raised both fists like a boxer and asked if the officer was going to shoot him before Rankin fired at him from about 5 yards away. Criminal justice professor Stinson said on-duty officers kill about 1,000 suspects a year in the United States, but only 74 have been charged since 2005. A third of these were convicted, a third were not and the other cases are pending. The killing of Chapman "would not have gotten this kind of attention five years ago," Stinson said, but now use-of-force complaints are coming under more scrutiny.

William Chapman shooting: Virginia officer found guilty of manslaughter Read more An attorney for William Chapman’s mother, Sallie, said he was readying a civil lawsuit that will argue the city of Portsmouth, Virginia, and its former police chief Ed Hargis should never have allowed Rankin to work as a police officer. “It will be filed within a couple of weeks,” said the attorney, Jon Babineau. In an article that first confirmed Rankin as the officer who killed Chapman, the Guardian disclosed in June last year that alarms were raised within the Portsmouth police department about Rankin’s conduct even before his first deadly shooting of an unarmed man, in 2011. Sallie Chapman said she was not satisfied with Rankin’s conviction for voluntary manslaughter and the jury’s recommended sentence of two and a half years in prison. “It’s not enough,” she said. Rankin will be formally sentenced by Judge Johnny Morrison on 12 October. Rankin’s lawyers said he would appeal against his conviction. “The jury should have heard the whole story,” said James Broccoletti, his lead attorney, who complained that he was prevented from citing Chapman’s juvenile criminal record at the trial. Rankin, 36, killed Chapman outside a Walmart superstore in the city on 22 April 2015, during a confrontation over a suspected shoplifting. He shot Chapman in the face and the chest. Rankin claimed he fired when Chapman aggressively charged at him. Testifying in his own defense at Portsmouth circuit court, Rankin appeared to undermine his own case to have acted reasonably, by unexpectedly and repeatedly saying that he had experienced “tunnel vision” when he killed Chapman. The Guardian published a series of articles about Chapman’s fatal shooting to coincide with the launch of The Counted, an investigation to document every death caused by police in the US. Earl Lewis, a cousin of Chapman who has acted as a family spokesman since the shooting, credited the articles with setting in motion the prosecution of Rankin. “It instantly changed things,” said Lewis. “Nobody was listening to what we had to say but your article gave Sallie a voice. If it wasn’t for the Guardian, we wouldn’t be here.” Rankin avoided prosecution for fatally shooting Kirill Denyakin, a hotel cook from Kazakhstan. Rankin shot Denyakin 11 times outside an apartment building in Portsmouth after a 911 caller reported the 26-year-old was banging loudly on the front door. The officer said Denyakin charged at him, the same explanation he gave for opening fire on Chapman. A close friend of Denyakin said that in light of Rankin’s conviction on Thursday, he intended to make a citizen’s complaint seeking criminal charges against him for the 2011 killing as well. “We will take another swing at this,” said the friend, Maurice Wilson. Denyakin’s mother, Yelena, watched the entire trial over the past fortnight alongside Sallie Chapman after traveling to Portsmouth from Kazakhstan. “I’m really pleased he was convicted but the sentence is not enough,” she said outside court. “But why didn’t my son get justice when he was shot 11 times?” A grand jury declined to indict Rankin for Denyakin’s death, and a $22m civil case that was brought against the officer by Denyakin’s family ended in failure. Rankin was banned from street patrols and restricted to administrative duties for two and a half years following his shooting of Denyakin, after the Kazakh government complained to the US state department. Rankin used a pseudonym to taunt Denyakin’s family in comments he posted to the website of the Virginian-Pilot, the local newspaper, writing: “22 mil wont buy your boy back.” He also noted that most Americans couldn’t hope to earn such sums in an entire career, “let alone a habitual drunk working as a hotel cook”. Prosecutors were barred from telling jurors in the trial over Chapman’s death that Rankin had killed before. The only reference to Denyakin’s death permitted was a video clip recorded by the camera on Rankin’s Taser moments after he shot Chapman. “This is my second one,” he could be heard telling a witness. But details of the Denyakin shooting will feature in the Chapman family’s civil lawsuit against Portsmouth, according to their attorney. Also likely to appear are doom-laden mobile messages that Rankin exchanged with colleagues in the hours before he shot Chapman. “The city sucks, but so does the rest of the world,” Rankin wrote from the computer console in his patrol car about 90 minutes before he killed Chapman. “People are just bad. I think the story was that god would have spared sodam and gomora [sic] if they could have found just 10 decent men, and he wound up smiteing [sic] both cities.” Morrison, the judge, did not allow the mobile messages into the criminal trial. His ruling meant that after commonwealth’s attorney Stephanie Morales promised in her opening statement to inform jurors about Rankin’s “state of mind” prior to the shooting, her prosecution team was practically unable to do so. Securing the first-degree murder conviction they were seeking would have required proving that Rankin acted with premeditation. Facebook Twitter Pinterest William Chapman: ‘I sat here and waited for my baby to come home. But he never came home’ Rankin was terminated from his job at the Portsmouth police department after being indicted for Chapman’s murder. Following the shooting he married his long-term girlfriend, Dawn Burrows, meaning that she cannot be compelled to testify about him in court. Burrows was one of the first medics on the scene at both of Rankin’s fatal shootings. Other information from Rankin’s past may also come back to haunt him as he faces further legal action. Prosecutors said in court this week that Cori Johnson, Rankin’s first wife, was ready to testify that he “fantasized about line-of-duty shootings” in 2008 and 2009. The judge declined to allow Johnson’s testimony into the trial. Rankin and his wife bought a house in nearby North Carolina after he killed Chapman, and he is understood to have made inquiries about police jobs in the area. But under the terms of his bail he is unable to leave Virginia. An avid firearms enthusiast, he will also be barred from possessing a gun if his felony conviction stands. When he was interviewed under oath by attorneys for Denyakin’s family for the civil lawsuit, Rankin said he had killed a dog “six months to a year” before shooting Denyakin. Testifying that he had been responding to a “vicious animal” call-out, Rankin said he shot the animal seven times.

Cop Guilty in Shooting of Unarmed Black Teen Stephen Rankin plans to appeal manslaughter conviction By Arden Dier,  Newser Staff Posted Aug 5, 2016 7:47 AM CDT 79 comments Comments Stephen Rankin appears in court on Aug. 4, 2016.   (The Virginian-Pilot via AP, Pool) View 1 more image (Newser) – A former Portsmouth, Va., police officer was found guilty of manslaughter Thursday after shooting an unarmed black teen last year—the second fatal shooting of his career. Though Stephen Rankin was charged with first-degree murder, a jury convicted him of the lesser charge and recommended he spend two and a half years in prison, reports the Guardian. He faced up to 10. Prosecutors said Rankin, 36, intentionally killed 18-year-old shoplifting suspect William Chapman in a Walmart parking lot on April 22, 2015, after Chapman resisted arrest. However, Rankin—a US Navy veteran with training in mixed martial arts—said he shot Chapman twice in self-defense as Chapman "came towards me aggressively" after a Taser was knocked from Rankin's hand as the two scuffled. "I felt I needed to save my life," he said, adding he immediately gave Chapman CPR. The Guardian reports Rankin also shot and killed an unarmed man from Kazakhstan in 2011, though Judge Johnny Morrison ruled jurors couldn't hear about that since a grand jury declined to indict Rankin. In that case, Rankin said 26-year-old Kirill Denyakin, shot 11 times, reached into his waistband and charged at him. Prosecutors also couldn't share with the jury text messages Rankin sent before Chapman's death; one read "people are just bad," another referenced Sodom and Gomorrah. It's not clear whether Chapman actually stole something from Walmart. Rankin is due to be sentenced Oct. 12, though his lawyers plan to appeal. The Virginian-Pilot reports he's the 13th US officer to have a jury convict him of murder or manslaughter since 2005.   View 1 more image My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   2% Hilarious 5% Intriguing 6% Depressing 57% Brilliant 7% Scary 22% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 79 comments Next on Newser: Husband's Frantic Effort to Save Wife From Train Fails Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 79 comments MSinVA Aug 9, 2016 9:50 AM CDT 2.5 years recommended.

TECHNOLOGY Why It's Surprising Marc Lore Is in Talks to Sell Jet.com In building his Amazon competitor, Lore was focused on huge ambitions, a strong employee culture, and building a long-lasting company. By Christine Lagorio-Chafkin Christine Lagorio-Chafkin is a writer, editor, and reporter whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Village Voice, and The Believer, among other publications. She is a senior writer at Inc. @Lagorio Senior writer, Inc.@Lagorio WRITE A COMMENT Marc Lore, CEO of e-commerce site jet.com, and his team smile at the photographer during the meeting in the conference room at jet.com headquarters in Montclair, New Jersey. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The word today that Walmart is in talks with Jet.com to buy the Amazon competitor rocked the online retail world. Because just a few months ago, Jet's founder, Marc Lore, was talking about building a long-lasting company that would, over time, wildly exceed its whopping prelaunch valuation of $600 million. The Wall Street Journal reported the talks of an acquisition Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. A source told the Journal the potential deal, which may or may not go through, would value Jet.com at $3 billion. Looking back just a few months, it all seemed pretty unlikely. Lore seemed hell-bent on building something truly huge in e-commerce, which had just taken some major blows. Remember that both hyper-promising online retail upstarts Gilt Groupe and One King's Lane sold for small fractions of their prior valuations within the past two years. Back in March, he told me: "I don't even think about Amazon on a day-to-day basis," he said. "I basically see an opportunity to create a really large business over time in an online ecommerce market that's $3 billion today but growing to a trillion dollars over the next 10 years." Lore also talked a big game about building a company he--and his employees at its headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey--loved. He told me back before the company even launched to the public that he'd chosen three core values for Jet staffers to hold dear: work transparently, play fairly, and trust explicitly.  Most unique perhaps is transparency. "We are completely transparent with our compensation system, so everyone knows what everyone on their level makes," he explained. "After the board meeting, we will give the entire board presentation to the whole company. We are transparent about financing, valuation, and number of shares outstanding. And we believe that's super empowering." It's hard to see how that attention to culture would square with selling to a giant multinational corporation. Seems that might just clash slightly with the potential suitor's prior PR nightmares over worker health care and political scuffles over minimum wage regulations.  Still, Lore is no stranger to selling massive online retailers to even larger retailers. Before founding 1800Diapers--which would become Diapers.com--and selling that to Amazon for $545 million, he'd created a sport-card collecting site called ThePit.com, and sold that to Topps. Perhaps he just can't help himself. Or perhaps the $3 billion valuation that source floated was just too enticing to pass up.   Published on: Aug 3, 2016 Advertisement

Jurors at Portsmouth circuit court on Thursday found Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter for killing William Chapman in April last year. It was Rankin's second fatal shooting of an unarmed man, reports the Guardian. Rankin had been charged with first-degree murder and using a firearm to commit a felony. The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for 13 hours after hearing four days of detailed testimony from witnesses to the shooting, a series of experts and Rankin himself. Rankin, 36, was terminated from his job at the police department after being indicted for murder. Prosecutors argued that Rankin intentionally killed Chapman with premeditation after the latter resisted arrest and defied his orders. The officer tried to stop Chapman in the parking lot of a Walmart superstore on the morning of 22 April 2015 to investigate a suspected theft from the store. Rankin and his attorneys had however insisted that the officer opened fire only as a last resort after Chapman fought with him aggressively and then charged towards him. Rankin had earlier shot Kirill Denyakin, an unarmed hotel cook, four years before his confrontation with Chapman. Rankin said Denyakin, 26, reached into his waistband and charged at the officer during a confrontation outside an apartment building where Denyakin was banging loudly on a door. Denyakin was shot 11 times. A grand jury declined to bring charges. The jury recommended a sentence of two and a half years in prison, as Chapman faced up to 10 years. Judge Johnny Morrison will formally sentence Rankin at a later hearing. The rare trial of a white officer for shooting a young black man played comes amid an ongoing nationwide controversy over the use of deadly force by the US police against African Americans.

Rhode, a skeet shooter going for a medal in her sixth straight Games, said: “I shoot 500 to 10,000 rounds a day – having to do a background check every time I purchase ammo or when I bring ammo out for a competition or a match, those are very, very challenging for me.” Here, Jonathan Watts warns that the sporting showpiece threatens to become emblem of Brazil’s chaos. Rio 2016: top American shooter attacks gun laws Florida mobilizes against Zika The Wynwood neighborhood has become the epicenter of the fight against Zika, as federal and state health officials said at least 15 people have been infected with the virus by local mosquitoes. The area, dense with fashion label stores and contemporary art museums, is undergoing aerial spraying. “Zika is unprecedented,” a CDC spokesman said. “We’ve never before had a mosquito-borne disease that can cause birth defects.” Florida mobilizes to control mosquitos causing Zika outbreak Priced out of ’Frisco “This is the place where a 25-year-old made national news in March for paying $400 a month to live in a wooden box in a friend’s living room,” writes Maria La Ganga of San Francisco. “Where a 99-year-old widow went to court in April to fight eviction from the flat she’d lived in since the 1940s. Where the cheapest home for sale in late July was fire-gutted, uninhabitable and still cost $228,000.” A battle is raging over whether tech wealth, population growth or political will is to blame. Ordinary people can’t afford a home in San Francisco. How did it come to this? Victim of London stabbing was ‘vibrant personality’ Darlene Horton, 64, was hours from flying home to Tallahassee, Florida, when she was attacked in a square in central London. Devastated friends paid tribute to the retired special education teacher, calling her an “inspiration”. Police have said a 19-year-old Norwegian of Somali heritage was arrested on suspicion of murder after the attack that also left two women and three men injured, one seriously. London stabbing: American victim was an inspiration, friends say Hackers for Hillary Attendance at a Black Hat hackers conference in Las Vegas went “through the roof” when the first Hackers for Hillary gathering was convened on Wednesday. Organizers said that when Donald Trump called on Vladimir Putin to help find Hillary Clinton’s “missing” emails late last month, he angered the wrong group of people. “Maybe 12 people had RSVP’d until then,” said Jake Braun, chief executive of Cambridge Global Advisors. “It went through the roof after that. It really helps when you have Donald Trump giving Russia a pass on hacking our democracy.” Hackers for Hillary: event attendance ‘through the roof’ after Trump remarks Frank Ocean anticipated It’s four years since Frank Ocean’s last album, Channel Orange, and 13 months since he promised the follow-up, Boys Don’t Cry, would be released. On Friday, Apple is releasing perhaps the most anticipated album of 2016. In those past four years, beyond a handful of guest vocal appearances, an a capella track on Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo, a two-minute sketch of a song called Memrise and an appearance in a Calvin Klein ad, very little has been seen or heard of the artist. Decoding Frank Ocean: secret messages, boomboxes and Boys Don’t Cry Heard, Depp and a divided Hollywood The former couple’s divorce and restraining order proceedings have scandalized Hollywood, splitting celebrities and fans, writes Nicky Woolf. “Reports from Depp’s previous girlfriends, people that know him, that ‘he’s a great guy’, ‘he didn’t abuse me’, ‘he’s a great father’; these things are pretty typical,” notes Joanna Pepin, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. “The other thing was the victim-blaming in the articles against Heard – that she’s a gold-digger, somehow responsible for the violence.” Lawyers are set to appear in court on Tuesday. Johnny Depp v Amber Heard: abuse accusations split Hollywood and public In case you missed it … In an essay for Glamour, Barack Obama wrote about how gender stereotypes harm us all.

A jury convicted Rankin of voluntary manslaughter on Thursday in the shooting death of an unarmed black man who had been accused of shoplifting. (The Virginian-Pilot via AP, Pool) PORTSMOUTH, Va.—Prosecutors in Virginia won a rare conviction of a white former police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen suspected of shoplifting. But the guilty verdict Thursday was for voluntary manslaughter, a lesser charge than the original first-degree murder count. And the jury recommended a 2 ½ year prison sentence for Stephen Rankin, a punishment far below the decade prosecutors had sought. The outcome is typical of the rare conviction that follows a shooting by police, said Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Juries are very reluctant to convict on-duty officers of murder “because they all recognize that policing is difficult and violent,” Stinson said. In a similar case in Baltimore on Thursday, a jury convicted a police officer of assault for shooting an unarmed burglary suspect. He was originally charged with attempted murder. Stinson says too little data exists to predict any kind of trend. But the black community in Portsmouth, Virginia, hoped the murder trial of Rankin, 36, would be a turning point toward more accountability. In this image made from a video, Portsmouth Commonwealth’s Attorney Stephanie Morales asks the jury to give former police officer Stephen Rankin the maximum sentence Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016, in Portsmouth, Va. (The Virginian-Pilot via AP, Pool) “The sentence was not enough,” said Earl Lewis Jr., a cousin of the 18-year-old who died, William Chapman II. “This basically says to police officers that it’s still all right kill.” Rankin’s formal sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 12. A judge cannot increase the jury’s recommended sentence, but he could reduce it. Rankin’s attorneys said they plan to appeal. Among their concerns was their inability to use what they said was Chapman’s violent juvenile history during the trial. Rankin shot Chapman in the face and chest outside a Wal-Mart store last year after a security guard had called police to go after the young man. No video recorded the actual killing, and testimony conflicted on the details of what happened. But most witnesses said Chapman had his hands up, and prosecutor Stephanie Morales said the officer could have used force that was not deadly. The officer “brought a gun into what is at worst a fist fight,” Morales told the jury, which deliberated for nearly two days before returning its verdict. Rankin, who was fired from the Portsmouth police force after being indicted, had already killed another unarmed suspect four years earlier. But he had been cleared of wrongdoing and the incident was inadmissible at trial. Read More Years of Surveillance Leads to Terror Charge Against Officer Rankin’s lawyers said Chapman’s death had nothing to do with any other police shootings. “I think this is a terrible tragedy; I wish it had never happened. I wish none of it had ever occurred,” Rankin testified after being found guilty. “I can’t begin to fathom how much pain that family is going through. I wish I could have done more to keep him alive,” he added. During his trial, Rankin testified that he calmly approached Chapman to discuss the shoplifting accusation and was preparing to handcuff him when the teen refused to comply with orders and a struggle ensued. He said he used his stun gun on him, but Chapman knocked it away. Both men then faced each other from a short distance away. That’s when he drew his pistol, Rankin said, and repeatedly commanded Chapman to “get on the ground.” Instead, he said Chapman screamed “shoot me” several times before charging at him from about 6 feet away. He said he experienced “tunnel vision” at that point and, fearing for his life, fired twice to stop him. “I had no reason to think he was going to stop attacking me,” Rankin said. “I was scared.” Rankin’s attorney, James Broccoletti, argued that the officer had to shoot because “everything he tried to do didn’t work.” Some witnesses backed Rankin’s testimony. Paul Akey, a construction worker who was nearby, said Chapman “went after the officer with throwing fists, and it looked like he knocked a Taser out of the officer’s hands.” But Gregory Provo, the Wal-Mart security guard who reported Chapman to police, testified that Chapman never charged at the officer. He said Chapman raised both fists like a boxer and asked if the officer was going to shoot him before Rankin fired at him from about 5 yards away. Criminal justice professor Stinson said on-duty officers kill about 1,000 suspects a year in the United States, but only 74 have been charged since 2005. A third of these were convicted, a third were not and the other cases are pending. The killing of Chapman “would not have gotten this kind of attention five years ago,” Stinson said, but now use-of-force complaints are coming under more scrutiny.

Think giants like Sports Authority, Kodak, BHS, Blockbuster, to name but a few familiar brands that have made the news for all the wrong reasons. In spite of all their phenomenal resources these firms failed to adapt their strategy in time to avoid financial disaster. Here are my six key insights that can help your business remain relevant. 1. Innovate or evaporate Change is hard which is why we delay it until we are absolutely forced to. One of Jobs's business rules was to never be afraid of cannibalizing yourself, "If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will." Just think about how Nokia has done in the past few years. They did not focus on the shifts that were taking place in industry, instead relying on their historical position and size as market safeguards. On the other hand, Yellow Pages started working on delivering online options to their users for easy accessibility – making the shift from paper to digital. 2. Set your parameters It’s vital that you have a clear understanding of not just the market segment you serve but the solution that you offer to that market segment. Companies like Sears lost sight of their main focus enabling retailers like Walmart to take the lead. Consider how Kodak did this and veered off track in the 1970s and 80s – unwilling and unable to embrace the post-film world. Customers supported Kodak not because they liked buying film, but because Kodak had a product that helped them preserve memories. 3. Questioning everything We’ve all had that overwhelming sense of euphoria after achieving a near impossible goal. You feel invincible and energised. As a leader, it’s important to not allow success to numb your senses into believing that ongoing success shields you from failure. Blockbuster was at its peak in 2004 only to see it reach the end of its reel a decade later. Advertisement IBM however saw the warning signs in the early 1990s and performed one of the most dramatic turnarounds in recent corporate history. 4. Keep it lean Gardeners understand that in order to restore a garden, you must prune away dead branches in order to help make room for the new. This is just how a business works. Virgin has enjoyed success in numerous industries but had to accept that Virgin Cars would not be part of that success track record. Sony have also recognised the importance of this in turning around their flagging fortunes. The end of their decade-long marriage with Ericsson and the spinning off of entire business units was an attempt to restore the tech giants agility and innovative flair. 5. Remove outdated processes and systems Systems are a phenomenal way to gain collective momentum and ensure that every person knows their contribution to the greater effort. Systems can however wreak havoc if they are not updated or removed in order to reflect the requirements of the business environment. Hershey incorporated a new operating system and with this transition of utilising a demand based business strategy they increased their cash revenue significantly. Harley Davidson similarly re-engineered their internal systems in 2009 owing to a severe sales slump. 6. The customer is king It is important that you focus on the desires, requirements, and the needs of the customers as they are always changing. Jeff Bezos at Amazon has a unique way of tackling this point. He leaves one chair empty at every meeting and this chair is used to represent the customers that shop at Amazon. Decisions are then made with consideration of how the person in the empty chair will feel or how it will impact that individual when they bring about a certain change in their product. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Follow Connect (Johan Hanekom knows me) Colleague Weve done business together Weve worked together Met in person Interacted with online Classmate Friend Family Follow only Create new group Johan Hanekom's articles About Johan HanekomJohan Hanekom is the Managing Director of Hanbro - a boutique consultancy helping international companies setup and develop their UK market presence.

Why should someone opt to use Android Pay when they can choose Samsung Pay, or PayPal, or even Walmart Pay if they tend to do the majority of their shopping at Walmart? This is where incentives come into play to try and entice users to choose a particular platform. In the past we’ve seen Samsung offer up all kinds of promotions to get users to use its service, like getting a free pair of headphones, but now it looks like Samsung will be more direct and will be giving users $5 for every friend they refer and recruit to Samsung Pay. For every friend they get to sign up, users will be have $5 added to their Rewards balance. However the catch is that you’ll only get the $5 when your friend makes their first purchase, meaning that you can’t keep creating accounts and referring yourself in hopes of maybe saving up enough for one of Samsung’s beautiful 4K TVs.  The good news is that the rewards aren’t one-sided. This means that when your friend makes a purchase, they too will be rewarded $5 as well, so essentially this is a win-win situation. This promotion will be valid until 31st of December, 2016.

By Fred Ramos Valley Morning Star County Elections Administrator Robert Mendoza claims county officials are refusing to update his departments deteriorating working conditions. Part of the Elections Administrators warehouse and office space has been relocated without his consent, Mendoza said, to the Constantino Zarate Warehouse two blocks from the county courthouse in Brownsville. He said that the conditions are unsafe and security at the building is lacking. Our voter registration files are directly exposed to major leaks and the humidity will be harmful to ballots and tabulation equipment, said Mendoza. With an environment that is not safe for humans, no alarm system in place, the department is at an even greater disadvantage than ever before. To make matters worse, Mendoza said he was not notified that commissioners court had given the maintenance department approval to proceed with its plans to take over part of the Elections Administrators space and reduce his departments room. Mendoza said there also are other concerns. Dust entering our expensive optical scanning equipment, climate control, nose pollution, and inadequate parking, he said. Mendoza said there were no immediate, definite plans to improve conditions in an area that prior to the Elections Administrators arrival was used for storing old records. Somehow, the departments needs have not been given the proper attention with due process, he said. Mendoza said he was concerned that poorly maintained ballot equipment could affect elections in May. He is absolutely responsible for the May elections. He cant place any excuses on anything with respect to his office space or his manpower, said Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa. As far as Im concerned, hes required to do his job with the people hes got. If he doesnt, hell be held responsible. Hinojosa said carpenters are constructing new facilities for the Cameron County Sheriffs Office and a new county judges courtroom. Plans are for work to begin in late April on the new Elections Administrators quarters. I dont know what his problem is. We dont have any other space available, said Hinojosa. Hes on the waiting list for repairs. As soon as we have our staff ready, hes next in line. Hinojosa said that Mendoza was notified some of his staff and equipment would be moved to the warehouse. He was notified. What hes telling you is not true, said Hinojosa. He just didnt agree with the decision of the commissioners court. So, hes whining that he didnt get what he wanted, but he was notified. Discuss Print Posted in Local News on Saturday, March 24, 2001 12:00 am.

The outcome is typical of the rare conviction that follows a shooting by police, said Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Juries are very reluctant to convict on-duty officers of murder "because they all recognize that policing is difficult and violent," Stinson said. In a similar case in Baltimore on Thursday, a jury convicted a police officer of assault for shooting an unarmed burglary suspect. He was originally charged with attempted murder. Stinson says too little data exists to predict any kind of trend. But the black community in Portsmouth, Virginia, hoped the murder trial of Rankin, 36, would be a turning point toward more accountability. "The sentence was not enough," said Earl Lewis Jr., a cousin of the 18-year-old who died, William Chapman II. "This basically says to police officers that it's still all right kill." Rankin's formal sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 12. A judge cannot increase the jury's recommended sentence, but he could reduce it. Rankin's attorneys said they plan to appeal. Among their concerns was their inability to use what they said was Chapman's violent juvenile history during the trial. Rankin shot Chapman in the face and chest outside a Wal-Mart store last year after a security guard had called police to go after the young man. No video recorded the actual killing, and testimony conflicted on the details of what happened. But most witnesses said Chapman had his hands up, and prosecutor Stephanie Morales said the officer could have used force that was not deadly. The officer "brought a gun into what is at worst a fist fight," Morales told the jury, which deliberated for nearly two days before returning its verdict. Rankin, who was fired from the Portsmouth police force after being indicted, had already killed another unarmed suspect four years earlier. But he had been cleared of wrongdoing and the incident was inadmissible at trial. Rankin's lawyers said Chapman's death had nothing to do with any other police shootings. "I think this is a terrible tragedy; I wish it had never happened. I wish none of it had ever occurred," Rankin testified after being found guilty. "I can't begin to fathom how much pain that family is going through. I wish I could have done more to keep him alive," he added. During his trial, Rankin testified that he calmly approached Chapman to discuss the shoplifting accusation and was preparing to handcuff him when the teen refused to comply with orders and a struggle ensued. He said he used his stun gun on him, but Chapman knocked it away. Both men then faced each other from a short distance away. That's when he drew his pistol, Rankin said, and repeatedly commanded Chapman to "get on the ground." Instead, he said Chapman screamed "shoot me" several times before charging at him from about 6 feet away. He said he experienced "tunnel vision" at that point and, fearing for his life, fired twice to stop him. "I had no reason to think he was going to stop attacking me," Rankin said. "I was scared." Rankin's attorney, James Broccoletti, argued that the officer had to shoot because "everything he tried to do didn't work." Some witnesses backed Rankin's testimony. Paul Akey, a construction worker who was nearby, said Chapman "went after the officer with throwing fists, and it looked like he knocked a Taser out of the officer's hands." But Gregory Provo, the Wal-Mart security guard who reported Chapman to police, testified that Chapman never charged at the officer. He said Chapman raised both fists like a boxer and asked if the officer was going to shoot him before Rankin fired at him from about 5 yards away. Criminal justice professor Stinson said on-duty officers kill about 1,000 suspects a year in the United States, but only 74 have been charged since 2005. A third of these were convicted, a third were not and the other cases are pending. The killing of Chapman "would not have gotten this kind of attention five years ago," Stinson said, but now use-of-force complaints are coming under more scrutiny. ←Older Newer→ Updated : 2016-11-24 03:17 GMT+08:00 MOST POPULAR Strasbourg's Christmas market at Taipei 101 20 Thanksgiving dining options in Taipei Thailand waives visa fee for Taiwan, 18 nations Taipei high school opens first gender-neutral restrooms in Taiwan Canadian man savagely beats Taiwanese girlfriend on Taipei street Meet Hualien's Famous British Barber Google Map of Taiwan's Demolished and Burned Cultural Assets Taiwanese woman opts for 'Stateless' over being branded 'Chinese' on Iceland ID Torrential rain warnings issued for northern Taiwan Current foreign workers program outdated and unreasonable: KMT lawmaker About Us Contact Us Taiwan News © 2016 All Rights Reserved.

Aug 5th 2016, 8:18 AM 16,705 Views 84 Comments Share8 Tweet Email Image: AP A JURY IN Virginia has recommended two-and-a-half years in prison for a white former police officer convicted of voluntary manslaughter yesterday in the shooting death of an unarmed black man who had been accused of shoplifting. The ex-officer, Stephen Rankin, shot 18-year-old William Chapman in the face and chest outside a Wal-Mart store last year after a security guard called police to go after the young man. No video recorded the actual killing, and testimony conflicted on the details of what happened. But most witnesses said Chapman had his hands up, and prosecutor Stephanie Morales said the officer could have used non-deadly force. The officer “brought a gun into what is at worst a fist fight,” Morales told the jury, which deliberated for nearly two days before returning its verdict. Rankin, 36, faced one to 10 years on the manslaughter conviction. Morales asked jurors to give him the maximum, while defence attorney James Broccoletti argued that no amount of jail time would bring Chapman back to life. A judge will formally sentence Rankin on 12 October The judge doesn’t have to follow the jury’s recommendation, but can’t increase the penalty. Accountability Rankin, who was fired from the Portsmouth police force after being indicted, had already killed another unarmed suspect, four years earlier, and many in the mostly black city of 100,000 saw his trial as a chance for accountability as police shootings continue around the country. But his lawyers said this case had nothing to do with deadly uses of force against other black men. “I think this is a terrible tragedy I wish it had never happened. I wish none of it had ever occurred,” Rankin testified after being found guilty. “I can’t begin to fathom how much pain that family is going through. I wish I could have done more to keep him alive,” he added. Chapman’s second cousin, Earl Lewis, also took the stand, speaking through tears about the family’s struggle to find money to bury him. Sallie Chapman stands n the courtroom after the verdict. The jurors — eight black and four white — did not convict on the first-degree murder charge prosecutors sought. Criminal charges are rare in police-involved shootings, and convictions are even more uncommon. ‘Throwing fists’ Broccoletti argued that Rankin had to shoot, because “everything he tried to do didn’t work.” And some witnesses backed Rankin’s testimony. Paul Akey, a construction worker who was nearby, said Chapman “went after the officer with throwing fists, and it looked like he knocked a Taser out of the officer’s hands.” Rankin testified that he calmly approached Chapman to discuss the shoplifting accusation and was preparing to handcuff him when the teen refused to comply with his orders and a struggle ensued. He said he used his stun gun on him, but Chapman knocked it away. Both men then faced each other from a short distance. That’s when he drew his pistol, Rankin said, and repeatedly commanded Chapman to “get on the ground.” Instead, he said Chapman screamed “shoot me” several times before charging at him from about six feet away. He said he experienced “tunnel vision” at that point, and fearing for his life, fired twice to stop him. “I had no reason to think he was going to stop attacking me,” Rankin said. “I was scared.” But Gregory Provo, the Wal-Mart security guard who reported Chapman to police, testified that Chapman never charged at the officer. He said Chapman raised both hands, boxing-style, and said “Are you going to f—ing shoot me?” before Rankin fired at him from about five yards away.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT In late 2014, fledgling entrepreneur Josh Tetrick persuaded investors to plow $90 million into his vegan food startup Hampton Creek Inc. Tetrick had impressed leading Silicon Valley venture capital firms by getting his eggless Just Mayo product into Walmart, Kroger, Safeway and other top U.S. supermarkets within about three years of starting his company. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.74 +0.62 +0.88% Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▲ 31.35 +0.29 +0.93% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 151.91 -0.76 -0.50% Yahoo! Inc YHOO ▼ 40.79 -0.22 -0.54% What Tetrick and his team neglected to mention is that the startup undertook a large-scale operation to buy back its own mayo, which made the product appear more popular than it really was. At least eight months before the funding round closed, Hampton Creek executives quietly launched a campaign to purchase mass quantities of Just Mayo from stores, according to five former workers and more than 250 receipts, expense reports, cash advances and e-mails reviewed by Bloomberg. In addition to buying up hundreds of jars of the product across the U.S., contractors were told to call store managers pretending they were customers and ask about Just Mayo. Strong demand for a product typically prompts retailers to order more and stock it in additional stores. Expense reports reviewed by Bloomberg show contractors bought back jars of Just Mayo from Safeway stores. Former workers say Hampton Creek also purchased its own products at Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Target, and Whole Foods locations across the country. While a November 2014 e-mail from the corporate partnerships team said the company would stop store buyouts, three former contractors who worked for the company in 2015 say the practice continued, and directions were given verbally. “We need you in Safeway buying Just Mayo and our new flavored mayos,” Caroline Love, Hampton Creek’s then director of corporate partnership, wrote in an April 2014 e-mail to contract workers known as Creekers. “And we’re going to pay you for this exciting new project! Below is the list of stores that have been assigned to you.” Love’s memo also referenced a key competitor: “The most important next step with Safeway is huge sales out of the gate. This will ensure we stay on the shelf to put an end to Hellmann’s factory-farmed egg mayo, and spread the word to customers that Just Mayo is their new preferred brand. :)” Tetrick, Hampton Creek’s chief executive officer, says the primary purpose of the purchases was to check the quality of the mayonnaise. “Because of this, we now understand the impact of trucking and shipping our product and enabled the system we have today that mitigates the risk of extreme temperatures,” Tetrick wrote in an e-mail. “Assessing the product from the customer perspective, more than anything, gets us out of the bubble of typical manufacturing. This was and always will be the primary purpose of it, which is why we’ll continue doing it.” Melanie Myers, an executive who worked in the company’s corporate partnerships team, says in a statement that the program was primarily for quality-control purposes but “we also thought it might give us a little momentum out of the gate.” Tetrick says the program has cost about $77,000, representing less than 0.12 percent of the company’s sales. Tetrick provided Bloomberg with 15 e-mails to contractors referencing quality-control assignments. He also presented a database showing surveys Creekers were asked to fill out after going to stores, checking jars for misaligned labels, breakage, or issues involving ingredient separation, which he says occurred when early versions of the jars were exposed to extreme temperatures in transit. The workers were sometimes instructed to purchase substandard merchandise and send it to headquarters, he says. However, the survey database—containing almost 3,900 entries in 15 states from March 2014 to January 2015—didn’t account for hundreds of Just Mayo purchases by Creekers during that period, according to e-mails, receipts and expense report records seen by Bloomberg. Five former Hampton Creek contractors and two ex-senior staff members say the buyback assignments were separate from quality checks at stores. The ex-contractors say in most cases they were told to simply buy up jars at nearby stores and were free to consume or discard them—not look for quality issues, as the company says. “It is highly questionable for a company to purchase its own goods,” says David Larcker, a professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Revenue is an important number for evaluating growing companies, but the companies need to be transparent about the source of that revenue. They also need to be transparent about their growth. If the sales are not generated from legitimate customers, that needs to be disclosed and is important information for investors to evaluate.”© Michael Short, The Chronicle     Hampton Creek’s approach to quality control is also unusual. Companies typically ensure the quality of products before they leave the factory, says Kurt Jetta, who runs a retail and consumer data company called Tabs Analytics. If they do find issues in stores, food makers usually don’t buy the products. Instead, they give the retailer a credit. “There’s no legitimate explanation for a manufacturer buying significant quantities of their own product from the shelf,” Jetta says. Founded in 2011, Hampton Creek marketed itself as a food technology company that ferrets out new plant proteins and uses them to reformulate everyday grocery items like mayonnaise and cookie dough. Tetrick, now 36, went around Silicon Valley vowing to disrupt the food industry and won over such leading VC firms as Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures. Today Hampton Creek says its backers include several billionaires, such as Hong Kong’s Li Ka-shing and Yahoo’s Jerry Yang. Despite criticism from other investors who say the company is less an innovator than a deftly run marketing machine, Hampton Creek has raised $120 million and turned Just Mayo into a cherished brand among sustainably minded consumers. Thousands of new packaged food items are introduced each year in the U.S., and a majority of them fail. For a young company, it’s critical to perform in a test market, with those results used by retailers to justify increasing distribution, says Jim Hertel, a grocery industry analyst at Inmar’s Willard Bishop. Sales from a major retailer can also be used as part of the pitch to investors. “If you’re an early-stage company, there’s a lot of pressure to demonstrate results,” Hertel said. In-store marketing is a crucial way for a young company to build a brand and boost sales. Hampton Creek held Just Mayo tastings and other demonstrations in supermarkets around the U.S. Wearing the required uniform of a black hat and t-shirt with the startup’s three-leaf logo, the Creekers were supposed to persuade shoppers to try the product and then hopefully buy a jar. In 2014, the job changed, according to five former Creekers who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. Now they were being asked not simply to promote Just Mayo but to start buying it as well—an initiative the company dubbed “Special Project” or “Buyouts,” they say. Love, who has since been promoted to Hampton Creek’s vice president of mission, suggested how Creekers could do this most effectively in an April 2014 e-mail to a contractor. “I might go through the self-checkout lanes, or make several transactions going to different cashiers each time to avoid questions like, ‘Why are you buying so much mayo?!’” Love wrote. “Make sure you are not wearing your HC gear when you go into Safeway. This is an undercover project.” In interviews this week at Hampton Creek’s San Francisco headquarters, executives emphasized that quality control was the main goal of the buyback program. “These folks did an awesome job for us, primarily in helping us improve our quality,” Love says in a statement provided by Hampton Creek. “They were our eyes and ears on the ground. I’m proud of what we did and how we continue to do it.” One former contractor assigned to buy Hampton Creek products provided receipts showing purchases of more than 140 jars of Just Mayo in a day. Another contractor described buying at least 20 jars per store and says Hampton Creek gave workers directions to visit over a dozen stores in less than a week. Ex-Creekers say they were told to do whatever they wanted with the product after finishing the job. Some donated the supply to food shelters or handed them out to friends and family, but most say they threw it in the trash. E-mails from Love show the buybacks took place in the Mid-Atlantic, Southwest and Pacific regions. The five former Creekers say they happened all over the country. Hampton Creek also paid contractors to pretend they were customers and call store managers of Whole Foods, Safeway, and Kroger locations to stoke demand, according to e-mails reviewed by Bloomberg. “You will be calling Whole Foods Market locations as a customer to create buzz and increase demand for Just Mayo flavors and Just Cookie Dough in these stores, putting pressure on the Regional Buyer,” says a March 2015 correspondence signed by Melanie Myers of Hampton Creek’s corporate partnerships team. E-mails from Myers list some 100 store locations for each contractor to call in places such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Texas. The e-mails also directed contractors to conceal their identities and fib if questioned on the calls. “Remember, you are calling as a customer,” says an e-mail addressed to a contractor and signed by Myers, whose title now is Ingredient Sourcer. “The conversation should go something like this: Hi, I’m doing some catering and I’m looking to pick up this new mayonnaise. I think it’s called Just Mayo ...” In another script, contractors were told to say, "Hi! I’m hoping you can help me out. I’m planning a Back to School event and I’m looking to pick up this new mayonnaise. I think it’s called Just Mayo ...” Two ex-contractors for Hampton Creek, who sued their former employer in February 2016 seeking unpaid wages, reference an assignment to “buy out shelves” of the company’s products in a lawsuit filed in a federal district court in New York. The suit also says Hampton Creek failed to provide them with detailed documentation of their compensation and work-related expenses for tax-reporting purposes as required by state law. In an e-mail, Tetrick says that team of contractors helped improve quality control and “gave us a push when we landed in our first conventional account, which is why all of us will always be proud of their work. A handful of folks don’t represent the views of everyone.” In at least some cases, Hampton Creek lumped in expenses related to buying its own products with wages paid to contractors, according to five former workers. All five said money they were given to buy jars of Just Mayo were treated as taxable income, making them liable for a higher tax bill than their actual earnings would require. One former contractor provided H&R Block tax records showing this to be the case. Another Creeker asked the company in an e-mail to separate the expenses from taxable income. But the request was ignored, the contractor said. Hampton creek declined to comment about the alleged practice. “Treating reimbursement of business expenses creates a compliance burden to the contracted employee,” says Joseph Carcello, a University of Tennessee professor who sits on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s investor advisory committee. “There’s no way this reimbursement approach is in the best interest of the contractor, and there are limitations to what the contractor can deduct.” Two former senior staff who worked closely with Tetrick in 2014 and 2015 say the Hampton Creek CEO initiated the buyouts partly to make sales look better to potential investors. One says Tetrick didn’t disclose the practice to would-be backers during fundraising pitches in 2014. Fundraising pitch decks reviewed by Bloomberg do not reference the buyouts. “We always comply with our disclosure obligations to prospective investors,” Tetrick says in an e-mail. Earlier this year, Hampton Creek was looking to raise additional funds to help pay for an ambitious vision that imagined as many as 560 new plant-based products, which could include vegan “oysters,” “blue cheese” and an egg-substitute product it calls “Just Patty,” according to an investor presentation reviewed by Bloomberg. The company is still trying to close the round and is seeking investors in Asia, according to two people familiar with the matter. --With assistance from Craig Giammona To contact the reporter on this story: Olivia Zaleski in San Francisco at ozaleski@bloomberg.net.

Portsmouth officer Stephen Rankin, who was fired as he awaited trial, shot 18-year-old William Chapman in the face and chest outside a Wal-Mart store last year after a security guard accused the teen of shoplifting. No video recorded the killing and testimony conflicted on the details. The jury did not convict on the first-degree murder charge prosecutors sought. Criminal charges are rare in police-involved shootings and convictions are even more uncommon. Experts say on-duty officers kill about 1,000 suspects a year in the UniStates but only 74 have been charged since 2005. Of those, a third were convicted, a third were not and the other cases are pending. Prosecutors said the officer could have used non-deadly force, noting that every witness but Rankin testified Chapman had his hands up. The defence said Rankin had to shoot after a stun gun failed to stop the teenager. The jurors - eight black and four white - began deliberating on Tuesday in the mostly black city of 100,000. Many in Portsmouth saw the trial as a chance for accountability amid continuing reports about police-involved shootings. Rankin, who was fired after his murder indictment, had already killed another unarmed suspect four years earlier. His lawyers said this case had nothing to do with deadly uses of force against other black men. Persuading a jury to convict in these cases is always difficult because people tend to give police the benefit of the doubt, said Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. "Juries are very reluctant to convict an officer because they all recognise that policing is difficult and violent," he said. Rankin said he calmly approached Chapman to discuss the shoplifting accusation and was preparing to handcuff him when the teen refused to comply with his orders and a struggle ensued. He said he used his stun gun on him but Chapman knocked it away and both men then faced each other from a short distance. Rankin said he then drew his pistol and repeatedly commanded Chapman to "get on the ground". Instead, he said Chapman screamed "shoot me" several times before charging at him from about 6ft away. He said he experienced "tunnel vision" at that point, and fearing for his life, fired twice to stop him. "I had no reason to think he was going to stop attacking me," said Rankin, 36. "I was scared." Some witnesses backed Rankin's recollection. Paul Akey, a construction worker who was nearby, said Chapman "went after the officer with throwing fists and it looked like he knocked a Taser out of the officer's hands". Gregory Provo, the Wal-Mart security guard who reported the shoplifting allegation, testified Chapman never charged at the officer. He said Chapman raised both hands, boxing-style, and said "Are you going to shoot me?" before Rankin fired from about five yards away. Prosecutor Stephanie Morales argued Rankin chose to shoot when he could have used non-lethal force. "He brought a gun into what is at worst a fist fight," she told the jury. Defence lawyer James Broccoletti said shooting was his only choice after "everything he tried to do didn't work". Prosecutors failed to persuade the judge to allow Rankin's ex-wife to testify that he had fantasised about shooting people on the job. In his first on-duty killing, he was cleared of wrongdoing after firing 11 times at a white burglary suspect. He said that man charged at him while reaching into his waistband with his hands. The judge also refused to allow testimony about Chapman's own criminal record. send us stuff PreviousNext Want us to email you the top news stories each lunchtime?

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Oprah, Soros, Buffet on long list of tycoons backing Clinton Thu Aug 4, 2016 6:13PM Home US Politics US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (AFP photo) US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is enjoying financial support from a growing list of American billionaires who oppose Republican nominee Donald Trump. According to a recent report by Fox News, the former secretary of state’s presidential campaign has so far received more than $42.5 million in donations from a total of 24 billionaires. So far, movie producers Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, financiers Warren Buffett and George Soros, and Walmart heiress Alice Walton have all made contributions to the former first lady’s campaign. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey (pictured below) has also thrown her weight behind Clinton. Haim Saban is another media magnate that will support Clinton in the battle against Trump. Billionaire environmentalist Thomas Steyer joined the list and endorsed Clinton in early June. Some of the multimillionaires have donated millions to a top Clinton superPAC named Priorities USA Action. Saban ($10 million), Soros ($7 million), hedge fund billionaire James Simons ($7 million), Hyatt Hotel heir J.B. Pritzker and his wife Mary Kathryn Pritzker ($6.5 million), Slim-Fast founder S. Daniel Abraham ($3 million), Hedge fund billionaire David Shaw ($2.25 million), investors Jon and Pat Stryker ($1.5 million each), Spielberg ($1 million), Legendary Entertainment founder and CEO Thomas Tull ($1 million), and the list goes on. Jewish movie producer and director Steven Spielberg Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg are some of the other major figures who are siding with Clinton. In addition to the pro-Clinton billionaires, some of the Republican-leaning tycoons have announced that that they will not support Trump as the party nominee.   George Soros (L) and Hillary Clinton Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, for instance, has joined industrial power-brokers Charles and David Koch in withdrawing support from fellow GOP billionaire Trump. Whitman has pushed the envelope even further by stating that she will endorse and help fund Clinton. In addition to Priorities USA Action, million have been paid to other Clinton funds Hillary for America and Hillary Victory Fun. Pro-Clinton such as PACs American Bridge 21st Century, Priorities USA Action 2016 and Correct the Record have also received huge donations. Loading ...
