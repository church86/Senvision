Target Best Sales For HDTVs, PS4, And Xbox One Bundles Shopping 2 0 0 November 15, 2016 Black Friday 2016 Deals: Walmart Vs. Target Best Sales For HDTVs, PS4, And Xbox One Bundles Matt Couden With new Black Friday 2016 ads being released by the day, there’s still no question that the Walmart and Target sales deals are the most scrutinized. These two stores will see hundreds of thousands of shoppers come through the doors for the Black Friday shopping extravaganza, while many millions more will be shopping the deals online. Knowing that, it seems best to take a look at the two retailers to see the “best of the best” when it comes to their deals in 2016. Both Walmart and Target tend to go for the “wow factor” in terms of their front page sales deals on their advertisements and this Black Friday season is no different. Large hi-definition televisions, video game systems, and other electronics are normally featured as special “doorbuster” deals that customers can only snatch up if they are lucky. It usually means getting into the store super early, or being able to be online when the particular items are still in stock and available for order at the reduced prices. For this year’s sales, both stores are offering a great deal on a large HDTV. However, it really will depend on a customer’s preference. As Brad’s Deals notes, one of Target’s top deals is the Hisense 50-inch Smart 4K UHDTV for just $249.99. It’s considered one of the lowest prices seen on a television of this type and size. However, keep in mind that there are other details to consider once the item box is seen. These include looking at how many HDMI ports the TV has, as well as the lack of other key features that some discerning customers may want to skip. Walmart and Target will offer some enticing HDTV deals this season. [Image by Allison Joyce/Getty Images] Walmart is right there with Target and attempting to do them one better. Among Walmart’s top 10 deals is a Phillips 55-inch 4K UHD Smart TV at a price of $298.00. That’s five inches larger and about $50 more than Target’s deal, and it’s considered a more known household brand. It also indicates it has 3 HDMI ports, which is something that the Target deal specifics lack right now. Remember, getting to the store early for the doorbuster is the best way to snag this deal. There are a handful of other television deals from both Walmart and Target’s Black Friday deals this year. There’s a Vizio 60-inch 1080p HDTV for $398 at Walmart. For a smaller screen, Target has an Element 43-inch 4K UHDTV for $199.99, while Walmart has a 40-inch Element or Hisense 1080p HDTV for just $125. There’s also a 32-inch Polaroid LED HDTV for a low $85 at Target, making for a great small TV gift for a college student. Right up there with HDTV sales, each Black Friday shopping season are also Black Friday video game system deals. The Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4 continue to be highly sought after by gamers who have yet to acquire these top-of-the-line systems. Target will offer a $249.99 Xbox One S bundle deal which includes the 500-gigabyte system along with Battlefield 1 or Minecraft and a $40 store gift card. Walmart will offer the same price on a PlayStation 4 Uncharted bundle which will include a $30 store gift card. With these deals, it will come down to which gaming system the gift recipient really wants, as there are fanboys out there for Microsoft and Sony’s products. Some gaming enthusiasts tend to love the look of graphics or the available titles on one system over the other. For Black Friday 2016, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 deals will be available. [Image by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images] When it comes down to it, both stores have some amazing prices featured in their Black Friday 2016 deals. However, it’s important to do early research into the items that are being offered. If at all possible, try to get the exact model and SKU numbers for the items being advertised and look deeper into the features that these items include. In addition to that, make sure to plan out the best way to get to the store early, even if it means camping out in line. Otherwise, the best way to go may be to take a chance online that the item will be available for order. Holiday shoppers, which Black Friday 2016 deals are you most interested in? Do you feel Walmart and Target have any deals that are “must haves” or is it better to wait for Cyber Monday sales?

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Google Wifi: price, release date and features Google Wifi: price, release date and features By Lewis Leong Home networking   Blanket your home with Wi-Fi Shares Update: The Google Wifi router is officially up for preorder in the US! You can reserve your router through Amazon, Best Buy, the Google Store and Walmart. Note you can either purchase a single router for $129, or a 3-pack for $299. Look for the Google Wifi to release on December 6.  Google has yet another router, but this time it's more affordable. Meet Google Wifi, which starts at just $129, significantly lower than Google's other, pricier line of OnHub routers. You'll be able to pre-order Google Wifi in November from the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart and the devices will ship in December. UK and AU pricing have not been announced yet. So why did Google decide to release another router product when it already has OnHub? Whereas OnHub served as a single point of access to your home's wireless network, Google Wifi forms a mesh network using multiple routers to cover your entire home. Since you'll need multiple Google Wifi devices to take advantage of its mesh capabilities, Google will sell a 3-pack of Google Wifi discs for $299. "We launched the OnHub router last year to solve many of the everyday problems people encounter with home Wi-Fi," Google wrote in a blog post following Wifi's announcement. "With Google Wifi, we're building on that technology to create a system that provides seamless coverage for homes of any shape or size. OnHub and Google Wifi will work together, and we'll continue to add new features to all of our Wi-Fi devices via automatic updates." Strength in numbers If you already have an OnHub router, you can strengthen and extend the range of your network by adding on Google Wifi routers. The result is that you can move freely through your home and always have a solid connection, even when video chatting. Control your Google Wifi via an app on your phone One of Google Wifi's biggest selling points is its ease of use. Like the OnHub routers, Google Wifi intelligently analyzes your network quality and strength to offer you the best connection. For example, Google Wifi will constantly monitor network congestion and move devices to other channels for the fastest performance. Best of all, you can control Google Wifi via an app, making managing your home network a breeze. You won't need to navigate to a specialized site just to change a few settings like with traditional routers. Google Wifi supports Wireless AC1200 2x2, which means the router can maintain fast speeds by utilizing multiple channels simultaneously. Each router features 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports so you can have a wired connection for a faster, more reliable connection if needed. So far, Google Wifi looks like a great option for those who want consistent download speeds without the hassle of routine router management. However, we'll give you the full scoop when we get our hands on the router later this month. Looking for more ways to stay connected?

But if disaster strikes in the tunnel to the East End Bridge, rescue crews say they won't be ready. More >>    SALEM, Ind. (WDRB) -- Salem, Ind., has little more than 6,000 residents. Many neighbors say they drive several miles away for everyday items, especially late at night. They might drive 20 miles to Scottsburg or Paoli, or maybe even 40 miles to Louisville. "Being a parent, [I'm] getting ready [for] flu season. If we needed Pedialyte, there was nowhere to go but about 20 or 25 minutes away to get your Pedialyte," said Scott Durham, assistant store manager for Wal-Mart. That will change on Wednesday when the area's first big box retailer, Wal-Mart, opens. "It's probably the biggest thing to happen to Salem, maybe ever," said Michael King, Wal-Mart store manager. The store is bringing more than just toys, clothes and groceries to town. Wal-Mart is bringing hundreds of jobs. "300 plus," King said. Applications poured in like a flood. King says he could have filled the positions twice with the number of people who applied. "This community has been amazing. I've been at Wal-Mart for almost 20 years, and I've never had this type of reception," King said. Durham was born and raised in Salem. He was hired with a group of others who previously worked at a local thrift store. They say the pay at Wal-Mart is much higher than they're used to and it’s helping them better provide for their families. "They had as much as a 40 percent rate increase from what they were previously getting paid. So this whole experience has been phenomenal," Durham said. Durham says Walmart also brings him an opportunity for career advancement that he's never had.

Of course, you could have just gone to the shelves and checked the research articles themselves but, by for a slow human being, this would have been just too time consuming. These large volumes contained nothing by “metadata”: lists of article titles, authors, keywords… They were tremendously valuable to the researchers. One of the earliest applications of computers was to help manage document collections. In this sense, the Web and Google are very naturally applications for computers. In the early days, computers could not have access to the books themselves but human experts (librarians) could enter the precious metadata in the computers to make them useful. This was at a time when many computer scientists were worried that computers would be starved for data. Indeed, there are only so many highly paid experts who will sit quietly at a computer entering valuable data. Back then was an era when people dreamed of intelligent computers. So they imagined a world where human experts would enter data and rules in computer systems, and that these rules would allow these computers to match or even outmatch human intelligence. History proved these early artificial-intelligence researchers wrong. This “classical” approach toward machine intelligence did not bear fruit. It is not, as you might imagine, that these dreamers lacked support. They got billions of dollars in funding from just about every government agency you can think of, including the military. More recently, this classical artificial-intelligence approach has lead to the semantic web (1998) and its idea of “linked data”. The thesis of this approach is to supplement the existing web with a thick layer of “RDF” that describes the resources and enables advanced machine reasoning. There are a few problems that make classical artificial intelligence a bad approach: Collecting, curating and interpreting a large volume of predicates in an open world is a fundamentally intractable problem. If you must track the list of authors, the publication date and the topic of a set of books, and you have enough highly trained librarians, it will work. But the system fails to scale up. If you have enough time and money, you can build things up, to a point. Walmart, the world’s largest private employer, has an extensive supply chain that needs to track precise and accurate metadata about a vast range of products. It works. And it made Walmart very rich and powerful. But we should not underestimate the difficulty. When the American retailer Target tried to enter the Canadian market, they ended up with empty shelves. These empty shelves lead to poor business and to a massive failure that will be a subject of study for years to come. Why were the shelves empty? Because Target tried to build a new inventory management system and failed. What does an inventory management system do? Essentially, it is a metadata system. To build it up quickly, they had their employees work at collecting and entering the data, days after days… And then they face reality: when the metadata was there at all, it was often badly wrong. This made it difficult if not impossible to keep the shelves filled up. Walmart has a worldwide distribution and supply-chain system, with well-oiled computing systems. But getting it to work is not a secondary or trivial activity. It is Walmart’s core business. It takes enormous effort for everyone involved to keep it going. We know because it is hard for other people to reproduce it, even when they have tremendous resources. Even the simplest things can become headaches. Creative Commons allows you to specify a license for you work. A population choice is to allow “noncommercial” use. But does that mean? Reasonable people can disagree. Is a class given at a public college a “commercial” or “noncommercial” activity? Dublin core aims at specifying simple things like the author and title of a piece of work, but when you examine the generated metadata, there is widespread disagreement about what the various attributes mean. In the early days of the web, Yahoo! was the standard search engine. It worked through a taxonomy of websites. You looked for a taxidermist in your town by drilling down to the right category. But despite billions in revenues, Yahoo! could not keep this system going. It collapsed under its own weight. This should not be underestimated. Most metadata is unreliable. Maintaining high-quality data is simply hard work. And even when people have good intentions, it takes more mental acuity than you might think. For example, in the Target Canada case, product dimensions were sometimes entered in inches, sometimes in centimeters. You might dismiss such errors as the result of hiring poorly trained employees… but the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter crashed because highly paid engineers got confused and used English units instead of metric units. One of the problems with metadata in the real world is that you are in an adversarial setting. So assuming that the people entering the metadata are motivated and highly trained, you still have to worry that they are going to lie to you. That’s what happened with Yahoo!, and what happens with a lot of metadata. Suppose that I am a book editor and I am asked to classify the book… and I know that customers will browse the content according to my classification… my incentive is strong to fit my product in the most popular categories. To make matters worse, metadata systems are not objectively neutral entities on their own. They were designed by people with biases. There is no such thing as an objective oracle in the real world. If you have ever had to reconcile different databases, data stored in different formats, you know how painful it can be. There are simply different and equally valid ways to describe the world. You would think that errors can be objectively assessed… and certainly a box measures about 12 inches or it does not. However, the level and type of determinism in natural languages has evolved and reached a sweet spot. We are neither fully pedantic nor entirely vague in our use of a natural language. There is plenty of room for reasonable people to disagree about the meaning of the words, about how to categorize things. Is Pluto a planet? Well. It is a dwarf planet. Is that like a small planet or not a planet at all? We silently make some assumptions. One of them is that the world can be understood in a top-down fashion… we start from abstract concepts and work our way to concrete cases. Peter Turney argues that though we think that “red” and “ball” are the fundamental logical atoms, the opposite might be true. We first get a “red ball” as the core logical atom, and the most abstract notions, such as “red” or “ball” are derived from the more concrete ones. So far, I have been addressing the case of simple metadata. The kind that can help you determine whether a book was published in June or July of this year. But if you want to build “intelligent” software, you need a lot more than that. You need to represent your knowledge about the world in a formal form. How hard is that? Let us turn to mathematicians. Surely representing mathematics formally is the easiest thing. If you can’t formalize mathematics, what chances do you have in the real world? So for many decades, a collection of super smart mathematicians (under the pseudonym Bourbaki) attempted to give mathematics a formal foundation. It was interesting and challenging, but, ultimately, it just proved too difficult to pursue. But wait! Isn’t Google able to go through your pictures and find all pictures of a cat? Isn’t Google able to take a picture of your house and find out your street address? Yes. But this muscle behind these feats has little to do with the prowesses of metadata. You see, just as classical artificial intelligence folks pursued their dream of cataloging all knowledge and achieving intelligence in this manner… Other people thought that intelligence was more like a probabilistic engine. It is more about statistics than reasoning. We usually refer to this approach as “machine learning” meaning that the knowledge enters the machine through “learning”, and not through the wisdom of human experts. The opposition between the two points of views has been entitled “Neats and scruffies“. The metadata and formal reasoning people are in the “neat” camp, while others are in the scruffies. Google is the child of the scruffies. Google does not hire large sets of experts to catalog knowledge, the overwhelming majority of their effort is invested in machine learning. Of course, given a web page, Google has metadata… but the bulk of this metadata was derived by the machine. Suppose you needed to build a representation of the world… would you recruit thousands of people who would fill out forms? How would you build software that can parse textbooks, Wikipedia, reference manuals…? The latter approach has to deal directly with ambiguity and contradictions, but it is also the only way to scale up to billions of facts. So, at this point, if anyone asks you to invest a lot of time entering metadata in a system… you really ought to be skeptical. That’s not the approach that has taken over the world. It is the approach that has failed again, and again to deliver the promised goods. Let me summarize. Representing knowledge formally is hard. Harder than intuition dictates. It is really expensive. It does not fare well once adversarial interests come in. You usually end up with faulty, barely usable data, either because people did not make the effort, because they gamed the system or because they made honest mistakes. And that’s for simple data such as maintaining an address book of your customers. Intelligent applications need finer representations, and then it gets really hard and expensive to get right. Meanwhile, approaches based on machine learning are getting better and better every year. They can defeat the best human players at most games, they can classify your pictures automatically, they can translate books for you… We have to embrace machine intelligence. The last thing we want our highly paid experts to do is to be filling out forms. Further study: Everything is Miscellaneous by David Weinberger.

Walmart has told workers to not download the app. The app, WorkIt, was released Monday to offer advice to Walmart workers on a host of issues, according to OUR Walmart. OUR Walmart is a labor group, but not a union, as Walmart does not offer collective bargaining rights, which has thousands of paying members and has organized Black Friday protests at Walmart locations nationwide.  The OUR Walmart organization teamed up with software development company Quadrant 2 to develop WorkIt. The app uses IBM's Watson artificial intelligence bot to answer concerns or questions of employee, who are only identified on the app by their username and store position. Watson accesses a database built by Walmart workers to address user questions. When Watson cannot answer one of about 200 queries, "there is a peer network of experts that will interact with the users," Jason Van Anden, founder of Quadrant 2, told the Wall Street Journal. Watson then has the ability to learn how to answer certain questions from the peer experts. WorkIt is disrupting management by organizing labor over a mobile device. This is amazing. https://t.co/neMhYs3kLa— Greg Wester (@gwestr) November 15, 2016 For its part, Walmart has already addressed store managers about the app, warning that OUR Walmart is "increasingly trying to get our associates to turn over personal information to the union by using deceptive and slick looking social media and mobile apps," according to a document reported by the WSJ. "We just wanted to give you a heads up that if someone tries to get you to download an OUR Walmart work-related app on your mobile device, you may unknowingly be giving away valuable personal information like your location and personal contact information that the union can use however it wants," Walmart wrote to store managers, according to Bloomberg.

Bloomberg…https://t.co/elHoIEd2Ei— Jason Van Anden (@vananden) November 14, 2016 "There is no way to know if the details this group is pushing are correct," Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a statement. "Our people are smart and see this for what it is; an attempt by an outside group to collect as much personal and private information as possible." The app does not track location or ask users to submit their location, according to Cat Huang, a technologist who worked on the app.  "We’re not going to sell the data, ever," OUR Walmart co-director Andrea Dehlendorf told Bloomberg. "We will share it with researchers and use it to inform conversations with Walmart. But it’s not part of the revenue model." The app's utility emerged in the days when Walmart employees had limited time to access information on the company's extensive human resources policy guide held on the Walmart intranet known as Wire. (The company says it has offered more access to its policies since early 2016, Bloomberg reported.) In addition, queries to OUR Walmart's Facebook page became to much for the group to handle. Read more 10 biggest corporations make more money than most of world combined OUR Walmart directors raised money from various groups, like the Workers Lab, and hired a technologist, Huang, and a developer, Van Anden, to help create the app. The app will also assist OUR Walmart by gathering data on specific issues that impact employees, allowing the group to address the company with hard proof of the employee experience. "It will give us real evidence to talk to the company about what’s broken," Dehlendorf told Bloomberg. "We have to be in a place where we can say, 'This is the truth. We have massive data.'" The app does not access Walmart's policy guide directly, but offers "interpretations of the policies," Huang told Bloomberg. OUR Walmart said it expects about 14,000 employees, or around 1 percent of Walmart workers, to download the app by the end of 2017.

Walmart may be the biggest retailer on Earth, according to sales, but Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has mostly cashed out its stock. The move does not come as a complete shock — Buffett cut his stake in early 2016 — but the recent cut was a much, much bigger bit. According to emerging reports, as Walmart was announcing its $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, Buffett was slashing his remaining Walmart stake by 70 percent. These days, Berkshire Hathaway has less than $1 billion left in Walmart — down from around $3 billion at the half-way point in 2016. The news of the Buffett bail comes at a difficult time for Walmart. Thus far, 2016 has been a relatively strong year, but share price took a bit of a hit in Q3 when the Buffett reduction when through. The stock has since seen its price falter and decline — 5 percent in the last three months.  At the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in April, Buffett noted the difficulties that brick and mortar players are having against upstart players like Amazon. Instead of voting in that battle for dominance with his dollars, Buffett has instead decided to fly out of the fight by investing in airlines. Buffett is purchasing up shares in American Airlines, Delta and United-Continental with combined positions worth $1.6 billion. Those shares are starting to pay off some — thus far, the shares have netted Buffett $280 million, or a return of 21 percent return on the new stakes — since the end of September. That’s a nice payout for a man who said — as recently as 2013 — that he didn’t much favor investing in airlines. “Investors have poured their money into airlines and airline manufacturers for 100 years with terrible results,” Buffett said at the time. “It’s been a death trap for investors.”     Related Items:buffett, walmart, Walmart layoffs, What's Hot Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Recommended for you New York’s New Digital Crime Lab Fights Fraud Google Parent Alphabet Advances AI Endeavor OTI, Vend Access Bring Mobile Pay To Australia Get our hottest stories delivered to your inbox.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive ALDI supermarket chain coming to the High Desert Tuesday Nov 15, 2016 at 11:35 AM Nov 15, 2016 at 4:33 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz HESPERIA — In an aggressive move to open nearly four dozen grocery stores in Southern California, ALDI will soon make an appearance in the High Desert. The Germany-based, no-frills discount supermarket chain will be located on Main Street in Hesperia, just across the street from Super Wal-Mart, according to Hesperia spokeswoman Rachel Molina. With big box stores Wal-Mart and Super Target also getting a piece of the grocery industry, ALDI is moving into a competitive neighborhood in west Hesperia. But many believe the store will prosper because of its unique shopping structure and low prices. ALDI, which boasts that shoppers who switch from national brands to its exclusive brands can save up to 50 percent on their grocery bill, sells primarily, if not entirely, its own privately branded products of established U.S. foods. More than 90 percent of the groceries ALDI sells are under its own premium exclusive brands, all of which are free of certified synthetic colors, partially hydrogenated oils and added MSG. The company also regularly tests its exclusive products. ALDI is self-checkout, with no counter service departments. Product is brought in and displayed in boxes straight from the pallet and store staff includes forklift operators, a couple of cashiers and a security guard. Shopping carts can be rented for a deposit of 25 cents, with the deposit returned when the cart is returned. “With ALDI coming to town, it’s going to bring competition to stores like Wal-Mart and Target,” Mayor Pro Tem Paul Russ told the Daily Press. “Competition is good for the consumer — it puts downward pressure on prices, which means a cost savings for shoppers.” Forbes magazine calls ALDI a “growing menace to America's grocery retailers” as it redefines the grocery shopping rules for many. ALDI’s footprint in California went from zero to 25 stores in less than a three-month period in the first quarter of this year. The grocery chain held seven separate grand opening celebrations on May 19, according to a statement from ALDI. The company, which operates approximately 1,500 stores in 33 states, plans to operate approximately 45 stores in California by the end of the year and a total of 2,000 nationwide by the end of 2018. Russ said although the property is already graded and fenced for the new supermarket, a groundbreaking date has not be scheduled. For more information on ADLI, visit www.www.aldi.us.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 15, 2016 12:26pm   Comments Share: Related TGT Choose Your News: Earnings, Fed, Oil, And Retail Sales Highlight Busy Day Can Any Discount Retailer Withstand Wal-Mart? Earnings: Target Forecasts Lowered After Discounter Warned Of Slower Sales (Seeking Alpha) Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) is expected to deliver lower earnings and sales when it reports its third-quarter financial results on November 16. Broad Expectations Wall Street expects Target earnings to drop 3.5 percent year-over-year to $0.83 a share and sales to fall 7.5 percent to $16.3 billion. In the same quarter last year, the company earned $0.86 on revenue of $17.61 billion. In the past two quarters, Target’s earnings have managed to top the Street's view. Over the past 90 days, the consensus earnings estimates have been down by $0.06 to $0.83. CVS And Wal-Mart Threats The Minneapolis-based retail giant will likely feel the pinch from heightening online competition such as that from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). In addition, the company’s struggling food business will also weigh on the results. Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder thinks Target has established a low bar of SSS of 0 to -2 percent apart from a $0.75–$0.95-wide EPS range guidance. The firm thinks the retailer could achieve 0 to -1 percent SSS and maintains its EPS projection of $0.87, pointing out weaker sales trends and enough space to respond to Wal-Mart. Rival Wal-Mart reports on November 17. Another challenge for Target is to generate better traffic with CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS)’ ownership of the pharmacy business. CVS, in its third quarter report, said it is currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market as well as a soft seasonal business. “[V]ery recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter,” CVS President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo, said in a press release. It's Not All Foreboding On the positive side, Target may benefit from a strong back-to-school season, and better sales at its new children’s lines. Voices From The Street Following are the analyst ratings and price targets on Target: Barclays: Underweight, price target of $65. Citigroup: Buy, $80 PT. Cowen & Co.: Market Perform. Goldman Sachs: Neutral, $71 PT. Guggenheim: Neutral. JPMorgan: Neutral, $78 PT. Morgan Stanley: Underweight, $67 PT. At last check, shares of Target were down 0.94 percent at $71.50.

Subject (Source: Greer Police Dept.) Subject (Source: Greer Police Dept.) GREER, SC (FOX Carolina) - The Greer Police Department is seeking assistance in identifying subjects accused in scams at Walmart and a Dollar General store on Wade Hampton Boulevard. Officers reported that on Oct. 18 around 1 p.m., the individuals approached a 87-year-old man who was browsing inside of the Greer Walmart. Officers said the subjects convinced the victim that if he were to provide them with $3,000 for a processing fee, they would split $60,000 with him. Officers said that the victim agreed to the transaction. Authorities said the victim withdrew $3,000 from his account and after obtaining the check and drove with the female subject in order for the check to be cashed. Police said that the cash was provided to the subject but the subject failed to provide the sum of money to the victim. Police have also linked the suspects to two earlier incidents. On Jan. 14, 2016, police said the same male suspect and a yet unidentified approached an 87-year-old woman in the parking lot of the Dollar General at 805 W Wade Hampton Blvd. Police said the duo convinced her that they had found a bag in the parking lot that was filled with money. “The female subject told the victim that she would speak with her manager at Belk, fill out paperwork concerning the money and that they would need a processing fee but would in turn split the findings with her,” Greer police spokesman Lt. Jim Holcombe said. “The victim provided the subjects with $600, which the subjects took and fled.” A similar incident happened in May 2016 when the man and woman approached an 86-year-old woman in the Walmart parking. The duo convinced the woman they had found money found in a wallet and could split it between the three of them paid the victim paid “taxes” on the money found to the business. Holcombe said the victim got $449 out of her purse, which the suspects took and fled “The male subject in this case went by the name Mr. Jenkins and was driving a white Lincoln Navigator,” Holcombe said.

See Also on Kiplinger: 15 Things You Should Never Buy During the Holidays The heart of its game plan? Follow up on the success of last year’s Black Friday romp. That means the emphasis will be on deeper price cuts and an abundance of supply. The latter is a boon for late-sleepers who want doorbuster deals but aren’t willing to get out of bed early enough to score (you know, like at 2 a.m.). Walmart isn’t waiting until Black Friday to roll out some of its deals. Walmart.com’s online Black Friday sale begins at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on Thanksgiving. Brick-and-mortar stores’ Black Friday sales begin at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving Day. A caveat: Since many Walmart stores are open 24 hours a day, the doorbusters will be covered or cordoned off until 6 p.m. local time. (See which other retailers are open on Thanksgiving Day.) Advertisement Like last year, you’ll need to get a store employee to give you a special bracelet for select bargains. The window of opportunity to buy the item has been raised this year to two hours -- it was just one hour in 2015 -- meaning you can browse longer before you snag your goody. Walmart also has app-exclusive Black Friday offers already rolling out. You need to download the free app to see them, but I can tell you there’s a 65-inch Hitachi 4K TV selling for $599 (a $400 savings), an Acer 15.6 Core i5 laptop for $299 (a $150 savings), and an Xbox One S 500GB “Minecraft” bundle, including an extra controller, for $279 (a $20 savings). We reached out to deals experts to get their takes on Walmart as a retail player in this year’s Black Friday shopapalooza. Here are some of the more interesting deals you’ll find. Televisions. Walmart has 11 models in its doorbuster stable. Included in the collection are some red-hot 4K Ultra HDTVs, discounted for the first time this year at Walmart. Walmart’s deals include a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 (shaving $230 off the regular price) and a “special buy” Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298. Advertisement See Also on Kiplinger: 13 Ways to Waste Money During the Holidays Across the retail landscape this Black Friday, says Brent Shelton of FatWallet.com, TV deals will be hot, and Walmart’s are no exception. “Traditionally, TVs are one of the best doorbuster deals to try to nab and this year 4K TV doorbusters will be very promising,” says Shelton. “This will be a good year to grab a TV doorbuster and step up to 4K at a big savings if you haven’t already. Expect to see a few stores offer doorbuster discounts on newer curved 4K OLED models, although folks should expect prices well above $1,000 for this new technology.” Based on personal experience, I’d roll with the 50-inch Samsung for $398. Benjamin Glaser of DealNews.com agrees: “Not only is this deal $100 less than the best price we've seen for this set before, it's $37 below our Black Friday prediction.” Advertisement Other Black Friday TV deals Walmart is posting include a “special buy” 60-inch Vizio HDTV for $398 and two unnamed-brand “special buy” HDTVs, a 50-inch for $225 and a 40-inch for $125. While the prices are dirt cheap, deals experts warn that “special buy” TVs at Walmart and other retailers are usually specially manufactured models with limited features. Gaming Consoles. Videogame consoles will be hot Black Friday items this year, deals experts say. However, Walmart has a dud in one of its Black Friday bundles: The Xbox 360 500GB Forza Horizon 2 Bundle that’s selling for $129. “We've seen this same bundle for $99,” says Glaser. “Plus, Xbox One bundles will be going for around $200, while the latest Xbox One S bundles are being advertised for $249. So, for value, we suggest saving your money and buying a more current console.” If you favor Sony over Microsoft, the PlayStation 4 Slim Uncharted 4 500GB bundle will sell at Walmart for $249 ($50 savings), plus the retailer will throw in a $30 gift card. Advertisement Laptops and Tablets. Walmart has corralled 10 bargains in this category, including a 32GB iPad Mini 2 for $199 (saving $70) and “special buys” including a Samsung Chromebook 3 for $119 and a 15.6-inch HP Touch laptop for $249. Drones. After spending way too much for a high-end drone at a holiday charity event in January, I’m familiar with drones. So is Walmart. It’s selling the DJI Drone Phantom Standard 3 for $369 (a $130 savings) and a Promark 3D Virtual Reality HD Drone for $99 (a $49 savings). If you’re on a budget, the “special buy” Sharper Image Video Drone will run you just $30. Home and Outdoor. Again, these are “special buys,” including $25 sheet sets, $20 comforters and $9.76 kitchen appliances. Also in the lineup are a pair of outdoor grills for $99 each: a Blackstone two-burner propane griddle and an Expert Grill four-burner propane grill. For the kitchen, there’s a 27-piece Pioneer Woman porcelain enamel nonstick cookware set for $89. Toys. Walmart switches on its “Back to the Future” groove with a Razor Hovertrax 2.0 Hoverboard for $273 ($125 off), a Disney Princess Cinderella Royal Dreams dollhouse with furniture for $88 (a $61 savings) and, naturally, Hatchimals, the toy-of-the-moment Walmart is selling for $48.88. See Also on Kiplinger: 9 Tricks to Shopping at Best Buy Fitness Wearables. Meh. Who doesn’t already have one of these sitting in a drawer somewhere? For the seemingly few who don’t, Walmart is selling the Fitbit Charge 2 for $129 (saving $20), the Fitbit Alta for $99 (shaving off $30) and a Fitbit Flex 2 for $69 (down $30).

Walmart Warns Workers: Don’t Download Chat App From Labor Organization Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Warns Workers: Don’t Download Chat App From Labor Organization November 15, 2016 10:20 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave don't talk amongst yourselves walmart OUR Walmart Walmart has been repeatedly accused of retaliating against, and covertly monitoring, employees who have protested for improved conditions and higher wages. Now the nation’s largest retailer is reportedly warning employees to not download an app from a labor group that can be used for workers to connect and organize outside of Walmart’s gaze. OUR Walmart, a group that was formerly backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers union, recently launched an Android app called WorkIt that lets Walmart workers ask questions — anonymously, if they choose — about company policy and employees’ rights. Some of those questions will be answered by humans, but the app has used IBM’s Watson technology to put together replies to hundreds of the most common questions a Walmart worker might have. Registered users can also share stories and chat with each other. In that way, WorkIt is not that different from having a Facebook group, and there are a number of public and private groups like that already in existence. Yet this app, only a few days into its existence, is apparently rubbing Walmart HQ the wrong way. So much so that the Wall Street Journal reports that the retailer is telling employees to not even download it. According to the Journal, Walmart HQ sent a memo to store managers, instructing them to tell workers that the WorkIt app is just a scheme to collect employees’ personal information “by using deceptive and slick looking social media and mobile apps.” Bloomberg quotes a statement from Walmart’s labor relations folks, explaining that “if someone tries to get you to download an OUR Walmart work-related app on your mobile device, you may unknowingly be giving away valuable personal information like your location and personal contact information that the union can use however it wants.” But the app’s developers say that WorkIt doesn’t track users’ locations. On the app’s page in the Android store, it explicitly states, “Your location, contacts, photos, and/or any associated financial information stored on your mobile device is not accessed or used by WorkIt.” “We’re not going to sell the data, ever,” clarifies one of the WorkIt creators to Bloomberg. “We will share it with researchers and use it to inform conversations with Walmart. But it’s not part of the revenue model.” The company also contends that WorkIt may be providing inaccurate information. “Our associates already have anytime-access online to the company’s most current and accurate Paid Time Off and Leave policies and there is no way to know if the details this group is pushing are correct,” says Walmart. The folks behind WorkIt say what they’ve built has applications beyond Walmart, and that they hope to license the app to other labor groups and possibly even to companies that want to give their employees a way to communicate with each other.

What they discovered has undermined trust in a global luxury product and set off a salvo of class-action lawsuits that have created a king-sized public relations challenge for the Indian textiles industry and the U.S. companies it supplies. Turns out that major American retailers, including Target and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc., have been selling premium-priced sheets purportedly made of Egyptian cotton—a byword for luxury in linens—but that may in reality be woven with lower-quality cotton blends. Three suits seeking to be certified as class-actions have been filed against supplier Welspun India Ltd.—and a separate one last week was directed at Wal-Mart. That complaint, filed in New York by customer Dorothy Monahan, accuses the world’s largest retailer of questioning the fiber content of Welspun’s products as early as 2008, but not halting sales until after Target did so in August. Wal-Mart said it will “vigorously defend” itself. The other lawsuits, all filed in the U.S. against Welspun, allege the company fraudulently labeled its bed sheets as Egyptian cotton. Welspun declined to comment on the suits. Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts during a conference call in August that “the error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it.” Target, meanwhile, hasn’t been sued. “The marketing has created this image in our heads that high-quality cotton and Egypt are synonymous," said Louis Rose, a Memphis, Tennessee-based cotton industry consultant. “Consumers should be skeptical of these marketing claims. They’ll be under a lot more scrutiny now.” Target has cut ties and ended all of its $90 million in annual business with the Indian manufacturer, and Wal-Mart Stores has stopped selling Welspun sheets that had been labeled 100 percent Egyptian cotton. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. followed suit on Monday, sending Welspun’s stock 4.5 percent lower in Mumbai the following day. The shares have tumbled about 40 percent since Aug. 19, when Target announced its decision. “The issue was about traceability, not about quality," said Welspun Group Chairman  Balkrishan Goenka at a briefing in Mumbai Tuesday, adding that the company’s sales growth next fiscal year will be "muted" due to the controversy. The fake Egyptian sheet episode came to light after exhaustive work by Target investigators who analyzed sheet fibers under microscopes and tracked their journey through a global supply chain. The probe found that 750,000 of Target’s "Egyptian cotton" sheets, sold for as much as $75 a pop, didn’t contain any Egyptian cotton at all, but an amalgam of lower-quality fibers from cheaper sources. That July discovery touched off a scandal spanning from Minnesota to Mumbai and Cairo that threatens the future of Welspun, part of a $3 billion conglomerate headed by Goenka. It may also hobble Indian textile manufacturers in the race to supply Western consumers with high-quality sheets and towels, creating an opening for competitors from China and elsewhere to grab the business, according to industry analysts. The Welspun-made sheets Target examined were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. While it has interests in steel, energy, and infrastructure, textiles are the bread and butter for Welspun, which says it supplies one in five towels sold in America and posted revenue of about $900 million in the 2016 fiscal year. Tennis stars like Roger Federer mop their brows with Welspun towels at the Wimbledon championships—a fact the company highlights in investor presentations. The sheets fiasco reflects a simple reality: There’s a scarcity of Egyptian cotton. It first became a key export product in the early 19th century, when it arrived in France and became sought after for its silky feel. Production has been falling since the 1990s, however, and last year Egypt’s post-revolutionary military government ended subsidies for cotton farmers to shore up the state budget. A gradual decline in output has since become a precipitous plunge. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates there will be a 53 percent decrease in production this year, to an all-time low of 160,000 bales. The system for certifying Egyptian cotton is administered from Cairo by the Cotton Egypt Association, an industry group that grants stamps of approval to suppliers of 100-percent Egyptian cotton products. To receive one, CEA executive director Khaled Schuman explained, a manufacturer pays an initial fee of $5,000 and submits records of Egyptian cotton purchases and product samples, which undergo DNA analysis to identify whether the fibers were grown in Egypt or elsewhere. The companies are charged an additional $3,000 annually for the certification, according to Schuman. But once a certification is granted, producers are mostly left alone until they need to renew their label a year later. “You can’t put an employee from the association on each production line to inspect” every item being produced, said Mohamed Negm, who conducts testing of certification samples for the association to verify the fibers are Egyptian-grown. Typically, suppliers like Welspun purchase cotton in raw form from Egypt for import to Asia, where it’s turned into finished products for sale in the U.S. and elsewhere, he said. The highest-quality Egyptian material costs twice as much as the standard grade sourced from India, providing a powerful incentive to cheat. “Factories have mixed the Egyptian cotton with other low quality cottons to make profit, which has ruined the reputation of Egyptian cotton,” said Negm, adding that’s what the DNA testing and certification aim to curtail. During the set-up of the CEA’s DNA testing program, Negm said, it started analyzing random samples taken from store shelves globally; 90 percent were fake, mixed with low-quality cottons from the likes of Sudan, Burkina Faso and Pakistan. “It’s very easy to play it loose during the production process if you want,” said Liu Dang Dang, a foreign sales manager at Chinese manufacturer Jihua 3542 Textile Co. U.S. retailers “should have realized how obvious it is,” he said, adding that his company, which supplies Egyptian cotton fabric to manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe, doesn’t engage in the practice. “The price they want to pay for Egyptian cotton sheets is so low when the price of Egyptian cotton is so high.” Widespread blending Blending is widespread in the industry and quietly tolerated by many retail chains, according to two executives at producers other than Welspun who asked not to be identified discussing the procedure. Sometimes that means mixing good-quality non-Egyptian cotton that maintains the same feel amid shortages of the real thing, but it also often includes using cheaper grades to save money, said the executives, citing their experience with cotton processing departments and export requirements for U.S. retailers. The CEA formally announced its DNA testing program in April, saying the “gold seal” it would give manufacturers who passed would help “rid the supply chain of falsely labeled goods.” Awkwardly, the first company to receive a gold seal was Welspun, for bed linens as well as towels and bath rugs. Target has decided not to rely on CEA certifications going forward, according to a person familiar with the retailer’s decisions who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Wal-Mart, by contrast, has said it will continue to rely on the CEA standard. Schuman said the organization is “making good efforts to make the system tougher" to avoid future problems, for example by increasing the role of third-party auditors and monitoring suppliers’ inventories more closely. After discovering problems with Welspun sheets, Target quickly decided to terminate its entire relationship with the company, citing “the trust that our guests place in us." It also opted to offer refunds to customers who’d purchased them -- even if they’d been sleeping on them for years. Wal-Mart has also offered refunds. Although Welspun knew Target was investigating its products, its executives believed that, at worst, the retailer would drop only its Egyptian cotton sheets, according to a person privy to the discussions. Target didn’t warn Welspun beforehand about its Aug. 19 announcement that it was ending all its business ties, the person said, which left the company blindsided. At the time chairman Goenka’s wife Dipali, who leads Welspun’s home textile business, had just returned to India from meetings in the U.S.; she turned around immediately to do damage-control with clients, according to a person familiar with the events. In Mumbai, her husband had called an emergency meeting of department heads. He told them to ignore the company’s plunging share price and to focus on their day jobs, and that Welspun would bounce back over time, the person said. Both Goenkas declined to be interviewed. Welspun hired the audit firm EY to evaluate its practices and supply chain. On Tuesday, the company said it will move to producing all of its Egyptian cotton products in-house. The scandal is creating an opportunity for rival Indian supplier Trident Ltd., which has picked up a significant chunk of Welspun’s business from Wal-Mart, Target and Ikea, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Ikea often uses more than one supplier for the same product, according to a spokesperson for the Swedish company, adding that Welspun continues to supply the furniture retailer while it’s also worked with Trident for many years. Ikea said it doesn’t buy products made from Egyptian cotton due to sustainability concerns. Chinese textile producers may also benefit, analysts said. Big U.S. retailers tend to “go for Indian companies because they are cheaper," particularly thanks to lower labor costs, said Jack Yang, an executive at Chinese manufacturer Yantai Pacific Home Fashion. Scarce cotton Anyone trying to capitalize, though, faces the same problem: a shortage of Egyptian cotton. That, in turn, might assist U.S. manufacturers of Pima cotton, another high-quality grade that promotes itself as a rival to the Egyptian variety. Back in Cairo, the guardians of the country’s sole global brand argue their efforts will be enough to rein in fakes, and they say the controversy might even have a silver lining. “If what was happening had continued, in a few years there would be zero Egyptian cotton,” Schuman said. “The turbulence now is positive. It’s raising awareness, and we are doing everything we can to protect the value of our product.” Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Recent Articles by Bloomberg News Pence to lead Trump transition team, replacing Christie as chairman Drugmakers' stocks jump on promise of Trump presidency Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Major American retailers have been selling premium-priced sheets purportedly made of Egyptian cotton -- a byword for luxury in linens -- but that may in reality be woven with lower-quality cotton blends. Photo: g-miner/Thinkstock Huddled inside Target Corp.’s headquarters in downtown Minneapolis, a team of investigators spent the summer trying to answer what should have been a simple question: What were hundreds of thousands of the retailer’s sheets actually made of? What they discovered has undermined trust in a global luxury product and set off a salvo of class-action lawsuits that have created a king-sized public relations challenge for the Indian textiles industry and the U.S. companies it supplies. Turns out that major American retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., have been selling premium-priced sheets purportedly made of Egyptian cotton -- a byword for luxury in linens -- but that may in reality be woven with lower-quality cotton blends. Three suits seeking to be certified as class-actions have been filed against supplier Welspun India Ltd. -- and a separate one last week was directed at Wal-Mart. The complaint, filed in New York by customer Dorothy Monahan, accuses the world’s largest retailer of questioning the fiber content of Welspun’s products as early as 2008, but not halting its sales until after Target did so in August. Wal-Mart said it will “vigorously defend” itself. The other lawsuits, all filed in the U.S. against Welspun, allege the company fraudulently labeled its bed sheets as Egyptian cotton. Welspun declined to comment on the suits. Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts during a conference call in August that “the error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it.” Target, meanwhile, hasn’t been sued. “The marketing has created this image in our heads that high-quality cotton and Egypt are synonymous," said Louis Rose, a Memphis, Tennessee-based cotton industry consultant. “Consumers should be skeptical of these marketing claims. They’ll be under a lot more scrutiny now.” The fake Egyptian sheet episode came to light after exhaustive work by Target investigators who analyzed sheet fibers under microscopes and tracked their journey through a global supply chain. The probe found that 750,000 of Target’s "Egyptian cotton" sheets, sold for as much as $75 a pop, didn’t contain any Egyptian cotton at all, but an amalgam of lower-quality fibers from cheaper sources. That July discovery touched off a scandal spanning from Minnesota to Mumbai and Cairo that threatens the future of Welspun, part of a $3 billion conglomerate headed by entrepreneur Balkrishan Goenka. It may also hobble Indian textile manufacturers in the race to supply Western consumers with high-quality sheets and towels, creating an opening for competitors from China and elsewhere to grab the business, according to industry analysts. The Welspun-made sheets Target examined were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. While it has interests in steel, energy, and infrastructure, textiles are the bread and butter for Welspun, which says it supplies one in five towels sold in America and posted revenue of about $900 million in the 2016 fiscal year. Tennis stars like Roger Federer mop their brows with Welspun towels at the Wimbledon championships -- a fact the company highlights in investor presentations. Target has cut ties and ended all of its $90 million in annual business with the company. Wal-Mart Stores and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. also stopped selling Welspun sheets that had been labeled 100% Egyptian cotton. Those are significant blows coming from some of Welspun’s biggest customers, and have sent its stock down about 40% since Aug. 19 when Target announced its decision. The sheets fiasco reflects a simple reality: There’s a scarcity of Egyptian cotton. It first became a key export product in the early 19th century, when it arrived in France and became sought after for its silky feel. Production has been falling since the 1990s, however, and last year Egypt’s post-revolutionary military government ended subsidies for cotton farmers to shore up the state budget. A gradual decline in output has become a precipitous plunge. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates there will be a 53% decrease in production this year, to an all-time low of 160,000 bales. The system for certifying Egyptian cotton is administered from Cairo by the Cotton Egypt Association, an industry group that grants stamps of approval to suppliers of 100% Egyptian cotton products. To receive one, CEA executive director Khaled Schuman explained, a manufacturer pays an initial fee of $5,000 and submits records of Egyptian cotton purchases and product samples, which undergo DNA analysis to identify whether the fibers were grown in Egypt or elsewhere.

He told them to ignore the company’s plunging share price and to focus on their day jobs, and that Welspun would bounce back over time, the person said. Both Goenkas declined to be interviewed. Welspun, which has said the issue never affected the quality or safety of its products, hired the audit firm EY to evaluate its practices and supply chain. The company reports quarterly earnings Tuesday. The scandal is creating an opportunity for rival Indian supplier Trident Ltd., which has picked up a significant chunk of Welspun’s business from Wal-Mart, Target and Ikea, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Ikea often uses more than one supplier for the same product, according to a spokesperson for the Swedish company, adding that Welspun continues to supply the furniture retailer while it’s also worked with Trident for many years.

(WMT) Stock. Should You? Berkshire's thinner position in WMT stock has many investors reconsidering the giant American retailer's worth By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Nov 15, 2016, 9:04 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Walt Disney Co Is Cutting Its Own Cord (DIS) Recent Posts: Selling Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock? That’s Just Silly. Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) View All Posts Warren Buffett is selling down his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B) position in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). That’s putting pressure on WMT stock just ahead of its Nov. 17 earnings report, and forcing a lot of investors to rethink this long-term portfolio staple. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Berkshire’s stake in the giant retailer, once worth $5 billion, is now down to less than $1 billion. Buffett sold some of the shares earlier this year, then sold even more WMT stock after the company bought Jet.com for $3 billion in August. Berkshire Hathaway first disclosed a stake in Walmart shares in 2005. With the shares then trading at $47, their value was estimated at $944 billion. Since then, however, Walmart stock is only up 34% after peaking at around $85 in early 2015. Berkshire’s holdings in the company peaked in 2014, at 67.7 million shares, then worth about $5 billion. He began trimming the position last year as the price fell to less than $60 per share, and probably finished his sales around $70. Buffett has at least been acquiring better dividends — Walmart’s payout has risen from 15 cents per share in 2005 to 50 cents per share more recently. And he did enjoy some capital gains in WMT stock. But should you pick up what Buffett has put down? Walmart: Value or Value Trap? The 18 analysts following Walmart stock are estimating that revenue for the third quarter will come in at $118.69 billion, with earnings of about $3 billion, or 98 cents per share. Most analysts only call it a hold, not a buy. WMT is expected to earn $1.46/share, about $4.8 billion, during the current quarter, which includes Christmas. At current prices, the gains to be made here aren’t capital, but income. WMT stock currently yields 2.8% — slightly below the rate on the 30-year U.S. government bond, whose value has been falling lately (and thus whose yield is rising). Walmart’s purchase of Jet.com occurred at the start of the third quarter, and those managers have only recently slotted into the e-commerce division’s management structure. The company has big plans but may have trouble executing all of them in time for the current Christmas selling season. Speaking of Christmas … The season has already begun with major retailers “leaking” their top Black Friday deals, starting with TVs. Walmart’s ad focuses on electronics and games, with more products available for in-store pick-up.

Production has been falling since the 1990s, however, and last year Egypt’s post-revolutionary military government ended subsidies for cotton farmers to shore up the state budget. A gradual decline in output has become a precipitous plunge. The US department of agriculture estimates there will be a 53% decrease in production this year, to an all-time low of 160,000 bales. The system for certifying Egyptian cotton is administered from Cairo by the Cotton Egypt Association, an industry group that grants stamps of approval to suppliers of 100% Egyptian cotton products. To receive one, CEA executive director Khaled Schuman explained, a manufacturer pays an initial fee of $5,000 and submits records of Egyptian cotton purchases and product samples, which undergo DNA analysis to identify whether the fibers were grown in Egypt or elsewhere. The companies are charged an additional $3,000 annually for the certification, according to Schuman. But once a certification is granted, producers are mostly left alone until they need to renew their label a year later. “You can’t put an employee from the association on each production line to inspect” every item being produced, said Mohamed Negm, who conducts testing of certification samples for the association to verify the fibers are Egyptian-grown. Typically, suppliers like Welspun purchase cotton in raw form from Egypt for import to Asia, where it’s turned into finished products for sale in the U.S. and elsewhere, he said. The highest-quality Egyptian material costs twice as much as the standard grade sourced from India, providing a powerful incentive to cheat. “Factories have mixed the Egyptian cotton with other low quality cottons to make profit, which has ruined the reputation of Egyptian cotton,” said Negm, adding that’s what the DNA testing and certification aim to curtail. During the set-up of the CEA’s DNA testing program, Negm said, it started analyzing random samples taken from store shelves globally; 90 percent were fake, mixed with low-quality cottons from the likes of Sudan, Burkina Faso and Pakistan. “It’s very easy to play it loose during the production process if you want,” said Liu Dang Dang, a foreign sales manager at Chinese manufacturer Jihua 3542 Textile Co. U.S. retailers “should have realized how obvious it is,” he said, adding that the company, which supplies Egyptian cotton fabric to manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe, doesn’t engage in the practice. “The price they want to pay for Egyptian cotton sheets is so low when the price of Egyptian cotton is so high.” Widespread blending Blending is widespread in the industry and quietly tolerated by many retail chains, according to two executives at producers other than Welspun who asked not to be identified discussing the procedure. Sometimes that means mixing good-quality non-Egyptian cotton that maintains the same feel amid shortages of the real thing, but it also often includes using cheaper grades to save money, said the people, citing their experience with cotton processing departments and export requirements for US retailers. The CEA formally announced its DNA testing program in April, saying the “gold seal” it would give manufacturers who passed would help “rid the supply chain of falsely labeled goods.” Awkwardly, the first company to receive a gold seal was Welspun, for bed linens as well as towels and bath rugs. Target has decided not to rely on CEA certifications going forward, according to a person familiar with the retailer’s decisions who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Wal-Mart, by contrast, has said it will continue to rely on the CEA standard. Schuman said the organisation is “making good efforts to make the system tougher” to avoid future problems, for example by increasing the role of third-party auditors and monitoring suppliers’ inventories more closely. After discovering problems with Welspun sheets, Target quickly decided to terminate its entire relationship with the company, citing “the trust that our guests place in us.” It also opted to offer refunds to customers who’d purchased them -- even if they’d been sleeping on them for years. Wal-Mart has also offered refunds. Although Welspun knew Target was investigating its products, its executives believed that, at worst, the retailer would drop only its Egyptian cotton sheets, according to a person privy to the discussions. Target didn’t warn Welspun beforehand about its 19 August announcement that it was ending all its business ties, the person said, which left the company blindsided. At the time chairman Goenka’s wife Dipali, who leads Welspun’s home textile business, had just returned to India from meetings in the US; she turned around immediately to do damage-control with clients, according to a person familiar with the events. In Mumbai, her husband had called an emergency meeting of department heads. He told them to ignore the company’s plunging share price and to focus on their day jobs, and that Welspun would bounce back over time, the person said. Both Goenkas declined to be interviewed. Welspun, which has said the issue never affected the quality or safety of its products, hired the audit firm EY to evaluate its practices and supply chain. The company reports quarterly earnings Tuesday. The scandal is creating an opportunity for rival Indian supplier Trident Ltd., which has picked up a significant chunk of Welspun’s business from Wal-Mart, Target and Ikea, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Ikea often uses more than one supplier for the same product, according to a spokesperson for the Swedish company, adding that Welspun continues to supply the furniture retailer while it’s also worked with Trident for many years. Ikea said it doesn’t buy products made from Egyptian cotton due to sustainability concerns. Chinese textile producers may also benefit, analysts said. Big U.S. retailers tend to “go for Indian companies because they are cheaper,” particularly thanks to lower labor costs, said Jack Yang, an executive at Chinese manufacturer Yantai Pacific Home Fashion. Scarce Cotton Anyone trying to capitalise, though, faces the same problem: a shortage of Egyptian cotton. That, in turn, might assist U.S. manufacturers of Pima cotton, another high-quality grade that promotes itself as a rival to the Egyptian variety. Back in Cairo, the guardians of the country’s sole global brand argue their efforts will be enough to rein in fakes, and they say the controversy might even have a silver lining. “If what was happening had continued, in a few years there would be zero Egyptian cotton,” Schuman said. “The turbulence now is positive. It’s raising awareness, and we are doing everything we can to protect the value of our product.” Bloomberg Matthew CampbellShannon PettypieceSiddharth Philip Topics: WelspunCotton IndustryEgyptian cottonWal-Martlawsuits More from this Section Indian financial services firms lap up on high-profile exits from MNCs How Rosneft-Essar deal almost fell apart, thanks to a last-minute Saudi Aramco bid Cash crunch: mPOS service providers record surge in transactions, sign-ups Why another financial warning sign is flashing in China Modi’s re-election faces voter backlash because of jobless growth Editor's Picks The cash withdrawal, currency exchange challenge at rural bank branches Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks The economics of currency reform Donald Trump’s threat to Indian IT is all bluster First Published: Tue, Nov 15 2016. 01 01 PM IST Read more from Livemint In Pakistan, Bollywood’s loss has been Iranian, Turkish films’ gain Indian financial services firms lap up on high-profile exits from MNCs Parliament winter session to feel the heat on currency note ban Editor's Picks The cash withdrawal, currency exchange challenge at rural bank branches Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks Latest News In Pakistan, Bollywood’s loss has been Iranian, Turkish films’ gain Indian financial services firms lap up on high-profile exits from MNCs Parliament winter session to feel the heat on currency note ban Mamata Banerjee seizes currency ban move to take a shot at power in Delhi Demonetization may help banks turn profitable in third quarter: CLSA analyst Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 15, 2016 at 8:20AM After years of operating with the same playbook, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is starting to think like a disrupter. Gone is the company's traditional strategy of opening up hundreds of supercenters a year across the country, paying workers rock bottom wages, and operating on the cheap to ensure the lowest prices around. When CEO Doug McMillon took the helm in Feburary of 2014, he inherited a company in disarray. Comparable sales were falling as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) seemed to be beating the company on price and convenience, and the company had missed an opportunity to build out a viable e-commerce business. Now, Wal-Mart has dramatically scaled back on new store openings in the U.S. in order to focus on e-commerce and cleaning up stores. It's hiked minimum wages to $10/hour and increased training in order to reduce turnover, develop management, and improve the customer experience. It's pushing new ideas like grocery pick-up, where customers order groceries online and pick them up from a parking lot -- a concept that should expand to nearly 1,000 stores next year. But the biggest sign that Wal-Mart is starting to think like a start-up is its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, the e-commerce upstart, and the recent executive overhaul that followed. Image Source: Wal-Mart.  Jet.com Founder Marc Lore has taken over Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, and is rapidly ushering out the old guard. According to The Wall Street Journal, the departing execs include Fernando Madeiro, Walmart.com head, Diane Mills, senior vice president of global e-commerce human resources, and Brent Beabout, senior vice president of e-commerce supply chain.  When Wal-Mart announced the acquisition in August, it also said Neil Ashe, its CEO of global e-commerce, would be leaving the company. Rebuilding from scratch The executive turnover is the latest sign that Wal-Mart is looking to scrap its old e-commerce model and start fresh. At the time of the announcement, Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth had decelerated for eight quarters in a row, indicating the need for a new strategy. Lore is one of the best-regarded brains in e-commerce, and obtaining his services was a major reason for the Jet.com acquisition. Prior to Jet.com, Lore founded Quidsi, the Diapers.com parent, which was hotly pursued by both Amazon and Wal-Mart. After savagely undercutting Diapers.com on price, Amazon bought the company in 2010 for $545 million. Lore spent two years at Amazon following the acquisition before leaving. Wal-Mart CEO McMillon has shown in other ways that he knows his e-commerce division must be treated like a start-up in order to succeed. At the company's investor day conference last month, McMillon said he was doing his best to keep Lore away from the retailer's bureaucracy, adding, "If Marc can be Marc within this company, then great things are going to happen." Among the ideas that attracted Wal-Mart to Jet.com is its "smart basket" technology, which lowers prices as customers add more items to their orders, and also adjusts prices based on options like paying with a debit card or foregoing returns. It's too early to say how the Jet.com acquisition will play out, but the spirit of a start-up seems to be what Wal-Mart needs to rejuvenate its e-commerce operations. In its second quarter, e-commerce sales growth accelerated for the first time in two year thanks to the popularity of grocery pick-up. McMillon's turnaround strategy has been slow to take shape and is not expected to deliver profit growth until 2018. But there are already signs that moves like increasing wages are paying off. Wal-Mart's comparable sales reached its highest mark in years at 1.6% in its second-quarter report, and customer satisfaction scores were up as well. The Jet.com acquisition brings a much-needed set of new ideas and technologies that should boost e-commerce over the long-term. Wal-Mart is set to deliver its third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Nov. 17. While bottom-line results could again be muted, I'd expect another promising round of comparable sales and e-commerce growth.   Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Dirty Linen: A Sheets Scandal Is Roiling the Cotton Industry Bloomberg 1 day ago Matthew Campbell, Shannon Pettypiece and Salma El Wardany < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 3NEXT SLIDE > BC-WELSPUN-DIRTY-LINEN © Matthew Campbell, Shannon Pettypiece and Rajhkumar K Shaaw Huddled inside Target Corp.’s headquarters in downtown Minneapolis, a team of investigators spent the summer trying to answer what should have been a simple question: What were hundreds of thousands of the retailer’s sheets actually made of? Quotes in the article Welspun Corp Ltd 532144 ▲ 73.10 +0.60 +0.83% Target Corp TGT ▼ 71.44 -0.73 -1.01% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% Welspun India Ltd 514162 ▼ 60.15 -1.50 -2.43% What they discovered has undermined trust in a global luxury product and set off a salvo of class-action lawsuits that have created a king-sized public relations challenge for the Indian textiles industry and the U.S. companies it supplies.  Turns out that major American retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., have been selling premium-priced sheets purportedly made of Egyptian cotton -- a byword for luxury in linens -- but that may in reality be woven with lower-quality cotton blends. Three suits seeking to be certified as class-actions have been filed against supplier Welspun India Ltd. -- and a separate one last week was directed at Wal-Mart. The complaint, filed in New York by customer Dorothy Monahan, accuses the world’s largest retailer of questioning the fiber content of Welspun’s products as early as 2008, but not halting its sales until after Target did so in August. Wal-Mart said it will “vigorously defend” itself. The other lawsuits, all filed in the U.S. against Welspun, allege the company fraudulently labeled its bed sheets as Egyptian cotton. Welspun declined to comment on the suits. Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts during a conference call in August that “the error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it.” Target, meanwhile, hasn’t been sued. “The marketing has created this image in our heads that high-quality cotton and Egypt are synonymous," said Louis Rose, a Memphis, Tennessee-based cotton industry consultant. “Consumers should be skeptical of these marketing claims. They’ll be under a lot more scrutiny now.” Target has cut ties and ended all of its $90 million in annual business with the Indian supplier, and Wal-Mart Stores has stopped selling Welspun sheets that had been labeled 100 percent Egyptian cotton. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. followed suit on Monday, sending Welspun’s stock as much as 9 percent lower in Mumbai the next day. With these significant blows from some of Welspun’s biggest customers, the shares have tumbled more than 40 percent since Aug. 19, when Target announced its decision. The fake Egyptian sheet episode came to light after exhaustive work by Target investigators who analyzed sheet fibers under microscopes and tracked their journey through a global supply chain. The probe found that 750,000 of Target’s "Egyptian cotton" sheets, sold for as much as $75 a pop, didn’t contain any Egyptian cotton at all, but an amalgam of lower-quality fibers from cheaper sources.  That July discovery touched off a scandal spanning from Minnesota to Mumbai and Cairo that threatens the future of Welspun, part of a $3 billion conglomerate headed by entrepreneur Balkrishan Goenka. It may also hobble Indian textile manufacturers in the race to supply Western consumers with high-quality sheets and towels, creating an opening for competitors from China and elsewhere to grab the business, according to industry analysts. The Welspun-made sheets Target examined were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. While it has interests in steel, energy, and infrastructure, textiles are the bread and butter for Welspun, which says it supplies one in five towels sold in America and posted revenue of about $900 million in the 2016 fiscal year. Tennis stars like Roger Federer mop their brows with Welspun towels at the Wimbledon championships -- a fact the company highlights in investor presentations. The sheets fiasco reflects a simple reality: There’s a scarcity of Egyptian cotton. It first became a key export product in the early 19th century, when it arrived in France and became sought after for its silky feel. Production has been falling since the 1990s, however, and last year Egypt’s post-revolutionary military government ended subsidies for cotton farmers to shore up the state budget. A gradual decline in output has become a precipitous plunge. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates there will be a 53 percent decrease in production this year, to an all-time low of 160,000 bales. The system for certifying Egyptian cotton is administered from Cairo by the Cotton Egypt Association, an industry group that grants stamps of approval to suppliers of 100-percent Egyptian cotton products. To receive one, CEA executive director Khaled Schuman explained, a manufacturer pays an initial fee of $5,000 and submits records of Egyptian cotton purchases and product samples, which undergo DNA analysis to identify whether the fibers were grown in Egypt or elsewhere. The companies are charged an additional $3,000 annually for the certification, according to Schuman. But once a certification is granted, producers are mostly left alone until they need to renew their label a year later. “You can’t put an employee from the association on each production line to inspect” every item being produced, said Mohamed Negm, who conducts testing of certification samples for the association to verify the fibers are Egyptian-grown. Typically, suppliers like Welspun purchase cotton in raw form from Egypt for import to Asia, where it’s turned into finished products for sale in the U.S. and elsewhere, he said. The highest-quality Egyptian material costs twice as much as the standard grade sourced from India, providing a powerful incentive to cheat. “Factories have mixed the Egyptian cotton with other low quality cottons to make profit, which has ruined the reputation of Egyptian cotton,” said Negm, adding that’s what the DNA testing and certification aim to curtail. During the set-up of the CEA’s DNA testing program, Negm said, it started analyzing random samples taken from store shelves globally; 90 percent were fake, mixed with low-quality cottons from the likes of Sudan, Burkina Faso and Pakistan. “It’s very easy to play it loose during the production process if you want,” said Liu Dang Dang, a foreign sales manager at Chinese manufacturer Jihua 3542 Textile Co. U.S. retailers “should have realized how obvious it is,” he said, adding that the company, which supplies Egyptian cotton fabric to manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe, doesn’t engage in the practice. “The price they want to pay for Egyptian cotton sheets is so low when the price of Egyptian cotton is so high.” Widespread Blending Blending is widespread in the industry and quietly tolerated by many retail chains, according to two executives at producers other than Welspun who asked not to be identified discussing the procedure. Sometimes that means mixing good-quality non-Egyptian cotton that maintains the same feel amid shortages of the real thing, but it also often includes using cheaper grades to save money, said the people, citing their experience with cotton processing departments and export requirements for U.S. retailers. The CEA formally announced its DNA testing program in April, saying the “gold seal” it would give manufacturers who passed would help “rid the supply chain of falsely labeled goods.” Awkwardly, the first company to receive a gold seal was Welspun, for bed linens as well as towels and bath rugs. Target has decided not to rely on CEA certifications going forward, according to a person familiar with the retailer’s decisions who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Wal-Mart, by contrast, has said it will continue to rely on the CEA standard. Schuman said the organization is “making good efforts to make the system tougher" to avoid future problems, for example by increasing the role of third-party auditors and monitoring suppliers’ inventories more closely. After discovering problems with Welspun sheets, Target quickly decided to terminate its entire relationship with the company, citing “the trust that our guests place in us." It also opted to offer refunds to customers who’d purchased them -- even if they’d been sleeping on them for years. Wal-Mart has also offered refunds. Although Welspun knew Target was investigating its products, its executives believed that, at worst, the retailer would drop only its Egyptian cotton sheets, according to a person privy to the discussions. Target didn’t warn Welspun beforehand about its Aug. 19 announcement that it was ending all its business ties, the person said, which left the company blindsided. At the time chairman Goenka’s wife Dipali, who leads Welspun’s home textile business, had just returned to India from meetings in the U.S.; she turned around immediately to do damage-control with clients, according to a person familiar with the events. In Mumbai, her husband had called an emergency meeting of department heads. He told them to ignore the company’s plunging share price and to focus on their day jobs, and that Welspun would bounce back over time, the person said. Both Goenkas declined to be interviewed. Welspun, which has said the issue never affected the quality or safety of its products, hired the audit firm EY to evaluate its practices and supply chain. The company reports quarterly earnings Tuesday. The scandal is creating an opportunity for rival Indian supplier Trident Ltd., which has picked up a significant chunk of Welspun’s business from Wal-Mart, Target and Ikea, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Ikea often uses more than one supplier for the same product, according to a spokesperson for the Swedish company, adding that Welspun continues to supply the furniture retailer while it’s also worked with Trident for many years. Ikea said it doesn’t buy products made from Egyptian cotton due to sustainability concerns. Chinese textile producers may also benefit, analysts said. Big U.S. retailers tend to “go for Indian companies because they are cheaper," particularly thanks to lower labor costs, said Jack Yang, an executive at Chinese manufacturer Yantai Pacific Home Fashion. Scarce Cotton Anyone trying to capitalize, though, faces the same problem: a shortage of Egyptian cotton. That, in turn, might assist U.S. manufacturers of Pima cotton, another high-quality grade that promotes itself as a rival to the Egyptian variety. Back in Cairo, the guardians of the country’s sole global brand argue their efforts will be enough to rein in fakes, and they say the controversy might even have a silver lining. “If what was happening had continued, in a few years there would be zero Egyptian cotton,” Schuman said. “The turbulence now is positive. It’s raising awareness, and we are doing everything we can to protect the value of our product.” (Updates with Welspun share reaction in seventh paragraph.) --With assistance from P R Sanjai Rachel Chang Sam Chambers Rajhkumar K Shaaw and Siddharth Philip To contact the reporters on this story: Matthew Campbell in London at mcampbell39@bloomberg.net, Shannon Pettypiece in New York at spettypiece@bloomberg.net, Salma El Wardany in Cairo at selwardany@bloomberg.net.

Origins Edition – £24.99 (GAME) PS4 Slim or PS4 Pro: which one should I buy on Black Friday 2016? The big PS4 spending question this year surrounds PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro. There are two distinct PS4 boxes on offer in 2016, and you definitely want to be clued up as to which one you’re buying as the Pro, as you’d expect, is more powerful than the Slim and is aimed primarily as those looking to move into the 4K era. Best Buy – all deals are valid only from November 24-26 PlayStation Camera for PS4 – $29.99 (50% off) Gold Wireless Stereo Headset for PS4 and PS3 – $59.99 (40% off) Uncharted 4 PS4 500Gb bundle – $249.99 (16% off) PS4 Pro   PS4 Pro (originally codenamed Neo) is the next generation PlayStation in all but name. Releasing on November 10, it features an upgrades graphics unit and a faster processor, allowing it to output games in 4K (assuming you have a compatible TV). While it doesn’t play 4K Blu-ray discs (unlike Microsoft’s Xbox One S, also available throughout Black Friday 2016), this is the box to aim for if cutting edge graphics are the name of your game. The software to take full advantage of PS4 Pro won’t emerge until 2017, but Black Friday 2016 could well be your best opportunity to grab this more expensive box until this time next year. It’s worth noting that Sony’s already confirmed it isn’t planning any PS4 Pro exclusives, so you won’t be missing any games if you decide to stay with the current level of PS4 technology, only some extra graphical grunt. The launch cost is $399/£349, and PS4 Pro is bound to be one of the hottest tickets this Black Friday. Bookmark this page so you can land the best price. PS4 Slim PS4 Slim, both announced and released in September this year, is now the default PS4 box at the launch level of technology. If you have the PS4 that’s been on sale since the console launched in 2014, then you know what you’re getting here. It’s the same thing in a different case. All PS4’s support HDR following a PSN update in September, so it isn’t worth buying a PS4 Pro this year if that’s the only feature you’re looking for. Current pricing for PS4 Slim is around £230/$300, so significantly less expensive than PS4 Pro. PS4 Slim is far more likely to be heavily discounted this Black Friday than PS4 Pro, which will be Sony’s new baby during the sales, so if you just want to bag a PS4 console as a Christmas present and you’re happy waiting until next year for PS4 Pro (and the TV upgrade you’re going to need to take advantage of it), then this is the one to watch. Bookmark this page right now. PS4 on Black Friday 2016 PlayStation always takes advantage of the Black Friday holiday, so players can be sure to take their pick of bargains across the PS4 and Vita, digital games, boxed games and peripherals. Expect Sony to announce a digital games sale across PSN in the weeks before Black Friday, and look out for any discounts on the PS Plus service. If you’ve taken the plunge with the brand new PSVR headset there may be some surprise discounts there, but remember it’s only just release. Don’t expect any massive reductions. Last year PlayStation had its most successful Black Friday in its history (with almost 140,000 machines sold in the UK alone over the sales period), but how will it fair this year now that it has sailed passed the 40 million units mark? The answer’s easy. It’s likely to go well for Sony this Black Friday, as it has a brand new, more powerful box in PS4 Pro this year, as well as the bargain, entry-level choice with PS4 Slim. In addition, the introduction of PS4 Pro may well see heavy discounting on the “older” PS4 model, so keep your eyes well and truly open. Remember: all PS4 models play the same games. What is Black Friday? Black Friday is a retail sales day, the Friday following Thanksgiving in the US. Thanksgiving always falls on a Thursday, meaning Black Friday is always on a Friday. Or it’d be Black The Day After Thanksgiving. And no one wants that. Cyber Monday is also a thing, following after everyone’s had a rest on the Saturday and Sunday. Black Friday’s considered to be the start of the American Christmas shopping season, and has been since 1932. The unbridled festival of consumer greed has spread to the UK in recent years, with the whole shebang going fully international in 2014. British online retailers such as Amazon have taken to it with gusto, and UK gamers are now just as likely to pick up bargains as their American cousins. When is Black Friday 2016? Black Friday 2016 takes place on November 25. We’d expect retailers to begin advertising their deals in the month before the big day, and then start cutting prices in the week running up to Black Friday. Also remember that sales will continue over the US holiday weekend and on to Cyber Monday. After that, it’s the Xmas shopping season, so expect sales to continue, but not as drastically as during Black Friday. It really is the best time to buy, rather than waiting for Xmas holiday or New Year sales. How much can I save on Black Friday? Why exactly should you need to pay proper attention to Black Friday and Cyber Monday? There’s an easy answer: you can save a fortune. As well as bringing some massive discounts on expensive technology items, such as HD TVs and stereo equipment, video games, gaming PCs and consoles all line up for large savings. According to Adobe shoppers saved an average of 24 percent on goods last year – almost a quarter of the normal price. When you apply that to expensive tech like consoles and TVs, that’s a significant chunk of your hard-earned cash. The tide continues to turn for online retail, with Black Friday sales dropping at bricks and mortar stores in 2015 once again. This means more and more deals will be offered online in the future. You should absolutely be watching this year (yes, just bookmark this page now). There’s a reason people go crazy for Black Friday. And if you’re wondering how well games consoles perform compared to other deals at Black Friday, the same Adobe report shows that PS4 and Xbox One were in the top five goods bought on Black Friday 2016, alongside Samsung 4K TVs and Apple’s iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini. Black Friday Xbox One, PC, Nintendo, laptop and Apple deals There’s a lot of discounting going on during Black Friday, and not just on PlayStation products. We know you don’t stick to one thing for your daily entertainment, so here’s a handy list of other deals you can pick up during Black Friday 2016 in gaming, home entertainment, computing and tech.

Walmart invests in employees with training academy Kayla King-Sumner , The Republic | azcentral.com 8:33 p.m. MST November 14, 2016 The "Pathways" program is a training initiative aimed at increasing growth opportunities for employees nationwide. Rita Adams grins after completing a floor training exercise at a Walmart in Peoria. (Photo: Kayla King-Sumner/The Republic) Rita Adams has been selling jewelry at a Peoria Walmart for years, and she still arrives to work five days a week with the same radiant smile, resilient attitude and southern chuckle. "This is my career," said 52-year-old Adams. "I raised my family out of it." Adams started working for Walmart in 1996 in her small Mississippi hometown, and when she moved to Arizona in 1999, she had a job waiting for her. Her career with the nation's largest private employer allowed her to buy a house and send herself and three daughters to college, she said. Now, Adams seeks a promotion to jewelry-department manager. She has enrolled in Walmart's "Pathways" program, a training initiative aimed at increasing growth opportunities for employees nationwide. The program is part of a $2.7 billion investment in training and wage increases for employees, announced in 2015 as Walmart trailed competitors in customer-service ratings and employee satisfaction. Walmart plans to establish 200 Pathways academies across the country before the end of 2017, according to the company. Arizona academies Laura Roberts, 36, trains Walmart supervisor Anna Jordan, 21 to be a department manager at Walmart.  (Photo: Kayla King-Sumner | The Republic) Walmart held its first Arizona academy-training sessions for employees at stores in Gilbert and Mesa in August. The company employs about 35,000 people in the state. The Peoria Walmart where Adams works houses the company's third Arizona academy, serving staffers from more than 20 nearby Walmart stores. The academy includes a newly built classroom and school area in the back of the store where staff members attend eight-hour class sessions. Employees in the academy must attend four days of classroom training before advancing to practical training in the store. Adams completed a practical exercise Monday, a mock sale of an engagement ring. Nathan Seals, one of the store's associate department managers, played the customer. AZCENTRAL Study: Getting a college degree in Arizona pays off Academy students choose from several areas of study, including core leadership, merchandising, operations, technology and customer service. Then they continue on to training specific to the department in which they currently work, such as jewelry or produce. Laura Roberts, 36, started working for Walmart 18 years ago. She said her mentors helped her advance as a professional and a leader in the company. "I was kicked out when I was 16," said Roberts. "This is like (my) second family." Now a department manager, Roberts is training 21-year-old supervisor Anna Jordan in the Peoria academy. Jordan started working at Walmart immediately after high school to support herself. She said her favorite aspect of academy training is team-building activities to build a friendlier and more efficient staff. AZCENTRAL McDonald's 'Hiring Day' seeks to fill 3K jobs in Arizona Employees 'empowered' Walmart spokeswoman Delia Garcia said leadership is one of the company's most important core values, as laid out out by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon when he announced the investment into employee training and wages last year. Garcia said Walmart has cleaner stores and a better-paid staff as a result of the multibillion-dollar move. "We’re seeing that associates are feeling more empowered in their jobs," Garcia said. "Customer experience scores have gone up for the past eight quarters." Walmart aims to provide academy training for all of its approximately 140,000 employees in the future, Garcia said. The Peoria academy students will have their graduation ceremony at the Walmart on Peoria Avenue. "You can be whatever you want to be," said Adams, the longtime employee turned trainee.

Vaughan Lisbon said the store was always truck-friendly in the past and he had been using the parking lot for three months. Lisbon left his truck at the Walmart on Garners Ferry Road on Friday before heading out of town for the weekend. When he returned, his truck and others were gone. Lisbon said he noticed a “No Unauthorized Vehicle” sign, but he believed that sign was a new one. However, Walmart said the sign has been up for two years. After picking up his truck from the impound lot, Lisbon acknowledged that Walmart has the right to implement the rule on its private property, but he said the misconception that all Walmart lots were open to overnight parking was a costly one. "Why would they do it without giving prior notice to what they were going to do?" Lisbon said. "All they needed to do was put a sticker on the vehicles letting them know not to park there anymore." Walmart released a statement on the matter. "Permission to park in our store lots is extended by individual store managers, based on availability of parking space and local laws." Store officials said you should always check with managers before leaving a vehicle overnight.  Copyright 2016 WIS.

The hit of nostalgia only costs $60, so it’s out of stock at basically every retailer worth talking about. To try and give people a fighting chance at owning the tiny console (and drive holiday-time shoppers to its website), Walmart has announced that it will sell a limited quantity of the NES Classic on its site every day this week. DON’T MISS: NES Classic Edition review: A box of nostalgia The flash sale will happen every day at 5PM ET, right at this link. You’ll have to be fast, as the sale today — which wasn’t as widely advertised — sold out in minutes. To get your hands on the console, you’ll probably want to pre-create a Walmart account and enter your information, make sure you’re logged in, and start hitting refresh. (You can also download Chrome extensions to auto-refresh your page every couple of seconds, if you’re feeling lucky.) Experience gained buying concert tickets also tells me that having a couple different devices ready to go will also be helpful. The NES Classic is a $60 miniature version of the original Nintendo Entertainment System. It can’t take the old game cartridges, it doesn’t have any fancy online features, and it won’t do strange VR things for you. What it will do, however, is play 30 classic games, all pre-loaded and included with the $60 pricetag, including Super Mario Bros. 3, Castlevania, Mega Man 2, Metroid and Donkey Kong.  In our review, we said that”the NES Classic Edition isn’t a perfect product, but it is a smart, affordable, attractive device that blows all of those other retro consoles you’ve seen lining store shelves at Target and Walmart out of the water.

Trader Pete Najarian said when he looks at the fast food space, and especially the pizza area, he doesn't know why Papa John's doesn't get as much attention as Domino's. Papa John's finished the day up 1.8 percent. The company's stock is up nearly 10 percent this quarter and up more than 50 percent this year. Najarian noted that Yum Brands' focus is no longer just Taco Bell or KFC, but also Pizza Hut because it's an area where the company can make some gains. Trader Brian Kelly said he would want to buy U.S. restaurants, such as Darden Restaurants or Cracker Barrel. On retail, trader Steve Grasso said he has a problem with Wal-Mart because it's benefited from the "sell" pressure that has been put on Amazon. He said he expects Wal-Mart to fall once Amazon makes back some of its gains. For that reason, he says he'd rather buy Target, calling it the "catch-up trade." Earlier Tuesday, Home Depot reported sales and earnings that topped analysts' expectations, driven by an increase in both the number of people who made purchases in its stores and the amount that shoppers spent. Najarian said he was surprised by how far it fell, but that there's opportunity in the stock because the earnings looked very promising.

(AP) — Two former security workers at a Rhode Island Walmart say in federal lawsuits filed against the retailer that they were victims of racial discrimination. Robert McCutcheon and James Braddock worked as “asset protection associates” at the Providence store. They tell The Providence Journal that they loved their jobs, and saw room for advancement and long-term careers. The men, who are both black, allege they were called “gangstas” by their supervisors, subjected to racial stereotypes, sent into largely minority neighborhoods to retrieve shopping carts, and denied promotions based on race. They are seeking unspecified damages and are asking the court to find Walmart in violation of state fair employment laws and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act. A Walmart spokesman said the company denies the allegations and does not tolerate discrimination. ___ Information from: The Providence Journal, http://www.providencejournal.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

But have hope. Once a day, for a few minutes before they’re all scooped up, Walmart is selling the NES Classic on its website starting at 5PM ET. The company says it will do so until November 18th. Today marked the first day of the flash sale, and Walmart’s stock was depleted in just minutes. So that means come tomorrow, have your fingers ready to refresh this product page until it gives you the option to add the NES Classic to your shopping cart. If you’re lucky, the mini-console and its 30 pre-loaded Nintendo games will be yours for a mere $60. - Via: VentureBeat - Source: Walmart.com Next Up In Gaming This Google-powered AI can identify your terrible doodles Super Mario Run is launching on December 15th for $9.99 Some 'Enhanced' games are having frame rate issues on the PS4 Pro How much should the Nintendo Switch cost?

Published on November 15, 2016. Most Popular Forget the U.S. election results, post-Brexit anxiety or other uncertainties. It's the season for a battle of the brands to make the most compelling holiday video of the year. Nowhere is this more true than in Britain. "Buster The Boxer," John Lewis's just-released Christmas ad, was this week's top viral video with 137.2 million views. The ad features wild animals jumping on a backyard trampoline while Buster, a house dog, looks on and decides to copy them. Rival Marks & Spencer's "Love Mrs. Claus" campaign video came in a distant second with 12.2 million views. The effort breaks new ground with its depiction of an empowered, tough-as-nails Mrs. Claus, played by British actress Janet McTeer. The video portrays Mrs. Claus jetting off in a helicopter to make a last-minute gift delivery for a young girl. The two British blockbuster holiday ads beat out other newcomers to this week's list, including campaigns from Starbucks, Trivago and Walmart. Meanwhile, last week's fifth-place video from Samsung featuring an education program held its spot. The Viral Chart, courtesy of Visible Measures, uses both "organic" unpaid views and paid ad placements during the week through Sunday.

The Marysville Police Officers Association will run their second annual coat drive on Nov. 18 and 19 while another local union from the Marysville Fire District finished their own coat drive this November as well. Police Officers Coat Drive Marysville police officers will be collecting coats and cold-weather clothing on Nov. 18, at Fred Meyer, from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., and Nov. 19, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., at the Marysville Walmart. This is the second year they will be out collecting. Last year they gathered around 300 coats and hundreds of hats and gloves as well. "We hope to at least match last year, although I hope to do a couple hundred more coats," said Chris Jones, a Marysville police officer and the secretary of the Marysville Police Officers Association. Jones said more organizations are involved this year that are helping to get the word out. They are also collecting at two stores instead of one. Last year the Walmart was running out of coats by the end of the drive, he said. Jones said that the drive is a good way for officers to be involved in the community. "We try to look at where there's a need and not just a want, and we know there's a lot of need for basic necessities for some families," he said. "We feel like this is a great way to give back to them," he said. The coats collected by the police officers are given out at the Marysville Toy Store, which provides toys and other items to low-income families in December during the holidays. "Being a part of the toy store we were able to meet, not so much the kids, but many of the parents there and the community," he said. Jones hopes that the coat drive also helps local residents see the police as part of the community as well. "We work hard at our job, but we also want to work hard in the community," he said. Coats for Kids Local 3219, the Marysville Fire District's firefighter union, has participated in Coats for Kids for the last four years and handed out their coats on Nov. 9 this year. This year 93 kids from five first-grade classes from Liberty Elementary received coats as part of the program. The coat drive, which many firefighter unions participate in, started on the east coast but has come to Washington in recent years. File Photo Marysville police officer Chris Jones is at the Grove Church on Nov. 30, 2015 where the Marysville Police Officers Association stored coats, hats and gloves collected during last year's coat drive. The idea "stuck with the local firefighter community. It's one of those ways that we can give back to the community," said Jason Tucker, president of the local 3219 union. Local firefighters collect donations as part of the drive and allocate some of their own funds as well. Afterward they go out to local schools to collect measurements and go out to buy coats for the kids, said Tucker. "We love the aspect of giving back to these kids and helping them," he said. They try and target lower-income schools such as Tulalip Elementary, Shoultes Elementary and Liberty Elementary, he said, and kids have the option to opt-out if they already have a suitable coat. "I think it's important for those parents that don't have adequate resources," said Tucker. "I've seen kids that show up on a winter day and don't have a coat or just have a worn-down hand-me-down coat," he said.

A member of loss prevention for Walmart contacted authorities concerning surveillance footage that captured a suspected shoplifter. The employee observed the suspect putting a number of items into a shopping cart and walked out of the store without paying for them. Once outside, the suspect was confronted and ran off leaving the items behind.  If located, Walmart does not wish to press charges. If you have any information regarding the identity of this suspect, please contact the Columbia County Sheriff's office at 706-541-2800. Copyright 2016 WFXG. All rights reserved.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Salvation Army begins holiday campaigns Tuesday Nov 15, 2016 at 11:48 AM Nov 15, 2016 at 11:48 AM By Jason JordanThe Evening Tribune HORNELL — There’s an ever-present need for human services in the Hornell area, providing food, shelter and monetary aid to the working poor. When people need help, especially during the holiday season, one of the sources they most commonly turn to is the Salvation Army. In Hornell, the organization is serving nearly 1,950 families a month, between all of its functions — a number on par with the same time last year. Holiday organizing began on Saturday, with the Boy Scout “Scouting for Food” drive, but it does not end there. The annual Red-Kettle campaign will kick-off on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at Walmart in Hornell and Cy’s Shurfine in Arkport and Canisteo. “I’m always in the market for bell ringers,” said Hornell Site Director Gary Miles. Other sites like Save-A-Lot in Hornell may be added the the Red Kettle lineup as needed. “This is our main fundraiser. This is the money we use to do what we do, it supplies our food bank, it does our rent and utility assistance,” Miles said. “This is the big one for us.” While need declined for part of the year, it’s back this holiday season with a vengeance. “The need is there. It seems like the last few week that we’ve been getting a lot of clients back that we haven’t seen in a few months, and we’ve had a few back that we haven’t seen in a couple of years, so the need may be growing as we speak,” Miles explained. The programs are a hand-up, and not a hand-out for people, according to the Site Director. “We try to limit the times that they can come and try to encourage them to apply for job openings. When we do things like utility assistance we ask ‘How are you going to take care of this next month?’, because we can’t do it every month,” he described. Keeping in touch with other service organizations also assures that donations are used efficiently. “We have good working relationship with Turning Point and with Sister Susan in Canisteo so we don’t duplicates services. We share lists, and talk about things and refer people to different places depending on their need,” he said. The Salvation Army maintains a working relationship with local employers like Walmart, pointing clients in t he right direction. A generous community has filled the need so far in Miles’ tenure. The organization has consistently met its goals. “I’ve been here for four years, and every year it’s increased, so when this community knows there’s a need, they meet the need,” he said. Help often comes from local churches, but new organizations are pitching in all the time, including the Hornell High School’s staff, which will form a group of bell ringers for the first time. “The community always helps us out, and last year they floored me. I think our goal was $30,000 and I think we made $35,000. They’ve always surprised me, always come through, and always worked with us.” The hard part about organizing, according to Miles, is getting the word out there that the need continues. “We had a period where it dropped off some, but the last couple of months, the numbers have gone back up and we’re running about the same we did last year for some reason,” he said. A rash of recent hiring at Alstom and Walmart in the city may have made a temporary dent in the needy population. To assure that the Salvation Army can fulfill its mission, the goal for the Red Kettle Campaign this year is set at $32,000. “I think we can manage that,” Miles said. Whether or not they hit the mark, that is the number the operating budget is depending on. Donations of turkeys and other food items for Christmas dinners, and toys are also being accepted now, as well as donations of time from volunteers.

(AP) - Two former security workers at a Rhode Island Wal-Mart say in federal lawsuits filed against the retailer that they were victims of racial discrimination. Robert McCutcheon and James Braddock worked as "asset protection associates" at the Providence store. They tell The Providence Journal (http://bit.ly/2ftRzN1 ) that they loved their jobs, and saw room for advancement and long-term careers. The men, who are both black, allege they were called "gangstas" by their supervisors, subjected to racial stereotypes, sent into largely minority neighborhoods to retrieve shopping carts, and denied promotions based on race. They are seeking unspecified damages and are asking the court to find Wal-Mart in violation of state fair employment laws and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act. A Wal-Mart spokesman said the company denies the allegations and does not tolerate discrimination.

(AP) — Two former security workers at a Rhode Island Wal-Mart say in federal lawsuits filed against the retailer that they were victims of racial discrimination. Robert McCutcheon and James Braddock worked as "asset protection associates" at the Providence store. They tell The Providence Journal (http://bit.ly/2ftRzN1 ) that they loved their jobs, and saw room for advancement and long-term careers. The men, who are both black, allege they were called "gangstas" by their supervisors, subjected to racial stereotypes, sent into largely minority neighborhoods to retrieve shopping carts, and denied promotions based on race. They are seeking unspecified damages and are asking the court to find Wal-Mart in violation of state fair employment laws and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act. A Wal-Mart spokesman said the company denies the allegations and does not tolerate discrimination. ___ Information from: The Providence Journal, http://www.providencejournal.com Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Egyptian cotton concerns tip Welspun India into loss By Reuters Published: 07:23 EST, 15 November 2016 | Updated: 07:23 EST, 15 November 2016 e-mail By Zeba Siddiqui MUMBAI, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Welspun India said it had acted to address concerns over the quality of its Egyptian cotton as the departure of two major U.S. customers over the issue led to a quarterly loss. The bedding and towel maker also warned on Tuesday of muted revenue growth next year after Target Corp and the world's largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc said they would stop buying its Egyptian cotton products. Target alleged in August that Welspun had passed off cheap sheets as premium Egyptian cotton. Egyptian cotton uses high-end fibre, and hence sells at a premium to regular cotton. Chairman B.K. Goenka said that while the contribution of Egyptian cotton had fallen to 3 percent of Welspun's total revenue, nearly half of last year, as a result of the quality issue, the firm has no plans to exit the business. Goenka said the fault with the cotton products supplied to Target was due to "a complex supply chain" that Welspun is now working on simplifying by bringing it in-house rather than outsourcing. "The outsourcing has helped us meet our volume requirement ... however, the increasing complexity of our supply chain has presented a challenge toward tracking and traceability," Goenka said. He said consultancy EY had completed an audit and Welspun is implementing suggested remedial measures to its supply chain. "This is opportunity for us to improve our processes across our products," Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala said. LAWSUIT PROVISION Welspun said it had been in touch with all its clients about the Egyptian cotton quality issue. With the exception of Target, which said in August that it had severed all ties with Welspun, the rest of its clients planned to continue working with the company, Goenka said. Those include the U.S. retailers JC Penney and Bed Bath & Beyond, which conducted their own audits of Welspun. Welspun reported a consolidated net loss of 1.48 billion rupees ($21.87 million) for July-Sept, as against a profit of 1.79 billion rupees a year earlier. It also took a provision of about 5 billion rupees to cover costs related to the Egyptian cotton issue, and any costs that may result from U.S. lawsuits. Wal-Mart was sued last week on behalf of consumers who alleged the retailer sold products falsely labelled "100% Egyptian Cotton" from Welspun for many years after it first became suspicious about the quality of their fibre. Welspun's stock price is down 42 percent since August, and closed down 4.47 percent on Tuesday, after falling as much as 10 percent earlier in the day.

Michael A. Barlow pleaded guilty in Kingston's Ontario Court of Justice to one count of vandalism, theft of gasoline, night prowling at the Village Green Apartments near the Kingston Centre, two counts of illegally possessing methamphetamine and subsequently violating bail, which forbid him possessing or consuming street drugs. He was given enhanced credit on 14 days of pretrial custody and sentenced to time served. Justice Allan Letourneau was told that Barlow was initially charged on Sept. 28 after a man who'd parked at the 700 Sir John A. Macdonald Blvd. apartment complex returned to his car just before 5:30 a.m and found Barlow underneath it working with tools. Assistant Crown attorney John Skoropada said the surprised owner asked him what he was doing and Barlow replied, "working on my car," at which point the real owner of the silver Dodge called Kingston Police. Officers arrived just in time to catch Barlow pulling out in his SUV, Skoropada told the judge, and immediately detected a strong smell of gasoline emanating from inside his vehicle. It was only later discovered, according to the Crown prosecutor, that two other vehicles parked on the property had small, freshly punched holes in their gas tanks. Barlow was arrested on the spot and, when searched incident to arrest, was found to be in possession of 0.37 grams of methamphetamine. He was then released on bail, but on Oct. 3, five days after his initial arrest, federal Crown prosecutor Chantal Proulx said, Barlow again drew police attention, this time with his driving. She told Justice Letourneau an officer was patrolling on Montreal Street, travelling south when he saw Barlow's vehicle ahead of him swerve twice. He consequently pulled it over and she said the constable, upon approaching the driver's side, immediately noticed numerous empty baggies littering its interior; a number of tools, including bolt cutters, lying loose on the floor; and a Pepsi can that he suspected was a fake used to hide valuables. Further investigation, she said, discovered a hypodermic containing 0.3 grams of liquid methamphetamine in the rear of the vehicle, which was a direct violation of one of Barlow's release conditions. Barlow told Justice Letourneau: "I know I did wrong." But he said he's been desperate since losing his job. He claimed he "has bipolar depression," and has been turned down for every form of social assistance since losing his job. Justice Letourneau, in pronouncing sentence, commented on the danger of his particular criminal enterprise. He told Barlow he would have thought puncturing gas tanks to siphon gas risked causing an explosion. And if his circumstances really are as desperate as he claims, the judge told Barlow: "I would hope you wouldn't add crystal meth to that equation." syanagisawa@postmedia.com Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » Real Estate Magret and Richard Paudyn Golf Courses Belle Park Fairways Boats & Watercraft City of Kingston Marinas Go to the Marketplace » Local Businesses Advertise with us Contribute Send Your Scoop!

The expiration of Walmart Distribution Center’s 10-year Enterprise Zone property tax abatement means a 5.71 percent increase to the EAV in the district. That number has been stagnant in recent history, so a bump such as this doesn’t happen often. How rarely does it happen? “Never,” Tim Schwingle, the district’s director of finances, said with a laugh. “It’s been a long, long time – 10 to 15 years maybe – since it’s gone up that much.” Wednesday night, the school board will recommend levying $12.175 million for the 2016 levy year. The preliminary levy will be on file 30 days before the board will vote to adopt it at its December meeting. It will also vote on approving $333,333.33 to pay down its bond and interest levy. If that’s approved, the owner of a $90,000 home would see about $66.57 come off the school district portion of his or her taxes in 2017. “Not a huge amount, we understand,” Superintendent Tad Everett said. “But in this environment, when you look at other taxing bodies in neighboring communities, and even locally, where we’re not getting any funding increase from the state of Illinois, other bodies are really raising our tax rates.” The levy extension’s increase of $215,000 is 4.84 percent more than last year’s. The district gets between $1.5 million and $1.6 million in extra revenue from the 1 percent sales tax bump Whiteside County voters approved in November 2014. While pitching the tax bump to its residents, Sterling school district officials said they’d use a portion of the added revenue to abate $1 million in taxes over the next 4 years. The state’s budget quagmire prevented that plan taking effect last year. “Because of the governor’s threat or option to freeze property taxes across the state, had we reduced our tax rate at that time, it would have been extremely detrimental, due to the funding formula for schools,” Everett said. Tax abatement is one of the district’s chief financial goals, along with maintaining a balanced budget, which it had done 4 years running, meeting short-term facility needs, planning for long-term facility needs and lowering the overall tax rate. Residents can rest assured that there is no “gotcha” moment coming down the pike, Schwingle said. “This isn’t one of those, ‘Oh yeah, it will come down, but next year, they’ll jack it right back up.’ Our long-term projections show that our rate will remain this low, or maybe even decrease in the future. “Even when the abatement process goes away, it should be this low or lower in the future.” WHAT'S AN EAV? The equalized assessed value, or EAV, is the result of applying the state equalization factor to the assessed value of a parcel of property.

Welspun India has taken a hit of Rs 501 crore on its books as a result of the scandal that led to global retailers like Target, Wal-Mart and Bed Bath & Beyond discontinuing sales of the home textile maker's Egyptian cotton products. To arrest the damage caused to its brand and goodwill, the company has decided to stop outsourcing Egyptian cotton products and will now manufacture them in its own facilities in India. The entire issue, according to B K Goenka, chairman, Welspun Group, revolved around traceability of Egyptian cotton and not on the quality, safety or usability. "We have taken a one-time hit of Rs 501 crore in the second quarter as a result of this issue. We believe, this provision is sufficient to cover all the likely costs. Due to this unforeseen event, we are likely to see a muted revenue growth in FY'17 as against our initial guidelines," said Goenka. While the company had appointed consultancy firm EY to review and identify improvements in the supply chain, the senior management also engaged with all its customers / stakeholders over the last two months proactively and addressed their concerns. Post the review, the company is now taking steps that are aimed to reinstill confidence in the market. "Being a vertically integrated manufacturer, we are moving towards making all Egyptian cotton products – from cotton to finished products – in-house. Going forward we will not outsource any intermediate products for Egyptian cotton and deploy dedicated resources in Egypt for its sourcing while also increasing third-party assurances for the products. We are also working towards using cutting-edge radio frequency identification device (RFID) technology to improve traceability of materials," he said, adding that this move will significantly reduce manual intervention in the company's supply chain processes. The company has also put together a five-point programme (five pillars of growth) to meet its target of $2 billion revenue with 20% contribution – it currently contributes 5% to the total revenues – from the domestic market by 2020. The management will also be working towards becoming a zero net debt company which currently stands at Rs 2,500 crore. While the company's revenue for the second quarter ended September 30 grew 22% to Rs 1,790 crore from the year-ago period, it reported a consolidated net loss was Rs 147.52 crore in the second quarter. It had posted a net profit of Rs 179.37 crore in the same period of last financial year. Current revenue for half year of this fiscal grew 18% to Rs 3,383 crore. In another development, the company's Board also approved a capital investment of Rs 600 crore in flooring solutions i.e. manufacturing of world class carpets, rugs, etc. This investment, Goenka said, will be done over 18 months spread over FY18 and FY19 and will benefit from synergies arising from the company's existing product line and customer base. "The state-of-the-art flooring solutions facility will be set up at our existing manufacturing location in Anjar (Kutch, Gujarat) with a capacity of 7 million square metre annually. The funding will be done through a mix of internal accruals and debt," said Goenka.

Kroenke out as Maryland Heights goes back to drawing board on floodplain project By Jacob Barker St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jacob Barker 1 hr ago (…) This farm field is part of what Maryland Heights officials call the "Maryland Park Lake District." Developers hoping for TIF incentives from the city will now have to convince a county commission that their project will benefit the entire county, not just Maryland Heights. Photo by J.B. Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com MARYLAND HEIGHTS • Alan Bornstein and investment partner Stan Kroenke have dropped a proposal to develop 1,800 acres of flood plain in this West County suburb, and the city is stepping back to draw up plans and solicit proposals for a project it hopes will be a regional entertainment destination. “Mr. Bornstein has picked up his sticks and gone home,” Maryland Heights Councilman Ed Dirck said during a special meeting to update officials on the project Tuesday evening. “We’re starting from scratch.” It could be a year or more before officials open up another request for proposals from developers interested in building on the prime real estate. In the meantime, city planners will be filling in more details of the kind of amenities and proposals they expect while also hashing out a plan with the levee district to finance the stormwater infrastructure needed before anyone breaks ground. “This is not about the next Walmart,” Maryland Heights Community Development Director Wayne Oldroyd said. Instead, he envisions a regional draw with the type of entertainment and cultural attractions that bring money into the region’s economy instead of moving sales tax dollars from one municipality to the next. The stormwater management plan on the low-lying land should become an amenity that enhances the area, he said, drawing comparisons to San Antonio’s River Walk. “That’s what the region needs is a regional attraction,” Oldroyd told the Post-Dispatch. “Certainly, St. Louis city has some of that, but where else are you going to get 2,000 acres?” So far, Maryland Heights has been somewhat disappointed in the proposals it has drawn. Several developers submitted plans, but they were for smaller projects and haven’t fit in with the area’s plan. The city’s planning commission has rejected a conceptual development plan from Altus Properties for market-rate apartments, and it has hinted it’s not in favor of a plan for warehouses from Panattoni Development.

Now, with the city preparing to put together a plan detailing exactly what it wants to see, it seems the developer that drew the most interest — the man who moved St. Louis’ football franchise to Los Angeles — isn’t waiting around. Oldroyd said Bornstein and Kroenke or another investor could still respond to a request for proposals in a year or so, and he expects many major regional developers will. But he said the hope is to draw interest nationally. To do that, however, the city and the Howard Bend Levee District have to come up with a plan to pay for stormwater management. Dan Human, Howard Bend’s director, said the levee will be “pleased to work with the city on their planning efforts.” Oldroyd indicated a large tax-increment financing district or other development tool will probably be needed to help pay for infrastructure. He suggested the city begin meeting with school and fire districts that would be forgoing new property taxes in order to keep them in the loop early on. “We need infrastructure, and we’re going to have to look at incentive processes to get it done,” Oldroyd said.

Active-wear is a port in the storm. By Alex Eule Nov. 15, 2016 5:22 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large ENLARGE Lululemon has improved its customer experience and its online sales, both key ingredients in fighting off Amazon.com Illustration: Getty Images Is traditional retail becoming obsolete in the era of Amazon.com? The e-commerce giant has become a serious threat to retail stocks. Macy’s shares have been cut in half since mid 2015, for instance. And Wal-Mart was forced to spend $3 billion to acquire Jet.com, in order to fight off Amazon’s incursion. And the pain goes far wider. Barron’s recently spoke with retail expert Dana Telsey, who runs a boutique investment firm called Telsey Advisory Group. She’s cautious about overall holiday sales, but she sees pockets of strength, including home improvement retailers, cosmetics shops, and stores that specialize in athletic apparel. Atop Telsey’s list of recommendations is Lululemon Athletica, a member of the Barron’s Next 50. Says Telsey: “It has tackled past inventory woes, improved its customer experience and online sales, and strengthened profit margins. And the company fuels growth with innovative products.” And yet, Lululemon shares are down 30% in the last three months. The stock now looks relatively inexpensive -- based on its earnings potential -- at least compared to how it’s traded in the past.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 16, 2016 -- 01:16 GMT (17:16 PST) | Topic: Mobility Like fellow PC manufacturers Dell and HP, Samsung's online store has Black Friday deals of its own. Electronics giant Samsung joins rival hardware manufactures like Dell, HP, and even Microsoft who are not content to have their PCs sold on Black Friday just by their retail partners. Instead, they want their own online stores in on the shopping madness. Samsung has just posted a preview of its upcoming deals, but is it worth buying directly from the source? In a few cases, it appears that the answer is "no". Many of the sale prices on its Galaxy Tab tablets are the same that we've seen, and in some cases, chains are offering even lower prices. For example, BJ's Wholesale has the 7-inch Galaxy Tab A for $10 less on Black Friday than Samsung is advertising ($99.99) -- and even throwing in a 16GB microSD card, which the Galaxy manufacturer isn't matching. No retailer is putting the breadth of Galaxy slates on sale like Samsung.com, however, so it may be the only place where you can score some savings on the giant Galaxy View with a 18.4-inch display ($399.99 for 32GB version starting on November 18). A similar scenario occurs with the Chromebook 3, which Samsung is touting at a $149.99 price point, but Walmart is selling it for just $119 and even Best Buy undercuts Samsung's direct price by $10. Again, you may have better luck with Samsung's Windows laptops, if for no other reason than we haven't seen them on sale in other Black Friday ads thus far. For instance, its budget-friendly Notebook M with Intel Celeron N3060 processor, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of solid-state storage, and 11.6-inch screen receives a $50 price trim for Black Friday to $399.99, the same discount as the more robust Notebook 3 with Intel Core i5 CPU, 4GB of memory, terabyte hard drive, and full HD 15.6-inch display. Samsung also has some deals on its more stylish laptops. The Notebook 7 spin is a 2-in-1 available in 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch sizes, both of which are on sale for Black Friday. At $649 the 13.3-inch Notebook 7 spin with Core i5, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive, and full HD rotating touchscreen receives a $150 discount, while the bigger version is offered in two different configurations (also $150 off), both with Core i7 and terabyte hard drive.

Operation Christmas Child collects more than 1,750 boxes from Liberty students Following Liberty University’s Operation Christmas Child (OCC) Blitz Week, more than 1,750 boxes full of toys, school supplies and hygiene products were filled by students and faculty at Liberty for children across the world. With OCC Blitz week at an end, the chapter is now preparing to send those boxes to North Carolina to be processed and distributed. While the goal was not met, the OCC chapter president at Liberty University has a smile on her face. “We were ecstatic,” OCC student President Taylor Frost said. “The fact that so many children are going to receive gifts and the gospel makes my heart full.” The goal for the chapter this year was to raise 3,000 boxes for the children. Even though the amount was not met, Frost said the number of people that participated this year made her extremely happy. GIVE — Liberty students filled shoeboxes with items to be shipped to children in third-world countries for Christmas. Photo Credit: Amber Tiller “Students got their boxes and went straight to get the supplies,” Frost said. “Wal-Mart and Dollar General had backed-up lines all night (Wednesday, Nov. 2).” While the checkout lines were being filled, Frost said how enjoyable it was to see Liberty work together on this project. “We’ve noticed this year, being our third year (as a club), that usually three to five students partner together to pack a box, Frost said. “We love seeing LU come together for this cause. It gets everyone in the Christmas mood.” Liberty’s OCC chapter is not yet done collecting shoeboxes, however. Nov. 14-21 is national collection week, and Frost wants to make sure students know they still have time to turn in a box. As of November 6, Frost said they are still collecting shoeboxes at the school of aviation. All the shoeboxes will be collected and sent to a processing plant in order to ensure all items are able to be shipped and are packed correctly. After leaving the processing plant, they will be delivered to children. Ciara Craddock, a global studies student, took part in this experience last year in Senegal, Africa where she handed out the boxes that were collected. “I have to say it was incredibly humbling to hand out those boxes,” Craddock said. “The children were so incredibly thankful, and these boxes are filled with items that are a true blessing — things that are needed like a toothbrush, but also things that bring joy, like a small toy or stuffed animal.” Craddock was doing her internship in Africa. She spoke about the expressions on the children’s faces when they got their box. “I can’t even think about how the children responded without tears coming to my eyes,” Craddock said. “They would stand up, hold the box above their head, smile and just start screaming with joy.” Craddock also said it was incredible seeing the shoebox ministry come to life. She said she has always filled a shoebox every year, but that year, she felt “honored to give those boxes out.” “Every year my brothers and I each fill up a shoe box around Christmas time, spend maybe $10 on each box and then pray over them before we turn them in,” Craddock said. “Honestly, I don’t think much of it after that point. It was amazing to hand the box to a child knowing that I’m not just handing them a box full of coloring books, crayons and toothpaste, but I am handing them a box that had been prayed over by people all over the world.” The change that Craddock saw in this not only changed her mind on the boxes, but she went as far to say that it changed something in her. “I saw that this ministry really does impact and change someone’s life,” Craddock said. “Sure, we can talk about it and say it all we want. But when you physically see the crowds of people, the children’s smiles, and the way that it actually meets a need that otherwise wouldn’t be met, there’s nothing like it. It changes your perspective on life, and it changed me.” ROBERTSON is a news reporter.   Christmas Cheer, Christmas Child. Bookmark.

Published Nov 15th, 2016 6:42 pm gjared@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Diana Smith never realized when she started college she would become a trend setter. The biology and pre-med student at Arkansas State University chose a field that requires heavy doses of math and science classes. Many girls decide to avoid science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers when they attend college. The Arkansas STEM Coalition and Wal-Mart Stores have teamed to recruit 5,000 volunteer mentors in the state to encourage more girls to go into these disciplines, Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin told Talk Business & Politics. Griffin and others spoke at an event Tuesday on the ASU campus in hopes of enlisting local schools to the cause. “The types of jobs we want to recruit to the state are high paying and sustainable … many are STEM based,” Griffin said. “We have to train more STEM workers in Arkansas. It’s that simple.” Upon graduation, about one out of every two male high school students at least considers a career path associated with STEM, Griffin said. Only one out of every nine girls considers such a path, he said. Arkansas is desperate for workers with those skills, so it’s obvious where state leaders need to look, he said. Griffin has toured the state this year as part of the national Million Women Mentors movement. The goal is to enlist 1 million mentors nationwide by the end of the year, and 2 million by 2020, Walmart Market Health and Wellness Director Suzanne Hightower said. In Arkansas, 2,500 have signed up so far, she said. Walmart employs 18,000 pharmacists and optometrists and pharmacies are one of the few science-based businesses dominated by women, she said. Mentors are required to spend at least 20 hours a year encouraging females about the virtues of a STEM education, she said. Mentors are also required to attend at least one STEM-related program a year. Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin spoke at an event Tuesday on the Arkansas State University campus in hopes of enlisting local schools to help encourage more females to enter STEM fields. Mentoring can start in middle school and can last until the student reaches the career stage, officials said. Students from Nettleton, Blytheville, and Hoxie attended the meeting on the ASU campus. The goal is to sign school and other organizations up for the program, and then have them identify and recruit mentors and mentees, Hightower said. Arkansas STEM Coalition Director Dr. Suzanne Mitchell the 150 or so people in attendance the goal is to make Arkansas’ workforce competitive on a global scale. Females are often not as confident as males when it comes to careers in these disciplines, and it’s a pattern that must change if the state is going to remain economically viable, she said. “Arkansas is building a robust STEM pipeline,” she said. The problems are not just in the high school system. Many female students who begin STEM-related majors as freshman dropout of the programs within the first year or two, said ASU College of Science and Mathematics Associate Dean Dr. Anne Grippo. To combat this problem, the university has instituted an in-house mentor program to help keep these female students on the right path, she said. Jobs in these fields are lucrative and employers are more likely to promote a person with a STEM background than ones from other educational and work disciplines, Griffin said. His neighbor, and former babysitter for his children, got a degree as a pharmacist and received a job offer of almost $150,000 upon graduation, Griffin said. The money and opportunities maybe plenty, but the work is exhaustive, Smith reiterated. “A lot of students don’t want to go into STEM because it’s hard. … It is hard,” Smith said. “But, you can do anything you put your mind too.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 0shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

Commander of the Bluefield Salvation Army Lt. Howard Hoffman said the need for volunteers is greater this year than ever before.   Hoffman said, "Without personnel, we cannot put someone at a location.  There will just be an empty spot and when there's an empty spot that means no funds will be collected at that particular location." Wyatt is 1 of only 4 volunteers and after Black Friday, they will have 13 locations where they will need bell ringers.   Wyatt said, "I want to encourage everyone who will come out to volunteer."   Hoffman says volunteers would work anywhere between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.  The bell ringers will be out 6 days a week.  The campaign runs through December 24, 2016. Last year they were able to raise $60,000 and Hoffman hopes they will be able to do the same this year.  Anyone who would like to be a volunteer can call the Bluefield Salvation Army at 304-327-7411.   WeatherMore>> GO / View Larger >> 7 Day Forecast School Closings Predictor WVNS-TV P.O.

(Photo courtesy Davin Brandt) A recent $75,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation will help expand the St. Paul Community Ambassadors Initiative. The city of St. Paul, its police department and community leaders started the program in 2013 in response to youth crime spikes. Community ambassadors, who have experience working with young people, spend time on the streets with the aim of diverting youth from risky behaviors and helping them find jobs with community services. After the first year of the program, juvenile arrests were 63 percent lower than the previous year at the locations and times the ambassadors were working, according to the police department. The same trend continued the next year. Mayor Chris Coleman announced in his August budget address that $150,000 in permanent funding and $50,000 in one-time resources would go to the program in 2017.

The company also plans to spend Rs600 crore over 18 months spread over financial year 2018 and 2019 to make carpets and rugs. Mumbai: Welspun India Ltd, which saw clients such as Target Corp. cut ties with the company for inaccurate labelling of its bedsheets, said on Tuesday that the issue was not about quality but traceability of the cotton it sourced because of the complex nature of the supply chain. “The textile industry has become very fragmented. This resulted in the need to source from various suppliers. As a result, our supply chain had become complex and this provided a challenge for tracking and traceability,” B.K. Goenka, chairman of Welspun Group, told reporters in Mumbai. US retailer Target Corp. snapped ties with Welspun, alleging that the Indian textile manufacturer had passed off inexpensive sheets as made of premium Egyptian cotton for two years. Welspun is moving towards making all its Egyptian cotton products in-house, Goenka said. The company has taken a one-time charge of Rs501 crore in the fiscal second quarter to provide for all the likely costs. These costs do not account for liabilities that may arise because of the three suits filed against the company in the US, said Goenka. Speaking about clients terminating contracts, Goenka said that the company continues to work with all its top clients, except for Target. Its other clients such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. have only terminated its Egyptian cotton contracts and continue to work with the firm. Egyptian cotton accounted for 6% of its overall revenue and is now at 3-5% of its overall revenue, said Rajesh Mandawewala, managing director of Welspun Group. Earlier, a “significantly large” part of its Egyptian cotton manufacturing was outsourced from close to 30 different vendors, Mandawewala said, explaining that the inputs now will have third-party assurances such as Gold Seal from Cotton Egypt Association, vendor audits and DNA tests. The company is also putting in place systems like radio frequency identification to be able to trace back all its products from cotton to finished products, said Mandawewala, explaining that the one-time charge will include these expenses. The company also plans to spend Rs600 crore over 18 months spread over financial year 2018 and 2019 to make carpets and rugs. These initiatives will help it meet is 2020 objective of being a $2 billion textiles business with zero net debt. However in the interim the company will have a muted growth in fiscal 2018 as against the initial guidance, said Goenka. As of September quarter, the company’s debt stood at Rs2,500 crore. In the September quarter, Welspun reported a loss of Rs147.52 compared to a net profit of Rs179.37 crore a year-ago. However sales continue to grow. Net sales grew 19% to Rs1,575.71 crore in September quarter from Rs1,327.76 in the year-ago quarter. To be sure, the stock has already regained most of its lost market capitalization. Since 22 August when the news first emerged of Target terminating its business relationship with it the stock lost 43% to Rs46.75 up to 30 August. From 30 August to till date, the stock gained 33% to Rs62. The company’s credit ratings have also been reaffirmed. On 2 November, India Ratings and Research, a Fitch Group Company reaffirmed Welspun India’s credit rating of “IND AA-/Stable”, the company said in a statement to BSE.

Hatchimals are flying off the shelves.  At big box stores like Target, Walmart and Toys “R” Us, the toy retails for just under $50.  But, a check online shows the same message – out of stock. On Amazon, the toy ranges from $190 to as high as $350. On Ebay, one seller offered a single Hatchimal for $600. In our search today, we came up with only one store in this general area with a few Hatchimals. Hobbytown in Fairfield had about two dozen Hatchimals. Today there were only a few left in the store. “The parents are having a rough time trying to find them,” said Celeste Vanderlip, the owner of Hobbytown. “Their child really wants that Hatchimal, it’s the gift at the top of their list that they’re looking for.” To snatch up a Hatchimal at Hobbytown, it costs $149. The owner tells us their price tag reflects the premium they had to pay to find the Hatchimals. More than one small toy store told us that the only the big box stores were getting shipments. “So we got them at a price to be able to sell to our customers so that they don’t have to go on eBay going on the Internet there here it’s that hot gift. We wanted to service our customers.” One parent came in looking for two Hatchimals. He was glad his search could end at Hobbytown. “Oh my God, yeah, I just called,” said Stephen Rilling of Trumbull. “They said they had them and get over here quick.” Here are some tips to make your search for Hatchimals easier. One viewer said to track Target shipments she used the website called Fyndly. About half way down the page there is a spot to put DPCI codes in for the different Hatchimals. Here are some of the codes you can use.  Just put in the numbers. Penguala Pink/Teal    086-08-0395 Penguala Pink/Red    086-08-0897 Draggle Blue/Purple    086-08-0396 Draggle Blue/Green    086-08-0898 Bearakeet Pink/Black   086-08-0899   Next, add your zip and how far you’re willing to drive.  Hit check and you’ll get an idea of who has Hatchimals in stock.  You may want to call in order to double check if the store has Hatchimals. Toys “R” Us tells us, they are getting more shipments of Hatchimals so check their website early in the morning.  When Hatchimals are in stock, the company recommends going to the store first thing in the morning. The toy sells out fast. One Target manager told News 8 that Hatchimals are so hot that parents are lining up outside the store for shipments. The craze is so big that even Spinmaster, the company that makes Hatchimals says it didn’t expect this kind of popularity.  On the website Spinmaster has a message for customers. A Message From Hatchimals The consumer response to Hatchimals has been extraordinary, exceeding all expectations. Some of our first shipments have already sold out. While additional product will hit retail shelves in November, we anticipate this inventory will also sell out quickly. We have increased production and a whole new batch of Hatchimals will be ready to hatch in early 2017. This is a special season and we don’t want anyone to be disappointed, nor do we support inflated prices from non-authorized resellers. We are working on creative solutions to help kids and their parents withstand the wait. In the interim, some retailers are developing pre-sale and/or rain-check programs for redemption in January. We will continue to update with program details as they become available.”   Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

(Photo: Jeff Barron/Eagle-Gazette)Buy Photo 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE LANCASTER -  A familiar holiday sight returns Saturday when the Salvation Army starts its annual red kettle fundraising event. The Salvation Army will have bell ringers who collect donations at 14 Fairfield County locations, including Walmart, Kroger, Big Lots and Hobby Lobby stores, along with the River Valley Mall. The campaign will end on Christmas Eve. The Salvation Army hosted a campaign kick-off breakfast Tuesday at the Lancaster Country Club, which featured former WCMH TV news anchor Cabot Rea as the keynote speaker. "We have a chance to help encourage others that when they hear the bell they reach into their pocket and put money into the kettle," he said. "It's about providing service to another." Rea also sang "You Raise Me Up" at the end of his talk. The goal in Fairfield County this year is $105,000, after receiving $98,000 in donations last year. "The more successful we are at Christmas, the more we can do throughout the year," local commanding officer Captain Bryan DeMichael said. "It doesn't matter. It could be a penny or a $50 bill. Every little bit helps. One of the great things about the red kettle campaign, it's the community coming together. It's the community saying, 'You know what? We want to do something to help make our community a better place.' So it's everybody coming together to help us make a big difference right here in the county." He said the agency has three key programs it focuses on. One is the Samaritan Center, which is where the Salvation Army daycare program works from. Another is the social ministries program that includes a food pantry, utility assistance and birth certificate assistance. The third program is Bridging the Gap, which is a life skills and mentoring program for at-risk teens. "It started last school year here in the county," DeMichael said of the mentoring program. "And to date, we have a 100-percent success rate of the kids who get referred to our program from Fairfield County Juvenile Court who completes our program and then have no further incidents with the law after that." The bell-ringers are both volunteer and paid staffers. So far DeMichael said he has accounted for 220 volunteer hours already. He said the agency is always looking for volunteers to help out with the 3,500 or so hours he has to fill.

B–Roll Special Report Tow Center The Second Opinion About Us Join Donate Advertise Mailbox Resources b a x Covering the Election Q&A: Chris Arnade on his year embedded with Trump supporters By Chava Gourarie, CJR November 15, 2016 2193 words a Share on Twitter b Share on Facebook Email this story A group of Trump supporters and "Hardee's Breakfast Club" members in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, put the politics talk on hold to pose for Chris Arnade. Chris Arnade has lived in Trump country for much of the last year, sleeping in motels in Midwestern factory towns, talking up old factory hands at restaurants, sharing laments about how the country has gone to shit. The 100,000-mile journey put Arnade—an independent journalist, former Wall Street trader, and a fan of Bernie Sanders—in the position of being less blindsided than most by Trump’s presidential win. His reporting, published in The Guardian, added more nuance to the prototypical Trump supporter profile—the frustrated, high-school educated, white, small-town, rural American voter. What emerges from Arnade’s boots-on-the-ground reporting is an honest look at brewing hate and anxiety while avoiding the think-piece pitfall that treats Trump voters like an anthropological curiosity. It shows communities facing not only economic ruin, but social ruin; not just loss of jobs, but loss of dignity. “The town feels disrupted,” Arnade says of his own hometown in Florida, where orange groves have been replaced by retirement communities. “It feels like there’s no heart anymore.” CJR first spoke with Arnade in June about his travels. We caught up with him this week after the election to help us break down what the media missed about the Trump voter, and where we go from here. The following has been edited for clarity and length.   Since the election, the media has engaged in some self-flagellating over a failure to accurately forecast the outcome, but also of everything we’ve been missing over the last year. Do you think things would have been different with more reporters on the ground? Ultimately, there were people doing that, but it felt very much like parachute journalism. I think people went in with an expectation of what they would find, and they found it. That’s reflective of the fact that they come in from a bubble. The [national] newspapers used to read the wires, read the local papers. If there was a story that was breaking in Alabama, they knew it because they would read all the Alabama papers. The regional papers were the feeder that gave the bigger papers a sense of what was going on, and those papers aren’t there anymore. So there’s this real bubble mentality that the media is in, and it was reflected in the coverage. There was no long-term commitment. [The national reporters] went in with no context, almost like anthropologists going on an expedition. It crept up on people this year, but it’s been out there for years, the sense of a town feeling frustrated and left behind; the loss of town centers; the loss of mills; the loss of factories; the loss of jobs. There just hasn’t been continued reporting on what impact that has had on these communities. The profiles of the white working class that are being done now should have been done five years ago. Why weren’t they done five years ago? Paul, who posed for a photo outside a Dollar Tree in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, told Arnade of his Confederate flag: “I’m proud of Southern heritage. I’m proud of hunting and fishing.” Related: His photos are striking and real. But is Chris Arnade a journalist? A big blind spot has been this tendency to call anyone who voted or supported Trump a racist. Is it that people are simply putting themselves first, rather than actually hating minorities and women? Is there a better way to be addressing this tension? Is a larger segment of Trump voters more viscerally and aggressively racist than the average public? Yeah. But is it the main driving force behind Trumpism? No.  Is it part of his appeal? Yes, very much so. But again, I maintain, if you have a group of white people who are feeling frustrated and humiliated, they are going to be a very easy targets for racial-identity politics. It’s kind of a scam to give them meaning, cheap meaning. Trump has been selling scams all his life. This is no different.   What’s one place that you’ve been that represents the phenomenon of the left-behind white working-class voter? I’ll tell you about Prestonsburg in Floyd County, Kentucky. It’s 3,500 people, all white, a coal industry town and hasn’t had a good run economically in the last 15 years, since coal has tumbled. The town center, which used to be dominated by local businesses in the seventies and eighties is now basically addiction clinics, and the community center is at the Walmart plaza, or McDonald’s, or at the churches. There’s a real strong sense of community, but the entire community is feeling humiliated. The whole town feels like it’s suffering, and with the economic decline has come a large increase in the things that follow: addiction, breakup of families. The place feels very hurt. And in comes Trump with a message of restoring pride—partly through white identity—that resonates there, because from Prestonsburg, Kentucky, America does not seem great.   I feel bad for the people—broadly, the poor, frustrated whites—who voted for him because he’s not going to deliver what they think he’s going to deliver.   My questions to you thus far have been about how the media has reported on this segment of the population, but they’re same American public that the newspapers are supposed to be writing to, not just writing about. Have you seen, or can you see, any way for the media to speak to and for these communities? If I walk up to a group of Trump supporters and I’m carrying The New York Times or the Washington Post—it’s just not going to be considered, it just isn’t valid. There are certain media names that have been so tarnished—I can’t tell you why—tarnished by talk radio, tarnished by Fox, tarnished by politicians for so long. It probably doesn’t help that those same papers run editorials and opinions that are pretty harsh towards the people that are in these communities. These [newspapers] are places that supported free trade, supported social agendas like gay marriage that aren’t necessarily popular in these places, so you know, the editorial side hasn’t really done anything to help these papers gain credibility in these towns.   How bad is the information divide, and the misinformation that’s being spread? It’s gotten further than just a divide; it’s two separate realities now. There are two separate narratives of how things happen. In red states or red communities that voted for Trump, they digest Fox and conservative talk radio… There’s plenty of misinformation too, and you just can’t argue with it. Related: Eight steps reporters should take before Trump assumes office Was there ever a Trump supporter you spoke to who changed their mind about him because of something he said or did? Nobody. Nobody. It was amazing. There was nobody who said I’m out, I’m done, he did blank and I’m over. Nobody. In fact I remember going to a crowd of Trump voters the day after the video was released—the “grab the pussy” one—and they were laughing about it, like “Oh you know, that guy!” And then I remember speaking to a woman a day later in my hometown, Date City, Florida, and she’s like, “Oh men, you’ve got to learn how to fight them off. They’re crazy. That’s men!” I didn’t know what to say to that.   Trump voters Connie and Fiore Napolitano hang out at a roadside hot-dog stand off Montauk Highway in Shirley, New York.  What are some variations on the generic definition we’re giving to the white working class Trump voter? Can you complicate the one-size-fits-all definition? Trump overperformed in communities that were suffering from the decline in industry, in factory jobs, but the people who voted for him were not necessarily directly impacted. So if you’re in a county that has lost a lot of jobs to a factory, and you’re a doctor or a lawyer, you’re still probably going to vote for Trump. It’s very community based; if your community in aggregate has been hurt economically and socially, everybody, rich or poor—if you’re white—is gonna vote for Trump.   Did anyone you met defy the stereotype of the white working-class Trump supporter? One of the things that I wished I had focused more on is the number of white working class men who I would have pegged for a Trump guy—you look at them and they got all the signals—you’re a tired old man in a trucker’s cap, you’ve got your cigarettes, sitting there at the McDonald’s table, drinking your coffee, looking angry. I’m gonna peg you for a Trump guy—there’s one in particular, I’ll never forget, an absolute fan of Bernie Sanders. He called him Old Man Sanders. “I love my old-man Sanders. He talks sense!” I met many of them throughout my trip in the same places; Ohio, West Virginia, so yeah that’s where I was kind of blown away.   As a writer, how have you navigated being able to understand people’s anger but not justify it? Or try to get other people their anger without justifying the accompanying hatred and racism? My pet peeve these days is giving context to everything; trying my best to allow the reader to see the ugliness, but at the same time understand the context for which it might come out of. It’s not a justification per se of that ugliness, just hopefully a way to help people understand what’s the best way to solve it. It’s one thing to call out racism; it should be done. But it’s not clear to me that just calling it out is going to do anything to solve it.   I wonder if you think we need to differentiate between the coverage of Trump, and the coverage of Trump supporters. Trump was and is pretty outrageous, and reporters weren’t necessarily wrong to cover him that way. But did we apply that to the voters too much? I do think the coverage of the supporters was too late, and when it was done it was biased, and eventually it got there. But it went through an ugly period. I went to the GOP convention in Cleveland. There were 2,000 people from the media in Cleveland that week, and I didn’t see any of them. Because I spent my time in the neighborhoods. I split my time between a poor black neighborhood, Central, which was only two miles from where the convention was—you could see the helicopters; the other was a poor, working class white neighborhood called Parma, and I wanted to see. I was talking to voters, not voters who had come down to demonstrate. I was talking to people who were just hanging out in bars and hanging out in McDonald’s. There was too much focus on the machine of politics and not enough on the voters.   This man in Cleveland who gave his name as Jo Jo said he was a strong Trump supporter. A recurring theme in your work, and a common denominator among the places you visit, seems to boil down to anger. Can you elaborate on where that’s coming from? I think the bigger word is humiliation, and how that humiliation ends up getting rendered is different from place to place. But at it’s core it’s about frustration, humiliation, and anomie, which is basically meaninglessness, feeling like not having a place, drifting. How that is expressed is very different based on where you are, and it’s very different based on race. If you’re feeling a sense of meaninglessness and frustration and you’re a black kid in Milwaukee you express it very differently than if you’re a white kid across the park. Also if you’re male or female, and that’s where our racism and sexism come into the dialogue. I don’t think people understood the full anger out there, and when they did they didn’t want to believe it, so the reporting came back was very anthropological—look at these crazy people and their anger.   What was your feeling on election night, having seen so many different sides of this and having met so many people? I wasn’t surprised when he was elected. Did I expect it? No. Was I surprised? No. I kept saying before the election that I don’t know if Donald Trump is going to win this time, but a Trump character will win eventually.  I feel really bad for minorities. I feel awful for them, for the minority communities I spent time in, for places like Milwaukee, Buffalo, Selma, and the Bronx. That was my first reaction. And I feel bad for the people—broadly, the poor, frustrated whites—who voted for him because he’s not going to deliver what they think he’s going to deliver.   What gives you hope? That I personally know that a lot of people who voted for Trump are decent people who I don’t think would let some of the nightmare scenarios happen. I just don’t see the people I know who voted for him being able to let the world go down that path. Has America ever needed a media watchdog more than now? Help us by joining CJR today.

Aviation & Aerospace > General - aero More reports on: M&A, News reports, Airlines, Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire Hathaway takes stakes in four major airlines news 15 November 2016 Berkshire Hathaway's just released SEC filings show that the company had taken a stake in three of the four major airline companies - American Airlines, United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines. However, in an exclusive report  CNBC said that Berkshire had also taken a stake in the fourth major carrier, Southwest Airline. According to commentators the move into airlines comes as rather unexpected investment by Warren Buffett, who had kept away from the industry for decades after the investment he made in US Airways back in 1989 almost immediately dropped in value. By 1995, Berkshire had written down the original $389 million investment to $89.5 million, just 25 cents on the dollar from the original amount. Buffett did make money on the deal in the end, but the experience was enough to sour him on the entire airline industry, something he had frequently written about in his annual letters to shareholders. Meanwhile, Buffett had almost completely divested his Walmart stake. After cutting down some of his stake in the retailer earlier this year, Buffett unloaded Walmart stock by nearly 70 per cent as the discount store announced its controversial deal to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com. Buffett's stake in the retailer is now below $1 billion, down from nearly $3 billion in the middle of this year, according to new securities filings. Walmart stock is now 15 per cent up so far in 2016, but it had begun to falter, with the shares down slightly during the third quarter when Buffett reduced his stake. The stock dropped nearly 5 per cent in the last three months. The legendary  investor had started paring down his Walmart holding a year earlier, when the retail giant lowered its earnings forecast.  search domain-b    go Legal Policy | Copyright © 1999-2016 The Information Company Private Limited.

Some think the end is nigh for gun sales, meaning this could be a great way to prep for the future. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Nov 15, 2016 at 2:21PM You can see where the priorities of Smith & Wesson Holding (NASDAQ:SWHC) now lie. For the third time in five months the gunmaker has bought a company that targets its accessories and outdoors sporting goods business, signalling what direction it needs to go in the future. Smith & Wesson Holding is looking to survive a day when gun sales aren't as robust by buying a survivalist outfit that adds to its extreme outdoors sporting goods portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Survival of the fittest Smith & Wesson announced recently it was buying camping and extreme outdoors equipment maker Ultimate Survival Technologies (UST) for $32 million, with the possibility of $2 million more depending on sales -- a pretty good price considering the outfitter has some $24 million in trailing revenue. The gunslinger dropped $85 million on knife maker Taylor Brands and $95 million on laser sight maker Crimson Trace, but UST Brands is an established name in what some might call a small but fast-growing industry and that gives Smith & Wesson the opportunity to make a mark in the space. According to the gunmaker's release announcing the purchase, the preparedness outfit delivered impressive revenue growth between 2012 through 2015, achieving compounded annual growth rates of 49% following the expansion of its product lines and retail presence. Those interested in preparedness can now even find Ultimate Survival's products for sale at Wal-Mart. Going off-grid It's not easy to peg just what the opportunity is in the survival industry, as those individuals prepping for an uncertain future are likely doing so out of the spotlight while also converting everyday household items to their needs. Yet the popularity of shows like Survivorman, Dual Survivor, and even the extreme Doomsday Preppers, along with personalities such as Les Stroud, Bear Grylls, Cody Lundin, and Dave Canterbury suggest there is an undercurrent of interest in the topic. Image source: Getty Images. Smith & Wesson's entrance into the market has the potential to raise the profile of the industry even further but make it much less extreme sounding. The gunsmith has been looking to put its stamp on the market since it acquired Battenfeld Technologies in 2014 for $130 million. It sees the outdoors sporting-goods market as a means of minimizing the wide swings in performance that occur in the firearms industry. Though the company might be enjoying booming sales at the moment, it probably realizes it's not always going to be the salad days and wants to have something to fall back on in leaner times. Moreover, there is greater opportunity for growth in the broader extreme outdoor-sporting goods market, which is valued at $60 billion, than there is in the U.S. firearms industry, which is roughly a quarter of the size. Going great guns There is something to be said for the diversification. Shares of industry peer Sturm, Ruger (NYSE:RGR) walks nearly in lockstep with Smith & Wesson, yet it doesn't have the same backstop available to it as it sells guns and only guns. A downturn in the gun market or, worse, greater restrictions placed on gun ownership would dramatically hurt sales. As we've seen since the presidential election, where Smith & Wesson's stock has plummeted on the belief that a Donald Trump presidency has taken gun control off the table for the moment, the gunmaker would have another avenue of growth still available to it. Image source: Flickr via Ryan Grimm. Turning its attention to sporting goods would make it more like near-peer Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO), which has dozens of brands in its portfolio, including Bell bicycle helmets, CamelBak water reservoirs, and Tasco binoculars, but also owns Savage Arms, a manufacturer of rifles and shotguns, as well as Federal Premium ammunition. Long-term survival Ultimate Survival Technologies is a respected name in survival, having been around for some 80 years, and brings with it gear like LED lights, all-weather fire starters, signal mirrors, first aid kits, whistles, survival kits, camp kitchen products, and more. Yet as Vista Outdoor has found, industry trends can sometimes lead operations astray. Its fiscal 2017 first-quarter earnings suffered as sales continued to target firearms rather than accessories and gear. When gun sales are hot as they are now, and buyers are falling over themselves to get the latest firearm, retailers aren't going to be pushing accessories when they can make the easy money with a gun sale and quickly move on to the next customer. Having multiple streams of revenue is smart for Smith & Wesson, even if the UST purchase and the survivalist niche aren't make or break for the business. But the gunmaker has indicated it doesn't see its future so much in firearms as it does in sporting goods. Last week it filed a proposal to have shareholders vote on a name change for the company from Smith & Wesson to American Outdoor Brands. That shows it wants the extreme outdoors business to grow from its current level of just 10% of revenue to perhaps account for the majority of them. That's a big change, obviously, and it not only indicates that investors can expect to see a lot more of these types of acquisitions, but also that Smith & Wesson is preparing for its own doomsday when gun sales eventually fall.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Augmented Reality Maps Are Coming To IPhone Posted: Nov 15 2016, 11:36am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     Apple Awarded Patent Which Details Augmented Reality Maps For iPhone Apple has received a new Patent named ‘Augmented Reality Maps.’ This patent gives an immersive navigation feature which will be powered by augmented reality. This feature if ever does reach an iPhone will be incorporated into the Apple Maps app for iOS devices. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock The interesting feature will work when the user will point the camera at their surroundings. The results will show directions and points of interest to be shown on the screen. This is a perfect example of Google’s Street View Navigation concept. The only difference is that live footage will be the substrate. The system will identify the user’s current location and the device direction. After receiving these two inputs it will tilt and will use a simple array of onboard sensors. This will be overlapping the camera’s virtual view finder with certain points of interests such as bus stands etc. The user is allowed to alter the live video to find directions to a location desired by the user. A search bar will appear at the bottom of the viewfinder so that the user can search and navigate his point of interest. This new patent isn’t much of a surprise; we knew rumors were coming in already that Apple was taking interest in the AR/VR field. Nevertheless, the strong competitors of Apple Google and Facebook are more interested in virtual reality. Apple on the other hand is more inclined towards the augmented cousin. The CEO of Apple has shown his interest in the AR market more than we thought this year. It is also rumored Apple might be using an augmented system for a self-driving software. Traditionally Apple does not make use of patents immediately. So we might not be seeing this implemented very soon. This is just still an idea which could prove to be amazing for drivers.

(NYSE: TGT) is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter financial results before the markets open on Wednesday. The consensus estimates call for $0.83 in earnings per share (EPS) and $16.3 billion in revenue. In the same period of last year, the retailer posted EPS of $0.86 and $17.61 billion revenue. This company has started to build smaller stores, to move into cities, but Wall Street does not buy the company’s overall management. Target is often considered Wal-Mart’s smaller brother, the second largest big-box retailer, but one that has struggled. Over the past year, Wal-Mart shares are up 17% and Target has lagged. Target continues to be wedged between the world’s largest retailer on one side and the extraordinarily successful Costco on the other. Retailers have tried to launch stores that are a different size than their traditional ones. As a matter of fact, Wal-Mart did, with little success. Target does not have the brand power that retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon do. Bigger or smaller stores likely won’t solve that problem. A few analysts weighed in on Target ahead of the earnings report: Brean Capital reiterated a Buy rating. Nomura has a Hold rating with a $75 price target. Jefferies has a Hold rating with a $72 price target. Guggenheim has a Neutral rating. Barclays has an Underweight rating with a $60 price target. Credit Suisse has a Neutral rating with a $65 price target. Cowen has a Market Perform rating with a $68 price target. Argus has a Hold rating. So far in 2016, Target has underperformed the broad markets, with the stock down 1.6%. Shares of Target were down about 1% at $71.47 on Tuesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $74.28 and a 52-week trading range of $65.50 to $84.14.

(Neil Nisperos/Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, SCNG) Kimberly McDavis, 42, of Ontario only bought a couple of 10-cent plastic bags at Stater Bros. on Monday. (Neil Nisperos/Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, SCNG) By NEIL NISPEROS / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF ONTARIO With Southern California grocery stores charging for plastic bags — at different rates — following the passage of Proposition 67, reaction was varied Monday as shoppers weighed whether they should just pay for them or do without. Prop. 67, approved by 52 percent of statewide voters Tuesday, went into effect immediately. “I think it’s ridiculous,” said Daniel Poffenberger, 21, Ontario, who was walking into a Stater Bros. on Monday. “I think for people that are middle class, I don’t think it’s right. We pay a good amount of taxes as it is. We shouldn’t be getting charged for stupid, petty things like that. It’s just not fair.” Nearby, Kimberly McDavis, who was loading up her car with groceries, said she only purchased the new 10-cent bags for certain items. McDavis said she supports the change because of environmental benefits. “It is a hassle when you forget your reusable bags and then you’re faced to pay the 10 cents, so I only purchased the two bags for things I knew would roll around in my car versus just the things that wouldn’t, and I didn’t purchase bags for that,” McDavis said. “It makes you more mindful that you don’t forget your reusable bags, so I think a lot of people right now are trying to adjust to that.” Prop. 67 requires stores to charge at least .10 for recycled paper bags and reusable plastic bags. Here’s what consumers are paying for plastic bags: • .10 at Stater Bros. • .10 at Target • .15 at Vons • .15 at Albertsons • .10 at Trader Joes • .10 at Wal-Mart Carlos Illingworth, spokesman for Albertsons, confirmed the higher prices for Vons and Albertsons. They also sell canvas bags for between $1.25 and $2 apiece. “We are focused on helping our customers making this transition, which includes providing them with a wide variety of options to choose from,” Illingworth said. Jennifer Muniz, manager of the Cardenas Market at 1837 E. Fourth St. in Ontario, said bags were still free there and that the company would begin charging between 10 and 15 cents per bag Nov. 18. Target is among retailers now offering new, plastic bags, thicker than the flimsy bags commonly used in California prior to the new law. Text at the bottom of the bag reads, “This Everlasting Bag is designed for at least 125 uses.” “It helps people from throwing their plastic bags out because they have to pay for them and the bags you do get last a whole lot longer,” said Samantha Parker, 28, of Ontario, who was shopping at Stater Bros. on Monday. Target shopper Olivia Gross, 42, of Rancho Cucamonga, said she liked the new bags. “I was for getting rid of the (one-time use) bags,” Gross said. “I think it’s an environmental thing. I like the bags. Ralphs is doing that, too: 10 cents for new bags.” Monrovia-based Trader Joe’s, which had traditionally used thick paper bags, also is now charging 10 cents for its paper bags, but the store offers several reusable bags that are priced from 99 cents to $6.99, the latter featuring a zipper and temperature-stabilizing insulation. “The 99-cent bag is a strong, beautiful bag without insulation, and it doesn’t have a zipper, but it carries bread and nonperishables very well,” Alison Mochizuki, spokeswoman for Trader Joe's said. The California Grocers Association said it was supportive of Prop. 67, which ratifies Senate Bill 270, which banned plastic shopping bags statewide in 2014 but was put on hold when Prop. 67 organizers were able to collect enough signatures to put the matter on the Nov. 8, 2016, ballot. In the meantime, more than 100 municipalities throughout the state enacted their own bans. “Most retailers have stores in multiple counties, so rather than have retailers have to figure whether to send plastic here or paper there, this makes it more consistent,” Dave Heylen, spokesman for the Californa Grocers Association, said. “Plus, it sends a consistent message to the consumers that the entire state is supportive and interested in reducing the use of plastic bags from an environmental standpoint.” Related Links Orange County loves its plastic bags, even though California votes for ban Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Boeing to shift 2,500 jobs away from Huntington Beach, with 1,600 heading to L.A.

Others are quite clear that it is more important than ever to make sure the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is held accountable for the ways in which it has failed to uphold a truly democratic process. After all, when it became clear that the DNC deck was stacked against Sen. Bernie Sanders, the fallout went no further than Debbie Wasserman Schultz and there was no effort to change that. Perhaps even the DNC regrets the way it ignored all the polls that had Sanders defeating the Republican candidate. Still others think it is time to rebuild the Democratic party with progressive leadership and intentions. All of these ideas and more could be given thorough examination. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders on stage at College Green Park in Iowa City. With only four days until Election Day, Sanders encouraged people to vote Clinton. Friday, Nov. 4, 2016. –photo by Zak Neumann. Some of us stood in College Green Park in Iowa City last week and listened as Sanders reminded us that his campaign had served a vital purpose. It had helped to create the most progressive platform that our country has ever seen. Many of us who remain devout Sanders supporters decided to hold our noses and vote for Hillary Clinton, largely because we felt this would be a more socially responsible action than either staying at home or diluting the effort to defeat the Republican candidate. For a long time I had refused to accept Hillary Clinton as a responsible choice. People talked about the level of misogyny they saw reflected in the comments about her. I did not see Clinton’s gender as the issue, I saw her position on the issues as an issue. Imagine, for example, if she had even modestly acknowledged the rights of the Standing Rock Sioux or the abuse of the eminent domain laws on farmland in Iowa. Imagine if she had commented on the threat to the drinking water of millions of people by a leaking oil pipeline. Most of the progressives I have read or talked to could not support her silence. And the lack of trust many of us felt had to do with her affiliations with entities like Monsanto, Wal-mart and the corporations that funded her campaign. But regardless of Clinton’s stance on the issues, I think the real problem lies elsewhere. Who could deny that there are problems within the electoral system in this country? Examples of these problems abound: the unnecessary and corrupt influence of big money, the death of third party options, the specious influence of the electoral college, the failure of the government to fully protect and enforce the Voting Rights Act, voter suppression, gratuitous gerrymandering, illogical voter ID restrictions, the corrosive sway of yellow journalism, the absence of accountability among mainstream media outlets, the failure of our law enforcement or the judicial system to exact due process regarding accusations of rape, financial malfeasance, tax evasion, sexual assault, espionage, threats of violence against other candidates, inciting violence against Mexicans, Blacks, Muslims and women, and much more. These are serious problems. We need expedient and well-coordinated action to build local progressive networks that will help us address these and other problems in the electoral system. To do so goes hand in hand with delivering candidates who are not only willing to listen to and respect the electorate (all of the electorate), but who see that as the most important part of their job. We need alternative choices to Democrats and Republicans who take the votes they get for granted. Progressives must be decisive and determined in making sure we have a well-informed public that can access not only registration and voting venues easily, but also can also enjoy independent forums that educate them about the most pressing social, economic and political issues affecting them. We need progressive coalition politics that offer 21st century platforms — those that are on a par with other advanced western political states. In my view, sustaining any progressive gains of the last 50 years or developing strategies for the 2020 elections means organizing locally. I agree with [Johnson County Supervisor] Mike Carberry when he calls for developing a local coalition that can mobilize at a moment’s notice to support or protest issues, initiative and candidates based on our shared values. Furthermore, if ever there was a time to convene a local progressive summit to discuss and develop our options, that time in now. Let us do so while we still can. As we find out what we are made of in the next few years, I hope we put love and kindness at the center of our efforts to build democracy. I am envisioning a future that is not strangled by the dictates of the super rich. We need a progressive summit that takes as one of its key priorities the restructuring of the electoral process. A summit that seeks to help change political discourse in this country so that it is a true reflection of the needs and ideas of the people.

According to a police affidavit, the victim said she was looking on a shelf when a man, later identified as 28-year-old Tony Smith, walked up behind her, pressed against her and inappropriately touched her.  The victim turned around and yelled at Smith. Surveillance video showed Smith running down the aisle from the victim. Smith is charged with sexual battery. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

By Danielle Tullo Nov 15, 2016 If you're obsessed with wine but stick to affordable bottles because, you know, rent, food, survival, then I have some exciting news! La Moneda Reserva, a fancy AF Chilean Malbec that's won awards for being so delicious, is now available at Walmart for $7. I'll drink (multiple bottles) to that. 🍷🍷🍷. The wine won the award for "Platinum Best in Show" at the 2016 Decanter World Wine Awards in June. Previously, it won a blind taste-test — beating out 16,000 other wines — and was named the "2015 Best Red Single-Varietal Under £15." The takeaway: It's delicious, cheap, and wine experts across the world think it's pretty great. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below La Moneda Reserva was originally sold at Walmart's U.K. business, Asda, and it's finally made its way to the United States. It will be available in more than 500 Walmart stores across the country but only while supplies last, so stock up ASAP — like, before Thanksgiving dinner.

Here's our guide to the best holiday gadgets The 2016 holiday is fast approaching. That means one thing: gadget time. These are the TIME technology team’s suggestions for everything from stocking stuffers, like Nintendo’s NES Classic, to high-end cameras like Fujifilm’s X-T2. Our suggestions are sorted by budget, from least to most expensive. We’ve also included a few lines about why we like each gadget we’ve picked for the list. View as 1 of 45 Replay SHARE KontrolFreek Vortex Thumbstick Grips ($14.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Gamers looking for an edge in the latest shooter. Why we like it: They’re a pair of neon-orange clip-on plastic extensions that make it easier to take down targets with the current or last-gen PlayStation and Xbox controllers. After using them to play games like Overwatch, Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, we’ll never go back. What to know: Purists may consider using these to be cheating. Buy Now Replay SHARE Tile Mate & Slim ($25 for Mate, $30 for Slim) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: That scatterbrain friend or family member who’s always misplacing something. Why we like it: These Bluetooth-powered tags play a little song when prompted, so you can find them if they are within 100 feet of your cellphone. Now so small and inexpensive they’re practically must-owns. Tile Slim is just the width of two credit cards, letting it slip in a wallet with minimal heft, and Tile Mate is 25% smaller than the original tile — making it a perfect keychain fob. What to know: Out of range doesn’t mean out of luck. Selecting “notify when found” taps the community of Tile owners, anonymously. So, when someone walks past your lost item, their app will detect it and report it to the service, which will reveal its location on your app. Buy Now: $25 for Mate, $30 for Slim Replay SHARE Uber Gift Card ($25+) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anyone who lives in an area where Uber is available, especially in cities. Why we like it: It’s an easy way to treat a friend or family member to a free ride, since recipients just need to enter the Gift Code in the Payments section of the app. Gift cards are sold in retail chains such as Walmart, Target, and CVS. Uber gift cards can also be used toward the company’s food delivery service UberEATS. What to know: Gift cards can’t be redeemed for UberRUSH, Uber’s courier service. Replay SHARE Google Chromecast ($35) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Shoppers seeking a basic media player for viewing apps like Netflix, Hulu, YouTube on their TV. Why we like it: There are plenty of affordable streaming options out there, but the Chromecast makes browsing content as easy as using your smartphone. Since the Chromecast runs compatible apps from your phone on your TV, you don’t need to log into apps on your TV or get used to a new interface. What to know: Your phone must be nearby in order to use and control the Chromecast. While you can display any Chromecast compatible app on the TV using iPhone or Android, you can only show other phone content (photos, etc.) on your television using Android. Buy Now Replay SHARE Selfie Stick ($39.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anybody who can’t stop taking selfies. Why we like it: Ah, the selfie stick. It’s easy to make fun of them, but they’re incredibly useful gadgets for getting group photos to cherish forever. This telescoping model can do double duty as a handle, resulting in smoother and steadier video. What to know: This model doesn’t have a shutter button, so you’ll need to use your phone or camera’s timer or time-lapse modes to take selfies with it. The pictured GoPro isn’t included, either. Buy Now Replay SHARE Mophie Powerstation ($49.95) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anybody who wishes their phone battery would last longer (so, everybody.) Why we like it: Accessory maker Mophie’s latest Powerstation battery packs are slimmer than ever, making them easy to stash in a backpack, purse or pocket. Even the smallest versions can completely recharge a dead phone, effectively doubling your battery life. What to know: Newer smartphones have better battery life, so this is a safer gifting choice for somebody with an older device. Buy Now Replay SHARE Bloxels ($49.95) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Minecraft masters who are ready to build a game of their own. Why we like it: Pairing old-school tech (think Lite Brite) with modern gear (it’s Android-, iOS-, and Kindle-compatible), Bloxels gives kids an 8-bit education on video game creation, from characters to backgrounds to boards. What to know: This won’t help your kids learn to code (there are plenty of other toys for that), but it will teach them game design principles, which can be applied to other walks of life. Buy Now Replay SHARE Amazon Fire Tablet ($49.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Young kids (for games) and older users (for email and Facebook.) Why we like it: The Amazon Fire Tablet is nowhere near as powerful as more expensive tablets, but it’s impressive given the price. It’s a great option for young kids or grandparents who want something simple for playing games, surfing Facebook or checking email. It’s also more durable than your average tablet, so it’ll take a few bumps and drops in stride. What to know: These also work great as bedside accessories for watching Netflix or reading a book before you hit the hay. Buy Now Replay SHARE Amazon Echo Dot ($49.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Amazon Prime subscribers who have a speaker to spare. Why we like it: Amazon Echo, the company’s original voice-enabled speaker/intelligent assistant/smart home controller, made interacting with technology easy, even fun. Its little cousin, Echo Dot, dumps the speaker in favor of a much friendlier price point. To get the full effect, users will need to connect their existing audio gear via Bluetooth or 3.5mm cable. What to know: You can get the full smart speaker experience from the bigger, more expensive Echo. Buy Now Replay SHARE Nintendo NES Classic Edition ($59.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Older millennials and Gen-Xers who want to relive their glory days, or share their childhood favorites with their kids. Why we like it: 30 of the finest video games to grace the medium, several of those design exemplars, all tucked snugly into a chip soldered onto a peewee circuitboard inside a pint-sized replica of the most iconic games console in history. That’s Nintendo’s NES Classic Edition, an ostensible paean to 8-bit playgrounds with modern HDMI video support and multimode display options (digitally crisp or wobbly retro) that buyers can have for $60. And with its replica A and B button gamepad, it’s also a chance to experience, tactilely, perhaps one last time, what the boomerang-shaped gamepads we routinely clutch for hours on end — to the point of taking their existence for granted — owe a debt to. What to know: There’s no official way to add more games to the NES Classic Edition, meaning you’re stuck with the 30 (mostly very good) titles it ships with. Get In-Stock Alert Replay SHARE WD My Passport Ultra 1TB ($64.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anybody who’s bad at backing up their computer in case the worst should happen. Why we like it: A nice big backup drive like Western Digital’s 1TB My Passport makes it easy to back up your computer — should anything happen to your PC or Mac, you’ll rest easy knowing your data is safe on this drive. The Passport is tiny, making it easy to stash away in a desk drawer when you’re done backing up, which you should do weekly or monthly, depending on how much data you’re creating. If you want to get really serious about preserving your data, keep the drive in a separate location from your computer, like a locked drawer at your office. What to know: 1TB should be enough storage for everyday users, but photographers and other media professionals might need more capacity — or rely on a cloud service — to back up their work. Buy Now Replay SHARE GoalZero Torch 250 ($79.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Campers, dog-walkers, emergency preppers — basically anyone who might need to see in the dark. Why we like it: Chargeable via USB, solar, or a hand crank, this multi-purpose torch, flood, and emergency light will never run out of power, even if the electricity is out. Its 4400mAh battery can provide up to 48 hours of light—unless you tap it to recharge your phone (which could be a life-saving feature.) What to know: It’s not very ergonomic and won’t likely fit in a glove box, the perfect place for an emergency gadget like this. Buy Now Replay SHARE UE Roll 2 Bluetooth Speaker ($99.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Music fans who never sit still. Why we like it: Small, versatile, and waterproof, this burger-sized Bluetooth speaker is a modern-day boombox. Its nine hours of battery life will outlast any picnic or pool party. And for bigger sound a single mobile phone can pair with two Roll2s simultaneously. What to know: The Roll 2’s IPX7 waterproof rating means it can survive a 30-minute soak in up to a meter of water. That means it’s great for the bathtub, but not the deep end. Buy Now Replay SHARE Roku Premiere+ ($99.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Cable cutters who don’t want to miss a thing on TV. Why we like it: Ultra high-definition video might not be available on every streaming service yet, but with 4K and HDR capability, this box has the specs to make your TV look great, whenever it arrives. And if you don’t have a 4K set yet, don’t worry. Costing just $99 the Premiere+ won’t break the bank, you can buy one now to future-proof your entertainment center. What to know: Jealous of Apple TV’s voice remote? Don’t be. Roku Ultra offers the same feature on its remote for $30 more — and it’s got 4K, which Apple’s set top box doesn’t. Buy Now Replay SHARE Samsung Gear VR ($99.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anyone with a compatible Samsung phone who’s curious about virtual reality but isn’t ready to sink hundreds of dollars into a high-end setup. Why we like it: The Gear VR is an affordable virtual reality headset that offers a vivid enough experience for those interested in trying out VR. Since it’s powered by your smartphone, wearers don’t have to deal with an extensive setup process or dangling wires. It also runs apps from the Oculus store, which is flush with options. What to know: The Gear VR‘s cheaper price means it comes with limitations compared to headsets like the Oculus Rift ($599.99), HTC Vive ($799.99), and PlayStation VR ($399.99). It can’t track your body’s movement in virtual space, restricting how you can interact with objects and characters in VR. It also doesn’t include a dedicated remote for VR or support motion controls, meaning you can’t wave, duck, or point at objects in games. Buy Now Replay SHARE Kindle Paperwhite ($119.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Those who want an affordable and reliable e-reader. Why we like it: The Kindle Paperwhite’s screen is just as sharp as its more expensive siblings and offers many of the same features. Its battery is long lasting and is compatible with Amazon’s massive e-book library. What to know: It doesn’t have an adaptive backlight, and its screen isn’t as bright as those of the Voyage and Oasis. There are no dedicated buttons or sensors for page turning. Buy Now Replay SHARE Plantronics BackBeat FIT ($129.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Fitness devotee whose pounding workouts don’t comport with easily jettisoned ear buds. Why we like it: In this price range, Plantronics’ sweat-proof and stylish BackBeat Fit (with Bluetooth and integrated mic) is unsurpassed. It’s unusually comfortable, offers solid bass as well as decent volume power, and respectable battery life in the 7 to 8 hour range. What to know: The behind-the-neck cord can be annoying. Buy Now Replay SHARE Fitbit Charge 2 ($149.95) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Those looking for a simple fitness tracker that goes beyond basic step tracking. Why we like it: The Fitbit Charge 2 is a modest refresh of the company’s most popular band that brings a host of improvements, including a bigger display and new features that help provide a more complete picture of your health. The larger screen alone makes it more useful for keeping an eye on smartphone notifications throughout the day. What to know: Avid runners might want to look elsewhere if they want to track their routes without their phone. It’s also not possible to remotely control music playback through the Charge 2. Buy Now Replay SHARE Nomad Horween Leather Charging Wallet ($149.95) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Any man with a iPhone. Why we like it: Carrying around a spare battery can be a drag, but stitching one into a wallet is brilliant. This bi-fold doesn’t just pack a 2,400mAh battery and the usual slots for cash and cards, it also integrates an Apple Lightning cable to charge your phone in a pinch. The Horween leather is a great touch, aging beautifully and making the wallet seem much a non-gadget. What to know: The battery is built into the bi-fold’s hinge, making it a little longer (but no thicker) than most wallets. If size matters, the slim version fits in both front and back pants pockets and costs $30 less. Buy Now Replay SHARE Razer Turret Mouse & Keyboard ($159.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: PC gamers who want to get off their chairs and head to…the couch. Why we like it: This $160 wireless lapboard and mouse’s only noteworthy flaw is its lack of a backlit keyboard. Otherwise it’s the slickest way to interface with a big-screen-connected gaming PC from the of a comfy chair. The durable, quiet chiclet keyboard folds in half and docks snugly in a vertical stand, as does the mouse. If you’ve dreamed of playing a game like Civilization VI at 4K resolution on a 50 or 60 inch screen, this is how to get it done. What to know: This keyboard is fine for gaming, but it’s not something you’ll want to write a senior thesis on. Buy Now Replay SHARE Even H1 Headphones ($179) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Music fans who say today’s tunes sound terrible. Why we like it: For the $179, the H1’s comfy headband, soft ear pads, and rich mahogany cups are already a nice deal. But these cans also pack customizable “earprint technology” that lets you tune them to your distinct hearing preferences, bringing out all the nuance that gets muddled out by MP3s and streaming music. What to know: Even’s H1s are hard-wired cans that don’t have Bluetooth or Apple’s Lightning connector cable, so iPhone 7 owners will need to use Apple’s included adapter. Buy Now Replay SHARE Jaybird Freedom Wireless ($179.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Earbud fans anxious to be free from wires and extra heft. Why we like it: When it comes to fit, in-ear headphones are hit or miss. But the Jaybirds come with all the necessary hardware to ensure they’ll stay put. The sweat-proof, metal design means they’re tougher than they look, and they sound great too. If it wasn’t for the string-thick audio cable running across your neck, you wouldn’t know they were there. What to know: The four-hour battery isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. The headphones have four hours of life on their own, and four more with the (bulkier) charger clip attached. Buy Now Replay SHARE Fujifilm Instax Share SP-2 ($199.95) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: People who take lots of smartphone photos and want to have something to stick on the fridge. Why we like it: We all carry pretty great cameras in our pockets all day, meaning we take way more photos than we used to. But too many of those photos live solely on Facebook and Instagram. With the Instax Share SP-2, you can quickly and easily make printouts of your smartphone photos to give to a friend or keep as a memento of a special occasion. What to know: Instax film costs about $0.75 per print, which can be much more expensive than sending your photos to an online printing service or visiting your local convenience store with photo kiosk. Buy Now: Silver or Gold Replay SHARE Littlebits Gizmos & Gadgets 2nd Edition ($199.95) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Tablet-toting kids who love tech, but need less screen time. Why we like it: Tapping into new levels of kids’ creativity, this 70-piece kit has everything curious minds need to invent new ways to slay boredom. But more than just a pile of widgets, Littlebits also provides projects aplenty, helping to teach little ones the ins-and-outs of electronics. What to know: Like with LEGOs, there are a variety of different bits and accessories to buy. You’re not giving them a game; you’re giving them a hobby. Buy Now Replay SHARE AKG N60 NC ($199.95) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Music fans who want sleek-looking, noise-cancelling headphones. Why we like it: The AKG N60 NCs are a terrific-sounding pair of noise cancelling headphones for a reasonable price. The cord is detachable, meaning it can be easily replaced if the connectors ever wear down from lots of use. They have great battery life, but even if you forget to charge them, you can still use them as normal headphones without the active noise cancellation. What to know: These aren’t Bluetooth headphones, so iPhone 7 buyers will need to use them with Apple’s included adapter. Buy Now Replay SHARE New Nintendo 3DS XL ($199.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Nintendo fans, young kids, and gamers looking for a mobile option beyond their smartphone. Why we like it: The best version of Nintendo’s 3DS remains the finest gaming handheld in the industry, bar none. Super Mario 3D Land, The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, Fire Emblem Fates, Monster Hunter Generations, and Pokemon Sun and Moon are only available here. And when you consider what some pay to upgrade smartphones or tablets annually — as a devoted gaming device with deterministic inputs, touch screens have nothing on this thing — at just $200, it’s arguably a steal. What to know: Nintendo’s upcoming Switch console, due out in March 2017, also offers portable gameplay, so it’s unclear if it’ll be worth owning both it and a 3DS. Buy Now Replay SHARE Canary Flex ($199.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anyone looking for an extra set of eyes, indoors and out. Why we like it: Weatherproof and wireless, it can be placed outdoors, but with a wired connection and slick design, it doesn’t raise eyebrows inside. What to know: Enabling Canary’s geofencing capabilities means the camera can be shut off when you arrive home to preserve your privacy, but the trade-off is that the company knows your location. Buy Now: Black or White Replay SHARE Moto G4 ($199.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anybody who wants a good phone but doesn’t need all the bells and whistles. Why we like it: The Moto G is proof that you don’t need to spend $700 on a smartphone to get a great experience. Considering the price, it’s an all-around solid performer. Think of it as the Toyota Corolla of smartphones: It gets the job done, it looks good, and it won’t break the bank. What to know: The Moto G’s camera isn’t great in low light, so if you’re shopping for a mobile photography fan, you might want to look elsewhere. Buy Now Replay SHARE Acer Chromebook R11 ($269.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Those who need an affordable and reliable laptop primarily for using the Internet. Why we like it: For its price, the Chromebook R11 adequately covers all of the basics: a comfortable keyboard, a fluid trackpad, and a touchscreen that’s sharp enough to to make for watching videos and viewing photos. The R11’s display can also fold backwards, transforming into a tablet. What to know: Because it’s a Chromebook, the R11’s functionality will be limited when there’s no Internet connection. Buy Now Replay SHARE Apple Watch ($269+ for Series 1, $369+ for Series 2) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Apple devotees who want a smartwatch with fitness tracking features. Why we like it: The Apple Watch’s relatively slim design, easy to navigate interface, and versatility make it one of the best smartwatches available. Fitness nuts, particularly runners and swimmers, might want to opt for the more expensive $369 Series 2, which is water resistant, includes built-in GPS tracking, and has general performance enhancements. But the cheaper $269 first generation watch offers a very similar experience at a more affordable price. What to know: Although the Apple Watch frees you from having to reach for your phone to check your texts, you still need to have your iPhone nearby to get the most out of it. Buy Now: $269+ for Series 1, $369+ for Series 2 Replay SHARE Xbox One S ($299.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Xbox gamers looking for an upgrade or people buying into Microsoft’s gaming ecosystem for the first time. Why we like it: Microsoft’s newer, slimmer Xbox One S is what the Xbox One should have been three years ago. There’s no bundled, controversy-laden Kinect peripheral. It’s able to rest in your entertainment center horizontally or vertically. It’s compact and thermally tepid, with the power supply built-in. It includes a finessed gamepad with tweaked control stick grips, an IR blaster and it has a few new hardware tricks up its sleeve, including Ultra-HD 4K Blu-ray support. If all you need is 500GB, it’s yours for $299, or you can spend as much as $399 for a 2TB version. What to know: Microsoft’s promising a revved-up Xbox in the near future, so current Xbox One owners may be better off waiting for that before upgrading. Buy Now Replay SHARE GoPro HERO5 Session ($299.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Videographers looking for a high performance, easy-to-use action camera. Why we like it: The GoPro HERO5 Session’s voice controls make it immensely more useful, enabling users to start and stop recording without pressing any buttons. More importantly this model can shoot in 4K and is waterproof even without a case. In many ways, it’s what GoPro’s Session camera should have always been. What to know: The HERO5 Session doesn’t have a screen to preview shots or adjust settings, unlike the more expensive HERO5 Black. Buy Now Replay SHARE Vizio E-Series 43in. 4K Home Theater Display ($379.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Dorm dwellers or apartment residents who want to make the jump to 4K. Why we like it: 43-inches of 4K for less than $400 — that’s one heck of a bargain. And Vizio throws in its SmartCast technology (which is essentially a built-in Chromecast), saving consumers even more cash. What to know: Small but important fact: this is technically not a television, it’s a display. The difference being that displays lack an integrated tuner, so they can’t grab over-the-air signals. In other words, you’re going to need an antenna or a set-top box to watch standard TV on this. Buy Now Replay SHARE PlayStation 4 Pro ($399.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: PlayStation gamers with a 4K TV. Why we like it: Sony’s souped-up PlayStation 4 delivers the explosive graphical bona fides of a PC two to three times as expensive. PS4 Pro enhanced games like Rise of the Tomb Raider, Ratchet & Clank or Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare look like someone removed a blurred pane of glass from your view. No one’s done what Sony’s attempting, releasing a mid-cycle console with twice the original unit’s power that’s fully forward-backward compatible, while holding the cost at parity with the 2013 launch original. What to know: Every upcoming PlayStation 4 game will be compatible with the standard-issue PS4, so there’s no need to upgrade just to keep enjoying new titles. Buy Now Replay SHARE PlayStation VR ($399.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: PlayStation gamers who find themselves VR-curious. Why we like it: Sony’s PlayStation 4-tethered headset hits closest to what feels like first-gen virtual reality’s sweet spot: affordability without meaningful compromise, ergonomic maturity and in a few instances riveting platform-exclusives. And at $399, it’s yours for hundreds of dollars less than its fellow high-enders. It’s the lithely machined and beveled progeny of a multi-billion-dollar global firm’s decades of consumer electronics know-how. It’s design like this that explains why Steve Jobs said he wanted to turn Apple into the “Sony of the computer business” when he returned to the company he founded in 1998. What to know: It doesn’t ship with the requisite camera or Move controllers; a package with everything you need costs about $100 extra. Buy Now: PlayStation VR, PlayStation VR Bundle Replay SHARE OnePlus 3 ($399, unlocked) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Android fans looking for an affordable phone that’s pleasant to use. Why we like it: Chinese startup OnePlus has been calling itself the flagship killer, and for good reason. Its OnePlus 3 phone is roughly $200 less than most premium smartphones and still offers an attractive design, solid performance, a decent camera, and an easy-to-use interface. What to know: The OnePlus 3’s camera isn’t the best at taking photos in low-light conditions, and the phone doesn’t support expandable storage. Buy Now: OnePlus 3 site, Amazon Replay SHARE GoPro HERO5 Black ($399.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Action sports and outdoors enthusiasts who want high-quality footage of their pursuits. Why we like it: GoPro’s latest high-end action camera, the HERO5 Black, packs lots of new features that add up to make it the company’s best product yet. Our favorites are the built-in video stabilization, which results in much steadier shots, and the new voice commands, which make it easier to use without fumbling around with buttons. What to know: You’ll want a couple extra batteries and a nice big memory card for all that high-def footage you’ll capture. We recommend the SanDisk Extreme 64GB — make sure you get the microSD version. Buy Now Replay SHARE iPad Pro 9.7 ($599) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Apple fans and creative-types seeking a portable device for productivity. Why we like it: This iPad packs the speed and power of Apple’s Pro model into a more manageable size. Its improved screen, which adjusts to match the lighting in your environment, combined with its punchy processor and compatibility with Apple Pencil make it a great choice for those seeking a tablet for both entertainment and productivity. What to know: Although Apple has made some noteworthy improvements to the iPad Pro 9.7, there isn’t much that differentiates it from the cheaper iPad Air 2, which starts at $399. Buy Now Replay SHARE iPhone 7 ($649, unlocked) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Anyone ready to upgrade from an older smartphone looking for a great camera, long battery life, and easy-to-use software. Why we like it: The iPhone 7’s improved camera, faster performance, and water resistance make it Apple’s best iPhone yet. What to know: There’s no headphone jack, so you’ll need to use the included dongle to continue using legacy headphones. The changes aren’t significant enough to consider upgrading from an iPhone 6s. Buy Now: Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, Unlocked Replay SHARE Google Pixel ($649, unlocked) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Android lovers who want a premium smartphone and current iPhone owners thinking about switching. Why we like it: The Google Pixel’s great camera, clean interface, and premium design make it one of the best phones you can buy, period. The Google Assistant is also helpful for answering basic questions and managing your calendar. What to know: It’s more expensive than some other Android phones, it isn’t water-resistant, and there are some unnecessary apps. Buy Now: Verizon, Unlocked Replay SHARE Samsung Galaxy S7 ($669.99, unlocked) Samsung Galaxy S7 Who’s it for: Anyone willing to splurge on a premium Android smartphone with an excellent screen and camera. Why we like it: The Galaxy S7’s colorful display and long battery life along make it a top choice for smartphone shoppers. Its camera is also one of the best, especially for capturing photos in low-light circumstances. What to know: Its shiny exterior is prone to fingerprint smudges, and it may come with unnecessary apps from your carrier. (This is a different phone than the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which has been recalled due to battery issues.) Buy Now: Unlocked, Verizon, Sprint, AT&T Replay SHARE Dell XPS 13 ($799.99) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Windows fans shopping for a premium, high-performance laptop to use as their primary computer. Why we like it: The XPS 13 offers just about everything you want in a great computer: fast performance, a dazzling screen, long battery life, and a gorgeous design. But what really makes Dell’s laptop stand out is its expansive screen, which Dell calls the “InfinityEdge” display. The bezels around the screen are so slim that the display actually looks larger than that of your standard 13-inch laptop. What to know: Because of its thin frame, the XPS 13’s webcam is located in an awkward position near the keyboard. Replay SHARE DJI Mavic Pro ($999) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: Drone enthusiasts looking for a highly portable model that captures great footage. Why we like it: The DJI Mavic Pro is remarkably compact when folded up, fitting in an average-sized backpack with plenty of leftover space. It takes remarkably crisp, stable video and photos. And the new controller is a huge improvement over the models that come with DJI’s Phantom lineup. What to know: You’ll only get about 20-25 minutes of airtime on a single charge with the Mavic Pro, so buy extra batteries if you want longer sorties. Buy Now Replay SHARE Razer Blade Stealth + Core ($999.99 for Stealth, $499.99 for Core) Suzanne Darcy for TIME Who’s it for: PC gamers who want a sleek laptop for playing on the go. Why we like it: The Stealth is a study in metallic minimalism: the 12.5-inch matte black laptop in some protective plastic, its tiny tube-like 45 watt power adapter and a coaster-sized stack of reading material. That’s it. In your hands the closed, half-inch thick body could be a petrified notepad, as lithe and paradoxically unyielding as a MacBook Air. Pair it with a $399 Razer Core Thunderbolt-connected chassis and it’ll let you harness the power of a tricked-out desktop graphics card, transforming your lithesome portable workstation into a screaming games machine. What to know: As you might expect on a laptop built for high-end gaming, the battery life can leave a little to be desired. Buy Now: $999.99 for Stealth, $499.99 for Core Replay SHARE Fujifilm X-T2 ($1,599, body only) Who’s it for: Hardcore photographers who want a beautiful camera. Why we like it: The Fujifilm X-T2 may look old school, but don’t let that fool you. It’s one of the best digital cameras on the market today. Shutterbugs will love the X-T2’s dial-in settings, which offer a terrific sense of manual control. What to know: Using the X-T2 is like driving a stick shift: It’s not for everybody, but it’s deeply rewarding once you’ve got the hang of it. Buy Now Read Next Your browser is out of date.

(Mark Lennihan/ASSOCIATED PRESS) BY Joe Dziemianowicz NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, November 15, 2016, 10:00 AM Santa’s workshops are actually sweatshops. So says a holiday spirit-crushing report out Tuesday uncovering unfair labor practices at Asian toymaking plants where popular brands like Barbie, Thomas the Tank Engine, Hot Wheels and others are made so kids can enjoy them on Christmas morning. There’s little to be joyful about in China Labor Watch’s “Investigation Report in Four Toy Factories.” The account by the New York-based non-government research and advocacy group found that toys manufactured for Mattel, Hasbro, Disney, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart are done so in unacceptable environments. Some Barbies are made by workers who endure unfair labor conditions, according to a new report. (Mark Lennihan/AP) “They are sweatshop conditions,” said Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, which conducted anonymous toy factory studies in May and September of this year. The report found that workers endured “heavy workloads,” “toxic conditions” and “extremely low pay.” For one month of 174 hours the base wage would be $300, according to the 50-plus page report. Help already wanted: Seasonal hiring started early this year “Workers are under enormous pressure,” said Li Qiang. “They are verbally abused.” Or worse. The report found that “none of the four factories had ever taken the pre-work safety training seriously.” As a result, workers were exposed to toxic materials and didn’t even know it. Conditions in some Chinese factories where Hot Wheels are assembled will make your head spin, per a New York-based labor group. (Mark Lennihan/AP) The report calls the situation “a world of misery for toy factory workers.” But it’s not a new world. “One of the most shocking things about the investigation is that these issues keep cropping up,” said Li Qiang. “Management always says it's going to make improvements but little is seen. They don’t keep promises.” The labor group shared a letter from Disney in which the famous brand noted that China Labor Watch “has made no attempt in recent years to contact us directly to share their concerns in a timely manner.” The group refuted that claim, adding that “We can’t tolerate that children’s dreams are based on workers’ nightmares.” Tags: holidays toys christmas china minimum wage Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

SOUTH ORANGE, NJ — On Nov. 10, South Orange Village unveiled its new Soofa bench — an innovative bench that charges mobile devices using solar power while providing the user with a social experience — in the heart of South Orange’s historic downtown, according to a recent release from the village. These benches were provided by the Sustainable Jersey Small Grant Program funded by Walmart. South Orange Village is the first New Jersey municipality to install the Soofa bench in its downtown and has plans to install several more in the near future. “South Orange has a long and proud history of being both environmentally conscious and at the forefront of new technologies,” village President Sheena Collum said in the press release. “Our goal is to provide this new technology in the heart of our downtown districts that will utilize free solar power to charge the most used digital tools of our on-the-go residents. Busy commuters, Seton Hall college students, local shoppers, senior citizens and after-schoolers will all benefit from this free power source. This program will also help show other municipalities a sustainable public project that is positive for all ages and demographics which can be replicated quite easily.” The solar-powered bench was featured as an up-and-coming technology at President Barack Obama’s inaugural White House Maker Faire in June 2014 and was referred to as one of the “six wonders of the Maker Faire” in the Wall Street Journal. The first of its kind, the Soofa bench is the brainchild of three female entrepreneurs from the MIT Media Lab and Harvard University who came together with a vision for a sustainable, connected future. South Orange will work with Soofa as an early adopter of leading-edge technology and will advise on new product development to solve problems facing cities and towns, big and small. “At Soofa, our main goal is to make cities better for people through the implementation of technology,” Soofa CEO Sandra Richter said in the release. “To do so, we work closely with our network of partner cities to learn where the biggest opportunities are to innovate together. South Orange Village is a great example of what we look for in a partner — super focused on innovation, sustainability and making its outdoor spaces as inviting as possible for its residents and visitors.” The Soofa Bench is in 18 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia, as well three other countries.

With its launch on Xbox One and recent expansion to other platforms including Android TV, FandangoNow today is available across an installed base of more than 100 million devices, according to Fandango president Paul Yanover. That’s more than double since Fandango, owned by Comcast’s NBCUniversal, acquired premium VOD service M-Go in January from Technicolor and DreamWorks Animation. Fandango’s goal: to extend its movie-ticketing business to include home entertainment, catering to movie fans after films have left theaters. The rebranded FandangoNow provides more than 40,000 new-release and catalog movies and next-day TV shows for rent or purchase, competing with the likes of Apple’s iTunes, Amazon Video and Walmart’s Vudu. “We’re the only company entirely focused on the movie consumer experience,” Yanover said. “Our ability to let people find the right movie at the right time, that’s critical — it will drive the flywheel effect.” Fandango will increasingly look to bundle together movie tickets with home-entertainment titles, Yanover said. For example, with the home-video release next month of Illumination Entertainment’s “The Secret Life of Pets,” FandangoNow users who purchase or rent the movie will get a free child’s ticket to see Illumination’s next animated release, “Sing,” slated to bow Dec. 21. Conversely, those who buy theatrical tickets to “Sing” on Fandango will get a discount on a selection of Illumination movies including “Despicable Me” and “Minions.” Both Fandango and Universal Pictures are owned by NBCU; Yanover said Fandango has also created bundles with other studios. To entice Xbox One owners to use FandangoNow, the company is offering users of the consoles who activate the service a 50% discount on their next purchase or rental. The FandangoNow app on Xbox One will support DTS-HD surround-sound audio. “FandangoNow is a perfect fit for Xbox One users who are looking to get their total entertainment fix right on their console,” said Steve Guggenheimer, corporate VP and chief evangelist at Microsoft. New movies coming to FandangoNow in November include “Suicide Squad,” “Sausage Party,” “Secret Life of Pets,” “Jason Bourne,” “Don’t Breathe,” “Kubo and the Two Strings” and “War Dogs.” FandangoNow is also on the web at fandangonow.com, on iOS and Android mobile devices, on Roku and Google’s Chromecast streaming players, and on smart TVs from Samsung, LG and LeEco’s Vizio. Fandango is developing support for other platforms, as well, Yanover said: “We are totally agnostic – any television screen we can be on, we’re excited about.” Filed Under: Fandango FandangoNow xbox one Want to read more articles like this one?

The supermarket giant announced it would be bringing prices down to a new national price cap of 110.7p per litre on unleaded and 112.7p on diesel at all 277 of its filling stations. Asda, owned by US retail giant Walmart, will shave up to three pence per litre off fuel, after nearly a year of price hikes for motorists. And the supermarket giant was the first of the national retailers to announce a price cute, with Tesco confirming it will be implementing a price cut at its 500 filling stations. Morrisons followed suit by saying it was cutting each fuel by up to 3p at its 333 forecourts. Sainsbury's said its prices at 303 sites would see similar cuts. Diesel prices have been rising across the UK in recent weeks. Government figures show that average fuel prices have reached their highest level since July last year, with motorists being charged 116.6p per litre for petrol and 119p for diesel. The fuel cut will be welcomed by the millions of drivers who have seen fuel prices rise since sterling slumped in the wake of the EU Referendum in June, which saw millions of Brits back Brexit with a vote to leave the European Union. Read More Watch new Asda Christmas advert for 2016 by Saatchi & Saatchi Simon Williams, the motoring organisation's fuel spokesman, said: "Retailers should have reduced their prices then rather than making one bigger headline-grabbing cut now. "This will sadly undermine motorists' trust in fuel retailers and it's hard not to see it as them taking advantage of the current climate, which has led people to think that higher fuel prices are an inevitability simply because of the weaker pound and talk of the rising cost of goods. "In fact there is still scope to reduce pump prices further." Read More Cost of Christmas dinner goes DOWN - despite fears Brexit will push up price of festive treats AA president Edmund King said the price drop will "take some of the sting out of the high pump prices". But he added: "Yo-yo oil prices mean that we may see costs reverse yet again." Read More Chocolate fans are being short-changed this Christmas - and this is why Tesco's fuel director, Peter Cattell, said: "With the busy festive season just around the corner, we know many of our customers will be starting to prepare for the big day. "So to provide a little extra help we're cutting the cost of petrol and diesel by up to three pence per litre at all of our 500 filling stations." Read More Asda slashes price of fuel to new national price cap Asda's senior director for petrol, Andy Peake, said: "Asda is once again leading the way in reducing the price at the pumps to help the millions of motorists across the UK. "Our new national price cap of 110.7p per litre on unleaded and 112.7p per litre on diesel will be welcomed by the millions of drivers who have seen fuel prices rise since Brexit."

It had posted a net profit of Rs 179.37 crore in the same period of last financial year. Its income from operations in the quarter under review stood at Rs 1,789.94 crore, up 21.81 per cent compard to Rs 1,469.44 crore in same period last year, Welspun India said in a BSE filing. During the quarter, the company made a provision of Rs 500.48 crore on account of Egyptian Cotton issue. "Provision of Rs 500.48 crore is towards return of goods by the customers, cost of network, inventory write-down, legal fees and other expenses relating to traceability issues," the company said. In August, the US retail giant Target Corporation terminated contract with the Gujarat-based textiles maker over alleged lapses in its products supply. Soon after, Walmart stopped selling Welspun India's Egyptian cotton products. Welspun India, later, appointed consultancy firm Ernst & Young to look into alleged lapses. Other US-based retail chains such as Bed Bath & Beyond and JCPenny are also conducting third-party audit of items sourced from Welspun India. "Welspun has taken the Egyptian Cotton issue very seriously and we have proactively engaged with all our stakeholders and appointed EY as external consultants to thoroughly examine the supply chain which has become significantly complex over the years making traceability very difficult," Welspun Group Chairman B K Goenka said. It said that EY "suggested several remedial steps covering structural, procedural, people and technological measures on which Welspun has begun to act". "As a vertically integrated player, the company is moving towards producing all the Egyptian cotton products in-house i.E., from procuring cotton to the finished product," it added. The Egyptian cotton product portfolio which has come under scanner accounts for 6 per cent of its annual business, the company earlier said. The company had posted total net sales of Rs 5,387.66 crore in 2015-16. In a separate filing, the company said its Board approved capital investment of Rs 600 crore in flooring solutions such as carpets, rugs etc. "This investment will benefit from synergies arising from the company's existing product line and customer base.

Million Women Mentors to Launch STEM Program at A-State By KASU Newsroom • 16 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email According to the Million Women Mentors website, Million Women Mentors supports the engagement of one million Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) mentors (male and female) to increase the interest and confidence of girls and women to persist and succeed in STEM programs and careers. Credit Arkansas State University Encouraging young girls and women to pursue education and careers in the STEM disciplines is the goal of a new national movement in which Arkansas State University is taking a lead role. Million Women Mentors (MWM) is being promoted in Arkansas by Walmart, STEMconnector® and Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, who will be keynote speaker for the campus launch of the program Tuesday, Nov. 15.  MWM wants to engage a million mentors by the year 2019. STEM is the commonly accepted acronym for the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  STEM-related jobs have grown three times faster than non-STEM jobs over the past decade.  At the same time, only about a fourth of female workers are in STEM professions, although women comprise half the workforce. "We expect to not only enroll many of the participants (at least 100), but we expect them to return to their STEM workplaces and recruit at least 10 of their colleagues," stated Dr. Cynthia Miller, director of the STEM Education Center at A-State.  "This will result in 1,000 or more northeast Arkansas girls being guided, encouraged and supported by local STEM mentors to enroll in advanced high school and college STEM courses and to pursue STEM careers in college. Thus, the critical need for high-paying STEM workers in Arkansas will be addressed with local students." MWM's goals are to boost percentages in three ways: girls planning to pursue STEM careers, young women pursuing college and university degrees in STEM fields, and women who stay and advance in STEM careers through workforce mentoring programs. Students from at least four area public schools along with A-State students will attend the Tuesday public launch event, which is scheduled for 10-11:30 at the Convocation Center, 217 Olympic Dr. Others involved with organizing the launch include Dr. Suzanne Mitchell, director of the Arkansas STEM Coalition, Suzanne Hightower, senior manager of STEM strategy for Walmart, Dr. Mary Jane Bradley, dean of Education and Behavioral Science at A-State, and Jill Clogston, director of the Education Renewal Zone. Other speakers include Chancellor Doug Whitlock, Provost Lynita Cooksey, ASU System vice president Shane Broadway, Associate Dean Anne Grippo, Stacy Gunderman of Future Fuels, and pre-medical student Diana Smith. Additional details about the program and launch event Tuesday are available through the Education Renewal Zone by contacting Clogston, jclogston@AState.edu or (870) 972-2049.

Wed 16 Nov 2016 | 6:41 GMT You are here: Home > Investing > Article Home News Investing Markets Metals & Mining Energy & Oil Agricultural Commodities Quotes Currencies Video AlertNet Humanitarian News About Thomson Reuters Egyptian cotton concerns tip Welspun India into loss Tue Nov 15, 2016 12:39pm GMT   Print | Single Page [-] Text [+] By Zeba Siddiqui MUMBAI (Reuters) - Welspun India said it had acted to address concerns over the quality of its Egyptian cotton as the departure of two major U.S. customers over the issue led to a quarterly loss. The bedding and towel maker also warned on Tuesday of muted revenue growth next year after Target Corp and the world's largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc said they would stop buying its Egyptian cotton products. Target alleged in August that Welspun had passed off cheap sheets as premium Egyptian cotton. Egyptian cotton uses high-end fibre, and hence sells at a premium to regular cotton. Chairman B.K. Goenka said that while the contribution of Egyptian cotton had fallen to 3 percent of Welspun's total revenue, nearly half of last year, as a result of the quality issue, the firm has no plans to exit the business. Goenka said the fault with the cotton products supplied to Target was due to "a complex supply chain" that Welspun is now working on simplifying by bringing it in-house rather than outsourcing. "The outsourcing has helped us meet our volume requirement ... however, the increasing complexity of our supply chain has presented a challenge toward tracking and traceability," Goenka said. He said consultancy EY had completed an audit and Welspun is implementing suggested remedial measures to its supply chain. "This is opportunity for us to improve our processes across our products," Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala said.   Continued...

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Home textiles firm Welspun India today reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 147.52 crore for the second quarter ended September due to provisions for Egyptian Cotton products supply issue. It had posted a net profit of Rs 179.37 crore in the same period of last financial year. Its income from operations in the quarter under review stood at Rs 1,789.94 crore, up 21.81 percent compard to Rs 1,469.44 crore in same period last year, Welspun India said in a BSE filing. During the quarter, the company made a provision of Rs 500.48 crore on account of Egyptian Cotton issue. "Provision of Rs 500.48 crore is towards return of goods by the customers, cost of network, inventory write-down, legal fees and other expenses relating to traceability issues," the company said. In August, the US retail giant Target Corporation terminated contract with the Gujarat-based textiles maker over alleged lapses in its products supply. Soon after, Walmart stopped selling Welspun India's Egyptian cotton products. Welspun India, later, appointed consultancy firm Ernst & Young to look into alleged lapses. Other US-based retail chains such as Bed Bath & Beyond and JCPenny are also conducting third-party audit of items sourced from Welspun India. "Welspun has taken the Egyptian Cotton issue very seriously and we have proactively engaged with all our stakeholders and appointed EY as external consultants to thoroughly examine the supply chain which has become significantly complex over the years making traceability very difficult," Welspun Group Chairman B K Goenka said. It said that EY "suggested several remedial steps covering structural, procedural, people and technological measures on which Welspun has begun to act". "As a vertically integrated player, the company is moving towards producing all the Egyptian cotton products in-house i.e., from procuring cotton to the finished product," it added. The Egyptian cotton product portfolio which has come under scanner accounts for 6 percent of its annual business, the company earlier said. The company had posted total net sales of Rs 5,387.66 crore in 2015-16. In a separate filing, the company said its Board approved capital investment of Rs 600 crore in flooring solutions such as carpets, rugs etc. "This investment will benefit from synergies arising from the company's existing product line and customer base. The capex will be done over 18 months spread over FY18 and FY19," it said. Shares of Welspun India closed 4.70 percent down at Rs 61.90 on BSE.

The encounter, caught on video by a bystander, shows an officer talking with a male passenger outside of the car that the female shoplifting suspect had just gotten into. After a brief confrontation, the man got back into the car. The driver ignored the officer's commands and backed out of the parking space, at which point the officer drew his gun and repeatedly warned the driver to stop. The car pulled away, left the parking lot, and was eventually pulled over after a brief chase at 12th St. and Roslyn Ave. SW. Erin Buckley, Troy Gordon and Eric Thurman -- the three passengers in the car -- were arrested and the merchandise was recovered. They face multiple charges. You can watch the full video of the encounter below.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     US Officials Say Paris Climate Agreement Will Survive A Trump Presidency Posted: Nov 15 2016, 3:18am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Efforts to Stem Climate Change will Go on Despite Trump’s Rhetoric   It so seems to be the case that the worldwide efforts to stem climate change will go on despite Trump’s rhetoric. The climate change envoy from the USA spoke at the conference held in Morocco on Tuesday. According to Jonathan Pershing, the efforts at limiting global warming will continue in an unimpeded manner. Don't Miss: Black Friday 2016: Everything You Need to Know Now This is so despite the President-elect, Donald Trump coming to office soon. Many ministers and heads of state attended the conference on climate change. They heard the words of Pershing loud and clear. Pershing assured the delegates gathered in the august audience that a single man could not derail the efforts that had been built over generations. This was so even if that man happened to be a super-rich guy who liked to have his own way like Trump. The Paris Treaty was resilient enough to withstand Trump’s rhetoric. Heads of state come and go, but the global coalition to sustain a pristine environment will not be stopped dead in its tracks. Trump’s team will be driving the policy in Washington soon, according to BBC. However, the transition from Obama’s policies to the implementation of Trump’s agenda would take time. It won’t happen overnight.  There was some sense of relief in this. Besides, Trump could not go against public opinion no matter how much power he possessed owing to his position as POTUS. The next four years were crucial in this regard. Donald Trump had vowed during his campaign trail that he would have the USA back out of the Paris Agreement. He also promised that he would withhold payment of cash to the UN regarding climate change. Whether he delivers in this regard remains to be seen. Yet the fact remains that the opposition of the lobbyists and senate against him will ensure that he does not have his way everytime a decision is to be put to the vote. Myron Ebell is to head the EPA. Handpicked by Trump, this man may create a few hurdles along the way. Pershing though said that the Paris Agreement was durable and resilient since it had the moral support of so many other nations besides the USA. The ambitions of scores of environmentalists and activists would not go to waste, Pershing assured the delegates in Morocco. Europe too expected the US to remain steadfast in its fidelity to the climate change pact.

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- India-based Amplus Solar picked up the title of Company of the Year Asia - 2016 in the recent Business Worldwide Magazine (BWM) Awards.

He added: "It's been quite a year for us, having enjoyed extraordinary growth in the rooftop solar field. We are uniquely placed within the fast growing commercial and industrial distributed generation segment and fully prepared to meet the ever-evolving energy needs of our customers.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File PhotoMore BERLIN (Reuters) - Axel Springer's digital ads unit Bonial wants to triple its active user base in the United States as it hopes to ride a digitalization wave in the retail sector, its chief executive told Reuters. "In the coming years we want to grow to 10 million active users," Christian Gaiser said in an interview. The company currently has an active user base of 3 million in the United States which compares with its global base of around 25 million. Bonial connects consumers and retailers via the internet and smartphones by alerting users to discounts at retailers near them. The company receives money for every user click on an ad. The location-based aggregator of flyers, coupons and catalogues works under the brand name Retale in the United States, with groups including Walmart and Target among its customers. Bonial, which is 72.5 percent-owned by Axel Springer, is active in 11 countries, of which the United States is the most important. "All developments we see here will arrive in other countries in about two to three years," Gaiser said, who founded the company in 2008, at the age of 22, but added that he currently had no plans to expand to further markets. Axel Springer, the publisher of Europe's top-selling Bild newspaper, bought its stake in Bonial in 2011 as part of a shift to more digital media and online classified ads as it seeks to offset a decline in print circulation. It has for instance bought Business Insider, an online business news portal, and digital classified ads portal StepStone. So far Axel Springer has invested around $90 million in Bonial, Gaiser said. Bonial's German business, where it operates portals such as kaufDa and MeinProspekt, has been profitable since 2011, the executive said. He declined to say when Bonial's U.S. business would turn a profit. "What we earn in our markets, we reinvest in growth," he said, referring to Bonial's general strategy.

HOME READ ONLINE The Fishers Fix Archive ON THE WEB Road Construction COMMUNITY Hamilton County Indianapolis COVER STORIES OTHER Education Dough Health Anti-aging Inside and Out Lifestyle Pets VIEWS Terry Anker CurrenToon Laughs Where’s Amy ABOUT US Contact Us Submissions Advertise Employment NIGHT & DAY Views Opinion: Just another country pastor by Mike Colaw · November 15, 2016 As much as I loved my education, both undergraduate and graduate school, that’s not really where I learned to be a pastor. I look at my traditional education as theological training, not the place I learned to pastor. I learned to pastor by watching my dad, Pastor Joe. When people think of a pastor today they often think of one of two people – the white-collared single guy or the Jesus rock star presenting the gospel like a flashy 80’s concert. Both get smoke. The former calls it incense, the latter calls it haze. I actually like both. However, as you move out of the big city and head into small communities, there is another type of pastor that becomes more prominent. They don’t make much money, wear hipster clothes, or have Twitter accounts. They are, well, normal. They wear clothes from Walmart and drive used cars. My dad is that type of pastor, and my knowledge of what it means to be a pastor is heavily influenced by him. He loves his people, he loves the community. I have many memories of him compassionately praying early Sunday morning at the altar for people by name. I visited the hospital with him more times than I can count. As a kid, I would watch my dad look into tear-filled eyes and encourage people facing terminal illness or the loss of a loved one. Those people loved him, and he loved them. I would listen to my dad passionately practice sermons on Saturday nights. He really did write and give his very best to those that attended the churches he worked in. He wasn’t on mission to be famous, but to participate in life with people. To him, being a pastor looks less like a shrewd CEO and more like a loving spiritual counselor. To him, what makes church great isn’t as much the quality of the rock show, but the health of the family. Dad loves knowing people, and people love knowing Dad. If you were to ask him why it’s worth it, he would simply say something like this: “I’m just trying to love people like Jesus would.” Today, I get to be a pastor. The truth is I am still learning. I’m not sure I have figured it out, but I know this. As I grow older I want to be a pastor like my dad. Loving Jesus, loving people, loving the community.

Tuned in: Ashmore’s Store artist coming to Montgomery Shannon Heupel , Montgomery Advertiser 5:46 p.m. CST November 14, 2016 Michael Koppy (Photo: Contributed) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE We have a very unique artist coming to Montgomery on Sunday at the Renaissance Exchange downtown. Michael Koppy performs 7:30-10 p.m. Depending on how many songs he does, that might give him enough time to work in his awesomely original, unique “behemoth” song “All in the Timing: A Hollywood Romance in Seven Chapters.” It’s a 27-minute song that’s on his new album/book “Ashmore’s Store.” The Tallahassee, Florida native actually recommends listening to it while driving. “Turn off the cell phone, slip it in the car player and drive across town,” said Koppy. He said the idea to take the song on the road came from a music critic in San Francisco. His book contains a tale of Ashmore’s Store, a real-life place that was owned by Robert Roy and Ethel Ashmore in his hometown. It speaks for small-town stores everywhere - centers of old communities, places to find what you need, people who know you. That store and its people got to know a lot about young Koppy, and he about them. It’s a life that forged Koppy into who he was as a young man, and who he is today. He was a musician as a young man, and reignited his music career after a 25-year career producing concerts, TV and musicals. Koppy is currently on his “The One Great Mornin’ Tour of Dixie,” which is taking him from Annapolis, MD, to Austin, Texas. The tour started on Nov. 5, and he is playing every single day through Dec. 4. It’s quite a marathon, and Montgomery is kind of in the middle of all that. That’s quite a trek, but nothing compared to what he did in his youth, going from ocean to ocean by hitch-hiking and hopping trains. This is a truly unconventional album, and I kind of love it. The book has the lyrics to the songs, including the lines he struck out of the recorded versions. It’s also beautifully illustrated and packed with stories and notes. The CD that comes inside the book has 10 songs - “River,” “Behind Every Great Fortune,” “Nineteen Years Old,” “‘Till Hell’s Dang Done Froze Over,” “We Shall Overcome,” “All in the Timing,” “The Cloths of Heaven,” and “Track Ten.” Along with Koppy, there are a host of other musicians on the album - Norman Hamlet (Merle Haggard & the Strangers), John McEuen (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), Woody Paul (Riders in the Sky), Richard Greene (Bill Monroe & the Bluegrass Boys), Roy Blumenfield (The Blues Project, Seatrain), Nicole Emery (Bob Dylan, Rickie Lee Jones), Cliff Carothers (Malice), and more. You can find “Ashmore’s Store” at Barnes & Nobile, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, eBay, HeartlandMusic.com, CCMusic.com and other book and music stores. Price range averages to be a little more than $30. Follow Koppy on his site michaelkoppy.com. *** Notes from the land of nuts… peanuts, that is In the words of the awesome show “Monty Pyton’s Flying Circus,” and now for something completely different. I’m a firm believer that God puts you where you need to be. The rest is often up to you to figure out. This past weekend during a family trip to Dothan for the National Peanut Festival, I believe He put me in the path of a couple of unique music acts that I might otherwise never have met. One is a pair of award-winning best friends, the other a ‘Big and Loud” family group who are no strangers to Montgomery. Both are gospel groups in their own ways. It was a beautiful night, and they were playing the "local stage" set up near the fair’s action, just down from the entrance to the rides and across from a huge picnic area were families could rest, eat and enjoy the shows. Kids were running around playing, battling with inflatable swords and dragging around stuffed animals. A roving magician was working the crowd doing sleight-of-hand tricks. The music from the stage was mixed with the sounds from the crowd and the rides, and it was just heavenly. There’s no other way to describe it. Having just come off of Montgomery’s own Alabama National Fair, I’ve got to say that I like this particular Dothan set up better for the local music acts. It puts them out in the open, near the action. Don’t get me wrong, I like Garrett Coliseum. I just think it works better having the acts out near the crowd, instead of expecting the crowd to come to the acts, especially when it’s not the headliner shows. And the mobile covered stage they use, which is owned by the city of Dothan, is something Montgomery would be wise to invest in. Anyway, let’s get to the music groups, both of which have origins that stem from faith. *** Meet the duo Alison & Tabitha Buy Photo Tabitha Shucker, left, and Alison Bunge of the duo Alison & Tabitha  (Photo: Shannon Heupel/Advertiser) Alison Bunge and Tabitha Shucker of the duo Alison & Tabitha are a pair of college students from northwest Florida finding their way, and their faith, through music. If you haven’t heard them perform before, you should. It’s a mix of message and talent that I truly enjoyed. There’s a reason these young women are the Alabama Music Association's New Gospel Duo of the Year, as well as being the 2016 National and International Adult New Gospel Duo of they Year, which they earned in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. “We’ve been friends for probably 15-plus years. Best friends for about 9,” said Tabitha. “God really aligned us. It’s His blessing to work and minister with my best friend.” “We really didn’t think that we would be doing something together,” said Alison. “We’ve always been told that ‘You should do American Idol’ or you should do this or this, but nobody really ever added the two of us together.” Early on, Alison said she and Tabitha were kind or rivals in their singing. Alison was interested in being a recording artist, while Tabitha leaned toward Broadway music. They said that it took acts of faith and humility to put them on a gospel singing duo path less than three years ago. “We knew that there was something more to our lives, like a calling. A purpose,” said Tabitha. They wanted to do music that they felt meant something more in the long scheme of things. That’s how they found their way into contemporary Christian music. They wanted to sing about God and the hope that Jesus offers. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t love the ‘80s music,” said Alison. “But ultimately, we know that they’re talking about a person. They’re glorifying a person.” “There’s so many people who are all talented, because God gives us all different gifts,” said Tabitha. “Well, you know what? It takes a calling to do something. Just like David had to have God behind him when he slung that stone and hit Goliath in the head, you have to have God behind you.  Really, we find that the only real meaning to singing is to glorify God." They’re currently working on a new album, which will be released early next year. “We’re the best at procrastination,” said Tabitha. “I’m a firm believer that God gave us that gift.” The duo said they've passed through Montgomery quite a bit. If you’d like them to stop and play a while, they’re available for bookings. You can keep up with Allison & Tabitha on their site alisontabithaofficial.com, as well as on Facebook @AlisonTabitha, Twitter @ABTSMusic, Instagram at alisondabitha, and check out their music on YouTube at Alison Tabitha. You can also contact them at 850-326-7675 or through email at ABTSMusic@gmail. *** "Big and Loud” for the Lord Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share The group Big and Loud perform Friday, Nov. 11, at the National Peanut Festival in Dothan, AL. Contributed Jason Lewis of Dothan has an act through which he’s surrounded by family and friends. He’s the lead singer and writes most of the band’s songs. “My 18-year-old (Grayson) plays lead guitar, and my 16-year-old (Brianna) plays drums,” said Lewis. “A friend of ours (Chad Jackson) is the bass player. We’ve been together since probably 2006, or so. A few different people in the band from year to year. For the past couple or three years, it’s been my family and a couple of other folks.” Lewis said that the band is a ministry for him and his family. They’ve got a true Southern sound - outlaw country gospel -  that’s firmly rooted in faith with tunes like "Live 4 Jesus," "Streets of Gold," "Man Up," "You Must Be Born Again” and "The Battle is on." You can check out their music online at reverbnation.com/bigandloud “We have a good time with it,” he said. Buy Photo Jason Lewis of the group "Big and Loud."  (Photo: Shannon Heupel/Advertiser) The “Big and Loud” band name comes from the band's origins back in 2005. Back then, they were trying to raise funds to go preach the gospel on the west coast. They didn’t want to wash cars, and were better at eating cookies than baking them. “Me and a friend (Jeff Batchelor) started the band. We were doing a vacation bible school,” said Lewis. "Well, the friend who was going to sing with me, we were just going to pick some old gospel songs and sing and write a few for the kids. His sister-in-law saw us. My friend’s 6 foot 5, 350 pounds, so he’s a big guy. Jokingly, she said, ‘Y’all can be Big and Loud.’ Apparently, I was the loud one. And it just stuck.” Lewis said Big and Loud has played the Montgomery area quite a bit, and that they’ve done a lot for area motorcycle group gatherings. You can keep up with them on Facebook @bigandloudband. *** Congratulations to Tatyana Webb  Buy Photo Tatyana M.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 4, 2016 -- 11:50 GMT (04:50 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Like Sam's Club, BJ's Wholesale concentrates its Black Friday PC deals largely on HP laptops and desktops. Two of the three major warehouse retailers have had their Black Friday ad leaks in the last couple of days: First Sam's Club and now BJ's Wholesale club (Costco remains a holdout.) Like its Walmart-owned competitor, BJ's has no Apple iPad deals listed, but does have a couple of different tablet deals, despite the device's fall from trendiness. In a special that's not only reminiscent's of last year, but also likely to be repeated widely, BJ's has Amazon's Fire 7-inch tablet on sale for just $33.33, or a little more than $15 off the normal price. Expect to see it priced similarly elsewhere, including on Amazon.com itself. Sam's Club has a 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A deal in its ad, but BJ's is going smaller (and cheaper) with a 7-inch model of the same Android tablet that's $89.99 (or $50 cheaper than BJ's current price) and includes a 16GB microSD card. BJ's is also touting a couple of specials on Microsoft Surface devices, but be aware that one of these deals is available today if you are a member of the warehouse club (despite the ad saying the prices are exclusive to the November 20 to November 28 time period). The Surface Pro 4 tablet with Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of solid-state storage is on sale for $749.99, or $250 less than what Microsoft's store is currently selling it for. (But what BJ's is selling it for now.) BJ's also has the Surface Book 2-in-1 laptop (previous generation with Core i5, 8 gigs of RAM, 128GB of storage) for $1,299.99, or $250 off the price BJ's sells it for today.

The three HP laptops specials are comprised of: the 15-ay071nr with Core i3-5005U processor, 8GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, and 15.6-inch screen ($349.99 or $150 off current price); the more powerful 15-ay068nr (Core i7-6500U, other key specs the same as the 15-ay071nr) for $499.99 (also $150 off); and the still more powerful Envy with Core i7-7500U chip, 12GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and full HD 15.6-inch display ($699.99 or $200 less than current price). Rounding things out are a pair of Lenovo notebooks and an actual gaming desktop. As with the Surface Pro 4, the Lenovo Z41-70 laptop already has the same price that BJ's is touting for Black Friday. The $499.99 portable includes a Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, and 14-inch full HD display. The Flex 3 2-in-1, on the other hand, is $120 cheaper than the regular price of $549.99 for November 18 through November 28 time period. It comes with a Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, and a 14-inch full HD touchscreen that possesses 360 degrees of rotation. At $979,99, the CyberPower Gamer Xtreme desktop is $220 less than the current price and features a Core i7 processor, 16 gigs of RAM, a 1TB hard drive and a 120GB SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Pay Can Now Be Used For Donations Posted: Nov 14 2016, 4:56pm CST | by Noel Diem, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Apple has announced that they will work with nonprofits, allowing them to take donations using Apple Pay. This will include Apple Pay on the internet as well as on mobile apps. There are hopes that it will increase charitable giving. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock Apple previously had a rule that iOS apps couldn't collect funds for charities or fundraisers using Apple Pay. It means that if they collected funds, they'd have to go through Safari or SMS. Now they will be able to go straight through the app. On mobile, users will be able to use TouchID. Online, users can click the Apple Pay button and confirm using iPhone or Apple Watch. Already, online stores that take Apple Pay have said that conversion rates are up and customers check out faster, according to TechCrunch. The reason that this system works is because everything is streamlined. Apple Pay has millions and millions of customers, and will add more each and every week. The technology is integrated into many iOS apps. In fact, Apple Pay transactions have increased by nearly 500% and more were made in one month this year than in all of last year. Many nonprofits are launching Apple Pay, including the following: American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors Without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, Save the Children, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision and WWF (World Wildlife Federation). A few others will join soon.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us VUDU version 5.0 now available, movie rental downloads for your Android By John Hoff - November 14, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter After Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, you’d find a gaggle of movie and video streaming services and apps trying to catch up to the big three up there. Netflix and video streaming are practically synonymous already, and it will take a lot to battle them for “king of the hill” honors. That said, VUDU is still alive and putting out a new version of its movie streaming service and app, with a couple of new features you may appreciate. VUDU is owned by Walmart, and it is one of those services where you can either rent or buy movies either in standard or in high definition. Much like Google Play Movies, it will allow you to watch your movies on any supported device. VUDU version 5.0 brings new features that you may like, including offline rentals and downloads. If you’re traveling for the holidays, you might want to have a movie or three on your tablet or phone to help you pass the time on that plane or train ride. VUDU’s new offline download feature allows you to save on data charges and watch your movies offline. You can download either rented movies or ones that you already purchased, and take it with you on your trip. Lastly, there’s a new VUDU-exclusive “Extras+” feature, where you can access bonus clips, behind the scenes content, storyline extras, filming locations, and all that stuff made for movie fans like you and me. Download or update your version of the app via the Google Play Store.

City manager Byron Smith told the council on Monday that organizers of the Grand Floral Parade approached the city about sending a float to the 2017 parade. “It would be a great way to showcase our community,” Smith said. The parade has a “mini-float” program with slots for 15 Oregon cities each year to put a small float built around a golf cart in the parade. The floats must be made of all organic material, such as flowers and different colors of seeds and beans. Hundreds of thousands of people turn out for the parade each year or watch it on television. Mayor David Drotzmann said he thought the parade would be an “awesome opportunity” to show off the city’s new logo and brand to people across the state. Councilors said it would be important to begin now to find community volunteers willing to spearhead the effort and make sure the final product was something the community could be proud of. “It’s a great idea but very, very labor intensive at the end,” Jackie Myers said. The city does not have to officially commit until February, so councilors directed staff to begin searching for community members interested in taking the project on. The Rose Festival will take place the weekends between May 27 and June 12. On Monday the council also re-approved its financial policies and approved a supplemental budget. The city had expected to pay to drain the lagoons at the recycled water treatment plant during the previous fiscal year but did not do so until later in the summer, meaning the money had to be re-appropriated into the 2016-2017 budget. Draining the lagoons of solid waste and taking it to the landfill cost $1,390,100 plus $9,880 for engineering costs and $22,220 for pump repairs. Smith said there was more material in the lagoon than expected, which is why the cost came close to $1.4 million instead of the $1 million the council was told last year. “Forty percent is a big miss,” Drotzmann responded. “Wasn’t that the engineer’s job to tell us?” Smith said it was the first time emptying the lagoons with the new wastewater treatment system, which filters more solids out of the water than the old system, so in the future the engineers will have a better idea of costs. On an unrelated note, he reported that the city tested all of its drinking fountains and none of them had dangerous levels of lead. The first few minutes of the council’s regular session were packed with people in red shirts bearing the words “I Love My City.” The shirts are part of a campaign by Hermiston Assembly of God to spread acts of service and positivity around the city. “It’s good to see a full house and I love to see what’s on the T-shirts the full house is wearing,” Drotzmann said. He said the group was helping their community without any expectation of reward, but he felt it was important to invite them to the council meeting to recognize their work. Pastor Terry Haight said he had gotten calls from 10 different religious leaders since the group’s first activity in October, asking to help out with future projects. They will be providing free gift wrapping in the Wal-Mart parking lot the weekend before Christmas and hope to continue performing acts of service throughout the coming year. The city council meeting began with a work session about rules for the city committees. Smith said there had been some confusion about vague rules — whether city council representatives to the committee counted toward a quorum, for example. The council discussed adjusting the size of some committees and making rules about terms and other aspects more uniform across committees. They also supported Smith’s suggestion of holding a training with committee members, particularly committee chairs, on public records and public meeting laws. Smith said he would work with city attorney Gary Luisi to draft an ordinance spelling out rules for committees and bring it back to the council at a later date. ——— Contact Jade McDowell at jmcdowell@eastoregonian.com or 541-564-4536.

Plenty giving thanks at Holding Court Carol McAlice Currie and Carlee Wright , Statesman Journal 7:32 p.m. PST November 15, 2016 Yvonne Dynneson with St. John's Lutheran Church at Holding Court on Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016. (Photo: MOLLY J. SMITH / Statesman Journ) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Yvonne Dynneson stopped by to thank the community for attending previous workshops that St. John Lutheran Church in northeast Salem has hosted. She said this past spring, an information event about active-shooter situations, run in cooperation with the Salem Police Department, was "very informative and well attended." So she hopes the church's next event, to be held this afternoon, will be equally helpful to local residents. Beginning at 1:30 p.m.Wednesday, Nov. 16, St. John's will host a "crime prevention during the holiday season" session. Salem Police Officer Mark Jantz will be on hand to talk to residents about what they can do to stay safe not just during the holidays, but all year long. "He's going to tell us about what we can do to keep our homes, families and businesses safe not just now, but throughout the season," Dynneson said. There is no charge to attend. The general public is welcome and light refreshments will be served. She said the event was planned during the day to avoid having participants drive at night in inclement weather. Free parking is available in the church lot or on-street in front of the church. It will be held in Room 101 in the church basement. Bob Reinhardt and Leah McMillan with Willamette Heritage Center at Holding Court on Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016.  (Photo: MOLLY J. SMITH / Statesman Journ) History in the News to vet 2016 election Leah McMillan said in the wake of last week's presidential election, some might find it difficult to give thanks, but putting the election into historical perspective might help. And the Willamette Heritage Center is hosting its final History in the News program for 2016 this Thursday, Nov. 17, and it's aptly named "Election Reflections." She, along with her husband,  Bob Reinhardt, the center's executive director, say the event will consider historical precedents for the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath. "With this series, we are always looking for parallels and differences, and we engage our audience in discussion and dialogue. This is not a political series or a debate forum. It's about putting current events into historical context. It's looking at the present and seeing what's similar and what's different. It's about how people responded to contentious elections in the past, and making history relevant." Reinhardt is hopeful the three professional scholars assembled for the roundtable can shed some light on the past to help put the present in context. Panelists are Seth Cotlar, professor of history at Willamette University with a specialty in the years between the American Revolution and the Civil War; Ellen Eisenberg, Willamette University's Dwight & Margaret Lear Professor of American History who has also researched the history of American immigrant and ethnic communities; and Richard Ellis, Willamette's Mark O. Hatfield Professor of Politics, who has written on the subject and whose works include "The Development of the American Presidency," The Heritage Center is expecting a full house for the timely and topical event, which is free and open to the public. The Taproot Lounge & Cafe will be selling beer, wine and hard cider as well as appetizers during the event. Parking is free in front of the center, and the 5:30 to 7 p.m. discussion will be held in the Dye House. The series History in the News will resume in February following a holiday break. Joseph Harchanko with Harchanko Music Academy at Holding Court on Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016.  (Photo: MOLLY J. SMITH / Statesman Journ) Twenty cellists gather for performance Joseph Harchanko is hoping the community will be thankful for a free cello concert being staged by the Harchanko Music Academy this Sunday, Nov. 20. The free event will feature 20 cellists from grade 1 through adult. All are current or former students of Harchanko, and while many are students there are a few professionals thrown in. Harchanko is the music director at Montessori Discovery Center in Salem as well as the principal cellist with the Salem Symphony. Harchanko is pretty excited about the program for the performance. It will feature music from the British science fiction television series "Dr. Who" as well as works by Ludwig Van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Johannes Brahms and others. The performance will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at Loucks Auditorium at the Salem Public Library, 585 Liberty St. SE. There is no charge or tickets required to hear the cello choir arrangement, which will include all 20 cellos playing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" from his Ninth Symphony.

SMITH / Statesman Journ) Union Gospel Mission gives thanks Sharalyn Bechtel and Jenny Dunham of the Union Gospel Mission stopped by to give thanks to every last member of the community. The two women acknowledged that without the generosity and help of the gracious Salem community, the mission would not be able to provide its guests with a Thanksgiving feast next Thursday. Grateful for a $63,000 Walmart Community Grant, the mission was able to buy a refrigerated food truck, which allows it to safely picky up food donations from its community partners and transport it back to the mission. "We are locally and privately funded, which means we can't thank the community enough for helping us out," Bechtel said. Dunham said since 2010, the men's mission downtown has had its meals-served numbers go up by 61 percent. Shelter nights in the same time period are up a staggering 121 percent. Increases have also been posted at the Simonka Place for women and children in Keizer. "It's the community that helps us help others," Bechtel said. This year, the community has provided board games, turkeys and other foodstuffs to serve next week. The women didn't ask for anything from Holding Court, but we're going to mention that they still could use potatoes, fresh salad greens to serve a nutritious meal, and hams and turkeys to help increase the size of protein servings. And as always, the mission can use clean socks, razors, and men's underwear in all sizes as well as twin-sized blankets and light-colored sheet sets. Anyone wanting to drop off some of the above-needed items can stop by the donation center at 901 Front St. NE. Donation pick-ups can also be arranged for larger amounts by calling 503-763-0219.

Quilters Gail Grier and Crystal Matti came to share the news about the shop that opened a year ago. Everyone is welcome to drop in, check out the store and admire the quilts that decorate the walls. Plus there will be cake and refreshments, too. The shop currently features a display of quilts created by members of the Mid Valley Quilt Guild. “The guild puts on a challenge every year. This year it was using your initials to come up with an artistic quilt,” Crystal said. “A quilt called ‘Jelly Beans on the Beach’ won.” The guild’s ongoing projects include comfort quilts and pillowcases for wounded soldiers, women and children in shelters. For Alzheimer's patients, they create “fidget quilts,” which feature tasks and a variety of textures that help stimulate memory, said Crystal. Visit midvalleyquiltguild.com for information.

SMITH / Statesman Journ) Save the date Corban University junior Jonathan Bos and sophomore Lilly Davidson were handing out scarves at Holding Court to promote Cross Walk, a walking event on Jan. 1, 2017 designed to raise funds to support victims of violent crimes in Marion County. “We want it to be bigger and better than ever,” said founder Mary Lucas, who started the walk as a way of taking back the park after she was assaulted at Salem's Riverfront Park on Jan. 1, 2011. “It’s about taking tragedy and making it good,” Mary said. “All money raised goes directly to Marion County Victims Assistance. We’ve raised $60,000 raised to date." Brian and Nina White of Paramount Real Estate Services have supported the event since its inception. “I am encouraged and inspired by people who don’t let things get them down,” Brian said. “Let’s take back the park and life. It’s a great message and cause.” The annual family-friendly walk, which begins and ends at Salem’s Riverfront Carousel, is approximately 1.5 miles. It begins at 10 a.m. Jan. 1, at the park, 200 Water St. NE. Cost is $20. Children 13 and younger are free. Register online at crosswalksalem.org. For information, contact Mary Lucas at 503-931-3856 or email CrossWalkSalem@gmail.com. Author Pamela Lindholm-Levy holds her book "Count the Mountains" at Holding Court on Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016.  (Photo: MOLLY J. SMITH / Statesman Journ) Read all about it Pamela Lindholm-Levy visited to tell us about her novel “Count the Mountains.” The Portland-based author grew up in Salem — South Salem class of ‘57 — but moved to Colorado after college. “My work and love for the mountains made this story start brewing in my head,” Pamela said. The story, which takes place in the late 1800s, is about a woman who moved to Denver with her father expecting to strike it rich in gold, but when her father dies she is left without prospects. After expanding her knowledge and skills while assisting a doctor in mining town, she finds herself working at a hospital. A storm arrives and with it an unexpected patient from her past brings surprising complications to her settled life. Inspiration came from Pamela’s experience while working in a hospital as a tuberculosis bacteriologist, combined with the sights, sounds and history of Colorado. Her book is available online at Amazon.com. Parking for Holding Court Marlene Blanchard, owner of the Court Street Dairy Lunch restaurant, took a moment out of her busy schedule to remind folks driving downtown to attend one of the weekly Holding Court installments that there is plenty of free parking at the Chemeketa Parkade. She said with the holidays fast approaching, streetside parking downtown will be about as much fun as poking a sleeping bear. She recommends instead parking in the parking structure and cutting through the one-block alley to the restaurant.

Has Brand America invited trouble? By Delshad Irani & Ravi Balakrishnan, ET Bureau | Nov 16, 2016, 05.18 AM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » presidential elections | Karan Johar | Donald Trump #TrumpWins! Has Brand America invited trouble? Is Brand America in trouble after a “nasty” election and #TrumpWins? The world knows a few different versions of the United States of America. The Hollywood version. The Karan Johar version. The America of Apple, Google, and Silicon Valley. There’s also the New York City version, a bubbling cauldron of culture with more accents than there are Indian restaurants. Then there’s the side of America we just recently came up close and personal with during one of the most watched and debated US elections ever. Democracy’s most powerful device turned into a brain-cell murdering reality TV show nobody could take their eyes off. Sort of like a train wreck, Bigg Boss or badly dubbed kung-fu films that populate English movie channels after-hours. Try as hard as you will, you just can’t ignore it. “The world just got slapped with Middle America” says Publicis’ managing director and chief creative officer, Bobby Pawar, a man who lived in the States for quite a while and has Green Cards there like many of us; American kin, friends, and acquaintances, who are still reeling from shock, and therefore have bumped up the number of visits to their therapists’ couch from once to thrice a week. Pawar talks of the America that promoted a reality TV star cum businessman with murky dealings, no political experience, fanboys in the Klan, and an exceptionally limited grasp on not just the English language but also bare human decency, to the most powerful office in the kingdom. It’s this America that has shattered some illusions we might have harboured about the land of opportunity in our processed and pre-packaged ‘American Dream’. It has definitely affected America’s image as a brand believes Sanjay Tripathi, senior EVP and head – marketing, analytics, digital and e-commerce at HDFC Life: “As children, we always considered it a place where everything was better compared to India. Growing up, you discover the truth about a lot of your childhood fantasies and this was the last bastion. The run up was not good for either candidate. What was missing is traits you expect in a leader.” What the run-up to the 2016 US Presidential Elections and Donald Trump’s win have proved is that America is not what it seems. It’s not all Starbuckscup totting progressive folk, where order, civility, equality, and common sense prevail. “The election race was not very presidential,” says Arthur van ’t Hoog, designer, illustrator and co-creator of Worldwide.Vote, a site that invited people from across the world to choose between the two candidates and accurately predicted a Trump victory; “It seems the inimitable rhetorics and conspiracy theories have resulted in some sort of ironic reality show.” BBDO India’s chairman and creative chief, Josy Paul was in the States on Election Day. He described the mood as “crazy energy and excited disbelief!!!!” on the faces of everybody from limo drivers to Madison Avenue suits. Speaking from an upscale bar in NYC, he said, “There’s a visible rift. The elections seem to have uncovered the fault lines in the States. It is less USA and more DSA - The Divided States of America! Hatred was in the air during the run up, and it was being fuelled and fed by the media!” The “nasty” battle fought over who gets to be the person who dictates the world order and a bunk in the master bedroom at the White House and Trump’s eventual win has turned America into “a global punchline,” says Lisa Leone, who, earlier this year, disrupted the ad world with her essay on dealing with sexism in the industry. And now her next President will be a man who, conceivably, thinks sexism and misogyny don’t exist. Just like climate change is a massive hoax perpetrated by scientists and endorsed by President Barrack Obama. #Elections2016 and #TrumpWins have put a dent, or ten, on Brand America. Marian Salzman, CEO, Havas, PR believes “we are damaged at home and abroad and also our confidence in one another -- in how we think it pays to be American is shot.” Probably with a shotgun bought at the neighborhood Wal-Mart. Simon Anholt, whose initiative Global Vote gave people across the world a virtual say in the election, (and where, unlike Worldwide.Vote, the choice was Hillary Clinton), echoes Salzman’s sentiment; “His (Trump) view that the only way to serve the American is by doing a disservice to the rest of the planet is very old-fashioned, and ultimately does a disservice to America as well.” Leone, who like many other Americans watched in horror as the votes were tallied and Trump was declared President-Elect, does not mince words; “While pundits can theorise ‘this might just be what we needed’ it will take strength, love and some kind of magic for anyone other than white, straight Christian males to live through the next 4 years.” Backing her view is a rash of reports across Facebook and Twitter on the rise of casual racism. However, the good honest truth is most will still probably jump at the chance to live in the US of A, even if it must be Trump’s America. Says Paul, “The fact that we in India are so fascinated by the American elections tells us that the gravitational pull has not diminished. The dream is still intact. Just that the bubble has burst and you can see the imperfections. It’s the time for acceptance and reconciliation. I guess that’s how iconic brands evolve and become great again!” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

REGISTER SIGN IN Stocks just gave up an important advantage they've held over bonds Business Insider Nov. 15, 2016, 10:08 AM The recent bond market sell-off lifted Treasury yields to their highest levels of in a year.  That jump pushed the benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield above the dividend yield on the S&P 500 for the first time since last year. Before this reversal, investors who were seeking higher yields flocked to the stock market as global bond yields continued to fall and even turned negative in some countries. Specifically, investors bought into so-called bond proxies like utilities and consumer staples stocks that tend to offer stable, bond-like returns. However, those proxies have been "decimated" since President-elect Donald Trump won the election last week, said Dave Lutz, the head of Exchange Traded Funds at JonesTrading. That's because there was more competition from the higher-yielding bonds that these stocks are proxies of.  In November 2015, Fundstrat Co-founder and Strategist Tom Lee said "stocks are the new bonds" after the S&P 500 dividend yield jumped above the yield on the benchmark 10-year note. Lee also identified companies like Walmart and Coca-Cola, whose dividend yields were higher than their corporate-bond yields at the time. This reversal in dividend and bond yields should not lower the appeal of bond proxies, according to Kelly Bogdanov, a portfolio analyst at RBC Wealth Management. For one, bond yields surged to levels most forecasters didn't see coming as investors bet that Trump's fiscal-spending plans would boost domestic demand and inflation. However, there's still considerable uncertainty about when and how infrastructure spending will rise, and some strategists cautioned that traders were getting ahead of themselves with their bets on higher inflation. On Tuesday, Treasurys rallied and yields fell for the first time in a  week.   "While high-yielding dividend stocks may have fits and starts in coming months as the bond market adjusts to the Trump administration, we continue to believe they should be core holdings for income-oriented investors," Bogdanov said in a recent client note. "Fundamentals are still sturdy; cash flows are strong. As interest rates stabilize, these stocks should follow suit. In the meantime, they kick off attractive dividend payments."
