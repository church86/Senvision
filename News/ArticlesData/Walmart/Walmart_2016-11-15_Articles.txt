Walmart invests in employees with training academy Kayla King-Sumner , The Republic | azcentral.com 8:33 p.m. MST November 14, 2016 The "Pathways" program is a training initiative aimed at increasing growth opportunities for employees nationwide. Rita Adams grins after completing a floor training exercise at a Walmart in Peoria. (Photo: Kayla King-Sumner/The Republic) Rita Adams has been selling jewelry at a Peoria Walmart for years, and she still arrives to work five days a week with the same radiant smile, resilient attitude and southern chuckle. "This is my career," said 52-year-old Adams. "I raised my family out of it." Adams started working for Walmart in 1996 in her small Mississippi hometown, and when she moved to Arizona in 1999, she had a job waiting for her. Her career with the nation's largest private employer allowed her to buy a house and send herself and three daughters to college, she said. Now, Adams seeks a promotion to jewelry-department manager. She has enrolled in Walmart's "Pathways" program, a training initiative aimed at increasing growth opportunities for employees nationwide. The program is part of a $2.7 billion investment in training and wage increases for employees, announced in 2015 as Walmart trailed competitors in customer-service ratings and employee satisfaction. Walmart plans to establish 200 Pathways academies across the country before the end of 2017, according to the company. Arizona academies Laura Roberts, 36, trains Walmart supervisor Anna Jordan, 21 to be a department manager at Walmart.  (Photo: Kayla King-Sumner | The Republic) Walmart held its first Arizona academy-training sessions for employees at stores in Gilbert and Mesa in August. The company employs about 35,000 people in the state. The Peoria Walmart where Adams works houses the company's third Arizona academy, serving staffers from more than 20 nearby Walmart stores. The academy includes a newly built classroom and school area in the back of the store where staff members attend eight-hour class sessions. Employees in the academy must attend four days of classroom training before advancing to practical training in the store. Adams completed a practical exercise Monday, a mock sale of an engagement ring. Nathan Seals, one of the store's associate department managers, played the customer. AZCENTRAL Study: Getting a college degree in Arizona pays off Academy students choose from several areas of study, including core leadership, merchandising, operations, technology and customer service. Then they continue on to training specific to the department in which they currently work, such as jewelry or produce. Laura Roberts, 36, started working for Walmart 18 years ago. She said her mentors helped her advance as a professional and a leader in the company. "I was kicked out when I was 16," said Roberts. "This is like (my) second family." Now a department manager, Roberts is training 21-year-old supervisor Anna Jordan in the Peoria academy. Jordan started working at Walmart immediately after high school to support herself. She said her favorite aspect of academy training is team-building activities to build a friendlier and more efficient staff. AZCENTRAL McDonald's 'Hiring Day' seeks to fill 3K jobs in Arizona Employees 'empowered' Walmart spokeswoman Delia Garcia said leadership is one of the company's most important core values, as laid out out by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon when he announced the investment into employee training and wages last year. Garcia said Walmart has cleaner stores and a better-paid staff as a result of the multibillion-dollar move. "We’re seeing that associates are feeling more empowered in their jobs," Garcia said. "Customer experience scores have gone up for the past eight quarters." Walmart aims to provide academy training for all of its approximately 140,000 employees in the future, Garcia said. The Peoria academy students will have their graduation ceremony at the Walmart on Peoria Avenue. "You can be whatever you want to be," said Adams, the longtime employee turned trainee.

Vaughan Lisbon said the store was always truck-friendly in the past and he had been using the parking lot for three months. Lisbon left his truck at the Walmart on Garners Ferry Road on Friday before heading out of town for the weekend. When he returned, his truck and others were gone. Lisbon said he noticed a “No Unauthorized Vehicle” sign, but he believed that sign was a new one. However, Walmart said the sign has been up for two years. After picking up his truck from the impound lot, Lisbon acknowledged that Walmart has the right to implement the rule on its private property, but he said the misconception that all Walmart lots were open to overnight parking was a costly one. "Why would they do it without giving prior notice to what they were going to do?" Lisbon said. "All they needed to do was put a sticker on the vehicles letting them know not to park there anymore." Walmart released a statement on the matter. "Permission to park in our store lots is extended by individual store managers, based on availability of parking space and local laws." Store officials said you should always check with managers before leaving a vehicle overnight.  Copyright 2016 WIS.

Michael A. Barlow pleaded guilty in Kingston's Ontario Court of Justice to one count of vandalism, theft of gasoline, night prowling at the Village Green Apartments near the Kingston Centre, two counts of illegally possessing methamphetamine and subsequently violating bail, which forbid him possessing or consuming street drugs. He was given enhanced credit on 14 days of pretrial custody and sentenced to time served. Justice Allan Letourneau was told that Barlow was initially charged on Sept. 28 after a man who'd parked at the 700 Sir John A. Macdonald Blvd. apartment complex returned to his car just before 5:30 a.m and found Barlow underneath it working with tools. Assistant Crown attorney John Skoropada said the surprised owner asked him what he was doing and Barlow replied, "working on my car," at which point the real owner of the silver Dodge called Kingston Police. Officers arrived just in time to catch Barlow pulling out in his SUV, Skoropada told the judge, and immediately detected a strong smell of gasoline emanating from inside his vehicle. It was only later discovered, according to the Crown prosecutor, that two other vehicles parked on the property had small, freshly punched holes in their gas tanks. Barlow was arrested on the spot and, when searched incident to arrest, was found to be in possession of 0.37 grams of methamphetamine. He was then released on bail, but on Oct. 3, five days after his initial arrest, federal Crown prosecutor Chantal Proulx said, Barlow again drew police attention, this time with his driving. She told Justice Letourneau an officer was patrolling on Montreal Street, travelling south when he saw Barlow's vehicle ahead of him swerve twice. He consequently pulled it over and she said the constable, upon approaching the driver's side, immediately noticed numerous empty baggies littering its interior; a number of tools, including bolt cutters, lying loose on the floor; and a Pepsi can that he suspected was a fake used to hide valuables. Further investigation, she said, discovered a hypodermic containing 0.3 grams of liquid methamphetamine in the rear of the vehicle, which was a direct violation of one of Barlow's release conditions. Barlow told Justice Letourneau: "I know I did wrong." But he said he's been desperate since losing his job. He claimed he "has bipolar depression," and has been turned down for every form of social assistance since losing his job. Justice Letourneau, in pronouncing sentence, commented on the danger of his particular criminal enterprise. He told Barlow he would have thought puncturing gas tanks to siphon gas risked causing an explosion. And if his circumstances really are as desperate as he claims, the judge told Barlow: "I would hope you wouldn't add crystal meth to that equation." syanagisawa@postmedia.com Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » Heating and Cooling Haven Home Climatecare Funeral Services Cataraqui Cemetery and Funeral Services Travel & Lodging Delta Kingston Waterfront Go to the Marketplace » Local Businesses Advertise with us Contribute Send Your Scoop!

The expiration of Walmart Distribution Center’s 10-year Enterprise Zone property tax abatement means a 5.71 percent increase to the EAV in the district. That number has been stagnant in recent history, so a bump such as this doesn’t happen often. How rarely does it happen? “Never,” Tim Schwingle, the district’s director of finances, said with a laugh. “It’s been a long, long time – 10 to 15 years maybe – since it’s gone up that much.” Wednesday night, the school board will recommend levying $12.175 million for the 2016 levy year. The preliminary levy will be on file 30 days before the board will vote to adopt it at its December meeting. It will also vote on approving $333,333.33 to pay down its bond and interest levy. If that’s approved, the owner of a $90,000 home would see about $66.57 come off the school district portion of his or her taxes in 2017. “Not a huge amount, we understand,” Superintendent Tad Everett said. “But in this environment, when you look at other taxing bodies in neighboring communities, and even locally, where we’re not getting any funding increase from the state of Illinois, other bodies are really raising our tax rates.” The levy extension’s increase of $215,000 is 4.84 percent more than last year’s. The district gets between $1.5 million and $1.6 million in extra revenue from the 1 percent sales tax bump Whiteside County voters approved in November 2014. While pitching the tax bump to its residents, Sterling school district officials said they’d use a portion of the added revenue to abate $1 million in taxes over the next 4 years. The state’s budget quagmire prevented that plan taking effect last year. “Because of the governor’s threat or option to freeze property taxes across the state, had we reduced our tax rate at that time, it would have been extremely detrimental, due to the funding formula for schools,” Everett said. Tax abatement is one of the district’s chief financial goals, along with maintaining a balanced budget, which it had done 4 years running, meeting short-term facility needs, planning for long-term facility needs and lowering the overall tax rate. Residents can rest assured that there is no “gotcha” moment coming down the pike, Schwingle said. “This isn’t one of those, ‘Oh yeah, it will come down, but next year, they’ll jack it right back up.’ Our long-term projections show that our rate will remain this low, or maybe even decrease in the future. “Even when the abatement process goes away, it should be this low or lower in the future.” WHAT'S AN EAV? The equalized assessed value, or EAV, is the result of applying the state equalization factor to the assessed value of a parcel of property. Tax bills are calculated by multiplying the EAV (after any deductions for homesteads) by the tax rate.

I look at my traditional education as theological training, not the place I learned to pastor. I learned to pastor by watching my dad, Pastor Joe. When people think of a pastor today they often think of one of two people – the white-collared single guy or the Jesus rock star presenting the gospel like a flashy 80’s concert. Both get smoke. The former calls it incense, the latter calls it haze. I actually like both. However, as you move out of the big city and head into small communities, there is another type of pastor that becomes more prominent. They don’t make much money, wear hipster clothes, or have Twitter accounts. They are, well, normal. They wear clothes from Walmart and drive used cars. My dad is that type of pastor, and my knowledge of what it means to be a pastor is heavily influenced by him. He loves his people, he loves the community. I have many memories of him compassionately praying early Sunday morning at the altar for people by name. I visited the hospital with him more times than I can count. As a kid, I would watch my dad look into tear-filled eyes and encourage people facing terminal illness or the loss of a loved one. Those people loved him, and he loved them. I would listen to my dad passionately practice sermons on Saturday nights. He really did write and give his very best to those that attended the churches he worked in. He wasn’t on mission to be famous, but to participate in life with people. To him, being a pastor looks less like a shrewd CEO and more like a loving spiritual counselor. To him, what makes church great isn’t as much the quality of the rock show, but the health of the family. Dad loves knowing people, and people love knowing Dad. If you were to ask him why it’s worth it, he would simply say something like this: “I’m just trying to love people like Jesus would.” Today, I get to be a pastor. The truth is I am still learning. I’m not sure I have figured it out, but I know this. As I grow older I want to be a pastor like my dad. Loving Jesus, loving people, loving the community.

Tuned in: Ashmore’s Store artist coming to Montgomery Shannon Heupel , Montgomery Advertiser 5:46 p.m. CST November 14, 2016 Michael Koppy (Photo: Contributed) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE We have a very unique artist coming to Montgomery on Sunday at the Renaissance Exchange downtown. Michael Koppy performs 7:30-10 p.m. Depending on how many songs he does, that might give him enough time to work in his awesomely original, unique “behemoth” song “All in the Timing: A Hollywood Romance in Seven Chapters.” It’s a 27-minute song that’s on his new album/book “Ashmore’s Store.” The Tallahassee, Florida native actually recommends listening to it while driving. “Turn off the cell phone, slip it in the car player and drive across town,” said Koppy. He said the idea to take the song on the road came from a music critic in San Francisco. His book contains a tale of Ashmore’s Store, a real-life place that was owned by Robert Roy and Ethel Ashmore in his hometown. It speaks for small-town stores everywhere - centers of old communities, places to find what you need, people who know you. That store and its people got to know a lot about young Koppy, and he about them. It’s a life that forged Koppy into who he was as a young man, and who he is today. He was a musician as a young man, and reignited his music career after a 25-year career producing concerts, TV and musicals. Koppy is currently on his “The One Great Mornin’ Tour of Dixie,” which is taking him from Annapolis, MD, to Austin, Texas. The tour started on Nov. 5, and he is playing every single day through Dec. 4. It’s quite a marathon, and Montgomery is kind of in the middle of all that. That’s quite a trek, but nothing compared to what he did in his youth, going from ocean to ocean by hitch-hiking and hopping trains. This is a truly unconventional album, and I kind of love it. The book has the lyrics to the songs, including the lines he struck out of the recorded versions. It’s also beautifully illustrated and packed with stories and notes. The CD that comes inside the book has 10 songs - “River,” “Behind Every Great Fortune,” “Nineteen Years Old,” “‘Till Hell’s Dang Done Froze Over,” “We Shall Overcome,” “All in the Timing,” “The Cloths of Heaven,” and “Track Ten.” Along with Koppy, there are a host of other musicians on the album - Norman Hamlet (Merle Haggard & the Strangers), John McEuen (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), Woody Paul (Riders in the Sky), Richard Greene (Bill Monroe & the Bluegrass Boys), Roy Blumenfield (The Blues Project, Seatrain), Nicole Emery (Bob Dylan, Rickie Lee Jones), Cliff Carothers (Malice), and more. You can find “Ashmore’s Store” at Barnes & Nobile, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, eBay, HeartlandMusic.com, CCMusic.com and other book and music stores. Price range averages to be a little more than $30. Follow Koppy on his site michaelkoppy.com. *** Notes from the land of nuts… peanuts, that is In the words of the awesome show “Monty Pyton’s Flying Circus,” and now for something completely different. I’m a firm believer that God puts you where you need to be. The rest is often up to you to figure out. This past weekend during a family trip to Dothan for the National Peanut Festival, I believe He put me in the path of a couple of unique music acts that I might otherwise never have met. One is a pair of award-winning best friends, the other a ‘Big and Loud” family group who are no strangers to Montgomery. Both are gospel groups in their own ways. It was a beautiful night, and they were playing the "local stage" set up near the fair’s action, just down from the entrance to the rides and across from a huge picnic area were families could rest, eat and enjoy the shows. Kids were running around playing, battling with inflatable swords and dragging around stuffed animals. A roving magician was working the crowd doing sleight-of-hand tricks. The music from the stage was mixed with the sounds from the crowd and the rides, and it was just heavenly. There’s no other way to describe it. Having just come off of Montgomery’s own Alabama National Fair, I’ve got to say that I like this particular Dothan set up better for the local music acts. It puts them out in the open, near the action. Don’t get me wrong, I like Garrett Coliseum. I just think it works better having the acts out near the crowd, instead of expecting the crowd to come to the acts, especially when it’s not the headliner shows. And the mobile covered stage they use, which is owned by the city of Dothan, is something Montgomery would be wise to invest in. Anyway, let’s get to the music groups, both of which have origins that stem from faith. *** Meet the duo Alison & Tabitha Buy Photo Tabitha Shucker, left, and Alison Bunge of the duo Alison & Tabitha  (Photo: Shannon Heupel/Advertiser) Alison Bunge and Tabitha Shucker of the duo Alison & Tabitha are a pair of college students from northwest Florida finding their way, and their faith, through music. If you haven’t heard them perform before, you should. It’s a mix of message and talent that I truly enjoyed. There’s a reason these young women are the Alabama Music Association's New Gospel Duo of the Year, as well as being the 2016 National and International Adult New Gospel Duo of they Year, which they earned in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. “We’ve been friends for probably 15-plus years. Best friends for about 9,” said Tabitha. “God really aligned us. It’s His blessing to work and minister with my best friend.” “We really didn’t think that we would be doing something together,” said Alison. “We’ve always been told that ‘You should do American Idol’ or you should do this or this, but nobody really ever added the two of us together.” Early on, Alison said she and Tabitha were kind or rivals in their singing. Alison was interested in being a recording artist, while Tabitha leaned toward Broadway music. They said that it took acts of faith and humility to put them on a gospel singing duo path less than three years ago. “We knew that there was something more to our lives, like a calling. A purpose,” said Tabitha. They wanted to do music that they felt meant something more in the long scheme of things. That’s how they found their way into contemporary Christian music. They wanted to sing about God and the hope that Jesus offers. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t love the ‘80s music,” said Alison. “But ultimately, we know that they’re talking about a person. They’re glorifying a person.” “There’s so many people who are all talented, because God gives us all different gifts,” said Tabitha. “Well, you know what? It takes a calling to do something. Just like David had to have God behind him when he slung that stone and hit Goliath in the head, you have to have God behind you.  Really, we find that the only real meaning to singing is to glorify God." They’re currently working on a new album, which will be released early next year. “We’re the best at procrastination,” said Tabitha. “I’m a firm believer that God gave us that gift.” The duo said they've passed through Montgomery quite a bit. If you’d like them to stop and play a while, they’re available for bookings. You can keep up with Allison & Tabitha on their site alisontabithaofficial.com, as well as on Facebook @AlisonTabitha, Twitter @ABTSMusic, Instagram at alisondabitha, and check out their music on YouTube at Alison Tabitha. You can also contact them at 850-326-7675 or through email at ABTSMusic@gmail. *** "Big and Loud” for the Lord Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share The group Big and Loud perform Friday, Nov. 11, at the National Peanut Festival in Dothan, AL. Contributed Jason Lewis of Dothan has an act through which he’s surrounded by family and friends. He’s the lead singer and writes most of the band’s songs. “My 18-year-old (Grayson) plays lead guitar, and my 16-year-old (Brianna) plays drums,” said Lewis. “A friend of ours (Chad Jackson) is the bass player. We’ve been together since probably 2006, or so. A few different people in the band from year to year. For the past couple or three years, it’s been my family and a couple of other folks.” Lewis said that the band is a ministry for him and his family. They’ve got a true Southern sound - outlaw country gospel -  that’s firmly rooted in faith with tunes like "Live 4 Jesus," "Streets of Gold," "Man Up," "You Must Be Born Again” and "The Battle is on." You can check out their music online at reverbnation.com/bigandloud “We have a good time with it,” he said. Buy Photo Jason Lewis of the group "Big and Loud."  (Photo: Shannon Heupel/Advertiser) The “Big and Loud” band name comes from the band's origins back in 2005. Back then, they were trying to raise funds to go preach the gospel on the west coast. They didn’t want to wash cars, and were better at eating cookies than baking them. “Me and a friend (Jeff Batchelor) started the band. We were doing a vacation bible school,” said Lewis. "Well, the friend who was going to sing with me, we were just going to pick some old gospel songs and sing and write a few for the kids. His sister-in-law saw us. My friend’s 6 foot 5, 350 pounds, so he’s a big guy. Jokingly, she said, ‘Y’all can be Big and Loud.’ Apparently, I was the loud one. And it just stuck.” Lewis said Big and Loud has played the Montgomery area quite a bit, and that they’ve done a lot for area motorcycle group gatherings. You can keep up with them on Facebook @bigandloudband. *** Congratulations to Tatyana Webb  Buy Photo Tatyana M. Webb performs her original songs at the Montgomery Advertiser on Sept. 19, 2016.  (Photo: Shannon Heupel/Advertiser) Finally, just a short note of congratulations to Tatyana Webb, who is an alum of the Advertiser’s original music series and, more importantly, a Troy University student who gave an awesome performance Sunday for her senior recital. She sang in French, German, Italian and English. Webb is a member of POPulus, which is the American Pop Ensemble at Troy University. You can find her 9 track album ‘Unconditionally Beautiful” on iTunes, Spotify, Google Play and Amazon.

You can also email me at sheupel@gannett.com, or give me a call at 334-202-2348. I’d love to share your information, either in an upcoming River Region Tuned In column or in the Go Play Calendar.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 4, 2016 -- 11:50 GMT (04:50 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Like Sam's Club, BJ's Wholesale concentrates its Black Friday PC deals largely on HP laptops and desktops. Two of the three major warehouse retailers have had their Black Friday ad leaks in the last couple of days: First Sam's Club and now BJ's Wholesale club (Costco remains a holdout.) Like its Walmart-owned competitor, BJ's has no Apple iPad deals listed, but does have a couple of different tablet deals, despite the device's fall from trendiness. In a special that's not only reminiscent's of last year, but also likely to be repeated widely, BJ's has Amazon's Fire 7-inch tablet on sale for just $33.33, or a little more than $15 off the normal price. Expect to see it priced similarly elsewhere, including on Amazon.com itself. Sam's Club has a 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A deal in its ad, but BJ's is going smaller (and cheaper) with a 7-inch model of the same Android tablet that's $89.99 (or $50 cheaper than BJ's current price) and includes a 16GB microSD card. BJ's is also touting a couple of specials on Microsoft Surface devices, but be aware that one of these deals is available today if you are a member of the warehouse club (despite the ad saying the prices are exclusive to the November 20 to November 28 time period). The Surface Pro 4 tablet with Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of solid-state storage is on sale for $749.99, or $250 less than what Microsoft's store is currently selling it for. (But what BJ's is selling it for now.) BJ's also has the Surface Book 2-in-1 laptop (previous generation with Core i5, 8 gigs of RAM, 128GB of storage) for $1,299.99, or $250 off the price BJ's sells it for today. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Like Sam's Club, BJ's PC deals are skewed heavily towards HP, though it does have a couple of Lenovo models in the mix unlike its competitor. The three HP laptops specials are comprised of: the 15-ay071nr with Core i3-5005U processor, 8GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, and 15.6-inch screen ($349.99 or $150 off current price); the more powerful 15-ay068nr (Core i7-6500U, other key specs the same as the 15-ay071nr) for $499.99 (also $150 off); and the still more powerful Envy with Core i7-7500U chip, 12GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and full HD 15.6-inch display ($699.99 or $200 less than current price). Rounding things out are a pair of Lenovo notebooks and an actual gaming desktop. As with the Surface Pro 4, the Lenovo Z41-70 laptop already has the same price that BJ's is touting for Black Friday. The $499.99 portable includes a Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, and 14-inch full HD display. The Flex 3 2-in-1, on the other hand, is $120 cheaper than the regular price of $549.99 for November 18 through November 28 time period. It comes with a Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, and a 14-inch full HD touchscreen that possesses 360 degrees of rotation. At $979,99, the CyberPower Gamer Xtreme desktop is $220 less than the current price and features a Core i7 processor, 16 gigs of RAM, a 1TB hard drive and a 120GB SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Pay Can Now Be Used For Donations Posted: Nov 14 2016, 4:56pm CST | by Noel Diem, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Apple has announced that they will work with nonprofits, allowing them to take donations using Apple Pay. This will include Apple Pay on the internet as well as on mobile apps. There are hopes that it will increase charitable giving. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Apple previously had a rule that iOS apps couldn't collect funds for charities or fundraisers using Apple Pay. It means that if they collected funds, they'd have to go through Safari or SMS. Now they will be able to go straight through the app. On mobile, users will be able to use TouchID. Online, users can click the Apple Pay button and confirm using iPhone or Apple Watch. Already, online stores that take Apple Pay have said that conversion rates are up and customers check out faster, according to TechCrunch. The reason that this system works is because everything is streamlined. Apple Pay has millions and millions of customers, and will add more each and every week. The technology is integrated into many iOS apps. In fact, Apple Pay transactions have increased by nearly 500% and more were made in one month this year than in all of last year. Many nonprofits are launching Apple Pay, including the following: American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors Without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, Save the Children, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision and WWF (World Wildlife Federation). A few others will join soon.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us VUDU version 5.0 now available, movie rental downloads for your Android By John Hoff - November 14, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter After Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, you’d find a gaggle of movie and video streaming services and apps trying to catch up to the big three up there. Netflix and video streaming are practically synonymous already, and it will take a lot to battle them for “king of the hill” honors. That said, VUDU is still alive and putting out a new version of its movie streaming service and app, with a couple of new features you may appreciate. VUDU is owned by Walmart, and it is one of those services where you can either rent or buy movies either in standard or in high definition. Much like Google Play Movies, it will allow you to watch your movies on any supported device. VUDU version 5.0 brings new features that you may like, including offline rentals and downloads. If you’re traveling for the holidays, you might want to have a movie or three on your tablet or phone to help you pass the time on that plane or train ride. VUDU’s new offline download feature allows you to save on data charges and watch your movies offline. You can download either rented movies or ones that you already purchased, and take it with you on your trip. Lastly, there’s a new VUDU-exclusive “Extras+” feature, where you can access bonus clips, behind the scenes content, storyline extras, filming locations, and all that stuff made for movie fans like you and me. Download or update your version of the app via the Google Play Store.

The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the city of Hermiston will provide bus service in Hermiston beginning Jan. 2. Buy this photo Hermiston’s free public bus system is about to become a reality. The Hermiston City Council approved a contract with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation on Monday to begin the service on Jan. 2. Under the contract, Kayak Public Transit will provide a fixed-route bus service free to any member of the public for at least 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. The route will loop through Hermiston once each hour, stopping in residential neighborhoods as well as grocery stores, medical clinics and government buildings. The bus will also provide doorstop service for qualifying disabled residents who cannot reach a bus stop on their own but live within three-fourths of a mile of a stop. “This is a great start,” city councilor Rod Hardin said. “It’s something that’s been needed here for years.” The city expects to spend $125,000 on the first six months to get the system up and running, then apply for federal 5311 transportation funding that CTUIR planning director J.D. Tovey told the council he doesn’t “see any reason” would be withheld. If those funds come in and other projections hold true the city expects to spend an estimated $150,000 per year to subsidize both the bus system and the city’s taxi ticket program for senior and disabled residents. Mayor David Drotzmann said fiscal conservatives might question why the city would not charge for bus rides. But Tovey said Kayak Public Transit currently has a ridership of 80,000 per year and has calculated that it would not be cost-effective to charge riders until it hit 250,000 per year due to the rules of the tribal transit grant that funds the majority of the system. “Any income we take in counts against that grant,” he said. He said routes and schedules will be found on the CTUIR’s website for now, but they are also working on a separate website and a mobile app that would allow riders to use GPS to track where the bus is and when it will next arrive at a stop. Assistant city manager Mark Morgan said the city would love to add more hours to the bus schedule but for now this is what it can afford. He said some people had questioned why the route did not start earlier or end later to accommodate the work day, but pointed out that many Hermiston residents without cars do shift work. The Wal-Mart Distribution Center, Hermiston’s largest employer, runs shifts from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. for example. He said the city has surveyed taxi ticket riders the past three years and has discovered that more than half of their rides take place in the afternoon, and two thirds of rides are either to Wal-Mart or Good Shepherd Medical Center. Morgan said one in five Hermiston residents live in a “food desert” at least one mile away from a grocery store, and those people are disproportionately Hispanic residents living on the west side of town. The bus system can help them get to the store without carrying groceries more than a mile. Councilors and the mayor said they were excited to see the system finally come to fruition after years of work. Doug Primmer said gathering input from the community and working with the transit advisory committee that put together the recommendation was “the best process I’ve ever been involved with.” “Where else are you going to get this much bang for this much buck?” he asked. The council voted unanimously to approve the contract with the CTUIR. A survey asking for opinions on names for the new bus system is still open at www.hermiston.or.us until Nov. 28. ——— Contact Jade McDowell at jmcdowell@eastoregonian.com or 541-564-4536.

Illustration by Matt McClane The lingering smoke from area wildfires has sent dozens of patients to local hospitals, and it is a particular threat to those already suffering from lung or heart diseases, doctors said Monday. CHI Memorial hospital's emergency room saw 37 patients in the last 24 hours, according to emergency room physician Dr. Jeff Visser. "That's a significantly higher number than we would normally see," he said. "We normally would see probably half of that in a given normal-air-quality day." Erlanger reported seeing 19 patients in its emergency room since Friday, and nearly 120 in the past two weeks, also above normal levels. The threat is especially severe for those who already have trouble breathing. "The smoke consists of particulate matter that is in the air," Erlanger hospital lung specialist Dr. Patrick Koo said. "People with lung problems inhale it and then they get inflammation of the airway, and as a result they close down their airways and are more short of breath — they wheeze." "Anybody with a chronic lung condition like asthma is at significant risk just because of their underlying lung problem," Visser said. "Even healthy people can be significantly affected if they are trying to exercise outside." Both Visser and Koo advised people with lung or heart problems to stay indoors if possible. "You can wear one of those cup-shaped masks you can buy at Wal-Mart if you have to be outside," Visser said. Those having trouble breathing should call their doctors, Koo said. Physicians can prescribe steroids to reduce the inflammation caused by the smoke particles, he said. "If their symptoms are watery eyes and a cough — that would be limited and would get better. That is more of an annoyance than anything," he said. "But patients who get worse and have more shortness of breath, or their cough becomes uncontrollable, that's when they basically should contact their lung doctor." The problem is not limited just to humans. Trees and other vegetation are also in trouble from the extreme drought that has spawned the wildfires and may suffer long-term problems, according to Chattanooga city arborist Gene Hyde. "Long-term drought equals stress, and stress on trees means they are more susceptible to attacks by insects and diseases," Hyde said. "The long-term effect of stress will play out over several years. It is not just a short-term deal that ends once the rain starts." Hyde said trees with shallow root structures such as dogwoods and maples are particularly at risk. If there is no ban on watering in their area, homeowners should bring out a soaker hose or sprinkler and saturate the area around those trees for several hours, he said. He said he is also concerned that after the fires are put out, areas where they burned will be subject to soil erosion. "If you have a big area of bare soil, you open up that area to invasive species," Hyde said. He mentioned privet as one plant that often will take over a newly burned space, covering it with a dense cover of vegetation that prevents native trees such as maples or oaks from sprouting.

To help benchmark the companies that are doing it right Lithium Technologies studied how well Fortune 1,000 retail brands are engaging with consumers across social platforms.   The State of Social Engagement 2016 showed that retailers are prioritizing engagement, collaboration with influencers and online communities in order to bolster customer satisfaction, and ultimately, sales.   In fact, it is reported that customers are willing to spend up to 20% more with a brand if that brand responds to their social media activities.   Of eight retail brands studied (Sephora, The North Face, Amazon, Target, Nike, Walmart, REI, lululemon atheltica), highlights include: Sephora and Amazon had the highest engagement on online communities; Target and Nike did a particularly good job of co-creating content with influencers; and all eight brands used Instagram for visual storytelling, with North Face, Nike and Sephora being the strongest.   For more on their performance including key metric like Facebook and Twitter response times click here for the full story.

Rumors have emerged that the leading name in e-commerce is evaluating and testing plans for retail store concepts with the potential to create a footprint of 2,000 locations across the country. How viable is this strategy, and what kind of impact would it actually have for a company generating over $120 billion in annual revenue? Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Nov 14, 2016 at 7:46PM The company that people associate most with the incredible rise of online shopping wants to turn the retail industry upside down once again. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Fool.com contributor Dan Kline joins Vincent Shen to discuss recent reports that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is pushing forward with a number of brick-and-mortar retail projects in its hometown of Seattle and other areas across the country. Should early test locations prove successful, the company could launch as many 2,000 locations, integrating the technology and convenience that have made it the e-commerce leader. The cast also considers the profit potential behind such an expansion and the many challenges Amazon will have to overcome if it is to succeed with physical stores. Also, the hosts take a look at the upcoming launch of DirecTV Now, the state of competing over-the-top television services, and how an AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) merger (and other deals like it) might affect cable channels in the future. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 8, 2016. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Tuesday, November 8th, and I am your host, Vincent Shen. A nice surprise for this week -- joining me in studio today is Fool.com contributor Dan Kline. How are you doing, Dan? Dan Kline: Very nice to be here, Vince! Thank you. Shen: Correct me if I'm wrong -- this is your first time shooting in studio for Industry Focus, right? Kline: Yes, absolutely. Shen: How do you feel so far? Kline: It's different. Usually I can't see you, which is a little bit harder to do. If anybody has watched these and sees me looking off in a weird direction, it's because I did not have a video feed when I'm at home doing these. Shen: Yeah, I have to say, Sean, who does the energy show on Thursdays usually, with Motley Fool analyst, Taylor Muckerman, I'm very jealous of the fact that they always have two people in studio, riff off each other. It's a lot harder to do that when we're beaming in via Skype. Kline: We'll try to make it a habit every now and then. Shen: Yes, absolutely. We're covering a few different topics today. First one is the new release coming from DirecTV, which is their DirecTV Now service. Some details have leaked out, in terms of pricing, some of the channels that are available, how it will work. Can you give us a few details on that? Kline: It's all a little bit sketchy, but it feels like it's between what Dish is doing with Sling. Sling is basically 20 channels for $20, and you can add $5 add-on packs. It's a little more than that now, but it's roughly that. Sony, which has pretty much a cable-like product starting at $39.99, going up to about $59-$69. It appears it's going to be about $35 for the basic AT&T DirecTV package, but we don't know what you're going to get. We figure you're going to get some of the channels you want. ESPN, TNT, TBS, CNN, and then you'll be able to add on other ones. So, it's kind of a mid-price product, and it's clearly a cord-cutter product. But I go back to what we talked about a lot. I still don't see who this is for. It's not that much cheaper than cable, and it's a lot less convenient. Shen: I know that some of the initial reports indicate a package of as many as 100 channels, but that's not really what you're getting for $35, right? Kline: Right, the 100 are going to be if you add on all the different add-on packs. I had a Dish subscription where I bought everything -- well, maybe not quite everything (I didn't get the Spanish language channels), but everything in a language I speak. And it cost maybe $60. You add HBO, and you're at $75. So, you're not that different from the roughly $106 or something that average cable bills come out at. So, this is a case of, if you are a cord-cutter who wants access to certain programming, you can get it, but it's not going to be the cheapest service. It's sort of a middling service, and local channels are going to be very sparse. There are some local market deals, just like Sony has, where maybe in New York you can get NBC, and in Los Angeles you can get Fox. Even then, there's a lot of restrictions on what programming you get -- like, maybe you don't get NFL games, or maybe local something is locked out. Shen: From my understanding, a lot of these services, as you mentioned, in terms of those major local networks, thinking about CBS and NBC, ABC, it does kind of depend on what market you're in. Sometimes, if you're in a larger metropolitan area, you might get them, but otherwise... Kline: In a lot of cases -- like with the Sony offering -- you get access to, let's say, NBC. I believe NBC is a partner. You get access to their prime-time shows, but you could get those through other means -- at least eventually. What you don't get is the local news. So you're still missing out on the weather. Not that you can't get the weather other places, but school closings, and some of the things that make a local TV convenient. Nobody has figured out how to put that into a digital package yet. Shen: Sure. Another question, and another view into some of these services, the fact that with this DirecTV Now package, they can deliver some of the live content that maybe a lot of current viewers who are still attached to their linear cable packages have been hesitant to give up because of that live content. Do you think that is a differentiator? Or is that something that, again, is just not maybe enough of the value compared to that basic cable package? Kline: This is a me-too product. Every cable operator has some sort of skinny bundle, digital streaming product, somewhere in the works. Maybe somebody doesn't, but most of them do. What hasn't been shown is consumer demand. It seems logical that a younger person who has never paid for cable, or a family that goes, "Oh my god, my bill is too big," would say, "I want to spend $35 and get my favorites out of here." The problem is -- and I've written about this for families -- as a family, I have a wife and a child, and we all watch different things. So, I can't get the $20 Sling TV. I have to get everything they offer. It's going to be the same thing with this. So, as one person, or just you and your wife, this might make sense, especially if you don't have cable, and you want to watch basketball on TBS, and your wife wants to watch a couple of other shows. But these seem to me like very niche products, and they're being developed for market that has not proven to exist yet. Shen: OK. Last question, and it's relevant to the very big announcement that AT&T had recently, regarding its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. How do you think, assuming that deal goes through and makes it through the regulatory hurdles, how does that play into this, in terms of their ability to offer some of that exclusive content from Time Warner? They have a pretty good portfolio, powerful networks and content. Kline: I think the reality is, you can't make that much exclusive. Maybe you could take a specific artist you have under contract, and say, "We get a 90-day window on this." But it's not like you can take a cable network and say, "We're not going to sell it to the other 95 million cable homes." AT&T already has some of its own networks. It has the audience network, which has Dan Patrick and a couple of other shows. And it's nothing that would change your mind on getting a subscription. So, I think there's an advantage in that they can make favored nation deals for what they pay themselves, but probably a condition of that merger getting approved is that they don't do that, that if they're only going to charge themselves $1 for the channel for a digital subscriber, they're going to have to offer the same terms to Dish. They're not going to let AT&T-Time Warner strangle Sony, and Dish, and whoever else is coming down the pike. Shen: My last question -- and this has to do with the bigger-picture view of this industry and where some of these packages and services are going. There was a Comcast-NBCUniversal deal. Now there's this potential AT&T-Time Warner deal. Do you feel like the fact that the distributors and the content creators coming together is eventually going to give them the ability to offer some of the a-la-carte packages that so many consumers have been begging for at this point? Kline: I think we're going to see a lot of things go out of business. In the skinny bundle world, let's pretend I watch The Cooking Network, and maybe 200,000 people at prime time are watching it. But I'm not going to pay $6 a month to watch it. If you don't have to pay your $0.0005, or whatever the carriage fee is, to get it and not watch it, it's just going to go away. So yes, you might see some exclusive, really interesting content. But I think you're going to see more of the other edge as these things consolidate. Look at what's happening with ESPN. As less people subscribe, ESPN is going to spend less money on programming, or I'm going to pay more to get ESPN. At some point, they're going to lose some college deals, and things are going to spread out more. And it creates opportunity, but it's also going to put some stuff out of business. Shen: OK, totally understood. For our next story, here, this news came out a week or two ago, and as additional details for the plans for the company we're speaking about, which is Amazon. It's with their physical stores that they seem to be interested in launching. I think they surprised a lot of investors and industry followers last year when they started dabbling, last year, in their first physical retail locations. The thing is, the company often tests and experiments with these new ideas in its home city of Seattle. First it was bookstores. The company has now launched small pop-up stores, think mall kiosks, several hundred square feet of retail space. Not very big, but enough to feature things like its Kindles, its Amazon Echo speaker. So, a lot of these locations, it appears, have resonated with consumers. The company might be expanding that, and those efforts, during the holiday shopping season. But I think the bigger potential impact for the company, for its revenue, for its top line and bottom line, seems to be with groceries. This potential test they're doing with 20 grocery stores in cities like Seattle, Las Vegas, New York, Miami, and San Francisco -- it's called Project Como. What do you think? Kline: It's peculiar to me. I understood the logic of launching stores where I sell you a Kindle or an Echo, because when you buy a Kindle, or Fire TV, or whatever it is, I then have a pathway into your living room. So, I can run that store at a loss, but I'm making money off of you buying content for the rest of time, or at least for a few years, until you have to throw the device away. Going into the small grocery store -- and these are going to be interesting models where you can order online and pick up, and maybe select some produce, and pick your fish, but not have to pick your cereal -- it's all, frankly, models that consumers have rejected, in terms of 10,000 different grocery delivery start-ups that have gone out of business. I get it -- the goal is to build the distribution network, to make it more logical for Amazon to have a warehouse in your neighborhood. They're not just delivering to your house, they're also supplying this warehouse. They can move produce faster. But these are commodity items. It's not like Amazon can price broccoli dramatically better than Kroger can [laughs]. So, I don't see why I would go to it. Prime and getting deliveries to my house -- that makes sense to me. Having to show up to Amazon to get Lucky Charms, when they sell Lucky Charms at the Publix near my house -- it doesn't make sense. Shen: I will counter that, to an extent, just to give some additional detail on what Amazon is looking at. The company is going to be testing a ton of different store formats. Some of the details that we do have: Some locations might be around 30,000 square feet, which is just a little smaller than you would see in your typical supermarket. Kline: It's like a Whole Foods. Shen: Exactly. Those would be the larger establishments. Then, they would have small convenience-store setups, and some of these pickup-focused locations that would be 10,000 square feet. Another caveat for access and the market size for this opportunity is, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that for initial testing of these locations, they will actually be exclusive, potentially, to current AmazonFresh members. So, recently, it seems like the company has seen a little bit more success in terms of profitability with that. They've lowered the price from $300 a year to about $15 a month. That has been encouraging for the company. What do you think about the potential exclusivity? Kline: It becomes a bit of a Costco model. We've talked about this a hundred times -- Costco makes roughly 75% of its revenue from membership fees, so it encourages you, whether it's Prime, or Fresh, or whatever Amazon calls the membership, it gives you more incentive to join, which has been a driver for sales. I see the logic of that. But 2,000 stores built around groceries? If they targeted to the market, and they said, "This store is going to have groceries, this one is going to sell products, this one's going to have books..." But, it seems like a very specific offering. We just did a story that the overrun between Amazon and Costco is really high. A lot of people have memberships to both. So, once again, I don't know. You have the bottom-line numbers. It's not that big of a revenue swing for the company. Shen: Just to give everybody a little bit of details, you mentioned 2,000 locations -- based on the current planning, if the tests are successful, the company sees... Kline: And this is wildly speculative, in terms of where we are. Shen: Yeah. The company sees a potential rollout of 200 store openings per year, eventually reaching that network of 2,000 locations that you mentioned. Again, you touched on this earlier: The idea is they get supply through some of the innovation they've seen in the distribution centers, the expansion of that network. The company is constantly perfecting that part of the logistics. Kline: Everything they do makes the math better on their distribution network. So, they can use one warehouse to supply trucks, drones, grocery stores, blimps that throw fruit at you, whatever it is. Obviously, everything costs less. Shen: The thing is, the size of the opportunity, if they were actually able to get it out to that kind of scale, thousands of locations, it is sizable in the fact that the grocery business makes up about 20% of consumer spending in this country. It's like an $800 billion industry -- pretty large. Right now, with their current Fresh model with the delivery, that's like a sliver, like 2% of that market. Kline: Do you do the grocery shopping in your house? Shen: My wife and I do it together. Kline: Do you go to the grocery store? Shen: Yes, we absolutely go to the grocery store, because we prefer that experience, being able to pick our produce and things like that. Kline: My wife and I split the shopping, and we go to two different grocery stores: the one that's closest to our house, and the Whole Foods that's second closest. If an Amazon opened, even though I'm a devoted -- I buy from Amazon almost every day, I have an Echo, I use a Kindle, I have Fire TV -- if Amazon opens half a mile down the road from Whole Foods, I would go there twice a year as a novelty. Shen: [laughs] Kline: I think that's the model for grocery stores. Unless you can be an Aldi, or something that's a really different shopping experience, am I really going to drive farther? Shen: Yeah, but isn't the potential there, if there's a company that can really gather the data on what people want, and potentially curate the product offerings so people are like, "This is really a place I want to go; it has everything I need." Kline: Amazon does have patents on knowing what you're going to order before you've ordered it. You've already picked your Christmas gift -- I don't even have to order it. Shen: I have an interesting excerpt, here. GeekWire managed to get ahold of planning documents. They describe how one of these new retail operations might operate. I think it's really interesting, I want to share it with the listeners. It says, "When placing an online order, customers will schedule a specific 15-minute to two-hour pick up window. Peak time slots will sell out, which will help manage traffic flow within the customer parking adjacent to the building. When picking up purchased items, customers can either drive into a designated parking area with eight parking stalls where the purchased items will be delivered to their cars or they can walk into the retail area to pick up their items. Customers will also be able to walk into the retail room to place orders on a tablet. Walk in customers will have their products delivered to them in the retail room." So, a lot of different options there. Kline: I mean, it's very smart, but there's a lot of customer education. Shen: This kind of reminds me, frankly -- maybe not the pick-up aspect, but the tablet order, for example -- of the new small-format stores that Whole Foods have launched with their 365. They've integrated a lot of technology into those locations. In terms of the handful of locations that are currently open, it seems like early results are quite positive. So, maybe that is a proof of concept, to an extent, for what Amazon sees, here. Kline: It is. And McDonald's has had great success in Europe moving to a tablet ordering model. It does take people out of the equation, so these become cheaper stores to run. If you can manage the parking lot, you don't need as big of a parking lot, so your rent becomes lower. So in theory, you start to have significantly less overhead, and maybe you can put that into pricing. But, once again, it's solving a problem that might not be there. It's not that hard to get groceries. Non-perishables, Amazon can deliver me. I don't know that I want to get my produce or my meat without touching it or looking at it. And we've seen a lot of rejection of that model. So, I get it, New York, Seattle, there are going to be markets where convenience is key. But in suburbia, where people are already driving to places, it just seems like a very niche focus. And a 30,000-square-foot store is not a small store. These are not 1,500 square foot hyper-focused warehouses. They're still pretty big footprints. Shen: Yeah, that requires a lot of planning, in terms of finding the right locations. It's expensive to develop larger stores. Kline: They have picked a good time to be in the real estate business. There are a lot of Sears that are now available. [laughs] Shen: [laughs] True. So, a somewhat related topic around in-store pickup, and how some of the more traditional big-box retailers are leveraging this, I want to touch on this, again, related to the growing popularity of this delivery method for customers. About 20% of Americans, in a PwC survey, say they use in-store pickup on a regular basis, which really surprised me. About half of the survey respondents use in-store pickup occasionally. So, some of these traditional big-box retailers -- think Wal-Mart, think Target -- they have to deal with a lot of the challenges of integrating ship to store, in-store pickup capabilities into their established retail layouts. So, thinking of, how you optimize your staffing, how you store your inventory, how you separate your work spaces. But, I would argue that Amazon has an advantage, here, in that they're building their stores around this concept. Kline: They are. The chief person for this is either the person who feels their product is going to get stolen if it's delivered to their door, or, in the case of where I've used pick-up in-store at Target, when my wife wanted to pick up the sheets at our vacation condo, but have me pick them up. So, she ordered them in Connecticut, I picked them up in Florida, same day. Now, what Target's doing to facilitate this is, they're going to have dedicated personnel, at least for the holiday season, devoted to doing this, because the problem with pickup in-store has been, it's a bit like when you go to Panera Bread and they have the Order Ahead, yet no two stores do it the same way, and you never know where your bagel is [laughs]. So, you walk into Target, and basically, you were a pioneer doing something that the person behind the counter didn't necessarily know the procedure for. Maybe it was in the layaway area, maybe it was in the set-aside area, maybe they had to go pick it off the store shelves. So, absolutely, they have stepped up how they do this, but I do think it's something that...the holiday season, it makes a lot of sense. You need things faster, you want gifts when you want them. If it's the hot TV, you want to make sure you have already ordered it so you don't go to the store and have it be out. But is there really a huge demand for this in August? Shen: OK. So, you mentioned some of the potential top- and bottom-line impact. Jeremy Bowman, one of our Fool.com contributors, he has a really interesting piece on some of these developments that we've discussed at Amazon. He dug a little deeper into the numbers to estimate what the potential financial impact a 2,000 store network could have for the company. He uses some comparable metrics and numbers from leading grocery chain Kroger. The idea is, 2,000 locations, assuming about 30,000 square feet of retail space, and what Kroger can generate per square foot, currently, in sales -- it's about $40 billion of grocery revenue. So, I think, in the last 12 months, Amazon has had about $120 billion in revenue. So, that's significant. Granted, this would be over many, many years in order to get to that. Kline: And what's the margin on that? Shen: Exactly. That's, I think, the point that Jeremy really hits -- significant addition to the top line, but in terms of those razor-thin margins, think 2%-3% for the grocery industry overall. That's adding less than $1 billion to the bottom line while using those benchmark figures. So, you see, it is not going to be this huge profit driver for the company. But, even if it doesn't scale to that thousands of locations, it's just part of Bezos' strategy to get Amazon to be a bigger and bigger part of your life. Kline: The question comes down to, how can they leverage their user base? I'm a Prime member, so [are] about 25% of all Americans. If they can message to me and get me into that store, where perhaps I'm going to pick up my groceries, maybe I'm going to get a new Kindle, and maybe they can sign me up for an AWS account, all at the same time, while providing the ability to return without putting it in a box. If they can leverage all of those things, I see convenience. But that's not cheap. One of the reasons Amazon is cheaper is, they don't have the customer service expense of a physical store, because it's all automated. If you want to do a return, you click return and it sends you a shipping label, and you send it back, and a robot puts it away. So, I can see how it would work, but it does seem like a lot of effort for nothing. I would rather see 2,000 bookstores.

For those of you unfamiliar with their work, The Southern Poverty Law Center is one of the premier groups fighting hate crimes and racial violence. They are responsible for the financial takedown of the Ku Klux Klan in numerous wrongful death cases against African-Americans. And surprise! They are outright alarmed by the Trump presidency. CAROL COSTELLO: Richard Cohen is President of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Thank you so much for being with me this morning. So we have been talking a lot about Steve Bannon. Used to run Breitbart. He said he's a member of the alt-Right, White nationalists embrace him. What do you know about Steve Bannon? RICHARD COHEN, SPLC: You know, Bannon said he is providing a platform for the alt-Right and the alt-Right is nothing more than White supremacy rebranded for a digital age. He's been their mouthpiece. Mr. Priebus saying -- I feel sorry for Mr. Priebus because now he's made a deal with the devil. He has to support Bannon. But I think anyone who goes to the Breitbart website and looks at the kind of things that are out there I think would be shocked. COSTELLO: So I have heard people say we have checks and balances in this country so why are we worrying so much, this is just one voice in Mr.Trump 's administration. COHEN: Well, the white supremacists on Stormfront today are saying Bannon has Mr.Trump 's ear. It's not entirely surprising what Trump has done. Trump ran a racist campaign from the first day he came down that escalator at Trump Tower. He brought Mr. Bannon in not simply because Mr. Bannon is smart, not simply because Mr. Bannon is talented but because Mr. Bannon himself is a White nationalist. So it's disheartening to see him in the administration, especially after Mr.Trump said oh, he was going to bind the wounds of division. It's disheartening but quite frankly not entirely surprising. COSTELLO: For a lot of Trump supporters, they don't believe Mr. Trump ran a racist campaign. He was just saying things that needed to be said, that needed to be out in the open so that we could deal with it as a nation, to even the playing field. ↓ Story continues below ↓ COHEN: Look, when you start calling Mexicans rapists, when you say that we should ban Muslims from the country, when you say horribly misogynist things and when you mock the disabled, I don't see how people of good will can defend you. COSTELLO: So in real world terms, because your organization keeps track of the number of minorities who are harassed in this country, what are you seeing? COHEN: We are seeing a lot of ugliness and it's widespread. We have tracked more than 300 incidents since Mr.Trump was elected of anti-immigrant vitriol, of vandalism, anti-immigrant, anti-black, anti-LGBT and it's incredibly widespread. We are seeing it at Walmart, seeing it on the street and seeing it most especially in schools and universities. COSTELLO: How much has it spiked? Is it just in a few cities across the nation? Is it -- like how would you characterize it? COHEN: It's really something that we are seeing across the country from New York to California, from Michigan down to Florida. It's very very widespread and very very ugly. I wish Mr.Trump would speak out forcefully. Yesterday on "60 Minutes" he said he had seen one or two instances of it. He must not be reading the newspaper or getting his news feeds because it's quite widespread. COSTELLO: Now, some Trump supporters might suggest that you are ignoring the attacks on Trump supporters out there on the part of minority groups. COHEN: We are not. We have them on our website as well. We are not ignoring anything. But the attacks from theTrump people are much greater. Let me say, it's not surprising. White supremacists out there are celebrating Mr.Trump 's people are saying he's given them new hope. Some white, very prominent white supremacists have told their people go out and make people feel unwelcome. Go out and make them feel afraid. Unfortunately, that's what's happening. I highly recommend following the SPLC on Twitter and keeping up with their defense against hate crimes based on bigotry and racism: Small gesture but we’ve changed our profile pic. We stand everyday against bigotry and hatred.

Bannon will “push Trump in the right direction,” suggested Richard Spencer, president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute. “That would be a wonderful thing.” “It makes sense to me,” added Brad Griffin, author of the white nationalist website Occidental Dissent. Bannon “will hold Trump to the promises he has already made during the campaign,” Griffin added. “We endorse many of those promises like building the wall, deportations, ending refugee resettlement, preserving the Second Amendment.” hate crimes, Southern Poverty Law Center, Steve Bannon, white nationalism Click here for reuse options!

Brady Briefing Room 3:35 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Hello, hello. Hello, everybody.  In a couple hours, I’ll be departing on my final foreign trip as President.  And while we’re abroad, I’ll have a chance to take a few of your questions, but I figured why wait?  I know that there’s a lot of domestic issues that people are thinking about, so I wanted to see if I could clear out some of the underbrush so that when we're overseas, and people are asking about foreign policy questions, people don't feel obliged to tack on three other questions to them. Let me -- I know you still will.  (Laughter.)  That I'm aware, but I'm trying something out here.  First of all, let me mention three brief topics.   First of all, as I discussed with the President-elect on Thursday, my team stands ready to accelerate in the next steps that are required to ensure a smooth transition.  And we are going to be staying in touch as we travel.  I remember what it was like when I came in eight years ago.  It is a big challenge.  This office is bigger than any one person.  And that’s why ensuring a smooth transition is so important.   It’s not something that the Constitution explicitly requires, but it is one of those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy -- similar to norms of civility and tolerance, and a commitment to reason and to facts and analysis.  It's part of what makes this country work.  And as long as I’m President, we are going to uphold those norms and cherish and uphold those ideals. As I’ve told my staff, we should be very proud that their work has already ensured that when we turn over the keys the car is in pretty good shape.  We are indisputably in a stronger position today than we were when I came in eight years ago.  Jobs have been growing for 73 straight months.  Incomes are rising.  Poverty is falling.  The uninsured rate is at the lowest level on record.  Carbon emissions have come down without impinging on our growth.   And so my instructions to my team are that we run through the tape.  We make sure that we finish what we started, that we don't let up in these last couple of months, because my goal is, on January 21st, America is in the strongest position possible and hopefully there’s an opportunity for the next President to build on that. Number two, our work has also helped to stabilize the global economy.  And because there is one President at a time, I’ll spend this week reinforcing America’s support for the approaches that we’ve taken to promote economic growth and global security on a range of issues.   I look forward to my first visit in Greece.  And then, in Germany, I’ll visit with Chancellor Merkel, who’s probably been my closest international partner these past eight years.  I’ll also signal our solidarity with our closest allies, and express our support for a strong, integrated, and united Europe.  It’s essential to our national security and it's essential to global stability.  And that’s why the Transatlantic Alliance and the NATO Alliance have endured for decades under Democratic and Republican administrations.   Finally, in Peru, I’ll meet with the leaders of countries that have been the focus of our foreign policy through our rebalance in the Asia Pacific.  This is a time of great change in the world.  But America has always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe.  And that’s what it must continue to be. Finally, on a personal note, Michelle and I want to offer our deepest condolences to Gwen Ifill’s family and to all of you, her colleagues, on her passing.  Gwen was a friend of ours.  She was an extraordinary journalist.  She always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession -- asking tough questions, holding people in power accountable, and defending a strong and free press that makes our democracy work. I always appreciated Gwen’s reporting, even when I was at the receiving end of one of her tough and thorough interviews.  Whether she reported from a convention floor or from the field, whether she sat at the debate moderator’s table or at the anchor desk, she not only informed today’s citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow’s journalists.  She was an especially powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity, and her intellect -- and for whom she blazed a trail as one-half of the first all-female anchor team on network news. So Gwen did her country a great service.  Michelle and I join her family and her colleagues, and everybody else who loved her in remembering her fondly today. So, with that, I'm going to take some questions.  And because Josh Earnest has some pull around here, he just happened to put at the top of the list Colleen Nelson of the Wall Street Journal.   My understanding is, Colleen, that this is wrapping up your stint here and you're going to Kansas City. Q    Correct. THE PRESIDENT:  Josh just happens to be from Kansas City.  (Laughter.)  So I didn’t know if there was any coincidence there.  But we wish you the very best of luck in your new endeavors.   Q    As it turns out, there’s no place like Kansas City. THE PRESIDENT:  There you go.   Q    You're about to embark on your final foreign trip.  What will you say to other world leaders about your successor?  They’ve expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump.  Should they be worried about the future of U.S. foreign policy?  And secondly, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now?  And who should lead your party? THE PRESIDENT:  One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander-in-Chief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President, it is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries, and our diplomats and other diplomats, and intelligence officers and development workers.  And there's enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world.  That will continue.   In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships.  And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance.  I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship, and a recognition that those alliances aren’t just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world. With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated and it's hard and it's challenging.  And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection.  I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation.  I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge.  That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.   The Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles;  The belief that we should an economy that works for everybody, not just a few.  The belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive.  That we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race, or gender, or sexual orientation, or what zip code they were born in.  That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn’t just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values. So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn’t be up for debate, should be our North Star.  But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about.  I believe that we have better ideas.  But I also believe that good ideas don’t matter if people don’t hear them.  And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere.  We have to show up everywhere.  We have to work at a grassroots level -- something that's been a running thread in my career.   I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall.  And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points.  There are some counties maybe I won that people didn’t expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.   And the challenge for a national party is how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for.  And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press story.  It’s increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press. And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up state parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you’re paying attention to, and state rep races and city council races -- that all I think will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future. And I’m optimistic that will happen.  For Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I’ve been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset.  Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally.  Republicans controlled the Senate and the House.  And two years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and four years later, I was President of the United States. Things change pretty rapidly.  But they don’t change inevitably.  They change because you work for it.  Nobody said democracy was supposed to be easy.  This is hard.  And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.  Mark Knoller. Q    Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  Good to see you. Q    Thank you.  Good to see you.  Mr. President, what can you tell us about the learning curve on becoming President?  Can you tell us how long it took you before you were fully at ease in the job, if that ever happens?  And did you discuss this matter with President-elect Trump? THE PRESIDENT:  About a week ago I started feeling pretty good.  (Laughter.)  No, look, I think the learning curve always continues.  This is a remarkable job.  It is like no other job on Earth.  And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues.  That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world.   If you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis.  Today, they’re seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing.  There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today it does. So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any administration has to deal with today -- and respond to much more rapidly than ever before -- that makes it different.  I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about two weeks before anybody reported on it.  Imagine that.  I think it’s fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they’ve got to figure out in about an hour what their response is. So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect.  It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation.  I hope it was.  I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about.  And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff -- particularly your chief of staff, your national security advisor, your White House counsel -- how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that ultimately the President is going to be the final decision-maker, that that’s something that has to be attended to right away.   I have been blessed by having -- and I admittedly am biased -- some of the smartest, hardest-working, good people in my administration that I think any President has ever had.  And as a consequence of that team, I’ve been able to make good decisions.  And if you don’t have that around you, then you’ll get swamped.  So I hope that he appreciated that advice.   What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election -- all those things are important and should be thought about.  And I think it’s important to give him the room and the space to do that.  It takes time to put that together.  But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter.  And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he’s actually taken office. Q    And how long did it take before you were at ease in the job? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I didn't really have time to worry about being at ease, because you’ll recall we were losing about 800,000 jobs a month.   So the good news is that in some ways my experience is atypical.  It’s hard to find an analogous situation.  By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years.  We were in the midst of a free fall.  The financial system was locking up.  The auto industry was about to go belly up.  The housing market had entirely collapsed.  So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job.  We just had to make a bunch of decisions. In this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected -- otherwise, we wouldn’t have had the results that we had in the election.  On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been in eight, nine years.  Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two.  We've got historically low uninsured rates.  The financial systems are stable.  The stock market is hovering around its all-time high, and 401(k)s have been restored.  The housing market has recovered.  We have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us.  Our alliances are in strong shape.  The progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth.  And gas is two bucks a gallon.   So he will have time and space I think to make judicious decisions.  The incoming administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires.  They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve.  And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last eight years.  I’m very proud of them for it. Athena Jones. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You said more than once that you do not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office.  Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?  And if I can do a compound question, the other one is you mentioned staffing and tone.  What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I’m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor.  What message does that send to the country, to the world? THE PRESIDENT:  Athena, without copping out, I think it’s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition.   Look, the people have spoken.  Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States.  And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies.  And those who didn’t vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works.  That's how this system operates. When I won, there were a number of people who didn’t like me and didn’t like what I stood for.  And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality.  Hopefully it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts.  And so I don’t know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote.  But it makes a difference.   So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him, and members of Congress, and reaching out to constituencies that didn’t vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions.  And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see, and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in.   And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made.   And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing.  I think he recognizes that.  I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward.  And I don’t think any President ever comes in saying to themselves, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country.  I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large.  And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that.   But it's only been six days.  And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve.  There are certain things that make for good sound bites but don’t translate into good policy.  And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with. I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns, and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign.  And I think that's something that he will want to do.  But this is all happening real fast.  He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those.  And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out.  But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that. Q    And your view of his qualifications.  Has that changed after meeting with him? THE PRESIDENT:  I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him, and he's going to win -- he has won.  He's going to be the next President.  And regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up.  And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don’t match up with reality he will find shaken up pretty quick, because reality has a way of asserting itself.   And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history -- those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people. Scott Horsley. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You’re off to Europe, which is facing some of the same populous pressures we see at work in this country.  When you spoke at the U.N., you talked about the choice we're facing between integration and building walls.  What choice do you think the American people made last week?  And is there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices? THE PRESIDENT:  I think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it’s interconnected, that you’re not going to put that genie back in the bottle.  The American people recognize that their careers, or their kids’ careers are going to have to be more dynamic -- that they might not be working at a single plant for 30 years, but they might have to change careers.  They might have to get more education.  They might have to retool or retrain.   And I think the American people are game for that.  They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair.  And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans’ attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade.  But they’re concerned about whether or not trade is fair, and whether we’ve got the same access to other countries’ markets as they have with us; is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages, and so forth. Now, I made an argument -- thus far, unsuccessfully -- that the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that, that it strengthened workers’ rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field and, as a consequences, would be good for American workers and American businesses.  But that’s a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored. So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described.  And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair -- I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign.   As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy.  It keeps this country young.  It keeps it dynamic.  We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks.  And that’s part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful.  It’s part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we got a younger population that’s more dynamic. When it comes to trade, I think when you’re governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you’ve got a global supply chain.  The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they’re bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico.  And so it’s not as simple as it might have seemed. And the key for us -- when I say “us,” I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives -- is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real; here’s how we fix them:  Higher minimum wage.  Stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie.  Stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones.  Yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren’t engaging in child labor, for example.  Being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks that are in communities that feel forgotten. That’s going to be our most important strategy.  And I think we can successfully do that.  People will still be looking to the United States.  Our example will still carry great weight.  And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past. Martha Raddatz. Q    Thanks, Mr. President.  We heard some of the harsh words you had about Mr. Trump, calling him “temperamentally unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.”  Did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office?  And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump presidency? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we had a very cordial conversation.  And that didn't surprise me to some degree because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person.  He’s somebody who I think likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.   And what’s clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxiety, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive.  And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff. I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with.  I don't think he is ideological.  I think ultimately he’s pragmatic in that way.  And that can serve him well, as long as he’s got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction. Do I have concerns?  Absolutely.  Of course, I’ve got concerns.  He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues.  But the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it’s an ocean liner -- as I discovered when I came into office.  It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes -- even in our first two years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office. And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he’s really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out.  I’ll use an obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act. So obviously this has been the Holy Grail for Republicans over the last six, seven years -- was “we've got to kill Obamacare.”  Now, that has been taken as an article of faith -- that this is terrible, it doesn’t work and we have to undo it.   But now that Republicans are in charge, they got to take a look and say, let's see, we got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn’t have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefitting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of -- everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms. Now, it's one thing to characterize this thing as not working when it's just an abstraction.  Now, suddenly, you're in charge and you're going to repeal it.  Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance?  Are you going to just kick them off and suddenly they don’t have health insurance?  And in what ways are their lives better because of that?  Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job, and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition?  That's really popular.  How are you going to replace it?  Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they're 26?  How are you going to approach all these issues? Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first one to say, that's great -- congratulations.   If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage, and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem.  And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way. So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is now comes the hard part.  Now is governance.  We are going to be able to present to the incoming administration a country that is stronger, a federal government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs.   And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse.  And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick.  And if things get better, then more power to him.  And I'll be the first to congratulate him. Q    Mr. President, you had talked specifically about his temperament.  Do you still have any concern about his temperament? THE PRESIDENT:  As I said -- because, Athena asked the question -- whatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully then you correct for it. This may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper.  I am not well organized in that way.  And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system because I have bad filing, sorting and organizing habits.  And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff.  That seems trivial, but actually it ends up being a pretty big piece of business. I think what will happen with the President-elect is there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them.  Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States.  Everybody around the world is paying attention.  Markets move.  National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes.  And I think he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people.  All right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions and then I get out of here.   Nadia Bilbassy.   Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  President-elect Trump threatened to unravel the Iran nuclear deal that your administration worked very hard to get.  What would be a concern if he alters part of it?  And what would your advice be, considering that he said he’s open to advice?   And on Syria, sir, the Syrian regime now is threatening Aleppo with massive destruction.  You spoke passionately a few years back about Benghazi and you warned against the killing of civilians there.  Many people criticized your administration for the shortcoming of the Syria policy.  Are you willing to admit any fault under your watch?  And how do you act with President-elect Trump says that he won't support the Syrian opposition?  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Iran is a good example of the gap I think between some of the rhetoric in this town -- not unique to the President-elect -- and the reality.  I think there was a really robust debate about the merits of the Iran deal before it was completed.  And I actually was pretty proud of how our democracy processed that.  It was a serious debate.  I think people of goodwill were on both sides of the issue.  Ultimately, we were able to persuade members of Congress and the public -- at least enough of them -- to support it. At the time, the main argument against it was Iran wouldn’t abide by the deal, that they would cheat.  We now have over a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement.  That's not just my opinion, it's not just people in my administration.  That's the opinion of Israeli military and intelligence officers who are part of a government that vehemently opposed the deal.   So my suspicion is, is that when the President-elect comes in, and he’s consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts.  Because to unravel a deal that's working and preventing Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon would be hard to explain -- particularly if the alternative were to have them freed from any obligations and go ahead and pursue a weapon.   And keep in mind this is not just an international agreement between us and the Iranians; this is between the P5+1, other countries, some of our closest allies.  And for us to pull out would then require us to start sanctioning those other countries in Europe or China or Russia that were still abiding by the deal because, from their perspective, Iran had done what it was supposed to do. So it becomes more difficult I think to undo something that’s working than undo something that isn’t working.  And when you’re not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal.  When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you’re more likely to look at the facts.   That is going to be true in other circumstances.  For example, the Paris agreement.  There’s been a lot of talk about the possibility of undoing this international agreement.  Now, you’ve got 200 countries that have signed up to this thing.  And the good news is that what we’ve been able to show over the last five, six, eight years is that it’s possible to grow the economy really fast and possible to bring down carbon emissions as well.   It’s not just a bunch of rules that we’ve set up.  You’ve got utilities that are putting in solar panels and creating jobs.  You’ve got the Big Three automakers who have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set.  Turns out that people like not having to fill up as often and save money at the pump, even if it’s good for the environment. You’ve got states like California that have been moving forward on a clean energy agenda separate and apart from any federal regulations that have been put forward.  In fact, 40 percent of the country already lives under -- in states that are actively pursuing what’s embodied in the Paris agreement and the Clean Power Plan rule.  And even states like Texas that politically tend to oppose me -- you’ve seen huge increases in wind power and solar power.  And you’ve got some of the country’s biggest companies, like Google and Walmart, all pursuing energy efficiency because it’s good for their bottom line. So what we’ve been able to do is to embed a lot of these practices into how our economy works.  And it’s made our economy more efficient, it’s helped the bottom line of folks, and it’s cleaned up the environment.   What the Paris agreement now does is say to China and India and other countries that are potentially polluting, come onboard; let’s work together so you guys do the same thing.   And the biggest threat when it comes to climate change and pollution isn’t going to come from us -- because we only have 300 million people.  It’s going to come from China, with over a billion people, and India, with over a billion people.  And if they are pursuing the same kinds of strategies that we did before we became more aware of the environment, then our kids will be choked off.   And so, again, do I think that the new administration will make some changes?  Absolutely.  But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they’re doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us. Last question.  Justin Sink. Q    Sir, on Syria. THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry, I’m sorry.  Okay, you’re right.  You are right about that.   With respect to Syria -- in Benghazi, we had an international mandate.  We had a U.N. Security resolution.  We had a broad-based coalition, and we were able to carry out a support mission that achieved the initial goal of preventing Benghazi from being slaughtered fairly quickly.  It’s no secret -- you know this region well -- that Syria is a much more messy situation, with proxies coming from every direction.   And so I wish that I could bring this to a halt immediately.  We have made every effort to try to bring about a political resolution to this challenge.  John Kerry has spent an infinite amount of time trying to negotiate with Russians and Iranians and Gulf States and other parties to try to end the killing there.  But if what you’re asking is do we have the capacity to carry out the same kinds of military actions in Syria that we did in Libya, the situation is obviously different.  We don’t have that option easily available to us. And so we’re going to have to continue to try to pursue, as best we can, a political solution and, in the interim, put as much pressure as we can on the parties to arrive at humanitarian safe spaces and ceasefires that at least alleviate the suffering that’s on the ground.   I recognize that that has not worked.  And it is something that I continue to think about every day, and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end.  But I think it’s not surprising to you, because you study this deeply, that if you have a Syrian military that is committed to killing its people indiscriminately, as necessary,  and it is supported by Russia that now have substantial military assets on the ground and are actively supporting that regime, and Iran actively supporting that regime, and we are supporting what has to be our number-one national security priority, which is going after ISIL both in Mosul and ultimately in Raqqa -- that the situation is not the same as it was in Libya. And obviously there are some who question the steps we took in Libya.  I continue to believe that was the right thing to do, although, as I indicated before, in the aftermath of that campaign, I think the world community did not sufficiently support the need for some sort of security structures there and now is a situation that we have to get back into a better place. I’ve given you -- last question is Justin Sink of Bloomberg. Q    Thanks, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump administration.  One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the federal government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program.  I’m wondering if there’s anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump administration, considering his stance on immigration. And the second is, the administration and you have long maintained that the legal constraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander-in-Chief.  Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump administration, is this now the time to sort of test that theory by moving the detainees and see where the chips will lie? THE PRESIDENT:  Those are both excellent questions.  On the deferred action program that we have known as DACA that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefitting from these provisions, I will urge the President-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering that status of what for all practical purposes are American kids.  These are kids who were brought here by their parents.  They did nothing wrong.  They've gone to school.  They have pledged allegiance to the flag.  Some of them have joined the military.  They've enrolled in school.  By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character.  And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again.  And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at. With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us.  What is also true is we have greatly reduced the population.  You now have significantly less than a hundred people there.  There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next two months.   There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States.  But because of the nature of the evidence, in some cases, that evidence being compromised, it’s very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court.  And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us.  My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction.  We’d do it a lot cheaper and just as safely.   Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does, as well.  We will continue to explore options for doing that.  But keep in mind that it’s not just a matter of what I’m willing to do.  One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws, and you got to pay attention to them.  And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms.  And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President. I am very proud of the fact that we will -- knock on wood  -- leave this administration without significant scandal.  We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms, and keeping trust with the American people -- I will put this administration against any administration in history.   And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers.  And we had a strong White House Counsel’s Office.  We had a strong Ethics Office.  We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things.  It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it’s supposed to -- because we got 2 million people working in the federal government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could.  And that takes a lot of work. And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously, as well.  Again, you wouldn’t know this if you were listening to some news outlets, or some members of oversight committees in Congress.  But if you actually look at the facts, it works.   And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the federal government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing.  You look at VA.  People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix.  It was scandalous what happened.  What people don’t remember is, is that we’ve brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren’t getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half.  Just made the agency work better -- not work perfect, but work better. And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good.  Perfect is unattainable.  Better is possible.   And so we will try to share the lessons that we’ve learned over these last eight years with the incoming President.  And my hope is he makes things better.  And if he does, we’ll all benefit from it.   All right?  Thank you, everybody.  You guys, some of you who are traveling, you’ll get a chance to ask more questions. All right?  Thank you.   END 4:39 P.M.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Reuters Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement It's just two weeks until Black Friday, and retailers are putting together some of their biggest sales. But buyer beware: There are plenty of duds out there. Consumers should be wary of offers that look too good to be true. They should also keep in mind that in certain categories, such as winter clothing, next month will surely usher in more substantial discounts. Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD, said many categories will be discounted on Black Friday — but not necessarily on that exact day — so be open to finding deals on Thursday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Benjamin Glaser, an editor at DealNews, suggests shopping in the apparel category specifically on Cyber Monday. "Cyber Monday actually leads Black Friday and Thanksgiving in [the apparel] category," said Glaser. "Look for over 50 percent off at your favorite stores and brands." Glaser also says that while there are some enticing deals around toys during the Black Friday retail event, the hottest items in this category won't be seeing much savings action. Wait 'til December "Avoid buying toys over Black Friday week," he said. "We do see some good deals, but they are rare. Unfortunately, there's never really a good time to buy the season's hottest toys (like merchandise from Star Wars, Frozen, or PAW Patrol). But you might have better luck in the second week of December, when we see the best toy deals." Glaser also recommends that shoppers wait until after the holidays to buy heavy winter parkas and cold weather accessories. "These items could be exempt from the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but discounts will top 50 percent as they go on clearance later in the winter." Don't fall for ploys Shoppers should be wary of retailers slashing prices on their own brands. "Stores like Kohl's, Kmart, Sears, Walmart, and Macy's all have their own store brands and they can set the retail price on these items to whatever they want," said Kristin Cook, senior editor at Ben's Bargains. "So while 80 percent off sounds amazing, chances are high that the item was never actually sold for the listed retail price and so this may not actually be all that great of a price." Also, be leery of BOGO deals. They're somewhat designed to trick you into spending money you don't want to spend, all for the glory of a "free" item. "If you come across 'buy 2 get 1 free' deals and only planned on buying one of the items to begin with, don't opt to buy a second item in order to receive the third," said Kerry Sherin, savings expert at Offers.com. "You just doubled your budget by doing this. Don't spend just to save, [as in spending] $100 on stuff just to get $20 off." Make a budget and stick to it Because there are so many deals, shoppers could easily be tempted to break their budget. But stick to your guns, and don't be swayed to make a purchase you weren't planning on. "If you're on a budget, stick to a list and don't sway from it," said Sherin. "Creating a list that breaks down how much you're willing to spend on specific products is a great way to set an even more strict budget." Shoppers should also avoid unneccessary add-ons to buys like warranties. While of course you want to ensure that the expensive TV you just got is protected over time, there are other ways to get this that don't entail tacking on that pricey brand warranty. "Don't buy the extended warranty on electronics; instead, make your purchase with a credit card that offers extended warranty coverage in its terms, like American Express," said Sherin.

NEW YORK: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has bought shares in the four biggest US airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. The investments mark an unexpected reversal for Berkshire, which has avoided the airline sector for nearly two decades after a troubled investment in the former US Air Group, a forerunner to American. They also expand Berkshire's bet on the US economy, and in particular transportation. Berkshire already owns the BNSF railroad and the NetJets luxury plane unit, and in January paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts. According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire as of Sept. 30 owned 21.8 million American shares worth $797 million, 6.3 million Delta shares worth $249.3 million, and 4.5 million United shares worth $237.8 million. Buffett told CNBC television that Berkshire later invested in Southwest, and was disclosing that stake to avoid misleading investors into believing he was avoiding the carrier. It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in the airlines. Shares often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur. Buffett usually handles larger Berkshire investments such as Kraft Heinz Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp. His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as BNSF, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. The airline investments are "really important for investor confidence" in that sector, said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York. Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment. In after-hours trading, American shares rose 3.8 percent, Delta 3.4 percent, Southwest 3.3 percent and United 2.2 percent. US airlines have benefited in recent years from lower fuel costs, labor peace, higher fees from checked bags and other once-free services, and reduced competition through mergers. Such factors helped the four largest US carriers post a record $21.7 billion combined profit in 2015, and command more than two-thirds of the domestic market. Wright brothers, wrong investment Berkshire had ventured into airlines in 1989 when Buffett bought $358 million of USAir preferred stock, but he quickly regretted that investment. In 1997, he told Berkshire shareholders he had misjudged how USAir would "increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits." Eleven years later, Buffett felt no better, calling airlines a capital-intensive business that earned little or no money. "A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers," he wrote in his February 2008 shareholder letter. "Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down." Buffett nonetheless admitted to having sold the USAir stock, in 1998, at a "hefty gain." Orville Wright died in 1948, more than 44 years after he and his brother Wilbur flew their plane at Kitty Hawk, N.C. American and Delta said they welcomed Berkshire as an investor, and American said it "reinforces our view that our industry has fundamentally changed in a profound and lasting way." Southwest declined to comment. United had no immediate comment. Berkshire on Monday also disclosed other portfolio changes. It slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc by roughly two-thirds to 13 million shares. Berkshire had begun paring its stake in the world's largest retailer earlier this year, after more than a decade of ownership. Separately, Berkshire reduced its stake in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, and exited an investment in Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc.
