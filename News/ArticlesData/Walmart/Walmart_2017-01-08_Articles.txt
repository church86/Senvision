DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Here's Why You'll Lose Money in Walmart Be cautious right now. Chris Laudani Jan 9, 2017 9:12 AM EST Walmart (WMT) shares are gathering dust in the bargain bin. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 since mid-2013. Basically the stock is back to where it was before the October analyst meeting. On Nov. 17, Walmart reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 98 cents per share, 2 cents better than expected. About 2 cents came from company's share repurchase program, in which te company spent $1.4 billion to buy back shares. Walmart has spent $6.2 billion on buybacks in the last year. Revenue rose 0.5% to $117.18 billion vs. the $117.86 billion consensus estimate. U.S same-store sales rose 1.2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in store traffic. The average ticket rose 0.5%, or 70 basis points. Inventory declined 2% and same-store inventory declined approximately 6% while in-stock levels improved. E-commerce sales jumped 20.6% and contributed 50 basis points of the comp store figure. This quarter confirmed the problem I had with Walmart after the October analyst meeting. Then, I thought Walmart was going to spend a lot of money to fix its business. And basically, that's what happened. Operating income of $5.11 billion fell 10.4%. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales jumped 21.8%, or 103 basis points. Gross margin increased 32 basis points, less than expected. Expenses rose 8.6% as a result of the associate wage increase as well as investments in technology to support the company's ongoing e-commerce efforts. Because of the higher expenses, Walmart has no earnings leverage. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and year-end results on Feb. 21. Analysts are expecting earnings of $1.29 (vs. $1.49 last year) on $130.5 billion in revenue.

A $60-thousand-dollar reward is being offered for information for Markeith Loyd, the suspected shooter in the death of the Orlando Police Department officer Master Sargent Debra Clayton on Monday, January 9, 2017, according to a tweet from the Orlando... By Holly Yan, Ralph Ellis and AnneClaire Stapleton CNN (CNN) -- Hundreds of law enforcement officers were scouring Orlando early Tuesday for a man suspected of fatally shooting a police officer outside a Walmart. The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff's deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect -- who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. "I'm confident we will find him," Mina said. "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him." "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'He shot her down' On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. "As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her," the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. "That's not uncommon," he said. "We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police." Clayton returned fire but investigators don't think she struck the gunman, Mina said. Two minutes after Clayton's last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched "dozens of apartments and residences" and won't slow down because of darkness. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at. Sheriff's deputy killed As authorities scrambled to find Loyd, Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died in a crash as he was traveling on his motorcycle. "A motorist turned in front of him," the sheriff said. "Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff's department. In another incident, police said the suspect fired at an Orange County sheriff's captain who spotted his vehicle. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend's death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood. She was the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, was critically injured when he tried to come to Dixon's aid, WFTV reported, citing deputies. A hero who went above and beyond Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran at the department. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. The sheriff said his department also is mourning the death of its deputy. But with an "armed and extremely dangerous" killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. "While we're processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do," Demings said. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The deaths of Clayton and Lewis mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash.

News Facebook Feedback Jan.10: Counterfeit money, Inmate program, Officer burned Privacy Policy Man accused of using counterfeit money The York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office is searching for a man accused of using counterfeit money at the Wal-Mart in York County last month. The man used the money at the store at 2601 George Washington Memorial Highway on Dec. 20, officials said on social media. •Steve Hurley: That Wal-Mart gets a lot of attention lately. Hampton program helps prepare inmates Darnell W. Parker Sr. is teaching a seminar at Hampton City Jail, aiming to educate incarcerated fathers about how to take back their paternal responsibility once they leave the lock-up. •Lesley DeVries: Only male inmates? What about the mothers in jail? I find it VERY discriminating that you only think men need programs like this! •Stenson Robin: Yes. There are a lot of programs for men. Not so much for women. Come on now, we need both parents. •Stacey Cooper: He is only one person. We do not know the red tape behind what he is doing. Try to see the positive side instead of the negative side. •Joy Snead Lockhart: Some prisons do have programs for mothers and even allow the babies to stay with their mothers for a time after they're born. If Mr. Parker is willing to help these men become better fathers and citizens, he should be applauded! And so should the men that are changing. •John Grady Harris: This is awesome. Police: Caustic substance thrown in officer's face A Norfolk police sergeant was significantly burned Monday after a man went up to the officer and threw a caustic substance in his face, according to police reports. The sergeant was transported to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital with what police called significant burn injuries. The suspect was immediately taken into custody, police said. •Sisley Jones: Very sad. There is no need for so much hate. Praying for healing. •Jenn Sloan: Just terrible I'm praying for all emergency personnel and their families. Once is too much and it needs to end NOW. •Jessica Davis: This is awful.

By Tracey Kaplan | tkaplan@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 9, 2017 at 1:54 pm | UPDATED: January 10, 2017 at 3:04 am SAN JOSE — A man accused of a drug-addled Easter rampage that ended after he barreled his car through the window of a Wal-mart and bludgeoned shoppers with a metal bar was sentenced Monday to eight years in state prison. The sentence imposed on Haamid Ade Zaid, now 37, covers both the Easter 2013 crash, as well as a similar incident in  2012. In that case, Zaid drove his Lexus into a Chevron gas station on W. Capitol Expressway, smashing the car through the glass front doors and barely missing two employees working inside the market. Zaid had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, delaying the resolution of the case. But last month, he pleaded as charged to 10 counts of felony assault with a deadly weapon, as well as felony vandalism, and reckless driving. The sentence was the result of an offer by Superior Court Judge Daniel Nishigaya, rather than a plea deal. “It has been nearly four years since these incidents occurred and a long road to get justice for the victims,” prosecutor Deborah Hernandez said in a written statement. The case raised questions at the time among Zaid’s West San Jose neighbors, who wondered how Zaid, who was arrested in a string of troubling cases over a two-year period, was out of jail on March 31, 2013, the Easter Sunday when he rammed into Wal-mart.

At the time of the Wal-Mart attack, Zaid was being prosecuted in drug court for three other incidents: the Chevron crash, which prosecutors at the time did not believe was intentional; a 2012 case in which he allegedly threw a chair through the window of a Santana Row pub while high on cocaine; and a 2011 incident involving a burglary he imagined. Zaid had posted $20,000 bail after the Chevron crash. No one was hurt in the previous incidents, which all resulted in misdemeanor, not felony charges. The Chevron crash occurred just before 6 p.m. on December 16, 2012.  Zaid collided his Lexus into a vehicle at the intersection of Meridian and Hillsdale Avenues after running a red light. After a high-speed flight from the scene, he drove  into the Chevron station building. In the Easter Sunday incident in 2013, several witnesses observed a 1974 Oldsmobile Cutlass driving recklessly in an East San Jose neighborhood. At the intersection of Story and Senter Road, Zaid collided into a vehicle stopped at a red light. He continued at a high rate of speed to the Walmart parking lot off of Story Road. He sped around the crowded lanes, narrowly missing customers, and eventually collided into three occupied cars. Zaid then stopped, revved his engine and steered the Cutlass directly through the front doors of the store. As people fled, Zaid then backed his car up, stopped and again drove it further into the store – ultimately getting stuck in a tangle of shopping carts. Zaid then exited the car, swinging the metal club at people. He struck three victims before he was tackled and tied up with belts by Wal-mart customers. One victim sustained serious permanent injuries. The incident was captured on surveillance video. In all, seven people were injured in the Wal-mart incident.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Privacy Policy Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns. "It's scary," she said before she was let back into the complex. After she picked her son up, they waited with dozens of others outside the complex. Migul said as he and his mom were waiting, an Orange County deputy flagged him down and asked if he was hungry. The deputy pulled out a chocolate protein bar and gave it to the boy.

They later posted a picture of a smiling Clayton standing with two young boys with the caption “THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton.” THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton.

The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff’s deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect — who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. “I’m confident we will find him,” Mina said. “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him.” “To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd’s arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. “To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. ‘He shot her down’ On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. “As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her,” the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. “I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down,” said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. “That’s not uncommon,” he said. “We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police.” Clayton returned fire but investigators don’t think she struck the gunman, Mina said. Two minutes after Clayton’s last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched “dozens of apartments and residences” and won’t slow down because of darkness. “I believe there have been people out there helping him all along,” Mina said. “If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them.” He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at. Sheriff’s deputy killed As authorities scrambled to find Loyd, Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died in a crash as he was traveling on his motorcycle. “A motorist turned in front of him,” the sheriff said. “Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed.” Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff’s department. In another incident, police said the suspect fired at an Orange County sheriff’s captain who spotted his vehicle. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend’s death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood. She was the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. Dixon’s brother, Ronald Steward, was critically injured when he tried to come to Dixon’s aid, WFTV reported, citing deputies. A hero who went above and beyond Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran at the department. “I’ve known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself,” the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. The sheriff said his department also is mourning the death of its deputy. But with an “armed and extremely dangerous” killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. “While we’re processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do,” Demings said. Clayton’s death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The deaths of Clayton and Lewis mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Privacy Policy Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns. "It's scary," she said before she was let back into the complex. After she picked her son up, they waited with dozens of others outside the complex. Migul said as he and his mom were waiting, an Orange County deputy flagged him down and asked if he was hungry. The deputy pulled out a chocolate protein bar and gave it to the boy.

Accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Markeith D. Loyd shot Sgt. Debra Clayton multiple times when she confronted him outside a Walmart near the Pine Hills area, police said. That wasn’t the end of the violence: A sheriff’s deputy was struck and killed by a sport-utility vehicle while responding to the shooting, and another deputy took fire while trying to stop Loyd’s presumed getaway vehicle. Hours later-as hundreds of local, state and federal officers scoured streets and apartment blocks-Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings looked into a bank of TV cameras and urged Loyd to turn himself in. “Otherwise this is going to be a very, very risky operation for all of us,” he said. The mayhem began early in the morning – apparently when a 17-year police veteran went shopping at a Walmart in the Pine Hills area. A witness told ABC affiliate WFTV that Clayton, a married mother of two, was putting her bags in her trunk when a customer walked up and told her a wanted man was inside the store. Police had been looking for Loyd since Dec. 13, the day he allegedly shot and killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend and wounded her brother, according to the Orlando Sentinel. He was considered armed and dangerous, even then. Clayton turned back toward the Walmart just as the suspect walked out, James Herman told WFTV. “I heard her tell him: Stop,” Herman said. “He shot her down and he took off running.” The suspect fired backward as he ran, the witness said. Clayton was shot twice in the chest and once in the abdomen, WFTV reported. Her heart stopped in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Paramedics briefly revived her, but a flag-covered gurney was later wheeled out of a hospital as police officers lined up to salute it. “Oh God!!!” Orlando commissioner Regina Hill wrote on Facebook. “Please pray for my OPD Liaison. She’s been shot down in Pinehills.” In the early scramble for the suspect, an Orange County sheriff’s deputy on a motorcycle was struck by a vehicle. “He squeezed my hand. His arm was going cold,” a witness who tried to save the deputy told WFTV. “I thought he was going to make it.” The deputy died of his injuries. His name was being withheld until his family is notified. Another deputy spotted a speeding vehicle that matched the description of Loyd’s, and made a U-turn to pursue it, Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a news conference. The driver opened fire, the sheriff said, hitting the deputy’s vehicle but not harming him. According to WFTV, Loyd allegedly carjacked a vehicle and escaped again. Large swaths of the Pine Hills area were cordoned off as officers hunted for Loyd. After several hours, the Orlando Sentinel reported that SWAT police had surrounded an apartment and were calling Loyd out – rifles ready and helicopters circling. “He will be brought to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters at the news conference. “I can assure the community of that.” But more hours passed with no sign of Loyd, as the searchers roved across the city. A reward for his capture was increased to $60,000, and authorities warned that anyone helping him hide would be prosecuted. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared an official day of mourning. Florida Gov. Rick Scott prayed. City officials and law enforcement officers wept openly in front of TV cameras. Clayton was one of the first officers who responded to the Pulse nightclub shooting in June, arriving minutes after 911 calls came in about shots fired, according to police records. The Orlando officer appears to be the first law enforcement official fatally shot this year. Her death comes after a year that saw a surge in the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, a toll pushed upward by an increase in deadly shootings and ambush attacks. These shootings included high-profile attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge that left a combined eight officers dead, ambushes that rattled law enforcement officers nationwide at a time of tension between police and the communities they serve. Although statistics show a steep drop in the number of line-of-duty deaths since the 1970s, officers and others in law enforcement have said in recent years that they are increasingly on edge amid protests against how police use deadly force and concerned about the public perception of police. Others have expressed concern about antigovernment attackers targeting law enforcement officers and the number of guns available on the streets. Last year, 65 police officers were killed in shootings, up from 41 the year before, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that monitors line-of-duty deaths. Gunfire was the common factor in nearly half of the 136 law enforcement deaths in 2016, according to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, the highest percentage in more than two decades. Before 2016, it was more common in recent years for officers to die in traffic accidents than shootings. Ambushes were behind an unusually high share of these deaths, with nearly 1 in 3 officers fatally shot in such an attack. The surge in officers killed by gunfire last year was the largest on record, up 56 percent over the previous year, according to data from the memorial fund.

The suspect, identified as Markeith Loyd, was accused of murdering his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Fox 35 reported, adding that police had never caught him. Police hiked their reward for information on his whereabouts to $60,000. An Orlando SWAT team had surrounded an apartment complex a couple miles northwest of the Walmart around noon, demanding Loyd step outside, but eventually left. Earlier in the day, a traffic crash killed an Orange County deputy sheriff taking part in the manhunt, the sheriff announced. “We’re going to bring this dirtbag to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. “There’s going to be someone who knows where he is.” Loyd had been arrested 20 times in Orange County since 1994, according to court records. Police said the officer killed was Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force and mother of two, married for one year. Officials did not identify the deputy who died. At least 64 officers were killed in gun-related incidents in 2016, a jump of more than 50 percent from the previous year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Loyd was wearing a security uniform at the time of Monday’s shooting, a witness told WFTV. “(The shooter) was an average looking dude, he walked by me, had a security vest and everything,” witness James Herman told the station. “I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down.” Police released video of the officer’s flag-draped coffin leaving Orlando Regional Medical Center. The shooting unfolded three days after the massacre at the Ft. Lauderdale airport, which left five people dead. Loyd had been on the run since Dec. 13 when police accused him of shooting and killing 24-year-old Sade Dixon, a pregnant mother of two, and critically wounding her brother, Ronald Steward, outside her home. Dixon’s surviving relatives told Fox 35 she had just broken up with Loyd. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office stated the suspect’s age as 41, but the Sentinel reported it as 43. Prosecutors reportedly had dropped drug-dealing charges against him earlier. Herman said a shopper had tipped off the officer — who was putting bags in the trunk of her vehicle — that Loyd was in the Walmart waiting to check out. As the officer walked towards the store, the suspect barged out and fired at least 12 shots, according to Herman. Three shots hit the officer, WFTV reported. After deputies launched the manhunt, the suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and fired shots, hitting one deputy’s unmarked SUV twice before carjacking another vehicle and escaping, Fox 35 added. Nobody was reported hurt at the apartment complex. The search also led police to the Pine Hills area a few miles west of Orlando. City Commissioner Regina Hill identified the officer as her Orlando Police Dept. liaison. The officer’s heart briefly stopped while paramedics were racing her to Orlando Regional Medical Center, rescuers said. Officials locked down more than a dozen schools in the area, and closed the Walmart. Evidence markers were spotted in the store’s parking lot. “Any act of violence against our heroes is cowardly and shameful and our state will not stand for it,” Gov. Rick Scott responded. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning. Students and staff in the locked-down schools were safe, Fox 35 added.

The shooting occurred after 7:15 a.m. near a Walmart store in Pine Hills, which is located west of Orlando. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the department, was killed in the shooting, Police Chief John Mina said. “Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life to protect the community she loves,” Mina said at a Monday press conference. At least 49 dead in mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton (left) was killed in the shooting, and Markeith Loyd was identified as a suspect. (Orange County Sheriff's Office) Authorities identified Markeith Loyd, 41, as the shooting suspect. Loyd — wanted in connection with the December killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend — was seen fleeing the shooting scene, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. He fired at a deputy, who was not injured, and carjacked a vehicle before running off, the sheriff's office said in a statement. A second law enforcement officer, who has not been identified, was killed in a vehicle accident during the search for Loyd. A reward of up to $60,000 was offered for information on the suspect’s location, and the manhunt, featuring a SWAT team, focused on an apartment complex. 14 photos view gallery Massive manhunt underway after Orlando police officer is fatally shot “He will be brought to justice,” Mina said. “The community can be sure of that.” Photo captures Christina Grimmie's killer at show before shooting The circumstances surrounding the shooting weren't immediately clear.

"I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down." Police officers and sheriff’s deputies escorted the ambulance to the hospital, where Clayton was later pronounced dead.

Derrick McRae, pastor of the Experience Christian Center in Orlando, attended elementary and middle school with Clayton. McRae recalled his childhood friend as calm and quiet, a good listener who never seemed to raise her voice. “You’re too nice to be a police officer,” McRae told Clayton after she joined the department. The shooting occurred outside of a Walmart store. (John Raoux/AP) “I’m going to make a change,” she responded. She did make a change in the community, McRae said, supporting numerous initiatives, including McRae’s church giving away bicycles and toys at Christmas. Clayton was one of the first responders at the June 2016 Pulse shooting, McRae said. The friends last spoke about two months ago, discussing faith.

(John Raoux/AP) “Her family and friends, those who grew up with her, we’re all going to miss her, but she lived life as an example for so many others,” McRae said. Traffic was being diverted and area schools were placed on lockdown following the shooting. Loyd’s Facebook page last year featured numerous posts about his girlfriend’s pregnancy as well as workout photos. An ominous message was posted Nov. 30: “Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted.” He was arrested in a drug-related shooting in 1996, but first-degree murder charges were dropped after a key witness changed their story. In 2011, he was sentenced to 27 months in prison for possessing two ice pick-like homemade weapons while in federal custody. He’s also faced weapons, aggravated battery, trespassing and drug charges, according to Florida Department of Law Enforcement records.

Loyd is also accused of murdering his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. ORLANDO, Fla. >> An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed today after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, and a second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted for the murder of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early today, and an Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. The deputy wasn’t identified because his family hadn’t been notified. Another Orlando police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. “If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers … and we cannot control what happens in that situation,” Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart this morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt, authorities said. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. “I’m heartbroken and angry,” Scott said.

(AP) — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton’s killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday.

It's been 18 years since Wal-Mart split its shares. Find out whether a split is coming this year. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 9, 2017 at 9:12AM Dow component Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) revolutionized the department-store retail industry, creating new emphasis on low pricing and value. Over time, the stock's performance has also been strong, with solid performance and dividend yields that have provided income growth to investors over time as well. Yet one thing that investors haven't enjoyed in nearly two decades is a stock split from the big-box retail giant, and ongoing difficulties could make it tough for Wal-Mart to break that drought in 2017. Below, we'll look at Wal-Mart's stock split history and whether this year might finally bring an end to 18 years of going without a split. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart stock splits in the past Here are the dates and split ratios for the stock splits that Wal-Mart has done in the past: Date of Split Split Ratio May 1971 2 for 1 March 1972 2 for 1 August 1975 2 for 1 November 1980 2 for 1 June 1982 2 for 1 June 1983 2 for 1 September 1985 2 for 1 June 1987 2 for 1 June 1990 2 for 1 February 1993 2 for 1 March 1999 2 for 1 Data source: Wal-Mart investor relations. As you can see, Wal-Mart has a long history of doing stock splits at fairly regular intervals -- until 18 years ago. Since then, those splits have come to a halt. One key element of Wal-Mart's split behavior is that the company hasn't followed some of the more typical rules in determining exactly when to do stock splits. Often, companies wait for their shares to reach triple-digit levels before splitting their shares, arguing that lower share prices are helpful for investors trying to put money to work in their stock. Yet Wal-Mart has made splits at a wide variety of prices, ranging from a low of $23 per share for its 1975 split to nearly $90 per share with its most recent split in 1999. In fact, 1999 was the only time that Wal-Mart stock had ever topped the $100 per share mark, briefly climbing above that level before the split took place. The most common range at which Wal-Mart made splits was in the $45 to $50 per share area in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the $60 to $70 per share range in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Why Wal-Mart stopped splitting its shares The basic problem that Wal-Mart has faced is that its stock hasn't performed all that well since the turn of the millennium. Its overall average annual return over the past 17 years has been just 2.3%, and that includes the dividend income that investors have received along the way. Throughout the early 2000s, the share price treaded water in the $50 to $60 range. Although the discount retailer fared quite well during the market meltdown in 2008, it nevertheless didn't participate in the rebound that ensued following the end of the financial crisis. It wasn't until early 2015 that Wal-Mart stock reached $90 per share. That had followed several years of sluggish sales performance, but once Wal-Mart stemmed the tide of same-store sales declines and started gaining ground again, some investors concluded that the company's fundamental long-term strength would finally shine through. Since then, however, Wal-Mart has fallen by as much as a third from those levels, and even now, it remains well below those previous highs from two years ago. Will Wal-Mart make a split in 2017? Looking forward, Wal-Mart faces plenty of challenges. Higher labor costs and the need to invest in its online retail presence will put demands on the company's income statement, and Wal-Mart also has to pay attention to the efforts of its brick-and-mortar rivals both in the big-box arena and among smaller-footprint dollar-store retailers. At the same time, Wal-Mart has also retained its commitment to paying strong dividends. Its current yield is almost 3%, and that puts downward pressure on the stock price that keeps it from climbing to levels that would bring suggest the need for a split. As a result, it's unlikely that Wal-Mart will do a stock split in 2017. Yet in the long run, what investors should watch more closely is whether the department store giant can regain some of the leadership that put it in its industry-dominating position in the first place. If it can, then further share-price gains will follow -- and investors won't necessarily care whether Wal-Mart splits its shares either now or in the future.

Orlando Police Department Master Sgt. Debra Thomas Clayton, 42, died of her injuries suffered in the shooting that happened at the Pine Hills Walmart store early Monday morning, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said during a press conference. 'Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life to protect the community she loves,' Mina said. 'She will be deeply missed.' He added that she was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre on June 12.  The shooting happened just after 7:15am, as police say Clayton had been shopping in the store and was outside putting bags in the trunk of her car when someone told her that Markeith Loyd, a suspect wanted in connection with the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, may have been inside the store.

Markeith Loyd (right), 41, is the suspect accused in the shooting and police are still searching for him Clayton (above) was a 17-year veteran of the police department, a wife and a mother to a son. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said Clayton, 42, is a 'hero' Her flag-draped coffin (above) was removed from Orlando Regional Medical Center and was provided a police escort from the hospital Police escorted Clayton's  body from the Orlando Regional Medical Center  (above) The 17-year veteran was heading back into the store alone and had radioed in at 7:17am 'to say that she was attempting to contact a murder suspect,' Mina said.  She told the suspect to 'stop', but he immediately fired multiple shots at her before fleeing the scene, authorities said. At 7:19am, officers radioed in to say she had been shot and the first responding officers on scene began CPR on Clayton. She was pronounced dead at 7:40am at Orlando Regional Medical Center.   While trying to flee, Loyd fired at another deputy in a SUV, who was not injured. Loyd then carjacked a vehicle before getting out of the vehicle and running off, police said.  Officials said Loyd was spotted at the intersection of North Lane and Pine Hills Drive by a deputy who followed him to a nearby apartment complex.    Loyd, 41, is considered to be armed and dangerous and police are asking anyone who knows his whereabouts to please call 1-800-423-TIPS.

'We're going to bring this dirt-bag to justice, and he's going to jail,' Mina said of Loyd at the press conference. 'The community can be sure of that.' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings announced during the same press conference more tragic news, as another law enforcement officer died. Demings said that the deputy was hit by a car while on his patrol motorcycle as he was working a perimeter in search for the suspected gunman. Authorities did not release the deputy's name, pending notification of his family members.  Master Sgt.

He is considered to be armed and dangerous Ten minutes after that fatal crash involving the Orange County deputy, about 200 yards away OPD Officer Robert Castro was involved in a crash that sent him to the hospital with minor injuries, Mina said.  'The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words,' the Orlando Police Department tweeted along with a video showing the Clayton's flag-draped casket being put into a vehicle, as fellow officer saluted outside of the hospital.  'I'm declaring (Monday) an official day of mourning,' Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said.  James Herman, a witness to the shooting, told WFTV that the gunman was wearing a security uniform and fired at least 12 times at Clayton.    '(The shooter) was an average-looking dude, he walked by me, had a security vest and everything, Herman said.  Law enforcement officers hug as other officers, not seen, escort the body of the Orange County deputy that died in the line of duty on Monday Florida Gov.

He shot her down.'  Thirteen schools were locked down during the daytime due to the search of the suspect; but that is no longer in affect.  Aerial footage from WKMG shows several officers swarming the area, as some were spotted carrying assault rifles.  Loyd is also wanted in connection with the December shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24 (above) Loyd is also wanted in connection with the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, WFTV reported.  Sade Dixon, a 24-year-old pregnant mother-of-two, was shot to death outside of her home on December 13.  Authorities say Loyd, a convicted felon who has been arrested in Orange County 20 times since 1994, has been on the run since her death.  Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, 26, was also shot and critically injured in the incident, as he was trying to help her, police said.  Loyd has served 10 years in prison and five years probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  Back in 1999 he was sentenced to prison and was released from probation in 2014.  A November post on his Facebook page says: 'Goals!!!!

'You can bet Walmart was tracking their sales at the stores in Thunder Bay' says Ian Lee CBC News Posted: Jan 09, 2017 7:00 AM ET Last Updated: Jan 09, 2017 7:00 AM ET Visa cards will once again be accepted at Walmart stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., after the big box retailer announced it would not allow the the cards for payment in July. (Jeff Walters/CBC) Related Stories Walmart to once again accept Visa at Thunder Bay stores Walmart to lift ban on Visa after settling of fee dispute New front open in Walmart's war with Visa, as cards will soon be banned in Manitoba 'They're going to war' — Thunder Bay, Ont., ground zero in Visa vs. Walmart fight Now that Visa and Walmart have stepped out of the ring, some experts are positing their theories on which player emerged the winner in the six-month dispute over card fees. The companies aren't saying what kind of deal was struck, but Ian Lee, an associate professor in the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, suspects Visa came out on top. "I believe that Visa's the winner," said Lee, noting the card's popularity with consumers. "I think Walmart caved in." Visa once again accepted at Thunder Bay Walmart stores Walmart strikes deal with Visa to settle credit card fee dispute Walmart stopped accepting Visa cards at its stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. in July, and later expanded the ban to stores in Manitoba, but the promised Canada-wide roll-out of the policy never happened.  On Thursday, the two companies announced that a deal had been reached, and that Walmart would once again accept Visa at all its stores.  Lee said over the past few months, Walmart would have been watching its three Thunder Bay stores closely.  "You can bet Walmart was tracking their sales at the stores in Thunder Bay versus other stores that still accepted Visa," he said.  "And my argument — although I don't have the data, it's highly confidential — I am arguing that they suffered a loss. Their sales went down in the Thunder Bay stores that did not accept Visa." Visa has been advertising its cards on billboards across Thunder Bay, Ont. This one is located right next to the city's largest Walmart store. The two retail and credit card giants were locked in a battle over interchange fees. (Jeff Walters/CBC) Not everyone agrees that Visa must be the victor.  Steve Tissenbaum, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University, thinks the credit card company would have had to compromise by lowering fees to some extent. The fact that they reached a resolution is good for both players, said Tissenbaum.  "I think Visa won because they kept Walmart as an account, and Walmart won because they are able to control their cost, which is really their mantra," he said.  Report Typo or Error Send Feedback To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Jan 9, 2017 0 Some of the usual suspects make the list, including General Electric, McDonald's and Wal-Mart. However, major tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon—which have thousands of people on their payrolls—are all absent. 1 Intro By Alex Greer Jan 3, 2017 Wal-Mart has more than 2 million employees, greater than the populations of Wyoming and Vermont combined. While some of those people work outside the U.S., it's still shocking to see a single company with such a large workforce. How does Wal-Mart stack up to the other corporate giants when it comes to employment? With that question in mind, FindTheCompany, a corporate research site by Graphiq, decided to find some of the largest employers in America. Using 2016 data from Dun & Bradstreet, the data experts ranked the companies and agencies in the U.S. with 200,000 or more employees. Employee figures reflect the number of employees who work directly for the employer, not through franchises, and include employees worldwide. In the event of a tie, companies that were founded earlier were favored. Because the federal government is overwhelmingly the largest employer in the U.S., professions under this branch were broken out into separate departments (e.g. the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service). Additionally, FindTheCompany broke down the Department of Defense into its separate agencies. Some of the usual suspects make the list, including General Electric, McDonald's and Wal-Mart. However, major tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon -- which have thousands of people on their payrolls -- are all absent. Note: Employment figures from Dun & Bradstreet may not be exact. 2 #44.

(Photo: AFP) Related Articles Mall monopolies keep rivals away Walmart-owned Massmart wins court battle against Pick n Pay Walmart to invest $25m in China food safety research Walmart’s UK job cuts show how Asda fell behind Walmart to test grocery delivery through Uber Walmart lifts retail shares as US stocks retreat   It’s up to retailers to adapt to these changes – and in some areas even lead the way – or they’ll fall behind and disappear, explains Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. What will shopping be like in 10 years? No one knows all the details (that’s exciting!), but one thing is for sure: it will be very different than it is today. History is clear about that. In the mid-19th century, most people in the US were shopping at small markets. They would tell the manager what they wanted, and then wait for the item to be retrieved from the back or from the supplier. After that came the urban department store, supermarkets, then strip malls and discount stores. Today, the pace of change is rapid. Ten years ago most customers were reading about the original iPhone, and wondering whether it would be useful. Now they expect to order something on their mobiles, have it delivered or pick it up in store – often on the same day, in a few hours, or even in a few minutes. It’s up to retailers to adapt to these changes – and in some areas even lead the way – or they’ll fall behind and disappear. Here’s what customers can expect their shopping experiences to be like 10 years from now: 1. Customer empowerment and even greater influence Customer satisfaction has always been the number one goal for retailers, and in the future customers will be more empowered than ever to drive the change they want, as they get more control over their shopping experience. Technology – the internet, mobile and analytics – is being used to do anything and everything a customer doesn’t want to. Customers want to explore. But they need to have easy access to items they choose to use all the time. The historic trade-off between price and service has been altered by technology and customers expect to save time and enjoy the experience while saving money. They’ll fulfill their everyday needs – items like laundry detergent, paper, light bulbs, grocery staples and shampoo – in the easiest way possible through a combination of stores, e-commerce, pick-up, delivery and supported by artificial intelligence. Customer desires – think emerging fashion, fresh produce, and items they’ve never seen before – will still be fun to explore in stores as well as with technology (think virtual reality). Retailers that provide a truly unique, enjoyable experience and prepare their associates to provide excellent service will have the advantage. At Walmart we already see the value customers place on personalisation and convenience, through our success with grocery pick-up and delivery in several markets around the world. With the growth of the internet of things, customers will enjoy an increasingly connected or “smart” shopping experience through a network of connections linking the physical and digital worlds into an ecosystem of devices, including vehicles, stores and software. The internet of things, drones, delivery robots, 3D-printing and self-driving cars will allow retailers to further automate and optimise supply chains too. Both sides of the equation – demand and supply – will change dramatically. In addition, customers will continue to demand transparency around pricing and the supply chain. They’ll have less time to research the products they buy – but they’ll care even more about how they are sourced. They’ll choose to shop with retailers who provide that transparency so they can feel good about the items they purchase. This will require retailers to work with manufacturers to source items responsibly and sustainably. Retailers who do this and share the information will further earn customers’ trust. 2. I’ve seen what you have and I want it, too Customers all over the world now know, and can see, what people in other countries have, and they want access to it all. And they want it now. Chinese customers want access to Louis Vuitton bags from France and milk from Australia. Not long ago on a visit to Nigeria and Ghana, I asked one of our local store managers what his one wish would be. His answer: “I want you to put a Walmart Supercentre like the ones you have in the US right here and let me run it. My customers and my family have seen what you have and we want it, too. We want those items at those prices.” As Tom Friedman taught us, the world got flat and now it’s moving fast. The world needs inclusive growth provided in a sustainable manner. People are demanding it. 3. Shared value With all these changes, retailers will only survive if their business creates shared value that benefits shareholders and society. Social and environmental sustainability will be engineered into our systems, and that will strengthen the communities in which we operate, which will in turn appeal to customers. These changes, however, will require new levels of cooperation and collaboration between retailers and NGOs, governments and educational institutions. Basically, we’ll design retail and other businesses so that all stakeholders (as many as possible) benefit: customers, associates/employees, shareholders, the communities we serve and those in the supply chain. At Walmart, we’ve already found that investments in training, education and wages for our associates have resulted in higher customer satisfaction. Our customers want our associates to have a great life and they want to see that reflected in their attitudes and the service they provide. When it comes to environmental sustainability, retailers and policy-makers face new challenges with the increase in packaging waste and emissions that comes with the growth of e-commerce. Shipping packages one at a time is not only wasteful and environmentally unsustainable, it isn’t cost-effective. The demand for convenience will force retailers to come up with new ways to ship items – in batches vs. one at a time –that are better for business and the environment. While all these changes pose big challenges for retailers, they also represent unprecedented opportunities to innovate on behalf of customers and create new job opportunities for retail associates. I can’t think of a more exciting time to be in retail, to be at the forefront of change and part of an industry that has the potential to provide a better life for millions around the world. * This story first appeared on the World Economic Forum Agenda website, ahead of its Davos meeting from January 17-20. * This piece draws on a new report, Shaping the Future of Retail for Consumer Industries, which can be read here.

Last week, Amazon announced that it will open its newest brick-and-mortar bookstore in New York City, while Walmart subsidiary Jet.com said it purchased online footwear retailer ShoeBuy. The Time Warner Center in Manhattan will be home to a new Amazon Books outlet, a companion to stores already operating in Seattle, Portland and San Diego. Others are planned for Illinois, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The 4,000 square foot location in New York will feature books and Amazon devices. Meanwhile, the company is running another brick-and-mortar retail experiment, Amazon Go, a concept grocery store in Seattle that offers a no-checkout experience, set to open in early 2017. While Amazon is expanding its physical presence, Walmart is strengthening its ecommerce business. Its Jet.com unit, acquired by Walmart in September 2016, purchased Shoebuy, an online footwear, clothing and accessories retailer. According to Walmart, ShoeBuy will continue to operate as a standalone site, though "Jet will gain the experience of a well-established ecommerce player in the footwear industry." Walmart expects ShoeBuy's acquisition to "bring access to a large assortment of products, strong industry relationships, and rich content that will further enhance customer experience." The moves are simply the latest signs of blurring lines in retail, and reflect consumer preference for choice. As consumers move essentially freely from physical shopping to virtual experiences, retailers are working to catch their attention in both areas. When AYTM Market Research asked US internet users how they planned to make their holiday purchases in 2016, respondents were just as likely to say they would be purchasing online as they would be in-store. Research from Market Track conducted by Qualtrics also found that US internet users were close to evenly split in how they'd primarily make their holiday purchases. Approximately 52% of respondents said they would be making most of their purchases in-store, while 45% said they'd be doing so online. Another reason why retailers are expanding their omnichannel strategies may be because omnichannel customers are simply more valuable than non-omnichannel customers. A study from Retail Systems Research found that in 2016 59% of US retailers said that omnichannel customers were more profitable. —Alison McCarthy New in eMarketer PRO This Week Forecast: US Wearables Users, 2016-2020, with Breakouts by Age, Gender and Generation Report: US Digital Ad Spending Benchmarks by Industry, H2 Update Statpack: Canada – Consumer Time and Advertiser Dollars Report: UK Digital Trends for 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Jan 8, 2017 at 7:07PM Image source: Jet. Jet.com has helped reinvigorate Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) online sales growth, but the megaretailer is far from done transforming its online sales operations. Wal-Mart is kicking off the year with the acquisition of ShoeBuy.com, an online shoe retailer that competes with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Zappos. The acquisition reportedly cost $70 million. More telling are comments from Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce, Marc Lore, (former CEO of Jet.com) who said Jet and Wal-Mart will likely pursue more acquisitions like ShoeBuy. In particular, he pointed to "categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands." Jet.com's selection still pales in comparison to Amazon.com's, so improving inventory through acquisition is a quick fix for the problem. Raiding the closet Apparel is the largest online sales category in the United States. It shouldn't be a huge surprise that Amazon is the largest online seller of clothing in the country -- just like nearly every other category. What's more, analysts project Amazon's share of the U.S. apparel market to triple from 2015 to 2020. While Wal-Mart sells a good amount of clothing in its brick-and-mortar stores, it doesn't crack the top 10 online apparel retailers. Thus, the ShoeBuy acquisition is a perfect fit to launch sales of the "long-tail, high-margin" categories Wal-Mart is lacking. Before Amazon bought Zappos in 2009, its apparel business was minimal. It started adding T-shirts, jeans, and other basics to its product catalog, and it rapidly grew. Amazon sold $16.3 billion in clothing and accessories in 2015, according to Internet Retailer. With the introduction of its own clothing lines, it seems like only a matter of time before Amazon surpasses Macy's as the largest overall apparel retailer in the country. While ShoeBuy isn't nearly as large as Zappos -- $315 million in revenue versus $1 billion for Zappos in 2009 -- it still gives Wal-Mart a foot in the door to more robust clothing sales sales. A big budget for improvements and acquisitions Wal-Mart plans on spending $1.1 billion on its e-commerce operations in fiscal 2018, up from $900 million this year. But Wal-Mart developed that plan before it acquired Jet.com and put Marc Lore in charge of growing its e-commerce business. If Lore wants to make more acquisitions instead of developing things internally, Wal-Mart has the capital to move some money around and make it work. Consider that ShoeBuy and its $315 million in sales only cost $70 million to acquire, Wal-Mart has room to acquire several more similarly sized companies every year. By incorporating the smaller e-tailer's inventory, retail partnerships, and operations with Wal-Mart's giant infrastructure, the company should be able to boost the bottom lines of the smaller companies it plans to snatch up. If Wal-Mart stands a chance at catching up with Amazon, it'll need to do so through both acquisitions and organic growth. Amazon is still one of the fastest-growing online retailers despite its massive sales base. Amazon's retail sales increased 27% through the first nine months of 2016.  By comparison, Wal-Mart's online sales increased just 21% in the third quarter after reporting growth of just 7% and 12% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Acquisitions like ShoeBuy to penetrate the vast apparel market or other small retailers with a small foothold in a big retail category should fit well into Wal-Mart's larger online platforms. But Wal-Mart will have to keep spending in order to grow. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.com. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

CBS News reports that 26-year-old Timothy Black is accused of committing a vile crime at a Marietta Walmart store, involving more than one unsuspecting woman. Police say that Blake used a syringe to squirt his own semen at women as they shopped at his local Walmart store on more than one occasion. They say they first received a report of this bizarre behavior in early-November, from an unidentified female shopper who claimed he was being “creepy,” while hanging around her. The woman told police that she felt something “wet” on her back and foot while the man was behind her, which prompted her to run to a restroom to check herself. The unidentified woman told authorities that the substance was wet and sticky. When she emerged from the restroom, she claims that Timothy Blake was still present, and was watching her. Surveillance footage from the Marietta Walmart store reportedly compliments the woman’s claims. That’s not the only complaint being made against the Ohio man. On Dec. 28, authorities were given a similar account from another woman. Surveillance footage also went along with the claims she had made. That dude at Walmart who sprays his semen on you from a syringe. #WarningSignsOfACreephttps://t.co/5EqZNe8ABH — Saeger Ryman (@ezsaeger) January 5, 2017 Just before New Year’s Eve, Timothy Blake was arrested in association with the two disturbing incidents at Walmart. During an interrogation, the Ohio man initially admitted to squirting egg yolks at the two women. However, when police told him that they had “tested the substance,” Blake changed his story, and admitted that he had actually squirted semen at them. He reportedly admitted to using a syringe during the two reported incidents, but also admitted to using egg yolks and saliva in a syringe on separate, but similar, occasions. He has admitted to at least a dozen other occasions where women were stalked and squirted with bodily fluids and egg yolk. This isn’t the first time someone has been accused of squirting or smearing their bodily fluids on unsuspecting members of the public. Late last year, a Florida man was arrested after he reportedly poured semen on a woman at a Panera Bread restaurant. The Tallahassee Democrat reports that 28-year-old Patrick Bruce had entered the Panera Bread on Sept. 12, where he encountered the unidentified woman. The woman, who was eating with a friend, told authorities that the Florida man sat nearby and stared at her and her friend as they ate. The two women told police that he disappeared into a restroom, briefly, before coming back with a cup. The Florida man is accused of saying “here you go,” to the woman, as he flung the contents of the cup in her face — getting it on her neck, shoulders, and arm. The contents of the cup was later determined to be Patrick Bruce’s semen. Also last year, a Pennsylvania man was arrested after he allegedly squirted semen on a woman’s buttocks. The woman claimed that she was shopping in a Bethlehem grocery store at the time of the incident, but she followed him out of the store and took cellphone photos of him in order to identify him to police. Lehigh Valley News reports that 57-year-old Michael Kevin Morris was charged with two counts of indecent assault and a single charge of open lewdness. Teenage boys ‘mixed their semen into icing and served it to teacher’ https://t.co/E9Za8jZhTc — LadyRos (@LadyRos2) December 23, 2016 As for this latest case, Ohio man Timothy Blake has been charged with sexual imposition, menacing by stalking and pandering obscenity. He is currently being held in jail without bond. Meanwhile, reports have revealed that he is married, but his wife has been unaware of his alleged hobbies. Police have reported that the Ohio man blames his parents, for some reason, for the strange behavior he has exhibited.

The smiley face first appeared at a store in North Carolina in 1989 and then grew to be the face of the brand. "Whenever you'd walk in the door, the greeter would have a roll of smiley face stickers," said Savannah Lester, who stopped by the exhibit during a family outing. Nearly 30 years ago, Henry Jordan, a store manager in Whiteville, North Carolina, and his wife came up with the smiley face logo hoping to get more kids to come into the store. They printed "Wal-Mart Lil' Shopper" at the bottom of the stickers, and they turned out to be a hit. Walmart Founder Sam Walton wrote a letter to Jordan praising him for his bright idea and the retailer adopted the smiley face in its stores nationwide. The face eventually became the face of the savings customers could get at Walmart. Walmart plans to bring the savings symbol out of retirement this year. The museum exhibit will be on display until Jan. 31.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 7, 2017 at 6:44PM Image source: Getty Images. Since August 2010, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) have risen from below 10,000 to within a fraction of a point of 20,000. Doubling in just over six years is an impressive feat, especially given that the Dow also pays a respectable dividend yield of more than 2% on top of its rise. Yet although all 30 stocks that are currently in the Dow have risen over that period, some haven't done nearly as well as the overall average. In particular, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) have underperformed the Dow since 2010. Let's look more closely at these stocks and whether they can start pulling more of their weight in 2017 and beyond. ^DJI data by YCharts How a big-box giant lagged behind the Dow Wal-Mart hasn't exactly done badly over the past six years, rising 57%. Yet the retail giant has seen several big moves in both directions over that timeframe, and the state of its once-commanding big-box business is far from the colossus that long-term investors became familiar with throughout most of its history. Wal-Mart has faced numerous challenges that it hasn't yet entirely conquered. On one hand, the benefits that Wal-Mart gained during the financial crisis had started to peter out by 2010, and many shoppers started to prefer slightly more upscale retail establishments compared to the famous discount department store. On the other hand, competition from online retailers has only gotten fiercer during the 2010s, and the resulting negative pressure caused same-store sales slumps that lasted for years before finally reversing themselves. More recently, labor cost issues have played a role in holding back profit growth, and efforts to build up its e-commerce presence have met with only mixed success. To play a bigger role in the Dow, Wal-Mart will have to establish that its efforts to revamp stores and offer new services will keep it competitive with its retail peers. Big Blue gives shareholders the blues IBM has the longest pedigree of Dow membership of these three stocks, having joined the average in 1932. Throughout much of the second half of the 20th century, IBM was a key leader in the technology industry, creating the personal computer and helping to drive its widespread adoption across the globe both for businesses and consumer use. Even when the hardware arena became less specialized and more of a commodity business, IBM adapted by entering the software and services field to tap into higher margins. Yet returns have slowed, with just a 58% gain since late 2010. In recent years, IBM's efforts to reinvent itself have met with greater skepticism. The move toward cloud computing and data analytics has led IBM to make further changes, including its decision to sell off a key server business in 2014. With the company's Watson cognitive-computing system, IBM hopes to find a wide variety of applications for clients to use, ranging from offering better customer service to assisting healthcare professionals with diagnosis and treatment decisions. The key question for IBM is whether it can keep making progress quickly enough to keep up with nimbler competitors. If it can, then the stock's contribution to the Dow's upward movement could become more important in the future. This stock suffered a big breakdown Finally, Caterpillar has been one of the hardest-hit Dow stocks over the past six years. A huge rebound in 2016 brought its total return since late 2010 to nearly 70%, but as recently as early 2016, Caterpillar's performance was flat during the period. The main problem that Caterpillar has faced is an unprecedented confluence of bad industry conditions among its key customers. One by one, poor performance in construction, infrastructure, mining, and energy has conspired to hold Caterpillar back, and customers have been sluggish in replacing aging equipment and boosting capital spending to acquire new products. The prospects for better commodity prices in the future helped push the stock higher over the past year, and health in commodities will be the best opportunity for Caterpillar to keep regaining ground and make a bigger impression on the Dow in the future. Yet if global conditions deteriorate, then Caterpillar could start weighing on the Dow again, as it has throughout much of the past several years. The Dow has done well for investors with its double since 2010, but it's inevitable that not every stock will pull its weight. Looking forward, though, there are things that Caterpillar, IBM, and Wal-Mart can do to try to keep up more effectively with their Dow peers in 2017 and beyond.

Brewer joined Sam’s Club, a division of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., in 2012. Brewer is leaving because "she wants a new challenge," Doug McMillon, CEO of Wal-Mart Stores told staff in a memo, according to Fortune. She will be replaced by John Furner, Sam's Club's chief merchant.  Brewer joined Walmart in 2006 as regional vice president, overseeing operations in Georgia. She later became division president of the Southeast, and then president of Walmart East. Before joining Walmart, she worked for Kimberly-Clark Corp. for 22 years, starting as a scientist and eventually becoming president of the Global Nonwovens Sector in 2004. Furner currently serves as the Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Sam's Club, where he oversees all of merchandising for Sam’s Club including Global Sourcing, Packaging and Private Brands.

Debra Clayton on Monday in Orlando, Fla. AP hide caption toggle caption AP Officers salute Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on Monday in Orlando, Fla. AP Two law enforcement officers have been killed during a massive manhunt for a murder suspect in Orlando, Fla. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton radioed from a Wal-Mart shortly after 7 a.m. Monday, saying she was "attempting to contact a murder suspect," according to a statement from the City of Orlando. Other officers radioed two minutes later, reporting that an officer had been shot. The 17-year veteran of the department died after she was transported to a hospital. Police are seeking Markeith Loyd in the murder of a pregnant woman named Sade Dixon last month. Loyd fled from the Wal-Mart and pulled into a nearby apartment building, where police say he fired shots at a sheriff's deputy but did not harm him. Loyd then allegedly stole a car and escaped. This put a manhunt into motion for the suspect, described as "armed and extremely dangerous." During the search, authorities say, a sheriff's deputy riding a motorcycle was hit by a car and later died. The deputy has been identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an 11-year-veteran of the force. Article continues after sponsorship "This is probably one of the toughest days for me in my career," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told reporters. "Because not only did we lose an Orlando police officer today, we lost an Orange County deputy sheriff as well who was traveling on his motorcycle as a result of these broad efforts that we have underway." Sheriff: We are highly motivated to bring this suspect to justice. We will stay on it until suspect is caught. pic.twitter.com/NcvJt5AnSY— OCSO FL News (@OrangeCoSheriff) January 9, 2017 Law enforcement is "highly motivated to bring this suspect to justice," the sheriff said. There is a reward of up to $60,000 for information about the 41-year-old Loyd. The Orlando Police Department says Clayton was married with a son. "She was extremely committed to our youth and really, the community," Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. "And she did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself — that's how committed she is." The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted that Lewis was a "gentle giant" with a "million dollar smile." In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, "These tragic deaths make clear the great risks that our brave men and women in uniform face each and every day, and the deep and abiding gratitude that our nation owes them for their service." attorney general loretta lynch law enforcement Orlando Orange County Police Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

MUST WATCH Orlando police urge suspect to turn himself in 01:14 Story highlights A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Markeith Loyd's arrest Master Sgt. Debra Clayton's death marks the first gun-related police fatality of 2017 in the United States (CNN)Hundreds of law enforcement officers were scouring Orlando early Tuesday for a man suspected of fatally shooting a police officer outside a Walmart. The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff's deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. Orlando tragedy: Two officers remembered After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect -- who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. "I'm confident we will find him," Mina said. "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him." Read More "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'He shot her down' On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. "As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her," the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. "That's not uncommon," he said. "We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police." Clayton returned fire but investigators don't think she struck the gunman, Mina said. If you know the location of Markeith Loyd reward is up to $60,000. Please call @CrimelineFL pic.twitter.com/hHrf8bMDWt— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Two minutes after Clayton's last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit Suspect Markeith Loyd After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched "dozens of apartments and residences" and won't slow down because of darkness. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at.

MUST WATCH Cops' families: We worry every day 01:28 As authorities scrambled to find Loyd, Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died in a crash as he was traveling on his motorcycle. "A motorist turned in front of him," the sheriff said. "Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff's department. It is with heavy hearts we announce the death of beloved Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. The 11-year-veteran died in a crash today. #RIP pic.twitter.com/LX5zN7JzLx— OCSO FL News (@OrangeCoSheriff) January 9, 2017 In another incident, police said the suspect fired at an Orange County sheriff's captain who spotted his vehicle. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend's death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood. She was the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, was critically injured when he tried to come to Dixon's aid, WFTV reported, citing deputies.

She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact w/community. pic.twitter.com/8zL46iyUe6— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran at the department. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. Sgt. Clayton was extremely active with @pkzorlando. She loved working with kids and they loved her too! Rest peacefully, Sarge. pic.twitter.com/Xfpm4ctiqP— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 The sheriff said his department also is mourning the death of its deputy. But with an "armed and extremely dangerous" killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. "While we're processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do," Demings said. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words. pic.twitter.com/M48o1nnr4h— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The deaths of Clayton and Lewis mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash.

Master Sgt. Debra Clayton approached murder suspect Markeith Loyd at 7am today after being tipped off he was inside the Walmart store.

Debra Clayton was shot at a Walmart store in Orlando Splash News 10 Markeith Loyd was already wanted over the murder of his pregnant girlfriend AP:Associated Press 10 Law enforcement officers conduct a door-to-door search at an apartment complex in Orlando But she was shot ‘multiple times’ and died soon after. Sgt. Clayton – who was wearing body armour – returned fire but didn’t hit him. Now armed cops and a SWAT unit have surrounded a housing block off Cinderlene Parkway where the suspect is believed to be holed up. Police have called on Loyd to give himself up before any more blood is spilled. Police Chief John Mina said : “If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardises and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers … and we cannot control what happens in that situation.” Desperate Loyd – wanted over the murder of his pregnant girlfriend Sade Dixon – fled the scene of the earlier shooting, hijacking a car, and firing at least two shots at a pursuing police vehicle. He then abandoned the first car and stole another, according to police. Authorities are now offering a $60,000 reward for help in his capture. “We’re going to bring this dirtbag to justice and he’s going to jail,” added Chief  Mina.

Clayton had been shopping and was putting bags into the trunk of her vehicle when she was approached by another shopper, Herman said. "The customer walked up to her and said that someone they were looking for, wanted, was in the store in the line to check out," he said. "She went in there, I guess, to confront him. As she was going back to Walmart, he was coming out, and he shot her." During the manhunt, an Orange County Sheriff’s deputy was also tragically killed in a motorcycle accident. The Florida Highway Patrol confirmed the deputy, named as Norman Lewis, was involved in the hunt at the time of the crash. Clermont, Florida resident Billie Jarrard allegedly “turned into the direct path” of the officer. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement that charges are pending against Jarrard. Another police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries.

Debra Clayton Splash News 10 Loyd previously spent four years in prison for battery of a law enforcement officer Chief Mina said during a Monday morning press conference that Clayton, a 17-year veteran, was well-known on the force. “She organised several marches against violence by herself. That’s how dedicated she was,” Mina said. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said police had circulated Loyd’s image in the community because of the previous murder case, and officers had been on the lookout for him. “That indicates to me he is receiving help,” Demings said. Loyd previously spent four years in prison for battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison in 2011 for possessing homemade weapons while in federal custody. He was also charged in a 1995 murder case, but those charges were dropped. As hundreds of officers from multiple departments continue the manhunt, more than a dozen local schools were placed on lockdown.

(AP) — The Latest on the shooting of a police officer in Orlando, Florida (all times local): 5:15 p.m. Authorities have identified the Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy who was killed in a motorcycle crash when responding to a massive manhunt for a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. The sheriff's office said Monday that he is 35-year-old Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. Lewis was killed when his motorcycle collided with a van as he was responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Loyd is a suspect in the fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department. Lewis had been with the sheriff's office for 11 years and Sheriff Jerry Demings described him as "a gentle giant." The sheriff's office says he had played football for the University of Central Florida. ___ 4:05 p.m. Authorities say they've searched dozens of apartments and residences as part of a massive manhunt for a suspect in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at a news conference Monday afternoon that the focus of the manhunt was on an apartment complex in the northwest part of the metro area. Mina says authorities have probable cause to arrest 41-year-old Markeith Loyd for first-degree murder in the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was fatally shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. Mina says Clayton returned fire but Loyd wasn't hit. The chief also says Clayton was wearing body armor. ___ 2:40 p.m. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings is urging a suspect wanted for the murder of an Orlando police officer to turn himself in to authorities. Demings spoke Monday at a news conference held near the area in northwest metro Orlando where hundreds of officers from multiple police agencies were searching for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Demings says the best thing he could tell the suspect is to surrender so the situation can be resolved peacefully. Loyd is suspected in the shooting death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Authorities say Clayton was shot after she approached Loyd outside a Wal-Mart store Monday morning. He was wanted for questioning in the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. 11:15 a.m. Authorities say a deputy has been killed in a motorcycle crash while searching for a suspect in the shooting death of an Orlando police officer. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told a press conference Monday that another vehicle turned in front of the deputy, who was riding a motorcycle in pursuit of 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Loyd is suspected in the shooting death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. A massive manhunt was underway for him. Clayton was shot and killed in the line of duty near a Wal-Mart in Orlando. Police Chief John Mina says Loyd also is wanted in the slaying of a pregnant woman. ___ 10:25 a.m. An Orlando police officer who was gunned down while on duty has died. Orlando police announced the officer's death on its official Twitter account Monday morning. The shooting happened near a Walmart store in Orlando earlier Monday morning. The tweet said, "One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words." With the Twitter post was a video of the officer's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. Police tell news outlets that suspect Markeith Loyd is still on the run. A massive manhunt is underway and several schools are in lockdown mode. Police have asked anyone with information to contact authorities. A news conference is scheduled for 10:45 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. ___ An Orlando, Florida, police officer has been taken to the hospital following a shooting as authorities searched for a suspect. According to the police department's official Twitter page, the shooting happened just after 7:15 a.m. Monday not far from a Walmart. A massive manhunt for the suspect is underway. No additional details were provided about the shooting. The Orlando Sentinel (http://bit.ly/2i8wHZ6 ) reports at least seven Orlando police officers and Orange County Sheriff's deputies were seen escorting an ambulance carrying the officer to the hospital shortly after the shooting.

Sports How One Skater Racked Up Thousands Of Miles On Four Wheels, Two Crutches, And One Leg Nailing “Pop Shove-Its” is just Conner Millan’s latest trick by Jana K. Hoffman Share January 9, 2017 Share on Facebook Click me! Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link For most skateboarders, that first board is unforgettable. For 23-year-old Conner Millan, it has helped shape his entire life. Millan received his—a Walmart Spiderman board—as a gift from his mother when he was 8 years old. He remembers sitting on it and riding around when another boy his age pushed his way past. “He asked me why I wasn’t standing on it, and from that day on I was determined to learn how to skate standing up,” Millan tells GOOD. Millan was born with spina bifida, a rare birth defect in which an infant’s spine fails to develop properly in the womb. According to Mayo Clinic, there are fewer than 200,000 U.S. cases of spina bifida yearly. This chronic developmental disability can’t be cured and requires an immediate medical diagnosis. Some cases may require surgery and others require treatment to help with management over time. Despite his condition, it didn’t take Millan long to skate standing up. And that was just the beginning of Millan’s unlikely journey, defying everyone’s expectations and racking up hundreds of thousands of miles on four wheels, two crutches, and, eventually, one leg. People often make assumptions about Millan’s condition and ability to perform common functions and partake in physical activities. “(They) think that I’m not in a position to stand up for myself,” he says. Then he laughs while saying he’s no different than anyone else thanks, in part, to his skateboard.   “I want to be able to spread more awareness about spina bifida,” Millan says. “Not all forms can be visually identified or seen from an outward perspective.” Much like other disabilities and the lack of knowledge surrounding them, there are many misconceptions. Millan doesn’t experience any pain or soreness unless he spends the day skating, and his case could be very different from other spina bifida cases. People assume Millan can’t drive (he can). When he’s in the wheelchair, they think he’s stuck in it, that he’s unable to walk or function. And obviously, they’re surprised to find out that Millan can skateboard. “There isn’t a lot of accessible information, and I’d like to be able to change that.” At the time of this writing, Millan was in Venice, CA, skating his way through Los Angeles. This isn’t the first time he has done that. During his first visit two years ago, he was skating in the Life Rolls On competition and took a bad fall that opened up a callous on his foot. From spina bifida, both of Millan’s feet turn to the right, and his left foot developed a callous where all the weight was centered. “They gave me a pill antibiotic,” Millan says about his Los Angeles hospital visit following the accident. “I skated out of the hospital with a hole in my foot.”   He returned to his native Florida for further medical attention and intensive recovery. “The torn callous became infected, and my leg needed to be amputated,” he says. Millan spent two months in the hospital. He didn’t know if he would ever skate again. Then local non-profit Friends of Fernandina Skate Park launched a GoFundMe campaign. Between insurance and generous donations from across the nation, Millan was able to pay for a prosthetic leg, one for which he anxiously waited seven months to receive.   It didn’t take long for Millan to learn how to skate with a prosthetic either. “Because of spina bifida, I couldn’t move my ankles or toes anyway so learning how to skate with a prosthetic wasn’t too big of a change.” He says he had to get used to the weight of the prosthetic and the stiffness of the ankle piece. “Nothing that took longer than a day or two to get used to,” he adds. I skated out of the hospital with a hole in my foot. The only remaining issue for Millan is the sweat factor. He says the rubber cup that holds the prosthetic on isn’t very breathable and if he sweats, it slides down. “I’ve talked to my friend’s buddy who’s also an amputee that skateboards,” Millan says. “He told me try deodorant or baby powder.” Millan’s GoFundMe page is still active. He is trying to raise enough funds to replace his crutches with SideStix, which are devices developed especially for performance and those who seek comfortable, limitless mobility. “They’re stronger, have suspension in them, and are a pretty big upgrade from the ones I’m using now,” he says.  Millan approaches VENICE skate park with confidence—and some caution. He prefers street skating than skate parks, and is still learning how to skate bowls. Nevertheless, he greets his friends (which he makes wherever he goes) and pops out of his wheelchair with ease, utilizing his great upper body strength borne of daily crutch use. To affix his prosthetic, he rolls a rubber sleeve on to his leg and snaps the metal rod in place. He needs to remove the prosthetic for short periods of time to allow the sweat to dry up. The socks that come with the prosthetic for fitting purposes also need to be cleaned. Unlike other skateboarders who use their feet to push, Millan uses his crutches. The maneuver may seem challenging, but for Millan, who skates regular-footed, it’s clockwork. He still needs to lean into turns, but utilizes a crutch to brake. Tricks are a bit more limiting, but Millan has the “Pop Shove It” dialed in. To start the trick out, he places his crutches down on opposite sides of the board. Next, he kicks the tail of the board downward at an angle. Using his arms and the crutches that are still placed on the ground, he pushes himself up for the jumping motion while popping the board with his feet. “I don’t have enough muscle in my legs to land on my feet alone,” Millan says. “When I land, I usually place one crutch down to catch myself.” When all is said and done, he rolls on and to the next trick. No big deal. Millan has caught the wanderlust bug like many of today’s twentysomethings. Latching on to what became one of 2016’s most-talked about alternative living styles, he plans to drive a van and skate across the country in this new year, opting to forgo modern amenities and comfort for life on the road and lasting memories. (Millan generally uses hand controls to drive but can also use his foot.) He’s already nailed the hipster vagabond look without even trying. But on this day, it’s unusually empty at the Venice park as the sun begins to dip beyond the Pacific horizon. Millan gets ready to drop in as passersby gather around to watch. A curious little boy runs up to Millan, pointing toward his leg and asking, “What happened? What happened?” Millan stops to explain, in the simplest way possible, that he had an accident. The father, clearly embarrassed, apologizes profusely, but Millan shakes it off like it’s no big deal. He always shakes it off, because to Millan, it’s never been a big deal.

The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

Photo: Allison Jarrell By Allison Jarrell Spoolies 844.776.6543 www.spoolies.com You could say Jeanne James is a risk taker. James, who currently resides in Dana Point, lived with her family for a year in Kenya doing missionary work and running a guest house there. She’s sailed across the Atlantic with her husband and two sons. And she quit her full-time job to dedicate all of her resources and energy on reviving a quirky 1960s hair product—Spoolies. Not only have James and her husband, Tim, succeeded in bringing Spoolies back, but they’ve won two awards for the trendsetting silicone hair curlers and are now selling the American-made styling tools at 400 Wal-Mart stores across the nation. The recent partnership with Wal-Mart is part of the retailer’s 2013 commitment to buy an additional $250 billion in U.S. products by 2023. James is completely self-taught when it comes to all things manufacturing—she attended trade shows, made endless phone calls, researched online and picked up on industry nuances. “You have to be tenacious,” James said of being an entrepreneur. “I think a lot of running a business is not giving up. You have to fight for what you want.” James initially got the idea to revamp the retro rubber curlers in 2003. After working for a year in Kenya, James was inspired to raise money to help send some of the young girls there to school, but she didn’t want to just ask for donations. James wanted a sustainable model—a business opportunity that could continuously raise funds. James eventually remembered Spoolies—the curlers she wore as a kid that allowed her to avoid the dreaded frizzy perm. She wondered whether they were still in production. After a bit of research, James discovered that Conair had pulled the Spoolies trademark in the ’90s and had since released it, giving her the opportunity to revive the product. James obtained a patent, set out to find a U.S. manufacturer and updated the design and materials—trading latex rubber for 100 percent hypoallergenic silicone. Manufacturing the curlers would have been much cheaper in China, but James said it was imperative to keep production in the U.S. so that she could truly “trust the product and the quality behind it.” Not only did she end up keeping production in the States, but she found a factory in San Clemente, just 10 minutes from her home. The new and improved Spoolies debuted in December 2014. Since then, they’ve popped up on the shelves of Wal-Mart stores, and James said they’ll be an “impulse buy” in 350 stores next year, which means the curlers will be on display throughout the store—not just in the beauty aisle. Beginning in February, stores will carry nine-packs of James’ new jumbo curlers, as well as the regular size. The retro curlers have also been getting attention online from a younger generation of beauty bloggers—recent video reviews on Instagram have reached thousands of viewers. But most importantly to James, proceeds from Spoolies’ sales have been donated to Sister Freda’s Foundation in Kenya, which operates a hospital and clinic, a girls’ high school and a college for nursing, among other programs. To date, Spoolies has funded 30 beds at the school, which will sleep 60 girls. In addition to select Wal-Mart stores, Spoolies can be found online in 12- or 24-packs.

The fallen officer, Sgt. Debra Clayton, was shot multiple times outside a Walmart near the Pine Hills area this morning, police said. The suspected shooter is on the loose. (Twitter/Orlando Police) Schools were locked down, roads closed and two law enforcement officers died near Orlando on Monday, as a month-long hunt closed in on a murder suspect and turned violent. Accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, Markeith D. Loyd shot Sgt. Debra Clayton multiple times when she confronted him outside a Walmart near the Pine Hills area west of Orlando, police said. Loyd then fled the scene and remains at large. That wasn’t the end of the violence: A sheriff’s deputy was struck and killed by a sport-utility vehicle while responding to the shooting, and another deputy took fire while trying to stop Loyd’s presumed getaway vehicle. Hours later — as hundreds of local, state and federal officers scoured streets and apartment blocks — Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings looked into a bank of TV cameras and urged Loyd to turn himself in. “Otherwise this is going to be a very, very risky operation for all of us,” he said. The mayhem began early in the morning — apparently when a 17-year police veteran went shopping at a Walmart in the Pine Hills area. A witness told ABC affiliate WFTV that Clayton, a married mother of two, was putting her bags in her trunk when a customer walked up and told her a wanted man was inside the store. Police had been looking for Loyd since Dec. 13, the day he allegedly shot and killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend and wounded her brother, according to the Orlando Sentinel. He was considered armed and dangerous. Clayton turned back toward the Walmart just as the suspect walked out, James Herman told WFTV. “I heard her tell him: Stop,” Herman said.  “He shot her down and he took off running.” The suspect fired backward as he ran, the witness said. OPD @ChiefJohnMina It is with such a heavy heart that I have to tell you Master Sgt Debra Clayton a 17-year veteran of OPD, died at 7:40 am pic.twitter.com/owWHyuaOtj — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Clayton was shot twice in the chest and once in the abdomen, WFTV reported. Her heart stopped in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Paramedics briefly revived her, but a flag-covered gurney was later wheeled out of the hospital as police officers lined up to salute it. [Fort Lauderdale shooting suspect to make first court appearance on federal charges] “Oh God!!!” Orlando commissioner Regina Hill wrote on Facebook. “Please pray for my OPD Liaison. She’s been shot down in Pinehills.” A massive manhunt was underway for the man who police say shot and killed an Orlando police officer. A sheriff's deputy was struck and killed while responding to the shooting on Jan. 9. (Reuters) In the early scramble for the suspect, an Orange County sheriff’s deputy on a motorcycle was struck by a vehicle. “He squeezed my hand. His arm was going cold,” a witness who tried to save the deputy told WFTV. “I thought he was going to make it.” The deputy died of his injuries. His name was being withheld until his family is notified. Another deputy spotted a speeding vehicle that matched the description of Loyd’s, and made a U-turn to pursue it, Sheriff Demings said at a news conference. The driver opened fire, the sheriff said, hitting the deputy’s vehicle but not harming him. According to WFTV, Loyd allegedly carjacked a vehicle and escaped again. Large swaths of the Pine Hills area were cordoned off as officers hunted for Loyd. After several hours, the Orlando Sentinel reported that SWAT police had surrounded an apartment and were calling Loyd out — rifles ready and helicopters circling. “He will be brought to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters at the news conference. “I can assure the community of that.” But more hours passed with no sign of Loyd, as the searchers roved across the city. A reward for his capture was increased to $60,000, and authorities warned that anyone helping him hide would be prosecuted. Markeith Loyd is the suspect who shot OPD officer this morning. Anyone w/info please call 1-800-423-TIPS @CrimelineFL pic.twitter.com/TeABsCsTh4 — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared an official day of mourning. Florida Gov. Rick Scott prayed. City officials and law enforcement officers wept openly in front of TV cameras. Just spoke to @ChiefJohnMina and am praying for @OrlandoPolice. I let him know the State stands ready to help in any way. — Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) January 9, 2017 Clayton was one of the first officers who responded to the Pulse nightclub shooting in June, arriving minutes after 911 calls came in about shots fired, according to police records. The Orlando officer appears to be the first law enforcement official fatally shot this year. Her death comes after a surge last year in the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, a toll pushed upward by an increase in deadly shootings and ambush attacks. These shootings included high-profile attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge that left a combined eight officers dead, ambushes that rattled law enforcement officers nationwide at a time of tension between police and the communities they serve. [Ambushes and fatal shootings fuel increase in police death toll this year] Although statistics show a steep drop in the number of line-of-duty deaths since the 1970s, officers and others in law enforcement have said in recent years that they are increasingly on edge amid protests against how police use deadly force and concerned about the public perception of police. Others have expressed concern about anti-government attackers targeting law enforcement officers and the number of guns available on the streets. Last year, 65 police officers were killed in shootings, up from 41 the year before, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that monitors line-of-duty deaths. THIS is how we know and remember Sergeant Debra Clayton. She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact w/community. pic.twitter.com/8zL46iyUe6 — Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Gunfire was the common factor in nearly half of the 136 law enforcement deaths in 2016, according to the group, the highest percentage in more than two decades. Before 2016, it was more common in recent years for officers to die in traffic accidents than shootings. Ambushes were behind an unusually high share of these deaths, with nearly 1 in 3 officers fatally shot in such an attack. The surge in officers killed by gunfire last year was the largest on record, up 56 percent over the previous year, according to data from the memorial fund. This post has been updated.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: LITTLE LAMB GASTROPUB IN CLEARWATER IMPRESSES WITH BOLD FLAVORS, EDGY ATMOSPHERE AND AMBITIOUS DESSERTS [DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD | Times] Among the fare at the Little Lamb Gastropub in Clearwater is Char Siu Pork Ribs. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender and topped with pickled onion, mint, peanuts and a kicky lime vinaigrette. Gastropub is one of those words we're still a little iffy on. Does it mean fancy food in an easygoing setting, and with a whole lot of craft beer? Or does it somehow signal a drinking joint with suspiciously delicious meats? James Renew isn't too hung up on a narrow definition: "It means elevated food served in a casual, public house-type atmosphere." Check out Laura Reiley's review of Little Lamb Gastropub, tucked in an unlikely strip mall spot for an edgy, ambitious restaurant with a spare, big-city aesthetic.

The sheriff's office said Monday that he is 35-year-old Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. Lewis was killed when his motorcycle collided with a van as he was responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. Loyd is a suspect in the fatal shooting of Master Sgt.

AP By MIKE SCHNEIDER Monday, January 09, 2017 05:27PM ORLANDO, FL -- A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

Debra Clayton might have been shot by 41-year-old Markeith Lloyd Sr., a man also accused of shooting and killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. Authorities confirmed during a press conference that Lloyd is the prime suspect. Sources told WFTV that a man wearing a security vest shot and killed the female officer after she intercepted him in the store. A customer had told the officer that the man was a wanted criminal. After shooting the officer, police say Lloyd fled the scene while shooting behind him. He also shot back at responding officers, piercing one of their vehicles, they said. Lloyd stole the vehicle, drove away from the area and later ditched the car. Authorities have launched a significant manhunt for Lloyd. One officer has been killed during the pursuit. Authorities say that he was traveling at high speeds during the pursuit and got into an accident with another driver. No foul play is suspected. Master Sgt.

just-style home News & insights News Wal-Mart promotes Furner to Sam's Club CEO By Michelle Russell | 9 January 2017 Font size Email Print US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc has promoted John Furner as chief executive of its Sam's Club division following the retirement of Rosalind Brewer. Furner, currently executive vice president and chief merchandising offer for Sam's Club, will take up the role from 1 February. He takes over from Brewer who has served as Sam's Club CEO since February 2012. Fruner has served in a number of roles with the retailer, including senior vice president and chief merchandising officer of Walmart China from January 2013 to October 2015, and senior vice president of home and apparel, and global sourcing, for a year before that. In its last quarter, Walmart posted "solid" results that saw e-commerce growth accelerate, and US operations strengthen. It booked a 2.3% fall in net income to $3.0bn, but revenues on a constant currency basis increased 2.5% to $120.3bn, while US comparable store sales were up 1.2%, marking the ninth straight quarterly gain.

A massive manhunt is underway in Orlando for Markeith Loyd, 41, who was spotted Monday morning fleeing in a vehicle from the Walmart near Princeton Avenue near John Young Parkway, where the Orlando officer was shot, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. The deputy saw Loyd at North Lane and Pine Hills Drive, and Loyd pulled into a nearby apartment complex and opened fired at the deputy, striking his unmarked SUV twice, officials said. The deputy was not injured. Loyd then carjacked a vehicle and took off, deputies said. He later abandoned the vehicle near the intersection of Rosemont and Cinderlane Parkway, where a manhunt is underway, officials said. Authorities said Loyd should be considered armed and dangerous. "We are asking the public to assist us with his whereabouts," the Sheriff's Office said. "However, we ask the public not to approach him and call 911 instead." The Orlando officer was taken to a hospital and was later pronounced dead. Officials will hold a news conference at 10:45 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words. pic.twitter.com/M48o1nnr4h— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 "Just spoke to @ChiefJohnMina and am praying for @OrlandoPolice," Gov. Rick Scott tweeted. "I let him know the state stands ready to help in any way." Investigators placed evidence markers in the Walmart parking lot, but details about the shooting have not been released. Several law enforcement officers swarmed the area, and Orlando police said motorists should avoid driving to Pine Hills. Numerous officers were spotted carrying assault rifles at several intersections in the area. Fifteen schools in the Pine Hills area are locked down because of the search. The Orlando police officer is the second U.S. officer killed in the line of duty this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial website. Last year, 140 officers, including six women, were killed in the line of duty in the United States. Five were from Florida agencies, and 65 were killed by gunfire, the site said. Law enforcement agencies and officials in Central Florida sent condolences to the Orlando Police Department after the shooting. "Thoughts and prayers for the Orlando Police Department Officers and their families," Titusville police tweeted.   Copyright 2017 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved. × Top Stories Officials: Intoxicated man crashes through Detroit Metro Airport fence,… Elderly man in critical condition after hit-and-run on Detroit's west side Sunday night becoming partly cloudy, stays chilly Large feline spotted in Sumpter Township; police warn residents 1 killed in house fire on Detroit's west side Latest Videos 1 killed in house fire on Detroit's west side City of Gibraltar to retest water supply after reports of strange odor Elderly man in critical condition after hit-and-run on Detroit's west side Officials: Intoxicated man crashes through Detroit Metro Airport fence,… U.S. and World News Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images These 8 men are richer than 3.6 billion people combined Copyright 2017 CNN Obama's advice to Trump on being president POOL via CNN Trump hints at European immigration restrictions JUAN BARRETO/AFP/Getty Images 100-bolivar notes get extension as Venezuela crisis continues Bill Olive/Getty Images Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka dies Trending http://www.clickondetroit.com

The smiley face first appeared at a store in North Carolina in 1989 and then grew to be the face of the brand. "Whenever you'd walk in the door, the greeter would have a roll of smiley face stickers," said Savannah Lester, who stopped by the exhibit during a family outing. Nearly 30 years ago, Henry Jordan, a store manager in Whiteville, North Carolina, and his wife came up with the smiley face logo hoping to get more kids to come into the store. They printed "Wal-Mart Lil' Shopper" at the bottom of the stickers, and they turned out to be a hit. Walmart Founder Sam Walton wrote a letter to Jordan praising him for his bright idea and the retailer adopted the smiley face in its stores nationwide. The face eventually became the face of the savings customers could get at Walmart. Walmart plans to bring the savings symbol out of retirement this year. The museum exhibit will be on display until Jan. 31.

He was wearing a T-shirt that read "security" during the shooting, Mina said. Police identified the officer killed as Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force and mother of two, married for one year. Officials did not identify the deputy who died. At least 64 officers were killed in gun-related incidents in 2016, a jump of more than 50 percent from the previous year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," witness James Herman told WFTV. The officer was wearing protective gear and returned fire -- but apparently missed, Mina said. Tragic irony: The deaths of OPD Sgt Clayton & OCSO Deputy occurred on #lawenforcement appreciation day We are still committed to your safety pic.twitter.com/IZ1ullEJo8— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Police released video of the officer's flag-draped stretcher leaving Orlando Regional Medical Center. The shooting unfolded three days after the massacre at the Ft. Lauderdale airport, which left five people dead. Loyd had been on the run since Dec. 13 when police accused him of shooting and killing 24-year-old Sade Dixon, a pregnant mother of two, and critically wounding her brother, Ronald Steward, outside her home. Dixon's surviving relatives told Fox 35 she had just broken up with Loyd. The Orange County Sheriff's Office stated the suspect's age as 41, but the Sentinel reported it as 43. Prosecutors reportedly had dropped drug-dealing charges against him earlier. Herman said a shopper had tipped off the officer -- who was putting bags in the trunk of her vehicle -- that Loyd was in the Walmart waiting to check out. As the officer walked towards the store, the suspect barged out and fired at least 12 shots, according to Herman. Three shots hit the officer, WFTV reported. After deputies launched the manhunt, the suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and fired shots, hitting one deputy's unmarked SUV twice before carjacking another vehicle and escaping, Fox 35 added. Nobody was reported hurt at the apartment complex. The search also led police to the Pine Hills area a few miles west of Orlando. City Commissioner Regina Hill identified the officer as her Orlando Police Dept. liaison. The officer's heart briefly stopped while paramedics were racing her to Orlando Regional Medical Center, rescuers said. Officials locked down more than a dozen schools in the area for several hours, and closed the Walmart. Evidence markers were spotted in the store's parking lot. "Any act of violence against our heroes is cowardly and shameful and our state will not stand for it," Gov. Rick Scott responded. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning. Students and staff in the locked-down schools were safe, Fox 35 added. Click for more from Fox 35.

Police said Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was approached Monday morning at around 7 a.m. by a person who recognized Markeith Loyd, a man suspected of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. The witness pointed Clayton toward Loyd, and the sergeant called dispatch to announce she was approaching the suspect. Moments later, a man believed to be Loyd shot Clayton multiple times. She died soon after. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today. One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words. pic.twitter.com/M48o1nnr4h— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Loyd fled the scene, hijacking a car, and firing at least two shots at a pursuing police vehicle. He then abandoned the first car he hijacked and stole another, according to police.    During the manhunt, an Orange County Sheriff’s deputy was killed in a motorcycle accident. The Florida Highway Patrol confirmed to CBS News that the deputy, identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, was involved in the manhunt at the time of the crash. Clermont, Florida resident Billie Jarrard allegedly “turned into the direct path” of the deputy, am 11-year veteran. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement that charges are pending against Jarrard. That million dollar smile. The consummate professional. That's how we will remember our gentle giant DFC Norm Lewis. RIP. #BigNorm pic.twitter.com/I6BbSSCLeW— OCSO FL News (@OrangeCoSheriff) January 9, 2017 Orlando Police Chief John Mina said during a Monday morning press conference that Clayton, a 17-year veteran, was well-known on the force. “She organized several marches against violence by herself. That’s how dedicated she was,” Mina said. Police announced on Monday a reward of up to $60,000 for information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Mina said during a Monday afternoon press conference that if Loyd is arrested, he will be charged with first degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of a law enforcment officer. Authorities have so far searched dozens of apartments and houses in their search for Loyd, who police believe has received assistance during his flight. Markeith Loyd is the suspect who shot OPD officer this morning. Anyone w/info please call 1-800-423-TIPS @CrimelineFL pic.twitter.com/TeABsCsTh4— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said police had circulated Loyd’s image in the community because of the previous murder case, in which 24-year-old Sade Dixon was shot and killed, and officers had been on the lookout for him.  “That indicates to me he is receiving help,” Demings said. Loyd previously spent four years in prison for battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison in 2011 for possessing homemade weapons while in federal custody.  He was also charged in a 1995 murder case, but those charges were dropped. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The increase turned out to be economically instrumental, as it fostered greater productivity and improved employee relations among Ford assembly workers. In contemporary times, some businesses have imitated this yet-unusual tactic with hopes for similar economic gains. In 2015, Gravity Payments Inc experimented with a $70,000 minimum annual salary. The decision on the part of CEO Dan Price prompted a loss of clients and some of the company’s top employees, but the company is still afloat and functioning. In 2016, both Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) raised their minimum hourly pay — the former by rates between 5 and 15 percent and the latter by increments between $1.85 and $6.35. Between 2015 and 2016, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) raised its minimum hourly pay on two separate occasions: once from $8 to $9, and then to its present rate of $10. The company is currently enduring a large-scale battle with employees demanding a $15 minimum. If successful, the “Fight for Fifteen” movement would cost Wal-Mart an estimated $4.95 billion annually according to the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research. When The Government Intervenes While some corporations institute voluntary wages increases, others effect change more reluctantly and only to comply with federal mandates. After New Zealand enacted the first federally regulated minimum wage law in 1894, the United States was slow to follow suit. Nearly 45 years passed before the United States instituted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established a minimum hourly wage of $0.25. Throughout history, the rate increased just short of 30 times, with the most recent change setting the price at $7.25. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this figure lies about $18 below the average U.S. hourly wage. Most states maintain their own wage laws. As of January 1, 29 states and D.C. enforced minimums above the federal rate and 14 states maintained the same rates as the federal government. Five had no minimum wage law, and two enforced rates lower than the federal minimum; employers in each state are obligated to comply with federal rules. Throughout 2016, 20 states increased or were in the process of increasing their minimum wages, and 12 others currently have plans to effect raises in the coming years.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. U.S. Adds 156k Jobs; Unemployment Rate Ticks Up to 4.7 Pct. WASHINGTON (AP) – U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday’s report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7½ years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. U.S. Factory Orders Drop 2.4 Percent But Investment Up WASHINGTON (AP) – Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. Wal-Mart Names John Furner As Sam’s Club Next CEO NEW YORK (AP) – Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam’s Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam’s Club’s chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position on February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam’s Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. The Limited to Close All Brick-and-Mortar Shops WASHINGTON (AP) – More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy’s and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. Volkswagen Recalls 136,000 Autos for Antilock Brake Fix WASHINGTON (AP) – The Volkswagen Group of America is recalling nearly 136,000 Audi and Volkswagen autos to fix potential problems with their antilock brake systems. The recall covers 135,683 vehicles, including certain 2009-10 Volkswagen Jetta A5 sedans, 2009 Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen, Eos, GTI, Rabbit and Audi A3 vehicles and 2010 Volkswagen Golf A6 vehicles. In them, the control unit for the antilock brake system may fail when the system or the auto’s electronic stability control are activated. Volkswagen will notify owners, and repairs will be made free of charge. The automaker traced the problem to the use of an incorrect solder compound, which may cause cracks that prevent sufficient electrical power to flow.

By Caroline Thompson, Brad's Deals January 8, 2017 Save for later Saved Sears gift cards inside a department store in Garden City, N.Y. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Last year was a rough one for retail. 154 Walmart stores closed, trendy '00s brands like Aeropostale went up in flames, and even the athletic outfitting giant Sports Authority took a final, shaky breath before shutting down for good. If you thought it was going to get better in 2017, you're in for a rough ride.  While department stores have dominated shopping culture for more than a century, it seems their reign is coming to an end. After a lackluster holiday season, Macy's has announced it will follow through on the promise it made back in August, and close at least 68 stores this year. Meanwhile, Sears Holdings, which owns both Kmart and Sears, plans to close 108 Kmart stores and 42 Sears locations over the next few months. "We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetizing locations with highly valued real estate," Macy's outgoing Chairman and CEO Terry Lundgren said in a press release. "These are never easy decisions, and we are committed to treating associates affected by these closings with respect and transparency." Recommended: Can you handle adulthood?

According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

With Sears' announcement Thursday coming only a day after rival Macy's saying it would close 68 locations, the department store concept itself is looking like an endangered species. In a retail landscape now dominated by online sellers like Amazon and big-box chains like Walmart and Home Depot, Sears finds itself in a search for a reason to exist.   "The brand has lost relevance,  it’s lost customers and it’s lost its real reason for existence on the American retail scene,'' says Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, a retail consulting firm. Following "the trajectory they're on, there are no real signs of them turning it around to profitability.'' Sears has more than 1,300 stores remaining in its portfolio, so its demise could be prolonged. But if the retailer is unable to stem its financial bleeding and is forced into bankruptcy or perhaps a final assets sale, its loss would be akin to that of dominating American companies like airline Pan Am or five-and dime F.W. Woolworth. "I honestly don’t see a spot for Sears long-term," says Van Conway, CEO of Van Conway & Partners, who has advised retail companies and other businesses on reorganization and insolvency. "My mom shopped at Sears. That was the only place she could go. Now you have 50 choices, and Sears is outdated.’’ Founded in 1886, Sears launched its first large, general catalog a decade later and for generations was the go-to source for products ranging from watches to washing machines. Though it lost its place as the nation's biggest retailer to Walmart in the 1990s, Sears enjoyed a renaissance during that decade under the helm of then-CEO Arthur Martinez, who pushed a greater focus on apparel sales and other initiatives. The company faltered in the 2000s, selling its more than $30 billion credit portfolio to Citibank in  2003 and merging the Sears brand with Kmart, another struggling big box chain. CEO Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who shepherded the Sears tie-up with Kmart, initiated his own turnaround strategy, loaning the company cash, spinning off parts of the business and putting Sears' Kenmore, Diehard and Craftsman brands up for sale. © Elise Amendola, AP Sears Holding announced it will be closing 108 Kmart and 42 Sears stores. Sears' travails are part of a broader struggle that has engulfed many traditional retailers trying to compete in an environment in which consumers can buy virtually any item by browsing online and without setting foot in a store. "One thing people used to use department stores for was wide choice and selection,'' Saunders says. "There's no wider choice than on the Internet, so a lot of the reasons for going to those department stores just doesn't exist the way it once did.'' In addition to Sears, many retailers, including Kohl's and JCPenney, have failed to innovate in ways that will continue to woo shoppers. “We're seeing now in retail a lot of legacy players that are dead, dying or in danger of dying because of their inability to do that,'' says Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School,  who is the former CEO of Sears Canada. The flurry of steps taken in recent days by Sears is a stark illustration of the moves it is making to try to survive. In addition to the store closures, Sears announced Wednesday that it had obtained a $500 million loan commitment backed by mortgages on 46 properties belonging to its subsidiaries. That adds to its long-term debt, which had ballooned from $2.2 billion at the end of January 2016 to $3.7 billion at the end of October.  "From what I can see, these are very intelligent financial maneuvers to raise money,’’ says Conway. “But the whole issue is, is the core business of the retailer viable?"

Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees — a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for other ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We’re going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies, Kelly added. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. As of Friday, Walmart resumed accepting Visa at those stores. Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company’s agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn’t affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email.

Three children shot and killed in Four Hills. A man found decapitated outside a northeast Albuquerque Walmart. These gruesome murders made for a string of shocking headlines in 2016. But they were just a few of the 61 killings throughout the city last year, a number that marks a 32 percent jump from the year prior and the highest figure in 20 years. The city’s violent crime rate has risen each year since 2007. And four double homicides last year, and the triple murder of three young children in Four Hills, contributed to an increase of 15 killings from the year before – from 46 to 61. Advertisement Continue reading In an interview with the Journal on Friday, homicide Sergeant Elizabeth Thomson said the high number, as well as the brutal nature of so many of the murders, is cause for concern for her and her detectives. “We’ve seen some horrific murders in 2016,” she said. “It’s been a rough year overall.” The recent spike in murders in Albuquerque is at odds with a national trend of low murder rates in the majority of American cities, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice that provided crime projections for 2016. While a couple of large cities have seen a huge jump in murders, overall violent crimes across the country remain near a 30-year low, according to the study. Chicago had more than 750 homicides, according to the Chicago Tribune, and Baltimore had more than 300, according to the Baltimore Sun. In El Paso, a city with a slightly higher population than Albuquerque, there were only 18 homicides in 2016. While this year’s total number of murders is the highest it’s been since 1996, it doesn’t reflect a murder rate because it doesn’t factor in population growth in Albuquerque. Advertisement Continue reading It’s not possible to accurately calculate 2016’s murder rate because the city’s estimated population isn’t yet available for 2016. But, calculating the 2016 rate using 2015’s estimated population results in a rate of 10.9 murders per 100,000. That would make it the highest per capita murder rate since 2002, when the rate was slightly higher at 11.2, according to Journal calculations based on FBI crime data. The murder rates in 2009, 2005 and 2003 were more than 10 but less than 10.9. A rough summer A significant portion of 2016’s killings – 41 percent – remain unsolved, according to data kept by the Journal. That 59 percent clearance rate is the first dip in recent years for the Albuquerque Police Department’s homicide unit, which usually maintains a clearance rate of around 80 percent, well above the national average. Sgt. Thomson said that, while many of the murders haven’t been cleared yet, she is confident her seven-member detective team will be able to clear most of them in the upcoming months. She said the increased number of murders in 2016 affected the clearance rate. “The summer was rough; we had seven in July and seven in August, those were heavy months and it puts a strain on the detectives,” she said. “We are close on a lot of them.” Thomson said the most notable trends she found were the increases in murders stemming from fights or drug activity. Seventeen murders were the results of fights and 11 were connected in some way to drugs or drug dealing. Two thirds of the murders involved guns, an increase from previous years, according to Thomson. Several victims were homeless, including Clifford Miller, whose decapitated and mutilated body was found outside the Walmart near Menual and Wyoming NE in mid-December. And murder-suicides skyrocketed last year. “There are some years where we don’t see any murder-suicides, or we see one,” Thomson said. “Last year, we had eight people who were murdered as part of murder-suicide. That is a very disturbing trend to me.” Advertisement Continue reading But perhaps the most defining feature of the year was a total of six young children who were tragically killed at the hands of family members or in acts of domestic violence, sending repeated shock waves through the city as the year wore on. Motives and other details of many of the less high-profile killings haven’t been reported and aren’t publicly known. That’s because, in 2016, the department, along with the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office, did not provide basic information to the public about several murders, especially for those that remain unsolved. Thomson said they withhold information from the public so that when detectives are interviewing a suspect they can be sure the person has first-hand knowledge of the crime and didn’t just see it on television or read it in the paper. Shocking deaths Some of the details that were released on the city’s worst crimes – those involving the death of children – shocked the city and made national news. The brutal murder and dismemberment of 10-year-old Victoria Martens in August was one of the most gruesome crimes Albuquerque has seen. Police say Victoria was drugged, raped and either strangled or stabbed to death and dismembered by her mother’s boyfriend, Fabian Gonzales, and his cousin Jessica Kelley. Victoria’s mother, Michelle Martens, looked on and made no move to stop them, according to police. Advertisement Continue reading All three are charged with murder and other charges. Four days after Victoria’s death, another young girl was found dead. Nhi Nguyen, 11, was shot and killed by her stepfather Trinh Tran Van, who also shot and killed his wife Cam Thi To in their Northwest Albuquerque apartment before turning the gun on himself. In late February, 1-year-old Jayden Dayea was beaten to death by his mother’s boyfriend, according to police. In early December, three more children were killed when police say their mother’s ex-boyfriend broke into her house and waited for the family to return. Then, police say suspect George Daniel Wechsler shot all four of them, killing the children and critically injuring their mother before killing himself. Elijah Mascarenas, 5, Olivia Mascarenas, 6, and Ian Mascarenas, 9, were buried Monday. Thomson said that the number of children killed last year is not unusual, but the manner of their deaths was often more shocking than in years past. “The trend isn’t that there were more children killed,” she said. “The trend is that we had more murders where the nature of them is more horrific. Victoria is one of those, and then the three children killed in one incident – it weighs heavier on everyone.” Fight for more officers The rising property crime and violent crime rates have not gone unnoticed. Advertisement Continue reading In an interview Friday, Mayor Richard Berry said he hopes to bring the police force back up and is fighting for return to work legislation in the legislative session to get more officers on the streets. “There are a lot of things we can do holistically to fight crime,” he said. “There are some things we can do within the city and some things we need the Legislature to do to help us get more officers in the field.” Thomson said that it’s up to police to build good relationships within the community so people feel comfortable reaching out to officers in times of need. But, she said, murder is unlike any other crime that officers deal with. “Murder is very different from other crimes that people experience in our city,” she said. “It is a symptom of things going wrong in people’s lives.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe ABQnews Seeker Albuquerque News Crime From the newspaper Front Page News Suggested Stories: Notorious crimes of 2013 – Jan 2, 2014 Albuquerque homicides down despite recent violence – Aug 22, 2014 Murders in Albuquerque up sharply in 2015 – Jan 4, 2016 San Antonio records 151 homicides in 2016, most in 2 decades – Jan 1, 2017 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

 Orlando cop searching for suspect who fatally shot another officer dies in motorcycle crash Mike Schneider, Associated Press Jan. 9, 2017, 11:27 AM 1,920 facebook linkedin twitter email print Markeith Loyd, the suspect in the shooting of an Orlando County Police officer on Monday morning. Orlando Police Department ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) —The Sheriff's Office said on Monday that a deputy sheriff was killed in a motorcycle crash while searching for the suspect who shot and killed the Orlando police officer. The police officer died following a shooting while on duty early Monday, and authorities are conducting a massive manhunt for the suspect. The Orlando Police Department announced the officer's death on its official Twitter account Monday morning. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in Orlando earlier Monday. The tweet said, "One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words." With the Twitter post was a video of the officer's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. A news conference is planned at Orlando Regional Medical Center. The Orange County Sheriff's Office has joined in the search for the suspect, identified as Markeith Loyd, 41, in an area of northwest metro Orlando.  Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. No additional details were provided about the shooting. But sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The sheriff's office said Lloyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his ex-girlfriend last December. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting.   More from Associated Press: Rescuers search collapsed buildings in Italy after another powerful earthquake hits region near Perugia Texas Longhorns jump all the way up to No. 11 in latest AP poll after beating Notre Dame A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university's president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure Craig Sager is hoping to return to NBA sidelines by November after receiving a rare third bone-marrow transplant David Ortiz honored with a corn maze cut in his likeness More: Associated Press Shooting Orlando Florida facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Orlando cop searching for suspect who fatally shot another officer dies in motorcycle crash Orlando cop searching for suspect who fatally shot another officer dies in motorcycle crash ORLANDO, Fla.

Skip to content People Crime News Courts & Trials Cold Cases Crime Orlando Officer and ‘Hero’ Mom Allegedly Fatally Shot By Man Suspected of Killing His Pregnant Girlfriend By Greg Hanlon•@GregHanlon Posted on January 9, 2017 at 12:26pm EST Share Tweet Email Pinterest Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton Orlando Police/Twitter An Orlando, Florida, police officer was fatally shot in the line of duty Monday morning and the suspect — who was already wanted for the killing of his pregnant girlfriend in December — is still at large, authorities announced. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was shot in the parking lot of a Walmart on Princeton Street in Orlando, Police Chief John Mina said at a Monday morning news conference. She died at 7:40 a.m., he said. The suspect, Markeith Loyd, had been sought in the fatal shooting of his pregnant girlfriend, Mina said, adding that according to preliminary information, Clayton recognized Loyd before her fatal shooting. She was reportedly trying to detain him. A manhunt for Loyd is ongoing and “he should be considered armed and dangerous,” Mina said. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at the news conference that authorities “have been very aggressively looking for Markeith Loyd for the past couple of weeks” in connection with the death of his girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13. Demings suspects that Loyd is “receiving help from someone, and we’re calling upon sensible individuals to help us bring him to justice on this day.” • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Good news is that he does think it is possible. "When you look at how far stocks would need to rally to get back to their all-time highs, you will find that many of these Dow names have been much higher in less fortuitous circumstances," the "Mad Money" host said. Cramer boiled it down to 12 encouraging stocks that must advance more than 10 percent to get back to their old highs. David Trood | Getty Images No. 1 is Wal-Mart, which would need to climb 32 percent to get back to where it was two years ago. With the strength of Amazon, Cramer recognized that this is a lot to ask and said he doesn't expect it to help the Dow get to 20,000. No. 2 is American Express. The stock has 28 percent to run back to its 2014, and Cramer recommended buying it at current levels. All it would take is a multiple expansion now that the multiple is in favor. No. 3 was IBM, which would have to mount a 26 percent gain to get back to its $216 high in 2013. Unfortunately, Cramer didn't think IBM will get back to a 15 price-to-earnings multiple up from its current 12. "In truth, IBM should never have been as high as $216. Its earnings were inflated by buybacks and the price was hyped by hoopla surrounding Warren Buffett's anointment of the stock," Cramer said. No. 4 was Nike, the most intriguing stock to Cramer. Nike would need its stock to advance 26 percent to reach old highs, and Cramer thinks if Donald Trump can lower the corporate tax rate, it could help move it higher. However, he wasn't confident that it can close the gap between $53 and $67. No. 5 was Caterpillar, which also told investors it's not doing that well. It also would be the most hurt if Trump starts to play hardball with China, but it would also be a large beneficiary to a domestic infrastructure program. Cramer was willing to bet that the stock can creep towards its old level on positive commodity data and cost cuts from Trump. No. 6 and 7 were Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which need to add 17 percent to get back to their old highs, and Cramer won't count on them to get the Dow to 20,000. "Frankly, that is just asking too much of these stocks," Cramer said. No. 8 was Coca-Cola, and with a new CEO coming in, Cramer was willing to bet that the restructuring designed by outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent means the company will meet its numbers. However, he says the stock cannot be relied on to rally 14 percent to its former glory. No. 9 was Apple, and Cramer thinks the stock is looking like it will break out soon. It must advance a little more than 13 percent, and Cramer is concerned that Apple hasn't augmented its service revenue stream and isn't using its massive cash hoard to make more acquisitions. No. 10 was Cisco, which is still reeling from a downbeat quarter. Cramer wants Cisco to find a way to make it clear that its legacy business isn't hurting it as it transitions to more of a cloud play. He wasn't confident that the stock can rally 13 percent to its recent high. No. 11 and 12 was Disney and United Technologies, which need to rally 12 and 10 percent respectively to get to all-time highs. Based on Disney's theme park attendance, movies and potential to be a beneficiary of a corporate tax cut, Cramer called this one an "up" stock United Technologies will have a tough time gaining traction because of its recent strong run. If anything, Cramer expects the numbers to come down. So, while Cramer only found a few stocks among the list that could get back to old highs, many of them reached such high levels in a worse environment. Perhaps they can do it again.

The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. (Jacob Langston/Orlando Sentinel via AP) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on January 09, 2017 at 5:02 PM, updated January 09, 2017 at 5:31 PM comments ORLANDO, Fla. -- An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, and a second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted for the murder of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. Another Orlando police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. "If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers ... and we cannot control what happens in that situation," Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference.

Debra Clayton (Photo: Orlando Police Department) What should have been a day of police appreciation began in tragedy as Orlando authorities mounted a massive manhunt Monday morning for a suspect who allegedly killed an officer. Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton — a 17-year veteran of the department — was gunned down by a murder suspect she pursued on a tip, Chief John Mina told reporters during a press conference Monday afternoon. This tipster approached Clayton on the street and said they knew the suspect, Markeith Lloyd, was aware he was wanted for murder and disclosed his location at a Walmart in northern Orlando. Clayton sent word over her radio at 7:17 a.m. that she was attempting to approach the suspect at the store. It was only two minutes later that officers in her squad radioed dispatch about Clayton being shot. Gunfire rang out as soon as Clayton made contact with the suspect. She returned fire, but investigators believe she may have missed, Mina said. A short time after, the 42-year-old officer was transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center. She died at about 7:40 a.m., authorities said. Immediately upon firing on Clayton, the suspect fled and stole a car. Mina said he and his team of investigators believe Clayton is being aided and threatened criminal charges for anyone found doing so.     “We are using every resource possible to find him and arrest him,” Mina said. “I can assure you that we will not rest until we find Markeith Lloyd.”    Markeith Lloyd The suspect is wanted by authorities on first-degree murder and attempted murder charges. An Orange County Sheriff’s deputy pursued Lloyd after the car-jacking and was fired on after following the suspect into a nearby apartment complex. Authorities said the unmarked SUV was struck twice and the deputy was unharmed. Lloyd again escaped capture and carjacked another vehicle. During the pursuit, another sheriff’s deputy on a motorcycle was killed when a vehicle turned in front of the officer. It is unclear if Markeith will be charged for that officer’s death. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Middle District of Florida and the Orange County Sheriff’s Department could not be reached for comment by article publication. Lloyd was initially wanted in connection with the December 2016 murder of a pregnant woman. A $100,000 reward is being offered through Crimeline for information that may be helpful in leading police to Lloyd. Mina said that SWAT teams from several agencies and hundreds of officers are still looking for Lloyd and have searched dozens of homes. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the FBI, ATF and U.S. Marshals Service are assisting in the effort. “These tragic deaths make clear the great risks that our brave men and women in uniform face each and every day, and the deep and abiding gratitude that our nation owes them for their service,” Lynch said Monday.     Clayton is survived by a husband and a college-age son. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help financially support the officer’s family during this difficult time, the Orlando Police Department announced. The fact that Officer Clayton was killed on Officer Appreciation Day takes away from the national event started in 2015, but it underscores its importance, said Sarah Slone, public relations director with Concerns of Police Survivors, a non-profit group that offers support to law enforcement and their families.    “It’s supposed to be a day of respect for officers,” Slone told Guns.com. “There needs to be more appreciation shown and we need to stand by our officers.” There have only been two line-of-duty deaths this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks officer deaths. Last year, 140 officers died while on duty, 63 from gunfire. In 2015, there 130 officer deaths, 39 of which were caused by gunfire, according to the website. The number of law enforcement officers killed feloniously in 2015 was down close to 20 percent from the previous year, according to recent FBI data.    “Unfortunately, it’s become not a matter of if but when an officer will die,” Slone said. “It happens way too often and it saddens the event a little bit more.” Article updated Jan. 10 to add family fund information and the increase in reward to $100,000.

But because of long queues at the tills, crowded car parks and understaffed stores, are Aldi and Lidl ’s bubbles about to be burst? Clive Black, at stockbroker Shore Capital, said the discounters have become victims of their own success, with “overtrading” leaving stores looking “as if they’ve been robbed by a load of schoolkids”. Aldi said the claims “bear no relation to reality” and that sales over Christmas were 15% higher than last year. While Lidl has plans to open a dozen more upmarket stores – part of a £1.5billion plan to mimic Waitrose. From high streets with numerous butchers, bakers and grocers to all-in-one corner shops and the birth of the mega-supermarket, things have changed drastically over the past 100 years. Here’s a look at how shops and shopping have been transformed – and a peek into the future. Corner shop: 1900 (Photo: Hulton Archive) Samuel Stores in East London sold a wide variety of goods A century ago many streets had a corner shop that sold an array of groceries and household goods. Shopkeepers prided themselves on knowing all their customers by name. Stock was kept behind the counter. The goods were weighed out by hand, cut up, sliced and wrapped – and there was usually time for a chinwag with the staff and anyone else in the queue. These general stores were the backbone of the community at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 as many mothers left to run their household could not travel far without transport. Self service: 1950 (Photo: Internet Unknown) Sainsbury's in Croydon, Surrey, started the phenomenon Sainsbury’s launched the first self-service store – where customers collected their own groceries in baskets, rather than relying on assistants standing behind counters – in Croydon, Surrey, in 1950. The format soon spread to high streets across the country. A year later 28-year-old businessman Patrick Galvani opened Premier Supermarket in Streatham, South London. It was the first to qualify as a supermarket, not only because it was self-service but thanks to it having a floor space of more than 2,500sq ft. Creating a shopping phenomenon, before the end of the store’s opening day, 1,500 people — many of them used to years of rationing — had passed through its doors. After decades of queuing patiently behind counters at their local corner shop, many customers enjoyed the freedom of serving themselves, grabbing what they wanted before paying at one of the three tills. The launch was so successful that within 14 years Express Dairies – the company behind Premier – had opened a further 39 stores and had been eagerly followed by major competitors including Tesco.

It was launched in West Bridgford, Notts, by Gem International Supercentres Incorporated, a US-owned firm hoping to bring American shopping habits to our shores. Boasting around 50 departments, including sports goods, records, toys, a restaurant, a pharmacy, a hairdresser, and shoe repairs – as well as groceries – there was also enough parking for roughly 1,000 cars. But despite an estimated 30,000 people visiting on the opening weekend in November 1964, causing traffic jams for miles around, the US chain was not a success. Experts reckoned we were not ready for the change. Two years on, Gem sold its stake to Asda and the superstore concept took off, with Tesco and Sainsbury’s soon following suit. By the late-60s, as more women went out to work, families were less likely to visit high street stores each day to buy food for the evening meal. And as more homes had fridges, many households were doing a weekly rather than a daily shop. Chris Stockdale, son of Asda co-founder Sir Noel, said the store “was part of a shopping revolution”. He added: “It provided customers with the opportunity to buy most of their household needs at very competitive prices.” Budget chains:1990 (Photo: Bloomberg) German stores Aldi and Lidl undercut big supermarkets The big four supermarket chains faced a game-changing threat in the 1990s as a pair of German competitors cut into their profits by offering no-frills shopping. With lobsters for a fiver and £15 “leather” jackets, Aldi has been a hit with bargain-hunting Brits since its first UK stores opened in 1990. In 2015 it overtook Waitrose to become the UK’s sixth largest supermarket chain. (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Lidl quickly got in on the act too, launching its first store in Britain in 1994. Rather than offering a wide range of choice to trolley-stacking weekly shoppers, the discounting German chains were more aimed at the little-but-often shoppers. Their success in stealing a share of the market has been built on several factors. They ruthlessly axed brands that don’t sell in large quantities; produced copycat versions of popular high street lines; and offered luxury products such as caviar and Belgian chocolates at knockdown prices.

This was followed by Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer although Iceland was the first to extended its scheme nationally. A year later, ASDA launched a grocery home delivery service, an online home entertainment offer and a digital television channel selling non-food lines like its George range of clothing. In 2016 Amazon Fresh made its highly anticipated entry into the UK grocery market promising “everything you need for your weekly shop”, delivered to your door in a cool box. Experts are predicting the US online giant could grab up to 3 percent of the UK grocery market by 2020 - representing £1.4bn of sales, much of which would be stolen from Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. “I genuinely believe this is a game-changer,” says grocery market analyst Bryan Roberts at TCC Global. Although offering one-hour delivery slots between 7am and 11pm, seven days a week, with same-day delivery services available from 5pm for orders placed by 1pm, the service is still limited to London and surrounding areas. Downsizing: 2014 (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) Mini supermarkets move into our towns and cities As competition increased from the German discount stores, traditional supermarkets shrank the size of their stores. The change tapped into the habit of consumers shopping more locally and frequently. Once threatened with extinction, the mini-supermarket was on the march again in 2014, when the amount of Sainsbury’s Local stores overtook the number of its supermarkets. David Gray, a senior analyst at Planet Retail, says: “People are increasingly doing one big shop – in store or online – every week or fortnight, and then topping up at convenience stores.” There was a real blast from the retail past last year when Sainsbury’s went back to its roots by delivering goods by bicycle in Central London. The service was first offered by the chain more than 130 years ago. The future (Photo: AFP) Last month, Amazon successfully carried out its first drone test delivery - though not of food. Although the US giant has not revealed any plans to extend to its grocery delivery service yet, all eyes will be on the retailer after a pizza was delivered by drone in Germany at the start of January, leading experts to speculate on when the service will become mainstream. Could we potentially see a future where food arrives by drone still frozen or even store-cooked chickens on your doorstep steaming hot. With the advances in technology moving faster and faster and retailers racing to be the first to offer new, exciting products and services, few would bet against it.

Debra Clayton; an unidentified Sheriff’s deputy was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to the manhunt. ▶ An Orlando police officer has died following a shooting while on duty early Monday, and a second officer died during the manhunt for the suspect. (Associated Press ) By Mike SchneiderThe Associated Press Mon., Jan. 9, 2017 ORLANDO, FLA.—An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, and a second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted for the murder of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and an Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. The deputy wasn’t identified because his family hadn’t been notified. Another Orlando police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries.

Debra Clayton.  (Red Huber / Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service)   Friends and colleagues leave after the body of an Orange County Sherriff's Office deputy was transported from Orlando Regional Medical Center. The deputy was killed while responding to the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police officer in Orlando, Monday.  (Joe Burbank / Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service)   “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. “If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers ... and we cannot control what happens in that situation,” Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighbourhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armour, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt, authorities said. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. “I’m heartbroken and angry,” Scott said.

Debra Clayton, who died in the line of duty on Monday. next play/pause pre Hamilton Spectator By Mike Schneider ORLANDO, Fla. — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a news conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. Another Orlando police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a news conference. "He will be brought to justice." Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully.

The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. Clayton was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out.

(CNN) An Orlando police officer searching for a murder suspect was gunned down Monday, and a sheriff's deputy looking for her killer died shortly later. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran and mother of two, died Monday morning, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. The Orlando Police Department tweeted a video of Clayton's flag-draped casket as it was wheeled away from a hospital. The chief said Clayton was trying to contact a murder suspect at a Walmart at 7:17 a.m. Two minutes later, police received a call of an officer shot. Witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV the gunman was wearing a security uniform. "He walked by me, had a security vest and everything," Herman said. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down." Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. Mina identified the suspect as Markeith Loyd, who is also wanted for the killing of a pregnant woman in December. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. Sheriff's deputy killed Authorities across Orange County scrambled to find Loyd. During the manhunt, a sheriff's deputy was killed in a crash, Demings said. "Not only did we lose an Orlando police officer today, we lost an Orange County deputy sheriff as well who was traveling on his motorcycle," the sheriff said. "A motorist turned in front of him. Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." The deputy's name has not been released pending notification of relatives. A dangerous pursuit Demings said several law enforcement officers have been injured searching for Loyd. At one point during the manhunt, an Orange County sheriff's captain saw a vehicle that was believed to belong to the suspect and made a U-turn, Demings said. The suspect fired at the captain. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are now pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. As hundreds of law enforcement officers searched for the killer, several Orange County schools went on lockdown. A hero who went above and beyond While the manhunt continues, Mina said his department is grieving the death of a "hero." "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. "Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life protecting the community that she loved." The sheriff said his department is also mourning the death of its deputy. But with an "armed and extremely dangerous" killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. "While we're processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do," Demings said. A deadly first for 2017 Clayton's death marks the first firearm-related fatality of a law enforcement officer in the US in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash. The deaths of Clayton and the unidentified Orange County sheriff's deputy mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. Groeninger said 2016 saw 136 law enforcement deaths, including 65 from firearms. Copyright 2017 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.

(AP) — An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. A second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted in the killing of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. "If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers ... and we cannot control what happens in that situation," Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Gov. Rick Scott canceled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

She was married and had a college-aged son. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Advertisement Continue reading “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Gov. Rick Scott canceled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. “I’m heartbroken and angry,” Scott said. ___ Information from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Deputy killed while pursuing Orlando suspect – Jan 9, 2017 Reward raised for capture of suspect in officer killing – Jan 10, 2017 Reward shooting suspect raised to $100,000 – Jan 10, 2017 2 charged with aiding fugitive in police slaying – Jan 11, 2017 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

A second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash during the massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities offered a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old wanted in the killing of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences were searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Walmart store in Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to the search for Loyd. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” said police Chief John Mina.

Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves.

Vancouver's Talk Emily Lazatin Posted: January 09, 2017 01:24 pm An hour long wait for a cab in Vancouver can be normal on a busy night, but how about in the suburbs at 4:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday? A Maple Ridge man says he drove two seniors home after they said they waited too long for a cab. Colin Roarty was leaving Walmart at Haney Place mall when two elderly women asked for a ride home because they had been waiting over an hour for a taxi. “There was ice all over the place, one of them had a walker, and they were probably in their mid-80’s. They were both totally distressed.” READ MORE: More cabs in Vancouver for holiday season Him and his wife drove the two women home. “It was going to start getting dark, they were probably how they weren’t able to get a cab, so their last effort was to ask a stranger.” He’s calling on the province to move faster to bring in ride-sharing solutions like Uber. “These seniors I’m sure don’t have smartphones, they might not be able to summon an Uber but if there was Uber around, I’m sure they wouldn’t have a problem getting a taxi.” READ MORE: No new taxis on the road any time soon: Vancouver City Council Roarty says he’s given up on cabs in Maple Ridge, he says waiting up to an hour or more is normal. CKNW has yet to hear back from Alouette Taxi, the company that serves Maple Ridge. Icy conditions may have been the cause B.C. Taxi Association President Mohan Kang says it’s unusual to wait an hour for a cab in Maple Ridge and icy conditions may have caused delays. “Lately, really bad weather. The taxis in any place would take much more time to serve in a timely fashion. We don’t want people to wait one hour, not even 15 minutes even.” Kang also says cars are ready to go, but the city is lagging in the number of ‘chauffeur permits’ it’s issuing.

A second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted in the killing of Master Sgt.

Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Gov. Rick Scott canceled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. “I’m heartbroken and angry,” Scott said.

Debra Clayton approached the suspect and was shot ORLANDO, Fla. — A massive manhunt was underway Jan. 9 in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton’s killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Jan. 9. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. “He will be brought to justice.” Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Jan. 9 at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff’s officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer’s vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said.

Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a former candidate for president, is serving his second term in Senate. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)In my view, the media spends too much time treating politics like a baseball game, a personality contest or a soap opera. We need to focus less on polls, fundraisers, gaffes and who's running for president in four years, and more on the very serious problems facing the American people -- problems which get relatively little discussion. I hope that's what our town meeting on CNN tonight will accomplish. There are a lot of important questions to talk about, including: How do we stop the movement toward oligarchy in our country in which the economic and political life of the United States is increasingly controlled by a handful of billionaires? Bernie Sanders Are we content with the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we are experiencing? Should the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? Should one family in this country, the Waltons of the Walmart retail chain, own as much as the bottom 40 percent of our people? Should 52 percent of all new income be going into the pockets of the top 1 percent? While the very rich become much richer, are we satisfied with having the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth? Can a worker really survive on the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour? How can a working-class family afford $15,000 a year for childcare? How can a senior citizen or a disabled veteran get by on $13,000 a year from Social Security? Read More What can be done about a political system in which the very rich are able to spend unlimited sums of money to elect candidates who represent their interests? Is that really what democracy is about? Why, in the year 2017, do we still have state governments trying to suppress the vote and make it harder for poor people, young people and people of color to participate in the political process? CNN will host town hall with Bernie Sanders Why is the richest country in the history of the world the only major country not to provide health care to all as a right, despite spending much more per capita? Why are we one of the very few countries on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave? With the five major drug companies making over $50 billion in profits last year, why do we end up paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? How do we succeed in a competitive global economy if we do not have the best educated workforce in the world? And how can we have that quality workforce if so many of our young people are unable to afford higher education or leave school deeply in debt? Not so many years ago, we had the highest percentage of college graduates in the world. Now we don't even rank in the top ten. What can we do to make sure that every American, regardless of income, gets all of the education he or she needs? Meanwhile, on climate change, the debate is over. The scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and is already doing devastating harm to our country and the entire world. How do we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy while protecting those workers who might lose their jobs as a result of the transition? This is no small issue. The future of the planet is at stake. Obama: US climate efforts can withstand 'near-term politics' We are now spending $80 billion a year to imprison 2.2 million Americans, who are disproportionately African-American, Latino and Native American. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth, including China, which is home to four times as many people. How do we reform a broken criminal justice system? How do we create jobs and educational opportunity for young people, not more jails and incarceration? We must create a path for the 11 million undocumented people in our country to become lawful permanent residents and eventually citizens. How can we move our nation toward common sense, humane and comprehensive immigration reform and by doing that help reverse the decline of our middle class and better prepare the United States to compete in the global economy? Our nation's infrastructure is collapsing and the American people know it. At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports, levees, dams, schools and housing stock are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. How can we work together to make that happen? Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook These are the issues that need to be talked about all over the country.

A law enforcement vehicle drives near a Walmart where a police officer was shot, Monday, Jan. 9, 2017, in Orlando, Fla. Orlando police say an officer who was shot while on duty has died; a manhunt is underway for the suspect. (AP Photo/John Raoux) ORLANDO, Fla. – A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton’s killing. Another Orlando Police officer also was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but only had minor injuries. The shooting occurred near a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. “He will be brought to justice.” Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. “If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers … and we cannot control what happens in that situation,” Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff’s officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer’s vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. “I’m heartbroken and angry,” Scott said. ___ Information from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. 2 comments on this story The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

Police on Sunday arrested a Latrobe man on accusations that he set up a former friend last month to be robbed of his paycheck. State police in Greensburg allege that Austin D. Pesca, 22, offered to drive a friend, Brian Nicely, also of Latrobe, to cash his $796 pay check on Dec. 1 at Wal-Mart in Unity Township. Nicely told troopers that Pesca and he were going to have a few drinks afterward “to catch up on old times.” However, when Nicely returned to Pesca's car about 11:30 p.m., that Pesca reported he had received a telephone call from a friend in Jeannette who needed a ride to Latrobe, Nicely told troopers. Although he told Pesca he did not want to accompany him, Nicely told troopers that Pesca refused to drop him off and drove to Jeannette anyway. After Pesca picked up his friend, the pair drove Nicely to the rear of a closed Rite Aid store on West Hills Drive and Pesca's friend pulled out a handgun and demanded Nicely's money, Trooper John Zalich wrote in an affidavit of probable cause filed before Hempfield District Judge Mark Mansour. Nicely told troopers that he was assaulted by Pesca and the unidentified male after he exited the car. Pesca and the other man fled the scene, and Nicely told police he ran into the woods. Pesca was arraigned in night court before Ligonier District Judge Denise Thiel and ordered held in the county prison after failing to post $30,000 bond. A preliminary hearing is scheduled Jan. 20.

"To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran and mother of two, died Monday morning, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Orlando police are holding a press conference to update the hunt for a suspect. You can watch the press conference live below. "The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today," OPD tweeted, along with video of a flag-draped casket. "One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words." The chief said Clayton was trying to contact a murder suspect at a Walmart at 7:17 a.m. Two minutes later, police received a call of an officer shot. Witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV the gunman was wearing a security uniform. "He walked by me, had a security vest and everything," Herman said. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down." Herman said the man continued to shoot behind him as he was running from the scene. Police identified the suspect as Markeith Loyd. Mina said he is also wanted for the killing of a pregnant woman. Sheriff's deputy killed Authorities across Orange County scrambled to find Loyd. During the manhunt, a sheriff's deputy was killed in a crash, Demings said. "Not only did we lose an Orlando police officer today, we lost an Orange County deputy sheriff as well who was traveling on his motorcycle," the sheriff said. "A motorist turned in front of him. Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." The deputy's name has not been released pending notification of relatives. A dangerous pursuit Demings said several law enforcement officers have been injured searching for Loyd. Authorities warn that the murder suspect is armed and dangerous. At one point during the manhunt, an Orange County sheriff's captain saw a vehicle that appeared to be the suspect's and made a U-turn, Demings said. The suspect fired at the captain. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are now pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. At least 17 nearby schools are on lockdown as the suspect remains at large, officials said. A hero who went above and beyond While the manhunt continues, Mina said his department is mourning the death of a "hero." "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. "Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life protecting the community that she loved." A deadly first for 2017 Clayton's death marks the first firearm-related fatality of a law enforcement officer in the US in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash. The deaths of Clayton and the unidentified Orange County sheriff's deputy mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. Groeninger said 2016 saw 136 law enforcement deaths, including 65 from firearms.

We need to focus less on polls, fundraisers, gaffes and who’s running for president in four years, and more on the very serious problems facing the American people — problems which get relatively little discussion. I hope that’s what our town meeting on CNN tonight will accomplish. There are a lot of important questions to talk about, including: How do we stop the movement toward oligarchy in our country in which the economic and political life of the United States is increasingly controlled by a handful of billionaires? Are we content with the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we are experiencing? Should the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? Should one family in this country, the Waltons of the Walmart retail chain, own as much as the bottom 40 percent of our people? Should 52 percent of all new income be going into the pockets of the top 1 percent? While the very rich become much richer, are we satisfied with having the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth? Can a worker really survive on the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour? How can a working-class family afford $15,000 a year for childcare? How can a senior citizen or a disabled veteran get by on $13,000 a year from Social Security? What can be done about a political system in which the very rich are able to spend unlimited sums of money to elect candidates who represent their interests? Is that really what democracy is about? Why, in the year 2017, do we still have state governments trying to suppress the vote and make it harder for poor people, young people and people of color to participate in the political process? Why is the richest country in the history of the world the only major country not to provide health care to all as a right, despite spending much more per capita? Why are we one of the very few countries on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave? With the five major drug companies making over $50 billion in profits last year, why do we end up paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? How do we succeed in a competitive global economy if we do not have the best educated workforce in the world? And how can we have that quality workforce if so many of our young people are unable to afford higher education or leave school deeply in debt? Not so many years ago, we had the highest percentage of college graduates in the world. Now we don’t even rank in the top ten. What can we do to make sure that every American, regardless of income, gets all of the education he or she needs? Meanwhile, on climate change, the debate is over. The scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and is already doing devastating harm to our country and the entire world. How do we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy while protecting those workers who might lose their jobs as a result of the transition? This is no small issue. The future of the planet is at stake. We are now spending $80 billion a year to imprison 2.2 million Americans, who are disproportionately African-American, Latino and Native American. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth, including China, which is home to four times as many people. How do we reform a broken criminal justice system? How do we create jobs and educational opportunity for young people, not more jails and incarceration? We must create a path for the 11 million undocumented people in our country to become lawful permanent residents and eventually citizens. How can we move our nation toward common sense, humane and comprehensive immigration reform and by doing that help reverse the decline of our middle class and better prepare the United States to compete in the global economy? Our nation’s infrastructure is collapsing and the American people know it. At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports, levees, dams, schools and housing stock are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. How can we work together to make that happen? These are the issues that need to be talked about all over the country. I thank CNN for allowing us to have a serious discussion about serious issues.

(AP) — An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. A second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted in the killing of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Story continues below video × Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. "If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers ... and we cannot control what happens in that situation," Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Gov. Rick Scott canceled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

The Orlando police department announced the death of Master Sgt Debra Clayton on Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton’s killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in north-west Orlando earlier on Monday. The suspect was identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd was a suspect of the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Sheriff Jerry Demings of Orange County said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” the police chief, John Mina, said at a press conference. “He will be brought to justice.” Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loved. An official police tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” said the deputy chief, Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. Clayton was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7.40am, less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of her body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in north-west Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in north-west Orlando was nowhere near the city’s tourism area in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando’s mayor, Buddy Dyer, declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him on Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff’s officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer’s vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy was not harmed, the sheriff’s office said.

Courtesy photo SAN JACINTO – New brightly colored messages are shining day and night along San Jacinto Avenue and along Ramona Boulevard, thanks to two new light-emitting diode signs recently installed by San Jacinto Unified School District. One sign replaced an older-style reader board outside of San Jacinto High School at the corner of Ramona Boulevard and Tiger Lane, and the other sign is located between the district’s administrative office complex and the San Jacinto Wal-Mart superstore. “Even as soon as the first few hours either sign was activated, we starting receiving supportive feedback,” Michael Collins, SJUSD’s director of facilities and operations, said. “The great visibility from the chosen locations are just what we had planned for, and you can feel the excitement in our community.” SJUSD has been planning for these electronic signs for a few years, as an outcome from the stakeholder input collection required by the State of California. The Local Control and Accountability Plan public schools are required to submit each year for state funding must feature goals and objectives that support local priorities. In 2015, the district’s one of the LCAP goals was to “implement a comprehensive communications plan that focuses on student, family, community engagement and partnerships, reflects innovation, accessibility and connectivity, and cultivates excellence in a caring and safe, student-centered environment.” The goal carried an action item for additional signs to improve visibility and efficiency in delivering messages of events, alerts and services. “We started working with a nonprofit group that specializes in community signs quite a while ago,” Seth Heeren, assistant superintendent of business services for SJUSD, said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t reach an agreement so we started developing our own plans and tightened our budgets so we could finance the cost of two new signs without impacting other projects or student services.” As the second largest employer in San Jacinto, SJUSD recognizes their importance in the community and understands their impact on families throughout the valley. “Our 2016 LCAP Goal No. 4, similar to last year’s Goal No. 7, remains steadfast in promoting home/school/community partnerships,” SJUSD Superintendent Diane Perez said. “We have already been promoting several community events on our new signs and have plans to increase our outreach with businesses and service organizations. We believe in collaboration and meaningful relationships. Our success is tied to the success of our community.” The Hemet/San Jacinto Valley Chamber of Commerce recently honored SJUSD with the 2016 Large Business of the Year award in June.

(AP) — An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. A second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted in the killing of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. "If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers ... and we cannot control what happens in that situation," Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area.

"There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Gov. Rick Scott canceled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

Debra Clayton. Picture: Reuters Florida - A man wanted for killing his former girlfriend fatally shot an Orlando, Florida, police officer on Monday, authorities said, prompting a manhunt and a reward of up to $60 000 (R820 000). The suspect was identified as Markieth Loyd, 41, who was considered armed and dangerous. An Orange County sheriff's deputy in the manhunt for Loyd was killed in a collision between his motorcycle and a vehicle. "We are bringing this dirt bag to justice," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said of Loyd at a news conference. Authorities said the slain officer, Master Sergeant Debra Clayton, was shot while responding to a sighting of the suspect. Loyd fled the shooting scene outside a Walmart in a car and fired at a deputy who tried to the stop him, authorities said. The deputy was unharmed. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning after the officers' deaths. Authorities have been trying to capture Loyd in connection with the December murder of a pregnant woman, the Orange County Sheriff's office said. According to online jail record, Loyd also had been booked in October in Orange County on charges including burglary, attempted carjacking and violation of a pretrial release. Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, died at a hospital, the department said. Several photos posted on social media showed Clayton at community events, working to improve relations between police and residents. "The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today," the department said on its Twitter feed, which also showed a video of officers escorting a U.S. flag-draped gurney. "One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words." Orange County Public Schools said in a tweet 17 schools had been placed on lockdown, adding: "All students & staff are safe."

A $60-thousand-dollar reward is being offered for information for Markeith Loyd, the suspected shooter in the death of the Orlando Police Department officer Master Sargent Debra Clayton on Monday, January 9, 2017, according to a tweet from the Orlando... By Holly Yan, Ralph Ellis and AnneClaire Stapleton CNN (CNN) -- Hundreds of law enforcement officers were scouring Orlando early Tuesday for a man suspected of fatally shooting a police officer outside a Walmart. The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff's deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect -- who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. "I'm confident we will find him," Mina said. "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him." "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'He shot her down' On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. "As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her," the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. "That's not uncommon," he said. "We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police." Clayton returned fire but investigators don't think she struck the gunman, Mina said. Two minutes after Clayton's last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched "dozens of apartments and residences" and won't slow down because of darkness. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at. Sheriff's deputy killed As authorities scrambled to find Loyd, Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died in a crash as he was traveling on his motorcycle. "A motorist turned in front of him," the sheriff said. "Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff's department. In another incident, police said the suspect fired at an Orange County sheriff's captain who spotted his vehicle. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend's death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood. She was the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, was critically injured when he tried to come to Dixon's aid, WFTV reported, citing deputies. A hero who went above and beyond Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran at the department. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. The sheriff said his department also is mourning the death of its deputy. But with an "armed and extremely dangerous" killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. "While we're processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do," Demings said. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The deaths of Clayton and Lewis mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash.

Courtesy Orlando Police Department/Handout via REUTERS 2/2 By Jon Herskovitz A man wanted for killing his former girlfriend fatally shot an Orlando, Florida, police officer on Monday, authorities said, prompting a manhunt and a reward of up to $60,000. Helicopters buzzed the skies while scores of police shut streets and went door to door in their search for the suspect, identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. He was considered armed and dangerous. An Orange County sheriff's deputy in the manhunt for Loyd was killed in a collision between his motorcycle and a van, police said. The driver of the van was a 78-year-old man, according to local TV station News 6. "We are bringing this dirt bag to justice," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said of Loyd at a news conference, adding that federal agents had joined the search. "We will track him down to the ends of the earth," he told a later news conference. Authorities said the slain officer, Master Sergeant Debra Clayton, was shot while responding to a sighting of the suspect at a local Walmart. Loyd fired at her and she returned fire, Mina said, adding that he did not believe Loyd was hit. Loyd fled the shooting scene outside the store in a car and fired at a deputy who tried to the stop him, authorities said. The deputy was unharmed. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning after the officers' deaths. Authorities have been trying to capture Loyd in connection with the December murder of a pregnant woman who was once his girlfriend, the Orange County Sheriff's office said. Clayton, a decorated 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, died at a hospital, the department said. Photos posted on social media showed her at community events, working to improve relations between police and residents. "The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today," the department said on Twitter, showing a video of officers escorting a U.S. flag-draped gurney. Local media said Clayton was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse gay nightclub massacre in Orlando last June, the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history, where a gunman killed 49 people. Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an 11-year-veteran, was killed in the manhunt for Loyd, the Orange County Sheriff's office said. Lewis, 35, once played football for the University of Central Florida. it said. "Norm will be deeply missed. Rest in peace, gentle giant," it said on its Facebook page.

Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran and mother of two, died Monday morning, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. The Orlando Police Department tweeted a video of Clayton’s flag-draped casket as it was wheeled away from a hospital. The chief said Clayton was trying to contact a murder suspect at a Walmart at 7:17 a.m. Two minutes later, police received a call of an officer shot. Witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV the gunman was wearing a security uniform. “He walked by me, had a security vest and everything,” Herman said. “I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down.” Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. Mina identified the suspect as Markeith Loyd, who is also wanted for the killing of a pregnant woman in December. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Sheriff’s deputy killed Authorities across Orange County scrambled to find Loyd. During the manhunt, a sheriff’s deputy was killed in a crash, Demings said. “Not only did we lose an Orlando police officer today, we lost an Orange County deputy sheriff as well who was traveling on his motorcycle,” the sheriff said. “A motorist turned in front of him. Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed.” The deputy’s name has not been released pending notification of relatives. A dangerous pursuit Demings said several law enforcement officers have been injured searching for Loyd. At one point during the manhunt, an Orange County sheriff’s captain saw a vehicle that was believed to belong to the suspect and made a U-turn, Demings said. The suspect fired at the captain. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are now pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. As hundreds of law enforcement officers searched for the killer, several Orange County schools went on lockdown. A hero who went above and beyond While the manhunt continues, Mina said his department is grieving the death of a “hero.” “I’ve known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself,” the police chief said. “Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life protecting the community that she loved.” The sheriff said his department is also mourning the death of its deputy. But with an “armed and extremely dangerous” killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. “While we’re processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do,” Demings said. A deadly first for 2017 Clayton’s death marks the first firearm-related fatality of a law enforcement officer in the US in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash. The deaths of Clayton and the unidentified Orange County sheriff’s deputy mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. Groeninger said 2016 saw 136 law enforcement deaths, including 65 from firearms. 2016 Presidential Campaign Hacking Fast Facts Orlando police officer killed; sheriff's deputy dies in search for killer Related Posts Another drone spotted near airliner in New York Newark, New Jersey, teen shot dead at Mother’s Day motorcycle gathering Newtown High School students charged in ‘sexting’ ring Gasoline Prices Decline as Prices Slip Further from February Peak Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Archive Manhunt underway for suspect in killing of Orlando police officer Monday Jan 9, 2017 at 10:00 AM Jan 9, 2017 at 12:20 PM nMIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.   Information from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Customer Service Newspaper in Education Submit an Ad Internships Contact Us Market Place Shop Cars Homes Free Classifieds Ad Classifieds Community Info Community Served About us Historic Headlines Peoria History Forms Anniversaries Births Engagements Weddings 100th Birthday Jobs in Peoria Pets Place a Classified Ad Real Estate Rentals Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Helicopters buzzed the skies while scores of police shut streets and went door to door in their search for the suspect, identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. He was considered armed and dangerous. An Orange County sheriff's deputy in the manhunt for Loyd was killed in a collision between his motorcycle and a van, police said. The driver of the van was a 78-year-old man, according to local TV station News 6. "We are bringing this dirt bag to justice," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said of Loyd at a news conference, adding that federal agents had joined the search. "We will track him down to the ends of the earth," he told a later news conference. Authorities said the slain officer, Master Sergeant Debra Clayton, was shot while responding to a sighting of the suspect at a local Walmart. Loyd fired at her and she returned fire, Mina said, adding that he did not believe Loyd was hit. Loyd fled the shooting scene outside the store in a car and fired at a deputy who tried to the stop him, authorities said. The deputy was unharmed. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning after the officers' deaths. Authorities have been trying to capture Loyd in connection with the December murder of a pregnant woman who was once his girlfriend, the Orange County Sheriff's office said. Clayton, a decorated 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, died at a hospital, the department said. Photos posted on social media showed her at community events, working to improve relations between police and residents. "The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today," the department said on Twitter, showing a video of officers escorting a U.S. flag-draped gurney. Local media said Clayton was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse gay nightclub massacre in Orlando last June, the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history, where a gunman killed 49 people. Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an 11-year-veteran, was killed in the manhunt for Loyd, the Orange County Sheriff's office said. Lewis, 35, once played football for the University of Central Florida. it said. "Norm will be deeply missed. Rest in peace, gentle giant," it said on its Facebook page.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.   © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

In front of Wal-Mart will be a commercial center with smaller businesses inside. Brian Hill | Staff Photographer   New construction is going up next to the Georgia's restaurant on Randall in Algonquin. In front of Wal-Mart will be a commercial center with smaller businesses inside. Brian Hill | Staff Photographer   Amy E. Williams     Many of you spent a lot of time along Randall Road this holiday season, getting all of your last-minute shopping and returning done. And as you drove back and forth on all of your errands, you passed many times by the new building under construction in Algonquin along Randall Road near Georgia's Restaurant and Pancake House. Many of you wondered and emailed asking what the new addition to the Randall Road corridor would be. Ben Mason, the village of Algonquin's senior planner, says the 8,000 square feet going up in front of the Wal-Mart, and near Georgia's, will become a new commercial building. Mason said the building should be completed by this coming spring and then should be ready for occupancy. Already, he said, two tenants plans to fill the space inside of the new building. The plans call for an AT&T store in one half of the new construction, and an Aspen Dental center in the other half of the building, Mason said. Each business will be approximately 4,000 square feet in size, he said. Author visits: The Barnes and Noble store in Geneva will be hosting two authors this week who will be doing appearances and book signings in the store. First up is author William Hazelgrove, who will be signing his book "Madame President: The Secret Presidency of Edith Wilson." The event begins at 4 p.m., Thursday, Jan. 12, at the store within Geneva Commons. Hazelgrove's historical book tells the story of First Lady Edith Wilson, who took on many of her husband President Woodrow Wilson's duties after he suffered a crippling stroke while in office. The book explores the idea of whether the United States may have in some ways already had its first female president, and makes the case that Edith Wilson did many of those duties in her husband's place when he could not perform them. Switching to a different genre, there also will be a signing later the same day at the store of a new fictional novel. At 7 p.m., author Sarah Barthel will be at the Geneva Barnes and Noble. She will be reading an excerpt from her new book "House of Silence." She also will be signing the book for patrons. The book is set in Oak Park in 1875. The novel tells the story of Isabelle Larken, who witnessed a horrific crime in that area. Afterward, she was brought to Bellevue Sanitarium. In the fictional novel, Larken befriends fellow patient Mary Todd Lincoln while at Bellevue. The book will appeal to many with its local sites and stories set in the late 1800s. Both author events at the store are free and open to the public. The featured books will be available that evening for purchase, and for signing. The Barnes and Noble in Geneva is at 102 Commons Drive.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: A man wanted for killing his former girlfriend fatally shot an Orlando, Florida, police officer on Monday (January 9) authorities said, prompting a manhunt and causing area schools to be put on lockdown as a precaution. Law enforcement officials were searching for a suspect identified as Markeith Loyd, 41, who was considered armed and dangerous. The slain officer, identified as Master Sergeant Debra Clayton, was responding to a reported sighting of the suspect. Loyd fled the shooting scene outside a Walmart and fired at a deputy who tried to the stop him, authorities said. The deputy was unharmed. An Orange County deputy taking part in the manhunt also was killed on Monday when a vehicle struck the deputy's motorcycle, the sheriff's office said. Authorities have been trying to capture Loyd in connection with the December murder of a pregnant woman, the Orange County Sheriff's office said. According to online jail record, Loyd also had been booked in October in Orange County on charges including burglary, attempted carjacking and violation of a pretrial release. Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, died at a hospital, the department said. "The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today," the department said on its Twitter feed, which also showed a video of officers escorting a U.S. flag-draped gurney. "One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words." Orange County Public Schools said in a tweet 17 schools had been placed on lockdown, adding: "All students & staff are safe."

(AP Photo/John Raoux) Posted: Monday, January 9, 2017 8:20 am Manhunt underway for suspect in killing of Orlando officer Associated Press | 0 comments ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd's arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said. ___ Information from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was killed after the assailant fired on her near an Orlando Walmart, Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. Police identified the suspected shooter as Markeith Loyd. He is wanted by police for the December murder of a pregnant woman. A local CBS affiliate identified the woman as Loyd's girlfriend. After the shooting, a deputy identified Loyd at which point he fired at the officer's vehicle before fleeing in a stolen car and later abandoned the vehicle, Mina said. "He will be brought to justice," said Mina. Police said a second officer was killed in a traffic accident while pursuing the manhunt. Roughly a dozen schools in the area have been put on lockdown as police continue the search, according to multiple reports. Clayton is survived by her husband and two children, said Mina.

Gallop, Florida Today Published 12:26 p.m. ET Jan. 9, 2017 | Updated 2:49 p.m. ET Jan. 9, 2017 Markeith Loyd, 41, is wanted in the shooting death of Orlando police officer Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. (Photo: Orlando Police Department) MELBOURNE, Fla. — An Orlando police officer described as a hero was shot and killed early Monday morning, prompting a manhunt for a suspect already wanted on charges he fatally shot his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month, authorities said. Hours later, an Orange County, Fla., sheriff's deputy was killed in a traffic crash as a search got underway for the Orlando officer's suspected killer. The traffic crash involving the sheriff's motor deputy, however, was not directly tied to the initial incident involving the shooting death of the Orlando officer, authorities said. Orlando police identified the officer shot as Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a mother of two and a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department. "She gave her life protecting the community she loved. She will be deeply missed," said Orlando Police Chief John Mina in an emotional news conference broadcast nationally. "We have a lot of resources trying to catch this suspect. He will be brought to justice," he said, calling the fallen officer a hero. USA TODAY Best friend backs up fellow cop; both die Police are searching for Markeith Loyd, 41, who was spotted Monday morning in Orlando fleeing in a vehicle from a Walmart where the Orlando officer was shot, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. A reward of up to $60,000 is being offered for information leading to his arrest. Loyd was already being sought in connection with the shooting death of 24-year-old Sade Dixon, a mother of two, at her west Orange County, Fla., home in December. Her brother also was shot and wounded in that incident, according to media reports. Clayton's death came as the nation marked the annual Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Across central Florida, tributes poured in on social media for Clayton and the Orange County sheriff's deputy who was killed in the traffic accident. The deputy was not identified. Investigators in that case were working to contact his relatives. Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday, Jan. 9, 2017.  (Photo: City of Orlando) Clayton's body, escorted on Orlando Avenue by a stream of police cars, evoked another tragic milestone as the procession rode past the Pulse nightclub, site of a massacre that claimed 49 lives near the heart of the city in June. Upon learning of the deadly incidents, Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted: "Just spoke to @ChiefJohnMina and am praying for @OrlandoPolice. I let him know the State stands ready to help in any way." Police have not detailed the circumstances leading up to Clayton's shooting death. However, they said that earlier, an unidentified deputy saw Loyd in a vehicle. Loyd pulled into a nearby apartment complex and shot at the deputy, striking his unmarked SUV twice, officials said, according to WKMG-TV. The deputy was not injured. The Orlando TV station reported Loyd then carjacked a vehicle and fled, police said. He later abandoned the vehicle. The manhunt was underway where he abandoned the vehicle, officials said. Authorities said Loyd should be considered armed and dangerous, WKMG-TV reported. "We are asking the public to assist us with his whereabouts," the Sheriff's Office said. "However, we ask the public not to approach him and call 911 instead." A video showed police officers saluting Clayton's body as it was carried out of Orlando Regional Medical Center on a flag-draped gurney. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next An Orlando police officer searching for a murder suspect was gunned down Monday, and a sheriff's deputy looking for her killer also died, authorities said. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day, is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. The Orlando Police Department announced a reward of up to $60,000 for anyone who can lead officers to the suspect, identified as Markeith Loyd by Orlando Police Chief John Mina.    If you know the location of Markeith Loyd reward is up to $60,000. Please call @CrimelineFL pic.twitter.com/hHrf8bMDWt— Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017   Loyd is also suspected in the killing of Sade Dixon, who was pregnant at the time of her death, according to the Orlando Police Department.  'One of our own was taken' Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran and mother of two, died Monday morning, Mina said. "The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today," OPD tweeted, along with video of a flag-draped casket. "One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words." The chief said Clayton was trying to contact a murder suspect at a Walmart at 7:17 a.m. Two minutes later, police received a call of an officer shot. Witness James Herman told CNN affiliate WFTV the gunman was wearing a security uniform. "He walked by me, had a security vest and everything," Herman said. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down." Herman said the man continued to shoot behind him as he was running from the scene.     Sheriff's deputy killed Authorities across Orange County scrambled to find Loyd. During the manhunt, a sheriff's deputy was killed in a crash, Demings said. "Not only did we lose an Orlando police officer today, we lost an Orange County deputy sheriff as well who was traveling on his motorcycle," the sheriff said. "A motorist turned in front of him. Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." The deputy's name has not been released pending notification of relatives. A dangerous pursuit Demings said several law enforcement officers have been injured searching for Loyd. Authorities warn that the murder suspect is armed and dangerous. At one point during the manhunt, an Orange County sheriff's captain saw a vehicle that appeared to be the suspect's and made a U-turn, Demings said. The suspect fired at the captain. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are now pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. At least 17 nearby schools are on lockdown as the suspect remains at large, officials said. While the search continues, Mina said his department is mourning the death of a "hero." "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. "Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life protecting the community that she loved." A deadly first for 2017 Clayton's death marks the first firearm-related fatality of a law enforcement officer in the US in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash. The deaths of Clayton and the unidentified Orange County sheriff's deputy mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. Groeninger said 2016 saw 136 law enforcement deaths, including 65 from firearms. CNN's Kate Conerly contributed to this report.   Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(John Raoux/AP) REUTERS A man wanted for killing his former girlfriend fatally shot an Orlando, Florida, police officer on Monday, authorities said, prompting a manhunt and a reward of up to $60,000. The suspect was identified as Markieth Loyd, 41, who was considered armed and dangerous. An Orange County sheriff’s deputy in the manhunt for Loyd was killed in a collision between his motorcycle and a vehicle. “We are bringing this dirt bag to justice,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina said of Loyd at a news conference.   Authorities said the slain officer, Master Sergeant Debra Clayton, was shot while responding to a sighting of the suspect. Loyd fled the shooting scene outside a Walmart in a car and fired at a deputy who tried to the stop him, authorities said. The deputy was unharmed. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning after the officers’ deaths. Authorities have been trying to capture Loyd in connection with the December murder of a pregnant woman, the Orange County Sheriff’s office said. According to online jail record, Loyd also had been booked in October in Orange County on charges including burglary, attempted carjacking and violation of a pretrial release. Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, died at a hospital, the department said. Several photos posted on social media showed Clayton at community events, working to improve relations between police and residents.   “The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today,” the department said on its Twitter feed, which also showed a video of officers escorting a U.S. flag-draped gurney. “One of our own was taken in the line of duty. There are no words.” Orange County Public Schools said in a tweet 17 schools had been placed on lockdown, adding: “All students & staff are safe.” Dyer said the deaths of Clayton and the deputy, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, will be felt throughout the city. “On this sad day, I ask that our community stands united in support of the families of the fallen officer and deputy,” he said in a statement.

(Yuya Shino/Reuters) Technology Trump may not like alternative energy, but investors should Add to ... PAUL SULLIVAN The New York Times News Service Published Monday, Jan. 09, 2017 12:08PM EST Last updated Monday, Jan. 09, 2017 6:33PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Given what President-elect Donald Trump has said about his energy strategy — he favours coal and wants to end federal subsidies to the clean energy industry — does it still make sense to invest in wind, solar and other alternative sources of power? The answer is an emphatic yes, according to investment advisers, who say clean energy companies will continue to thrive during a Trump administration, regardless of what the president says or does. The sector has become as much about getting returns on investments and catching the next technological boom as it is about reducing greenhouse gases and helping the environment. And clean energy is creating jobs in every state, not just the ones that have oil or gas in the ground. Even the most politically conservative states, like Kansas and Iowa, are leaders in wind power and are likely to continue investing in it. “No longer is there a trade-off between what you believe in and what you can make money off of,” said Nancy Pfund, a founder and managing partner of DBL Partners, which made early investments in SolarCity and Tesla. She predicts that investors “are going to redouble their efforts to migrate their portfolios to a 21st-century energy economy.” Even without subsidies, she said, alternative energy sources will be well positioned to compete with coal and other carbon spewers. “It really has to do with the cost of wind, solar and electric cars compared to where we were 12 years ago,” Ms. Pfund said. And there is momentum in the sector. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, recently announced a billion-dollar investment fund to put money into energy research and the reduction of carbon emissions. But the challenge for all investors during the Trump administration and beyond will be to make sure that passions for change and innovation, or anger at environmental policies that favour fossil fuels, do not cloud sound investment analysis. “Recently, people have taken the green mandate and said, ‘You need to invest in the future,’” said Chat Reynders, chief executive and chairman of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, a $1.3-billion asset-management firm. “People have chased some investments that weren’t timely or were not quality investments in order to participate.” For example, in the 1970s, some investors were eager to back manufacturers of solar panels. But what was then a cutting-edge technology with high barriers to entry is now a commodity, with prices dropping as more manufacturers enter the market. This is good for the consumer, but not great for investors in the panel makers. And solar power has very much gone mainstream. Wal-Mart, which has panels atop its stores as it works toward 100-per-cent renewable energy use, and other companies have become huge producers and consumers of solar energy. “You can’t put the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the economics driving solar, wind and battery storage,” said Thomas Van Dyck, managing director in the SRI Wealth Management Group at RBC Wealth Management. “The economics are such that in California, wind and solar are the cheapest form of power you can put in place,” Mr. Van Dyck said. “If you’re a long-term investor, you need to look at these long-term trends.” Despite the economic forces lining up behind clean energy, investors and analysts caution that people interested in investing in this area should be prepared for a rough ride in the short term. “If you’re a long-term investor and looking out five to 10 years, it’s a no-brainer,” Mr. Van Dyck said. “It’s like looking at Intel or Microsoft in the 1990s — they had some cyclical issues, but look at them today.” An often-cited cautionary tale of passion trumping economic reasoning is Solyndra, the solar panel maker best known for spending $527-million in government loans before collapsing. R. Paul Herman, chief executive of HIP Investor, an investment rater and portfolio manager, said investors looking for broad guidance should keep three things in mind. They should look for companies that are trying to save money and reduce risk through clean energy. This is the Wal-Mart example. They should monitor their investments in fossil-fuel producers closely, lest their stocks plummet again as renewable energy gets cheaper and the value of their reserves diminishes. And those with a longer-term investment horizon and a higher tolerance for risk should look for companies focused on energy innovations. The last is the holy grail. Ms. Pfund’s firm, DBL Partners, had great success investing in Tesla and SolarCity, but she said she was not looking to mimic those investments today. “The last thing I’m going to do is keep investing in the same old, same old,” she said. “The venture-backed electric car company was a smart investment 10 years ago, but today it’s things like storage — the batteries in a Tesla or stationary storage — that are going to play a huge role in the electric grid of the future.” With storage, the energy created by the sun and wind can be used on demand — or on cloudy, calm days. Mr. Reynders said he was steering clear of solar panels but liked companies that install the panels. He also said he thought the Trump administration would be good for alternative-energy investment, though not as its cheerleader. If the administration follows through on Mr. Trump’s plan to cut clean-energy subsidies, it could force a shakeout in the industry and prompt investors to pay closer attention to company fundamentals. For investors with a greater appetite for risk, there are certainly longer-term energy investments. One is graphene, a super-thin, incredibly strong material that can be used as a conductor. Its promise is for batteries of the future, and probably much more. William Page, portfolio manager for global environmental opportunities strategy at Essex Investment Management, said he saw the potential in investing in graphene but was avoiding it for now. “We don’t want to invest in a technology that might work in the lab today but it’s not something that is a viable investment today,” he said. “We want something that is profitable today.” Like Mr. Reynders, Mr. Page thinks companies that install solar panels are a good investment. He also likes LED lighting installation — not exactly the sexiest clean energy investment, but one that is environmentally sound and profitable today. At the opposite end of the risk spectrum, Matthew Weatherley-White, co-founder and managing director at the Caprock Group, said people could make alternative energy investments in themselves, as it were. “Say you have $10,000,” he said. “Do you want to invest in a solar panel company or in a solar array for your house?” Of course, it depends on whether you are a city or country dweller. “In Idaho, where I live, there’s 6-per-cent internal rate of return for a solar array, so you get paid back in 18 years,” Mr. Weatherley-White said. “That might not blow the socks off as an investment, but it’s pretty predictable.” In places like California, where state policies favour solar power, that rate of return could be three to four times what it is in Idaho, he said. Still, it comes down to a question every investor should ask: “Where am I going to invest for a positive financial return and an environmental impact?” And in the United States, it is the states rather than the federal government that may wield the greatest influence over the clean-energy sector. “While the Trump victory for some was disturbing or took the wind out of their sails,” Ms. Pfund said, “the federal government can only do so much.” Report Typo/Error   MSFT-QMicrosoft Corp Latest Price$62.70 +0.09 (+0.14%) WMT-NWal Mart Stores Inc Latest Price$67.13 -0.84 (-1.24%) TSLA-QTesla Motors Inc Latest Price$237.75 +8.16 (+3.55%) Updated January 13 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

EST January 09, 2017 (Photo: Orlando Police Department)  CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST (NBC NEWS) -- Two Florida officers were killed Monday during a manhunt for a murder suspect who has been on the run since he was accused of fatally shooting a pregnant mother last month. Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was shot by the suspect, Markeith Loyd, after responding to a sighting of him outside a Walmart around 7:15 a.m. Monday, police chief John Mina told reporters. Clayton was a 17-year veteran of the force and didn't survive her multiple gunshot wounds, despite other officers rushing to her aid shortly after, Mina said. The Orange County Sheriff's Office then responded to the scene, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told reporters. The suspect carjacked a vehicle and a high-speed car chase ensued, with the suspect firing at least one shot, Demings said.

Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was killed after the assailant fired on her near an Orlando Walmart, Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters.  Police identified the suspected shooter as Markeith Loyd. He is wanted by police for the December murder of a pregnant woman. A local CBS affiliate identified the woman as Loyd's girlfriend.  After the shooting, a deputy identified Loyd at which point he fired at the officer's vehicle before fleeing in a stolen car and later abandoned the vehicle, Mina said. "He will be brought to justice," said Mina.  Police said a second officer was killed in a traffic accident while pursuing the manhunt. Roughly a dozen schools in the area have been put on lockdown as police continue the search, according to multiple reports. Clayton is survived by her husband and two children, said Mina.

Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was shot by the suspect, Markeith Damengzlo Loyd, 41, after she responded to a sighting of him outside a Walmart store about 7:15 a.m. ET Monday, Police Chief John Mina told reporters. Clayton returned fire, but authorities don't believe Loyd was struck. Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton volunteering at Parramore Kidz Zone, an Orlando youth program, in an undated photo. Orlando Police Department Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was killed in a crash as authorities gave pursuit. Mina said at a somber news conference that Loyd could face charges of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer. "We're going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to go to jail," Mina said. Clayton, who was married with a college-age son, was a 17-year veteran of the force who grew up in the area. Police records show that she was among the early wave of officers who responded to the shootings that killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12.

Orange County sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis in an undated photo. Orange County Sheriff's Office Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the suspect carjacked a vehicle and fired at least one shot during a high-speed chase. During the pursuit, Lewis, who was on a motorcycle, was killed in a crash with an uninvolved motorist, Demings said. Lewis received a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the University of Central Florida in Orlando, where he played on the offensive line for the football team from 2000 to 2003. Authorities had been seeking Loyd since Dec. 13, when Sade Dixon, 24, a mother of two who was three months pregnant, was shot to death. Her brother was shot in the leg, police said.

"If we find out about these people, we will criminally charge them," Mina said. Markeith Damengzlo Loyd in an undated photo. Orange County Sheriff's Office Authorities described Loyd as being 6 feet, 3 inches tall and weighing 230 pounds. They said he should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. State records show that Loyd has a long record of previous arrests, including a conviction for battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer with violence in a Jan. 3, 1998, incident. He served just more than four years in prison, parole records show. His record includes other convictions for firearms violations and resisting police. He and his wife were in the process of divorcing after domestic violence charges against Loyd were dropped in late 2015. Dyer, the mayor, declared Monday an official day of mourning. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he was "heartbroken and angered."

Orlando police say an officer who was shot while on duty has died; a manhunt is underway for the suspect. (AP Photo/John Raoux) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton’s killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. “He will be brought to justice.” Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff’s officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer’s vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. “I’m heartbroken and angry,” Scott said. ___ Information from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) Manhunt underway for suspect in killing of Orlando officer Last Modified: Monday, January 09, 2017 11:41 AM By Mike Schneider / Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. -- A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

Debra Clayton, Orlando Police Officer killed in line of duty. (Photo courtesy Orlando Police) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton’s killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. Authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for any information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. “He will be brought to justice.” Orlando shooting suspect (WFLA photo) Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a “committed” officer and “a hero” who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community,” said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy.

Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Mina said officers believed they knew where Loyd was. Officers were deployed to an apartment complex in northwest Orlando. The apartment complex and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. “There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there,” Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff’s officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer’s vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said.

A $60-thousand-dollar reward is being offered for information for Markeith Loyd, the suspected shooter in the death of the Orlando Police Department officer Master Sargent Debra Clayton on Monday, January 9, 2017, according to a tweet from the Orlando... By Holly Yan, Ralph Ellis and AnneClaire Stapleton CNN (CNN) -- Hundreds of law enforcement officers were scouring Orlando early Tuesday for a man suspected of fatally shooting a police officer outside a Walmart. The suspect fled, triggering an intense manhunt that included door-to-door searches in apartment complexes and the placing of a dozen schools on lockdown. Another officer died while taking part in the search for the gunman. The Orange County sheriff's deputy died when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. After the deaths of two law enforcement officers in one day, Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to find the suspect -- who has been identified as Markeith Loyd. "I'm confident we will find him," Mina said. "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth to find him." "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. Loyd also is wanted in the killing of a pregnant woman in December, Mina said. A reward of up to $60,000 is offered for information leading to Loyd's arrest. The officer he is suspected of shooting was identified as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42. The second officer who died in the accident was identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis. "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Officer Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'He shot her down' On Monday morning, someone at a Walmart had contacted Clayton and told her Loyd was in the area, Mina said. It appears Clayton briefly chased the suspect on foot. "As soon as she said stop, he basically opened fire on her," the chief said. One witness told CNN affiliate WFTV he had been outside the Walmart when the shooting happened. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down," said James Herman. Herman said the man continued shooting behind him as he was running from the scene. He also said the man wore a security shirt, but Mina said the suspect was not a security guard. "That's not uncommon," he said. "We run into people in nightclubs that wear T-shirts that say FBI, police." Clayton returned fire but investigators don't think she struck the gunman, Mina said. Two minutes after Clayton's last radio contact, police received a call of an officer shot. Officers performed CPR but could not revive Clayton. The pursuit After the shooting, Loyd fled in a vehicle and fired shots at another officer, police said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on the area. The suspect abandoned the vehicle and carjacked a different one, police said. He ditched that second vehicle shortly after and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. Residents were urged to stay inside and several schools were put on lockdown. By 3 p.m. ET, the lockdowns had been lifted at all the schools, the school system said on Twitter. Mina said officers searched "dozens of apartments and residences" and won't slow down because of darkness. "I believe there have been people out there helping him all along," Mina said. "If we find out about those people we will criminally charge them." He said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer he fired at. Sheriff's deputy killed As authorities scrambled to find Loyd, Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died in a crash as he was traveling on his motorcycle. "A motorist turned in front of him," the sheriff said. "Based on eyewitness testimony, he had a green light, he was not traveling at any (high) rate of speed." Lewis had worked 11 years with the sheriff's department. In another incident, police said the suspect fired at an Orange County sheriff's captain who spotted his vehicle. The captain was not seriously injured, but authorities are pursuing an attempted murder charge against the suspect. Suspect had been wanted in girlfriend's death CNN affiliate WFTV reported that Loyd was wanted in the December 13 fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant girlfriend, outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood. She was the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, was critically injured when he tried to come to Dixon's aid, WFTV reported, citing deputies. A hero who went above and beyond Mina said his department is grieving the death of Clayton, a 17-year veteran at the department. "I've known Debra for 17 years. She was extremely committed to our youth and the community. She did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself," the police chief said. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. The sheriff said his department also is mourning the death of its deputy. But with an "armed and extremely dangerous" killer on the loose, there is little time to grieve. "While we're processing our own emotional feelings, we still have a job to do," Demings said. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the United States in 2017, said Steve Groeninger of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The deaths of Clayton and Lewis mark the second and third on-duty law enforcement officer deaths of 2017. On Saturday, North Las Vegas police Det. Chad Parque was killed in a traffic crash.

(AP) — A massive manhunt was underway Monday in central Florida as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing an Orlando police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in northwest Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The tweet said Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, do to things for youth and do things for the community," said Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon, who added he assumed she was wearing a bulletproof vest since that is agency policy. She was married and had two children. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. Clayton either recognized Loyd or had been tipped off to his whereabouts when she approached him Monday morning, Mina said. Loyd then fired multiple shots at Clayton, according to the police. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said. ___ Information from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ Tags General News Search And Rescue Efforts Violent Crime Crime Law Enforcement Agencies Government And Politics Locations Orlando Florida United States North America Popular This Week Financial struggles to close downtown Winston-Salem restaurant Classes canceled for Tuesday; School year just got longer for Winston-Salem/Forsyth County students and teachers Skippy's Hot Dogs expected to reopen, expand under new owners Winston-Salem police charge teen in pedestrian's death 2 Winston-Salem stores fined for excessive price-scanner errors Piedmont Club may close with owner's planned departure; board tries to find new management Warning: Kerosene, gasoline mix-up discovered at convenience store in Winston-Salem Reboot Arcade Bar to open in downtown Winston-Salem Winston-Salem issues urgent warning about kerosene-gasoline mix-up at convenience store Winston-Salem Police: Two clerks injured in attempted armed robbery Poll What are your expectations after Donald Trump’s inauguration?

Debra Clayton didn't have to stay at her friend's house for two days to take care of her after surgery. She was not expected to spend countless hours volunteering with kids in the "dragon boat" program or at community forums calling for an end to the violence. The 17-year Orlando police veteran, newlywed and mother of an adult son did not need to start a nonprofit for young women and girls who were victims of violence. But she did, anyway. "I didn't know anyone with a bigger heart," said friend Teresa Sokolovic, holding back tears. "She was an angel." Clayton, one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse shooting in June, was gunned down Monday morning near a Wal-Mart on John Young Parkway and Princeton Street while confronting 41-year-old Markeith Loyd, who is wanted for murder.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Clayton was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where she died. Officers saluted her flag-draped casket as a medical examiner's vehicle took her body away. Orlando police Chief John Mina hailed her as a hero. "She gave her life protecting the community that she loved," he said. Hours after the killing, friends gathered in front of Clayton's home on a tree-lined street in Ocoee, where neighbors say they shared power washers and tools with each other.

Debra Clayton was a giving person and loved to work on youth projects. She helped distribute turkeys and was an ideal model of 21st century policing.   See more videos She said the two became fast friends, and Clayton spent two days at her home last year after she had surgery to take care of her. Clayton was a good police officer who was "on top of her game," Sokolovic said. "If he got her, he must be armed and really dangerous," she said. Clayton grew up in Orlando and attended Dr. Phillips High School before joining the Orlando Police Department in 1999, said her cousin, Jonathan Thomas. Clayton earned a bachelor's degree in public administration from the University of Central Florida in 1998 and a master's degree in criminal justice from UCF in 2002. 　　 She always wanted to be a police officer, her cousin said. "It was her passion," Thomas said. "She wanted to be a police officer so she could do good and get bad people off the streets." Neighbors remembered her friendly smile and quick wave to say hello. "We were like family," said Sanita Dhanraj, who lived two doors down from Clayton for 14 years. "She was very sweet and caring. It was heart-breaking to hear what happened to her." Mina said teams are in place to help Clayton's family "that are going to be at their side continuously as they make plans for laying her to rest." He added that Clayton was involved with Parramore Kidz Zone and other mentoring programs. The department released 38 pages of awards and commendations from her bosses and citizens hailing her work as an officer who went above and beyond her duty. Throughout the day, the department tweeted out photos of Clayton, not of her slapping handcuffs on criminals (though she did plenty of that as a dayshift patrol officer), but of her with a big smile on her face with kids and community members at events. "THIS is how we know and remember Sgt. Debra Clayton," the department tweeted. "She always had a smile for kids and always took a moment to interact with community." For years, OPD has participated in a "dragon boat" mentoring project in which cops team up with disadvantaged youth in rowing competitions. Andrea Eliscu, who started the program, said Clayton had been a mentor for the past four years. "The kids are just finding out, and they are just devastated," Eliscu said. "Everybody loved her. She was very beautiful, professional and passionate." Clayton was an active member of the Urban League's anti-violence task force and was starting a nonprofit, said Rev. Justin R. Felton Sr., a former executive aide to Orlando City Commissioner Regina Hill. "She understood the responsibility of being an officer is that you get to know those who you are serving and those who you are protecting," Felton said. "I believe when she took that oath, she meant it. Not only is she a model officer, she embodied it. I can't express how much people will miss her." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings hired Clayton when he was Orlando police chief and said he used to attend the same church with her. "She is someone who I know very well," he said. "My heart goes out to her family as well as the entire Orlando Police Department." She was married on Jan. 1, 2016, to Seth Leron Clayton, according to marriage records. Neighbors said they got married on a cruise. Felton went to a basketball game with the couple last year. "He loved his wife," said Felton. "They were newlyweds in so many areas — you could see the love and how they talked with each other." dharris@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5471 Staff writers Scott Maxwell and Jeff Weiner contributed to this story Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Crime Homicide Debra Clayton Markeith Loyd OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando police officer shot, killed; suspect still being sought Interactive: Central Florida homicides map Live map: Active Orlando Police Department calls All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 65°

(AP) - An Orlando police sergeant was shot and killed Monday after approaching a suspect wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. A second law enforcement officer was killed in a motorcycle crash while responding to a massive manhunt for the suspect. More than a dozen schools were placed in lockdown during the manhunt, and authorities were offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Markeith Loyd, the 41-year-old suspect wanted in the killing of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton. Officers and deputies focused their manhunt on an apartment complex in northwest Orlando, and dozens of residences had been searched. Residents who were evacuated from their homes sat on a sidewalk along a street with heavily armed officers and deputies and a parked SWAT team truck. Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff's Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for Loyd. Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," Police Chief John Mina said at a morning press conference. Later in the day, the chief said, "It doesn't matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth." Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks and believe he was receiving help from someone. At an afternoon news conference, Demings urged Loyd to turn himself in peacefully. "If we have to go in after him, then that jeopardizes and puts at risk the safety of law enforcement officers ... and we cannot control what happens in that situation," Demings said. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people, Mina said. "She was always the first to step up and help kids," the chief said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. "She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community," Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. She died Monday at 7:40 a.m., less than an hour after she was shot while on duty. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando's tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. "There will be a large law enforcement presence in that area until we can determine he is not there," Mina said. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn't hit him, he said. Sheriff's officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Gov. Rick Scott canceled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting but appeared with Orlando officials at the news conference. "I'm heartbroken and angry," Scott said.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Rene Stutzman and Stephanie Allen Contact Reporters Privacy Policy Hundreds of law enforcement officers are searching overnight for a fugitive who is accused of killing a cop at dawn on Monday when she tried to chase him down at a Wal-Mart and arrest him. A second law-enforcement official died in a crash just hours later as officers and deputies scrambled to find the murder suspect.  By Monday evening, officers largely abandoned the apartment complex in northwest Orlando that was the focus of their search for much of the day, and Markeith Loyd, 41, was still at large. "We are going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to jail," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Loyd has been wanted for murder since his pregnant ex-girlfriend was shot at her front door on Dec. 13. He has a long criminal history and on Nov. 30 wrote on his Facebook page: "Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted." Markeith Loyd Orange County Sheriff's Office Markeith Loyd Markeith Loyd (Orange County Sheriff's Office) The manhunt prompted the lockdown of more than a dozen schools and snarled traffic for hours. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Monday morning. A $60,000 reward was offered for information leading to Loyd’s capture, and both Orlando police and the Sheriff's Office described him as armed and dangerous. The violence started about 7:15 a.m. at the Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Street, when someone spotted Loyd, knew he was wanted for murder and told Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, who also happened to be at the store. She was on the job, in uniform and wearing body armor, Mina said. She called dispatch, then started chasing after Loyd. OPD officer shot and killed; deputy dies in crash Orlando Police Department Debra Clayton Debra Clayton (Orlando Police Department) She yelled for him to “stop” but instead the felon opened fire. She shot back but didn’t hit him, Mina said.  Backup officers who arrived 28 seconds later tried to save Clayton with CPR, according to the city, but she was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m. at Orlando Regional Medical Center. A short distance from the Wal-Mart, a captain at the Orange County Sheriff's Office spotted Loyd near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, according to that department. Loyd pulled into an apartment complex and fired at least once at the deputy, who was in an unmarked SUV. The bullet missed him but hit his SUV. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled. He abandoned that vehicle near Cinderlane Parkway, officials said. A massive manhunt for Loyd resulted in two motorcycle crashes by Orange County deputies, one fatal.        Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, an 11-year Sheriff’s Office veteran and former football player at the University of Central Florida, was killed 2-1/2 hours after the shooting. He was traveling south on Pine Hills Road on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van turning left onto Balboa Drive, the Florida Highway Patrol said. “We’re sad on this day for many reasons," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a morning news conference at the hospital. "In my 36-year career, this is possibly one of the toughest days for me." The driver of the van, Billie Jarrard of Clermont, could possibly face charges in the crash, troopers said. No one answered the phone Monday at Jarrard’s home. Records show he is a 78-year-old recent widower with no criminal history in Florida.  Ten minutes after Lewis’ crash, another deputy was involved in a wreck that sent him to the hospital. It happened just 200 yards down Pine Hills Road. Orange County Deputy Nelson Borjas, 46, had minor injuries and is expected to recover.  Officer called a hero Clayton is the first Orlando officer killed in the line of duty in a decade. The last was Al Gordon, who was shot during a robbery Oct. 4, 2007, the agency reported. Clayton, who is survived by a husband and college-age son, was one of the first officers to respond to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June that left 49 people dead and scores injured. PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. Mina called her a hero. “She gave her life for the community she loves." TaQueria Jones, a Wal-Mart cashier, said Clayton checked out at her register minutes before the shooting. “We talked about family, we talked about God," Jones said.  While the suspect was still at large, the cashier and others planted flowers in a spot just feet from where Clayton was killed. “I’m going to be out here every day to straighten them up. Every day," Jones vowed. Lewis, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since March 2005, was a member of the motors/DUI unit. Both Lewis and Clayton had degrees from the University of Central Florida. “They are heroes and Knights forever," UCF President John Hitt said. Deputies had been on the lookout for Loyd for weeks because of a murder warrant: He's accused of murdering his pregnant 24-year-old ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, on Dec. 13 and wounding her 26-year-old brother, Ronald Steward. They were shot at an Orange County home on Long Peak Drive.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Loyd has a long criminal record and served 10 years in prison and five years on probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records.  "To lose two law enforcement officers on this Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is indeed a tragedy,” Demings said. ... “It's a reminder that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to protect all of us." Gov. Rick Scott was in Orlando on Monday for a business meeting, but that was canceled and he joined Mina, Demings and other local officials at a morning news conference. "It breaks my heart that one of them was already senselessly killed this morning,” Scott said. Apartments focus of search On Monday, officers searched dozens of apartments, single-family homes and vehicles in the Rosemont neighborhood. Much of the search focused on the Eagle Reserve apartment complex.  An Orlando SWAT team as well as armored vehicles and a helicopter came and went twice to the complex on Cinderlane Parkway, where Loyd was last spotted by law enforcement Monday morning after the shooting. They pulled out for the second time about 6 p.m., but only after leaving some residents barred from their homes or from getting to work for several hours. Lupe Garcia and her 9-year-old son, Migul Hidalgo, were stuck outside their home for most of the day. Garcia walked to drop him off at school and came back to find her home surrounded in crime scene tape with dozens of officers holding long guns. "It's scary," she said before she was let back into the complex. After she picked her son up, they waited with dozens of others outside the complex. Migul said as he and his mom were waiting, an Orange County deputy flagged him down and asked if he was hungry. The deputy pulled out a chocolate protein bar and gave it to the boy.

(AP) – A massive manhunt was underway Monday in the popular tourist destination of Orlando as authorities searched for a man accused of shooting and killing a police officer. The Orlando Police Department announced the death of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on its official Twitter account Monday morning. A short time later, authorities said at a press conference that a second law enforcement officer was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for the suspect in Clayton's killing. The shooting occurred near a Walmart store in Orlando earlier Monday. The suspect has been identified as Markeith Loyd, 41, in an area of northwest metro Orlando. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last December. "He should be considered armed and dangerous," said Police Chief John Mina said at a press conference. "He will be brought to justice." Mina lauded Clayton, who was married and had two children, as a "committed" officer and "a hero" who gave her life to the community she loves. Police released a video of Clayton's body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. Authorities said 17 area schools were placed in lockdown following the shooting. Sheriff's officials said Loyd was spotted by a deputy fleeing in the Orlando police officer's vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy's SUV twice. The deputy wasn't harmed, the sheriff's office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff's office. The manhunt was being conducted where he abandoned the vehicle. Gov. Rick Scott cancelled an appearance in Orlando because of the shooting. Get breaking and town-specific news sent to your phone. Sign up for text alerts from the Daily Chronicle.

Sgt. Debra Clayton died after she was shot three times by a man wearing a security uniform outside the store, witnesses said. "[The shooter] was an average looking dude, he walked by me, had a security vest and everything," witness James Herman told WFTV-TV. "I was walking down the sidewalk, right past the officer, and I heard her tell him to stop, or whatever, and he shot her. He shot her down." Police chief John Mina announced "with a heavy heart" at a 10:45 a.m. news conference the 17-year veteran of department and mother of two, died at 7:40 a.m. She was carried out of Orlando Regional Medical Center in a flag-draped coffin and received a police escort. Markeith Loyd, who authorities believe shot the officer, is also wanted in connection with the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. An unidentified senior Orange County Sheriff's Office motorcycle deputy also died in a crash while searching for Loyd. Deputies were called to the scene of the initial shooting just after 7:15 a.m. after receiving word that an "officer needs help." An Orange County sheriff's deputy later spotted the suspected gunman and followed him to a nearby apartment complex, officials said. The man shot at the deputy but missed and hit his unmarked SUV twice, deputies said. Loyd allegedly carjacked a second vehicle and abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot. Loyd, 41, has been wanted since the Dec. 13 shooting of 24-year-old Sade Dixon, who was killed outside her home. Dixon's brother, Ronald Steward, also was critically injured when he tried to help her, investigators said. Loyd served 10 years in prison in 2009 for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records. He was released from probation in 2014. Mayor Buddy Dyer declared Monday an official day of mourning. The two law enforcement deaths occurred on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.

/PR Newswire/ -- MOLA-UFO, the selfie drone developed by Nine Eagles, an emerging high technologies company based in China, drew rave reviews from its debut at the CES 2017. The product's successful launch shows a promising future for MOLA-UFO when it hits the global market. Leveraging rich experience in developing and manufacturing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Nine Eagles extends the function of a consumer-level drone and seeks to cater the needs of a niche market by adding more fun and entertainment elements to the traditional UAV. Continue Reading Nine Eagles -- MOLA booth at the 2017 CES As an intelligent aerial photographer, MOLA-UFO boasts a unique configuration design -- palm-sized and UFO-shaped; a patented triple axes EIS technology to ensure stability and high-quality of the images; and advanced image recognition technology that enables intelligent tracking of the subjects. The selfie drone helps users capture important moments in all occasions. During the three-day exhibition, a large number of audience including dealers, retailers, and e-commerce platforms that specialize in consumer electronics and hobbyist products such as Walmart, Amazon, B&H and Hobbico expressed their interest in MOLA-UFO and prospects of partnership for future sales. According to the audience feedback, MOLA-UFO's unique configuration and innovative structure are undoubtedly the most eyeball-catching features of the drone. Ted Hill from Bear Mountain Holdings, LLC, an urban resort community from Canada, acclaimed, "Its elegant outlook and the four motor driven arms that could be freely contracted and expanded for transition between still and flying status are very impressive. I have never seen such a structure on the market. I think it makes a good combination between practicability and portability." Meanwhile, Bo Lorentzen, a tech blogger from FPVguy who visited MOLA's booth last year and owns quite a few Nine Eagles products including the radio-control scale model helicopter and airplanes, visited the booth again this year and was highly excited about MOLA-UFO.
