At the Retail Council of Canada STORE 2017 conference, CHEP released the details of a new case study highlighting its collaboration with Walmart Canada. CHEP applied its environmental sustainability expertise and reverse logistics capabilities to help Walmart efficiently move tonnes of wooden waste from retail locations to recycling facilities, helping the company move closer to zero waste. “Like many of our clients, Walmart has an aspirational goal of zero waste across global operations. When they asked CHEP for help, we were able to immediately implement a sustainability solution with multiple environmental benefits.” When gardeners crowded into Walmart Canada’s 400 locations, they left a costly environmental issue behind – empty wooden racks where the plants were displayed. To address the challenge, CHEP developed an innovative reverse logistics and waste diversion solution to use the retailer’s trucks, already at the stores, to transport the excess racks to a recycling facility. The solution has already resulted in the removal of more than 2,000 tonnes of wooden waste, improved health and safety of store associates and reduced waste disposal costs. The recycler is rescuing solid pallets for reuse and turning the remaining wood into chips and sawdust, sold as bedding for farm animals. CHEP Store Fulfillment through Virtual Reality Also at STORE 2017, CHEP utilized Virtual Reality to give customers an interactive in-store product fulfillment experience. It allows the user to visualize and participate in a retail store fulfillment exercise and learn “hands on” the value of easy CHEP Half Pallet replenishment versus stocking the shelves. The Virtual Reality platform shows users how CHEP can help retailers reduce labor costs and increase sales with its Store Fulfillment Solutions. CHEP’s robust 40x24-inch shared (pooled) half pallet can reduce warehouse handling costs by up to 25%, decrease in-store labor costs by up to 75%, lower shelf replenishment time by up to 65% and increase sales by up to 30%. A recent CHEP Store Fulfillment Solutions case study shows how CHEP helped a leading soup company improve the quality and performance of its in-store merchandizing displays by using CHEP half pallets. The company is now using CHEP half pallets for 100% of their in-store displays. “STORE 2017 provides a great opportunity for us to highlight CHEP’s innovative approach to supply chain management. From our collaboration with Walmart Canada to our innovative technology and Store Fulfillment Solutions, we deliver value for manufacturers, retailers and their trading partners each-and-every day,” concluded Floris.

Trendy independent firms can face a customer backlash when their founders sell to a big corporation. But many of these brands keep their cool and cachet - although it requires careful management. When the Camden Town Brewery was bought in 2015 by Ab InBev, the world's biggest beer firm, rival craft brewery BrewDog published a lengthy blog attacking the move. It accused Camden and other small brewers of selling out to "mega corporations, the ones who destroyed... and commoditised beer". It also said it would stop selling Camden beer at its BrewDog pubs, because it didn't want to put money in Ab InBev's pockets. But in April this year BrewDog raised a few eyebrows when it sold a minority stake to US private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners for £213m. Does this mean BrewDog itself sold out? "First of all, no-one has taken over BrewDog, we're still majority-owned by myself and Martin Dickie," co-founder James Watt tells the BBC. Consumer backlash As part of the deal, TSG agreed "100%" to protect the firm's independence and the way the beer is made, he says. "This deal gives us the firepower to compete globally with the mega beer corporations and their faux 'craft' beers, whilst remaining fiercely independent." From craft beer firms to organic food businesses, ethical fashion labels to beauty brands, many small firms have sold up to bigger ones only to be accused of selling out. Image copyright BrewDog Image caption BrewDog founders Martin Dickie and James Watt have promised never to sell up to a corporate brewer But is such criticism fair, and why do small businesses sell up in the first place? Mark Ritson, a professor of marketing at Melbourne Business School, says most consumers are "completely ignorant" about who owns their favourite brands. But in a small percentage of cases it can create bad publicity because the firms involved are "so contradictory". This happened when retailer Walmart acquired the trendy US online fashion firm ModCloth in March. ModCloth, which sells vintage-style clothes for women, had built a loyal following of socially liberal customers who identified with its brand values. But many of them thought Walmart was an unsuitable new owner, questioning its business practices with regards to workers' rights. Walmart tells the BBC it has invested billions of dollars in training and higher wages for its workers. And at the time of the deal, it stressed that ModCloth would continue to operate as a standalone business after the deal and get help to grow. However, that didn't stop customers complaining on a blog on the ModCloth website. Comments such as "congratulations, you have lost my business forever" and "today marks the death of ModCloth" sum up the reaction. Not so Innocent? According to Prof Ritson, the negative response to such deals is often more about perception than reality. He gives the example of Coca Cola, which in 2010 took a controlling stake in Innocent, the British smoothie-maker famed for its natural ingredients and quirky branding. Image copyright Innocent Image caption Innocent claims its values have "absolutely not" changed after Coca Cola took over in 2010 Like ModCloth, Innocent's founders stressed the firm would retain its values, in this case a commitment to natural, healthy food. But the deal had its critics. "You had the contradiction of this mass, American, sugary brand with the British, healthy brand, and it did diminish the firm in the eyes of many of its loyal followers," Mr Ritson says. But seven years on, Innocent claims its values have "absolutely not" changed. Innocent says it has increased sales across Europe by harnessing Coca Cola's expertise and resources. Turnover rose from £114m in 2009, when the US giant first took a minority stake, to £247m in 2015, Innocent's most recent audited accounts. "Coca Cola has remained hands-off and let us get on with running, growing and developing Innocent in an Innocent way," says a spokesperson. Phil Howard, an associate professor at the Department of Community Sustainability at Michigan State University, says it is understandable that small firms should want to be bought up "as the system favours bigger firms". Investors in small firms often want an early pay-back, while the costs of expanding a business can be heavy. Image copyright Ben and Jerrys Image caption After buying Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever set up an independent board to protect the ice cream firm's core values However, he says that while founders will see sales growth and "get a pay-off", most are "deluded" if they think their values will be protected. "If you talk to founders three or so years after the acquisition - you find most are disillusioned," he says. Buyer's remorse William Kendal, one a group of investors who took over Green & Blacks in 1999 - and was also its chief executive - says he now regrets selling the ethical chocolate brand to Cadbury in 2005. The entrepreneur tells the BBC the deal was driven by a desire to harness Cadbury's reach - particularly in the US - but that the brand did not take off in America as planned. He says the firm had regularly spoken out about political issues - such as whether the UK should adopt the euro and the limitations of the Fairtrade system - but Cadbury put a stop to that. "We were a campaigning brand, and occasionally we put people's noses out of joint, but that was part of the marketing. Image copyright Sim Photography Image caption William Kendall says, with hindsight, he could have done more with Green & Black's "But Cadbury were nervous about that and it watered down the personality of the brand." Mondelez, which now owns Green & Black's, says it is committed to the brand's founding philosophy of delivering "great tasting, ethically-sourced chocolate" and has invested significantly in its growth. Natalie Berg, an analyst at Planet Retail, says takeovers of craft brands can work, as long as the acquiring firm takes a hands-off approach. She cites Ben and Jerry's, the US ice cream firm bought by Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever for $200m in 2000.

Nine-month stretch: The rise of prenatal exercise classes Can't find the right handbag? Just design it yourself Why you need to question your hippo boss From its founding in 1978, the firm prided itself on its environmentalism, ethical ingredients and outspoken social advocacy - and since Unilever took over little has changed, say experts. This is partly because from the outset, Unilever agreed to establish an "external board" charged with overseeing Ben & Jerry's culture and social mission. "Some big firms have core competence for buying and maintaining small brands, and some don't," says Prof Ritson. Nonetheless, Mr Kendall's advice to small brands that are growing fast, but feeling the urge to sell, is to hold on. "Cadbury didn't do a bad job with Green & Black's, but in hindsight we could have done a great deal more with it," he says. "It's a British disease - we validate success by the exit rather than achievement of the business."

I’m going to die’: New details revealed in murder of Uber driver in Lincolnwood Posted 3:51 PM, May 31, 2017, by WGN Web Desk, Updated at 10:27AM, June 1, 2017 Share Update: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Please enable Javascript to watch this video LINCOLNWOOD, Ill. -- A 16-year-old girl was captured on Walmart surveillance video "walking nonchalantly throughout the store" holding a knife in one hand and a machete in another. Authorities say Eliza Wasni used those weapons kill her Uber driver in Lincolnwood. That's just one of the details that Cook County State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham revealed in a news conference Wednesday after Wasni appeared in court on first-degree murder charges. She is being held without bond for killing Grant Nelson, 34, of Wilmette. According to Cunningham, Wasni was picked up by the first of three Uber drivers at about 1:25 a.m. Tuesday. She was driven to a train station in Des Plaines. At 2:18 a.m., a second Uber driver took her from Des Plaines to a Walmart located at 3606 Touhy. That's when Cunningham says the teen removed a knife and a machete from their packaging at the store and walked around holding them. Then she left Walmart with the knife and machete, without paying, and was not stopped by any personnel, Cunningham said. The third Uber driver, Nelson, picked up Wasni in his Hyundai Sonata a few blocks west of the Walmart. About two minutes after Wasni got in the car, Cunningham says Nelson was stabbed by Wasni from the backseat. Cunnningham says Nelson was able to maneuver his car into a condo apartment building driveway near Lincoln and Touhy. Cunningham said he got out of the car and was heard banging and screaming at the lobby door saying "Help me! Help me! I'm going to die!" That's when residents called 911. Cunningham says Wasni tried to flee in Nelson's vehicle but she hit a median near the scene. Officers say she left the car, which was covered in blood, running in the middle of Lincoln Avenue and fled on foot. Cunningham says police found Nelson laying in the grass near the scene. He told officers that he was an Uber driver and that his white, female passenger had attacked him. He was then transported to an area hospital where he later died from his injuries. According to Cunningham, another group of officers later found Wasni crouched behind an office building's air conditioning unit not too far from the scene. She had the machete in one hand and a knife in another. When she wouldn't drop the weapons at the officers' requests, one of the officers tazed her and she was taken into custody. Autopsy results of the victim are still pending.

(Jason Ivester/The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP) FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — It’s before 8 a.m., but here at Bud Walton Arena, named after Walmart’s co-founder, Hanson’s “MMMBop” is blaring through the speakers. Blue lights are flashing to the beat, and thousands of Walmart employees in matching T-shirts (“Happy to help”) are cheering with their arms in the air. There are two days left until Walmart’s shareholders meeting, an annual affair known primarily for its pomp and circumstance, but the festivities are well underway. It’s part pep rally, part pop concert as Walmart executives and employees take the stage to talk about what’s next for the company as it shifts its focus to online shoppers. “There’s never been a more disruptive time in the history of retail,” says Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Walmart U.S. “We know there is no going back. There is only going forward.” Walmart — which last year had $486 billion in annual revenue, more than three times Amazon.com’s $136 billion — is locked in a tight battle with Amazon for the next generation of consumers. The retail giants — one founded in 1962 and the other in 1994 — are experimenting with new ways to make themselves indispensable to customers at a time when longtime companies such as Macy’s and Sears are fading fast. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) For Walmart, the challenge will be getting Americans to use its website with the same ease and frequency that they now use Amazon, which last year accounted for 33 percent of online U.S. sales. (Walmart accounted for 7.8 percent, behind eBay, according to the research firm Euromonitor.) The average Amazon shopper spends $157 on the site each month, compared with $27 at Walmart, according to a 2016 survey by research firm Mizuho. Walmart is hoping to narrow that gap by adding to its lineup of products and lowering its minimums for free shipping. (Amazon, meanwhile, seems to be moving in the other direction: The company opened its first bricks-and-mortar store two years ago in Seattle and expanded to New York last week.) Walmart last year bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion, and brought on its founder, Marc Lore, as the head of e-commerce. In the months since, Walmart has bought up specialty retailers including ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com. But just as important, executives say, is the company’s collection of 4,600 stores across the country, which account for the bulk of the retailer’s sales. “It’s a physical footprint unrivaled by any company anywhere,” said Greg Foran, president and chief executive of Walmart U.S. “The convergence of digital and physical gives customers choice on how, when and where they purchase and receive their items.” To that end, the company has begun offering discounts to online shoppers who pick up their purchases at Walmart stores. It has also begun offering free two-day shipping on orders over $35, down from $49. (Amazon has followed suit, first lowering its minimum requirement from $49 to $35, and most recently, to $25. On Friday, more than 16,000 shareholders, Walmart employees and others will gather in this arena to vote on the nomination of 11 board directors, including Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon and Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo. Shareholders will also vote on pay packages for key employees, including McMillon, who last year was paid $22.4 million in cash and stock awards, and Lore, who received a total of $243.9 million, making him one of the country’s highest-paid executives. The nonbinding vote, part of “say on pay” measures set by Congress, comes as labor groups across the country call on corporations such as Walmart to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Other proposals introduced by shareholders include one that would require the board chairman to be “independent of management,” and another that requests an independent director with environmental expertise. (Walmart, for its part, has asked shareholders to vote against these measures.) But on Wednesday morning, the mood was decisively festive. An accounts payable specialist sang the “Star-Spangled Banner.” Actor and former professional football player Terry Crews emceed, and pop singer Julia Michaels performed. Bags of caramel chocolate M&Ms parachuted from the ceiling. A slide show displayed recent company milestones, ranging from a 1.5 percent quarterly increase in comparable store sales, to “we closed at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve.” But the one that got the loudest cheers: “Ecommerce sales up 63 percent.” Read more: A man is suing Hershey for ‘under-filling’ his box of Whoppers The maker of Bud Light is investing $2 billion to make its beer ‘more sophisticated’ Meet Marriott’s longest-standing employee: A 79-year-old omelet-maker business business true Please provide a valid email address.

Brian Bahr, economic development manager for the city, said he believes a convention center would be a boon for the town and the Northwest Arkansas region as a whole, but the project is still in its earliest stages of conception. Bahr’s team, along with Bentonville’s tourism bureau, is researching tax incentive options while “actively looking for investors, which can be hard to find for a project of that scope,” he said. It has been two years since Kalene Griffith, president and CEO of Visit Bentonville, commissioned a feasibility study that recommended the convention center project. At the time, she cited missed opportunities to host large meetings tied to business with Wal-Mart Stores and its suppliers. The study was conducted by Chicago-based consultant Hunden Strategic Partners, and it showed a convention center and hotel would generate hundreds of new jobs, tens of millions in new tax revenue and spark a micro-economy in goods and services. Early estimates showed it would cost about $150 million. Griffith said the proposed center has since gained traction with potential investment partners, including those with similar facilities in other markets. “There’s interest. Our biggest challenge is our need for more incentives for convention center development,” she said. At the state level, investors can receive a 15% sales tax credit if they invest $1 million or more in a facility with at least 75,000 square feet of convention center space. An adjoining hotel cannot be counted toward the total square footage of the tax credit requirement, said Arkansas Economic Development Commission spokesman Scott Hardin. There aren’t any tax breaks or investment assurances in place with the city of Bentonville for such a project, and Bahr said any discussion with the city about potential incentives should wait until a serious investor is on board to help take on the expensive project. A hotel-convention center will require a significant amount of space, and Bahr thinks the development should be built downtown, where commercial square footage is at a premium right now. Kalene Griffith, president and CEO of Visit Bentonville Downtown is where the action is. It’s inviting, and it’s a good place for visitors to the city to be, he said. “Look at all the activity and energy that is taking place in downtown Bentonville right now, between the arts district, the market district, the square.” In addition to convention center space, the project would include a hotel and likely a parking deck, Bahr said. Compact layouts downtown mean the parking needs to be vertical, and that’s about 10 times more expensive, escalating from $1,500 per space for a basic, flat parking lot, up to $15,000 per space for a multi-story parking garage. All in all, it takes work and time to prove the return on investment to potential financiers, Bahr said. Though not downtown, an available site for a large-scale development is along Walton Boulevard just south of the Wal-Mart Home Office. An Oklahoma-based investor, Square Deal Capital Inc. of Oklahoma City, paid $56.8 million last fall to acquire the nine-story Bentonville Plaza office building and 16 additional acres. Included in the deal is 8.68 acres south of Bentonville Plaza. The property once was home to the George Nunnally Chevrolet auto dealership, but is now largely a crumbling parking lot. It has been vacant for nearly six years since Nunnally moved to a new Bentonville location on Moberly Lane in July 2011. To date, Square Deal representatives have not commented on the land purchase, nor have they filed a site plan with the city. MEETINGS MARKET There are two existing convention centers along the Interstate 49 corridor in Northwest Arkansas — the sprawling, 23-acre John Q. Hammons Convention Center in Rogers, connected to the Embassy Suites hotel, and the 13.4-acre Northwest Arkansas Holiday Inn & Convention Center in Springdale. In Bentonville, there are two hotels between 11,000 square feet and 12,000 square feet of meeting space: the 21c Museum Hotel downtown and Four Points by Sheraton on Walton Boulevard. Bahr said the city is unable to host mid-sized conventions, and the proposed facility, in terms of size, would fall between the city’s current offerings and the John Q. Hammons Center, which boasts 125,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. Northwest Arkansas is not the only region looking to tap into the big meetings business. In Jonesboro, two proposed convention centers are being planned.  A 78,000-square-foot, $50 million convention center and 165-room Hyatt Place Hotel near Interstate 555 last year received the blessing of the city’s Advertising & Promotion Commission, which approved a $300,000 investment given in $75,000 installments. However, recent investor issues caused delays in the project, prompting the A&P to take back $71,000 from the first payment until the development is back on track. Chris Keller, CEO of the entity that’s planning the project, is confident a new investor will carry it forward, according to recent reporting from Talk Business & Politics journalist George Jared. A $35 million project is proposed to be built on the Arkansas State University campus. The plans include a 202-bed Embassy Suites hotel, a 40,000-square-foot Red Wolf Convention Center, and a Houlihan’s restaurant. The company behind the project is O’Reilly Hospitality Management of Springfield, Mo., according to recent reports. Both convention centers have targeted 2018 for opening. CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE HIGH Meeting centers in other parts of the state are showing increases or holding steady in revenue and attendance. The Fort Smith Convention and Visitors’ Bureau reported record revenue for the Fort Smith Convention Center in 2016, at $777,519. Looking at the center’s 17 highest producing events, $15 million in spending on meetings at the Fort Smith center generated an estimated $293,715 in sales taxes for the city, according to the visitors’ bureau. In Little Rock, the publicly funded Statehouse Convention Center booked 140,589 convention room nights for 183 events in 2016. Events were down from the previous year at 218, according to the Little Rock Convention & Visitors Bureau’s annual report. CEO Gretchen Hall said the entity so far in 2017 has held onto increased meetings volume caused by a large spike tied to the temporary closing of the Robinson Center venue between 2014 and 2016. The Statehouse Convention Center was built in 1982 and expanded in 1999, the same year the city built the Verizon Arena. Both projects were made possible by a one-cent county-wide sales tax. As far as gauging the need for and feasibility of a large-scale convention center, Hall said, “Every destination’s a little different.” She said Little Rock’s Statehouse Convention Center “has been very well utilized,” and the bureau is now aiming for funding of a large-scale, indoor sports facility recommended in a 2015 study. On a national level, meeting attendance and conference budgets were both up last year, and more than one-quarter of industry professionals expect an increase in meetings bookings for 2017, according to an annual meetings market survey published in March by Convene, the Professional Convention Management Association’s magazine. The key metrics of budget, attendance and exhibitions space are all increasing but at a slower rate than in 2015, according to the report. Of the 200 respondents from throughout North America, 91% expected their budgets to either increase or stay the same during 2017. One-quarter reported earnings of $1 million or more from events and exhibitions.

On Wednesday (May 31), McMillon kicked off the International Associates’ Meeting at Barnhill Arena in Fayetteville and encouraged the company’s 1,500 international employees who were flown to Northwest Arkansas for shareholders week to take home the company culture. “I happen think we’re the good guys and the good girls in this fight,” McMillon said. “Take some of this passion and energy back with you.” Before the meeting, the employees arrived at the arena divided into groups by country, and were singing and dancing, and during the meeting, they also sang and danced to the traditional music of their country after presentations by that country’s executive team. Representing the international division’s 6,300 stores in 28 countries, the employees saw pictures depicting the humble beginnings of the company’s founder Sam Walton, who was born in Kingfisher, Okla., in 1918, and the store he opened in Bentonville in 1950. McMillon explained Walton’s work ethic of servant leadership, saying he shouldn’t ask someone to do a job that he’s not willing to do himself. ‘THE MOST INTERESTING’ Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright echoed the sentiment, and spoke on the opportunity the company offers its employees, noting McMillon was handling boxes in a distribution center when he started with the company. Now, he’s running the biggest company in the world, Cheesewright said. “Where else could that happen?” He said the company’s international division is not the “biggest, but we’re the most interesting by a long, long way.” Unlike the U.S. division, it has 65 store formats, and is in the fourth consecutive year of improving quarterly sales. “I don’t think there’s any other segment that has done that,” he said, giving credit to the work of the store employees. In discussing the company’s impact, he mentioned a U.S. study on how a new Walmart saved each person in the town an average of $3,500. It was like giving each resident a 5% to 6% pay raise, he said. “That’s amazing. That kind of brings it to life for me.” He also discussed the division’s recycling efforts to create zero waste. More than 80% of “everything that comes into our buildings is recycled,” he said. “It was about 60% five years ago.” Employees from Seiyu, Wal-Mart’s brand in Japan, gathered Wednesday in Fayetteville as part of the retailer’s shareholder week. The company is leading the way, and because of its size, other companies are following, such as when it sells low energy light bulbs or high efficiency detergents. Cheesewright encouraged the employees to think about what makes this week special to them and to talk to other employees as they bump into them and ask them what they do. “You’ll find that everybody has a special story,” he said. “But you’ll also find a lot of consistency. You’ll find really competitive people. I don’t think you’ll find many people here who don’t like winning.” INTERNATIONAL MARKETS Also in the meeting, executives of foreign markets discussed business in their division, highlighting the special occasions, seasons and holidays heavily impacting sales. Walmart stores in China serve about 2.4 million customers daily during holidays. Over the past Chinese New Year, Walmart stores there sold 33 million dumplings, and Sam’s Clubs there sold 800 tons of cherries. Also in China, more than 500 million customers shop online, and they can order fresh groceries using their smartphone and have them delivered within an hour. In Chile, the start of its barbecue season is in September, and 27.55 million pounds of meat were sold in the month at its stores, which are celebrating their 60th anniversary. September is also an important month for Mexico, and in the month in 2016, 1.5 million bottles of tequila were sold. In Africa, during its barbecue season, more than 1.1 million pounds of charcoal and 4.5 million meat packs were sold. Easter is an important holiday in the United Kingdom, and $70 million in Easter eggs were sold this past holiday. In Japan, spring is an important season, and sales for a top selling sushi item, the Eho-maki roll, rose 11% for the season over the past year. Japan executives showed an image, depicting the number of rolls sold would stretch 180 miles, or from Oklahoma City to Bentonville. In Canada, the country is celebrating its 150th anniversary, and the company’s private clothing brand, Canadiana, is marking the occasion. COMPANY AWARDS The company also handed out Integrity in Action awards to employees who went above and beyond, such as an Argentina pharmacist who helped to expose a $10 million prescription fraud ring or a United Kingdom pharmacist who helped a customer discover she was a victim of natural gas poisoning. The store of the year was 3658 in Canada. Associates of the year were Jan Ross of store 3004 in Canada, Chunyuan Chen of China and Juan Silva of store 1046 in Argentina. Ross saved a baby’s life by bringing down its body temperature and performing CPR before paramedics arrived. The company named two employees, one from Brazil and the other from South Africa, as part of its Associate Talent Search, and they sang during the meeting.

But would its Lone Star state customers accustomed to driving the family's big SUV to Wal-Mart to stock up on groceries embrace an online option? Apparently, yes. Dallas-Fort Worth is now Wal-Mart's biggest online grocery market in the nation. Some North Texas Wal-Mart stores are filling 900 orders a week. The average for the region is around 500 to 600 orders a week, said Jason Fogerty, Wal-Mart's Dallas area market coach for e-commerce. Wal-Mart just added the service to its first store inside the Dallas city limits at 6185 Retail Road in the Timber Creek Crossing shopping center. "Our customers love it. We're giving them what they want: time with their family," Fogerty said. On the first day it was offered at the Timber Creek location last week, he said, all but one of the customers was new to Wal-Mart's online service. Some Dallas shoppers were going to Garland and Rowlett for curbside pickup, Fogerty said. Wal-Mart grocery curbside service begins in North Texas Wal-Mart was the first to bring online grocery shopping with curbside service to North Texas in October 2015, and now it has expanded curbside pickup to more than 50 stores in Dallas-Fort Worth. Suburban shoppers were the first to have the option of swinging by a store to have a Wal-Mart employee load their groceries into their vehicle that they ordered online. Nationwide, Wal-Mart has expanded it to 500 stores and is adding 600 stores this year. "We think the service is ideal for attracting customers we aren't serving now," said Dallas store manager Tara Barnes, including people from East Dallas neighborhoods, Lake Highlands and students from Southern Methodist University. "Since we're the only Dallas store that has it, we're hoping we'll attract a different customer. Maybe a Tom Thumb shopper who wants this convenience will come here instead," Barnes saud,  She expects the Dallas store to quickly crank up to 40 to 50 orders a day. Ten employees have been trained and assigned exclusively to the service, and another 30 have had enough training to pitch in. Wal-Mart divided a supercenter into eight areas, and the professional shoppers are dispatched with a specially designed cart to accommodate shopping multiple orders at once. Sergio Rivera, the Dallas store's e-commerce manager said the staff received three weeks of training that included filling all the orders one day at a store in Rowlett and Garland. "When the other stores let us run it, we gained a lot of experience." If a size or brand isn't available, employees will pick the larger size or a higher quality at no additional cost, Rivera said. "We also tell the customer about the substitution, and if they don't want it, we can remove it from the receipt." The service is free and orders placed by 10 a.m. can be picked up the same day. Wal-Mart and Amazon are both building their online grocery business. Amazon last month opened two grocery pickup stores in Seattle. In other cities, it's partnered with local supermarkets. Sprouts Farmers Market is Amazon's Dallas grocery source. Kroger started its ClickList curbside service last summer in North Texas. Tom Thumb started online shopping delivery service in Dallas this year. Shoppers have several other options also through Instacart and Google Express. Kroger names which DFW stores will take ClickList online grocery orders After shunning the service in the late 1990s and early 2000s, shoppers today are interested in online grocery shopping as better technology and mobile shopping make it easier. Tanner Kelly, 27, picked up his $180 order last Friday at the Timbercreek Crossing Wal-Mart. He had just moved into a new apartment in Lake Highlands from Rockwall and said he had been adding items on the Walmart.com app all week. "Instead of spending two hours in the store, I just kept adding to my list as I'd think of things," Kelly said. "And now that I'm done moving, I'm coming by for my groceries." Kelly said his mother uses the service so he was used to shopping this way.  Twitter: @MariaHalkias View Comments Tags Retail Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Sponsored Stories Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

(Photo courtesy of Village of Lincolnwood) Grace Wong, Susan Berger and Brian L. CoxContact ReporterChicago Tribune A teenage girl from Chicago who has been charged with killing an Uber driver randomly attacked the man with a knife and a machete that she had just stolen from Walmart, authorities say. Eliza Wasni, 16, kept her eyes mostly to the floor Wednesday afternoon as a Cook County judge ordered her held without bail in the killing of Grant Nelson of Wilmette — an act prosecutors called "heinous" and "not provoked in any manner." Prosecutors said Nelson, 34, had picked up Wasni early Tuesday a few blocks from a Walmart in Skokie and, minutes into the ride, near the corner of Touhy and Lincoln avenues in Lincolnwood, she began stabbing him. He managed to pull over his Hyundai and run to a nearby condominium building lobby, where he pushed buzzers and yelled, "Help me, help me. I'm going to die," Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham said. Wasni took off in Nelson's car but quickly struck a median and then ran off on foot, Cunningham said. She was found nearby wearing just a bra and leggings; a bloodstained Chicago Cubs shirt was found nearby, and a trail of blood led responding officers to the condominium lobby and then to the seriously injured Uber driver, Cunningham said.

Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Cunningham gave a detailed account of the machete and knife attack.

Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Cunningham gave a detailed account of the machete and knife attack. (Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune)  See more videos Police were able to use the Uber app on his phone to see that "Eliza" was the name of his most recent customer, the prosecutor said. She called Nelson a "random victim." Nelson, who attended New Trier High School in Winnetka and the University of Colorado at Boulder, described his attacker to police but died later at a nearby hospital, officials said. Surveillance footage from Walmart showed Wasni walking around the store with a knife and machete and then leaving without paying for them, the prosecutor said. She said Wasni had taken two earlier Uber rides the evening before, including one to Des Plaines and another from Des Plaines to Walmart. She was apparently in violation of the ride-sharing company's terms and conditions, which say customers must be at least 18 years old. Wasni spoke during the bond court hearing only to confirm her name. Her lawyer, a public defender, said the teen attends Taft High School in Chicago and lives with a single mother. Wasni has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder. Judge Michael Hood ordered her to be held without bail and called the crime "extremely violent." An official with the Cook County sheriff's office said Wasni will be held in a juvenile facility. Outside the courtroom, Nelson's brother, Todd Nelson, called him "the most gentle, kind person. He never hurt anyone. He was good to animals, he was good to children."

Grant Nelson, shown in a family photo, was working for Uber when he was fatally stabbed while dropping off a passenger in Lincolnwood, according to police. (Todd Nelson photo) Grant Nelson, his brother said, loved opera and classical piano and was a "very good" piano player. He had also previously worked at Di Pescara restaurant in Northbrook, a manager there confirmed. "He was just trying to do the best he could in life," Todd Nelson said. His sister, Alexandra Nelson, added that the family hopes "justice will happen," calling the attack "horrifying and maddening." The siblings, as well as their parents, were in the courtroom during the hearing. Alexandra Nelson sat behind her father with her hand on his shoulder as a description of the alleged crime was read by the prosecutor. Family members sobbed at times during the proceedings, including when officials described Grant Nelson begging for help in the lobby before he was found on the ground outside in a pool of blood with multiple stab wounds on his right side. An Uber spokeswoman issued a statement Wednesday saying the company is "heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Regarding the company's 18-and-older age restriction for customers, the spokeswoman later explained that a rider's access to the service can be removed if the rider is found to be underage, and that there is a mechanism for drivers to report riders if they suspect them of being younger than 18. The spokeswoman said Uber has safety tips for drivers and riders, developed with the assistance of law enforcement agencies. She also said that drivers are encouraged to contact local authorities if they ever feel unsafe, and that the app has a two-way feedback system that is monitored around the clock by a team that investigates any problems that are reported.

Welcome to the second edition of Marketer's Brief, a quick read on marketing news, moves and trends. Have tips or suggestions for next week's edition? Send to eschultz@adage.com. Sheryl Crow will perform for Walmart associates in Fayetteville, Ark., tonight. No biggie since Walmart typically brings acts to entertain thousands of employees who come from around the world for its Shareholders Week. (Three Doors Down and Daughtry filled this slot last year.) But Crow stands apart for having had one of her albums banned by Walmart in 1996 over the song, "Love Is a Good Thing," which implied the retailer sells guns to children (contrary to law and store policy). No word on whether the song will be in the concert, but we're guessing not. Sheryl Crow's concert at Bloomington, Illinois Credit: Daniel/Dan Eidsmoe via flickr Another sign of bygones going by: The album is available on Walmart.com from a third-party seller. Said a Walmart spokeswoman: "When it comes to business decisions, every day is a winding road and we've enjoyed many opportunities to work with Sheryl Crow over the last 20 years. We look forward to her entertaining our associates because during our Shareholders' concerts all they want to do is have some fun." Michael Phelps dives all in for Huggies Even for the world's greatest swimmer, endorsement deals start drying up a year after the Olympics. But thanks to birth of his little swimmer, baby Boomer, Michael Phelps is adding Huggies Little Swimmers to a list that includes Intel, Under Armour and 800razors. Here, he and family turn up in a faux press conference to announce the deal from Ogilvy & Mather, Chicago. We're guessing faux, given the applause, but, hey, Donald Trump has engineered some applause at his announcements too. What would Mrs. Brady say? Conagra Brands is selling the Wesson oil brand to The J.M. Smucker Co. in a deal valued at about $285 million as the food marketer keeps tinkering with its portfolio to remodel itself into a house of brands. Conagra referred to Wesson, which it acquired in its 1990 purchase of Beatrice Co., as "an iconic edible oil." Conagra will keep making Wesson products and provide other services during a transition period for up to one year after the deal closes. The sale reminds us here at Marketer's Brief of Florence Henderson, who served as Wesson's pitchwoman from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. Donut vs. Doughnut Which spelling entices potential purchasers: donut or doughnut? Just in time for National Donut Day (June 2), Yes Lifecycle Marketing has the answer, at least when it comes to which works better in email subject lines. It's a close call. Emails sent with "donut" in the subject line in the week around last year's National Donut Day held an average open rate of 9.73%. Those with "doughnut" prevailed with an open rate of 10.82%. Fidget spinners: retail's rescuer or mom's curse? The toy du-jour, fidget spinners, could be spinning gold for retailers, Rumplestiltskin-style. On Tuesday, an analyst from Barclays increased her sales forecast for teen chain Five Below, citing spinners as a meaningful trend that is expected to positively impact the store's first-quarter sales. "Spinners may be a much larger phenomenon than the Rainbow Loom, Shopkins, or slime," wrote the analyst. But not everyone is loving the low-priced gadgets -- check out what JP Morgan Chase CMO Kristin Lemkau has to say ... Worst kid trend of 2017? Bottle flipping, fidget spinners or slime? I'm going with slime. — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) May 30, 2017 Tweet of the Week We put together a covfefe of President Underwood's favorites in your city, just in time for the @HouseofCards premier. pic.twitter.com/irYJy0zMA2 — Postmates (@Postmates) May 31, 2017 Number You Need to Know 20% -- the year-to-date decline in golf equipment sales according to NPD Group, showing that Tiger Woods DUI is not the game's only problem. Oreos Cereal Credit: Post Consumer Brands Would You Buy This? Oreos for breakfast? It's true. Oreo O's, first launched in 1998, are coming back in June after a 10-year absence, thanks to Post Consumer Brands. Moves Brandon Solano was named chief marketing officer of Pei Wei after what the Pan-Asian style chain called an extensive national search. Solano was most recently CMO of Papa Murphy's, the take-and-bake pizza chain, and before that had roles at Wendy's and Domino's. Coldwell Banker Real Estate CMO Sean Blankenship is leaving the company, effective June 1. Coldwell stated that he has been transitioning his duties to Senior VP marketing David Marine.

(AAPL): You’re Right to Be Skeptical of AAPL Stock Bitcoin Is Cryptocurrency, But It’s Not Currency Nokia Oyj (ADR) (Nok) Stock Is a Case of Image vs. Reality View All Posts Whenever lazy analysts look at the discount store market, they compare Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) with Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). As a result, investors have missed one of the decade’s biggest trends — discounting. It’s everywhere, as Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG) goes where Walmart fears to tread. Source: Shutterstock In neighborhoods that are too poor to support a Walmart, you’ll find a Dollar General. In towns that are too small to support a Walmart, you will find a Dollar General. Dollar General offers everything Walmart does, but less. A smaller store, with less selection, but geared to the people who depend upon it. The result is the same low-price monopoly in these markets Walmart enjoys in larger towns and along freeway intersections. Thanks to Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR), whose cookie-cutter Family Dollar stores are often sited close to Dollar General, there’s no talk of monopoly, either. But the effect is the same. The Dollar General Effect Is Growing Walmart is often accused of destroying small town America. In fact, it began a process of delivering everyone the same low prices, on the same middle-class goods, found in urban centers. This is something small towns wanted, something the old downtown could not give people. For those towns which thought their tiny size would make them immune to the Walmart Effect, there is Dollar General. In many places, they are the retail environment. What investors should know is that as they go, so goes small town America. Over the past 10 years, Dollar General stock is up 218%. Over five years, the gain is 52%. Since the start of the year, though, DG stock is down 2%. Dollar General is slowing, in part, because the impact of “innovations” Family Dollar brought to the market — alcohol and cigarettes — are in the shares. Family Dollar’s supply contracts with McLane Co., a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B, NYSE:BRK.A), brought these products into Dollar General markets, and Dollar General followed where it was legal. This has now gone about as far as it can, so same-store sales growth is slowing. To keep its top line moving ahead, Dollar General is opening more stores. It won headlines by noting “10,000 new jobs,” but that’s 1,000 stores. A Dollar General means fewer than a dozen clerk jobs in your town. As it runs out of its traditional customers, Dollar General is also opening a new format, DGX, targeting car-less millennials in urban markets with sodas, coffee and ready-made sandwiches.

More than 3,000 of the 1.5 million Walmart U.S. employees donned in matching blue t-shirts filed into Bud Walton Arena early Wednesday (May 31) to kick off the retail giant’s annual shareholder week. What they heard first from top U.S. executives was “thank you.” Walmart U.S. COO Judith McKenna opened the meeting saying just that, “Thank you for the difference you have made.” There was plenty to celebrate, according to the Wal-Mart execs, from the 1.4% same-store sales reported in the retailer’s first quarter to the 63% jump in e-commerce sales during that same period and 7.3% decline in inventory levels. But some of the most applauded accomplishments included: • Reduced pickup wait time by 29% and increased customer satisfaction; • Closing at 6 P.M. on Christmas Eve; • More than 100,000 employees were Academy graduates; • Shipped 6% more cases last year; and • Raised over $60 million for the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals “We are winning, and you are part of a company that’s taking it to the competition,” McKenna said. She said training is making a difference and the Walmart Academy’s are a “game changer.” This year she said nearly 250,000 employees will have gone through the academy training. The retailer will have 200 of the academies open by the end of this summer. McKenna also called on employees to be “advocates for anything is possible.” She said there will always be challenges but it’s crucial that employees understand three reasons why they should be advocates. “Wal-Mart is winning and you can make a bigger difference with Walmart than any other company and there is loads of opportunity for you to to grow at Wal-Mart.” Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran said the reason he spends the majority of his time out in stores is because he believes when and where you stand determines what you see. “I have to stand with you in the stores to see what your needs are. My parents were teachers and I suppose I do a lot of teaching, more so I am learning for each of you,” he said. “We face enormous challenges … convenience and saving time is important but I also believe price is just as important and that’s not going to change anytime soon. Our 4,676 stores footprint is unrivaled and our e-commerce business is growing each day. Converging these two is a big task but it puts us in a strong position,” Foran said. The one thing that Foran said could tip the scale in Wal-Mart’s favor is “you” he told them. “You are the spark at the core of the Wal-Mart experience. If we get it wrong and someone has a bad experience that’s a downer, but if we get it right it gives us an enormous advantage,” he added. “You are the human authenticity than makes the difference.” In typical Wal-Mart fashion there was entertainment at the event. Former NFL player and actor Terry Crews was the special guest host at the event. He hosted a game of “Walmart Associates Gameday” between management and employees. He treated everyone to his rendition of “Play that Funky Music.” Rising pop star Julia Michaels also performed two songs for the crowd as the musical guest. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, took the stage wearing flashlight high top sneakers, one of the new items sold in Walmart this year. He believes the retailer will sell enough of the shoes to light 40 Christmas trees for Rockefeller Center. He also promoted a new tent from Ozark Trails that is equipped with LED lights. He also touted a new M&Ms candy flavor — caramel chocolate which were parachuted down from the ceiling for everyone to try. The party gift in every seat was blow up floats shaped like cupcakes, sodas, or popsicles. Each of the products are new at Walmart. The shareholder meeting is set for Friday morning at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2013, file photo, two Wal-Mart employees walk past a sign in the lobby at the Walmart.com office in San Bruno, Calif. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (Jeff Chiu / AP) Anne D'InnocenzioAssociated Press Privacy Policy Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore's led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we got a customer base —those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup helped bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is helping, since people realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook and furniture pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensor track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress."

At right is Mercedes Emanuel of Cool, a member of the local Elks Lodge who is taking over the worthwhile effort with help from fellow lodge member Judy Jenkins, not pictured. Hilliard and McKinney, both of whom are wives of Elks, gave credit also to Julianna Turner for her work in helping to start Santa's Open House, a seasonal event that provides a holiday shopping spree for foster kids along with breakfast and festivities at the Elks Lodge in Shingle Springs. Democrat photo by Shelly Thorene FacebookTwitter FacebookTwitter It was 10 years ago that a trio of local women had an idea, a plan to make certain that foster children in El Dorado County would have a better chance at a merry Christmas. Although at first they were told it wasn’t feasible (too costly and too many complicated logistics involved), Pat Hilliard, Fran McKinney and Julianna Turner wouldn’t be dissuaded. And today, a decade later, the three women who against all odds started Santa’s Open House that allows foster kids to shop their hearts out at Walmart in Placerville each holiday season, are stepping aside. Hilliard, McKinney and Turner have done their duty in creating and sustaining a program that has helped so many young people going through difficult times, not only with gifts at Christmas but letting them know that their community always cares about their welfare.   Elfin Elks Both Hilliard’s and McKinney’s husbands are members of Elks Lodge No. 1712 in Shingle Springs and its members who include Turner have been absolutely elfin in helping to present Santa’s Open House for the past 10 years. The Elks opened up the lodge for the initial Santa’s Open Houses where shopping was conducted among donated items and presents including those purchased by Hilliard, McKinney and Turner themselves. Once Walmart became involved some five years ago, the shopping part of the special day occurs there, with two aisles of merchandise reserved and ready, just for the kids’ shopping pleasure. Foster children are given a gift card supported by donations from the public and benevolent organizations including Elks; last year each young shopper received a card worth $125. Walmart carves out a special time slot for the kids and their foster families and Santa Claus is there and waiting, complete with photo opportunities, along with store staff assigned to help the kids go crazy over aisles stuffed with toys, clothing and seasonal sundries. Although the shopping spree now is at Walmart, the doors at the Elks Lodge in Shingle Springs still swing wide that morning. The Elks open up the big, spacious building on Quest Court, readying the bacon, eggs, pancakes and more to welcome the happy families and continue the holiday merriment. After all, shopping’s hard work.   Capable successor It’s with mixed feelings that Hilliard and McKinney hand over Santa’s keys to the open house, but they both agreed it’s time to take it easy. Turner wasn’t present at the lodge as the women recounted their efforts, but Hilliard said no doubt she would share their sentiments. Their decision was made a little bit easier, though, knowing that a capable hand will be taking over, ensuring that foster children are not forgotten. Hilliard and McKinney smiled as they introduced a woman who appears enthusiastic and ready to go, with Elks member Mercedes Emanuel now tasked with keeping Santa’s Open House going. It’s not as easy as one might think. “It won’t be easy following in their footsteps,” said Emanuel recently as the women gathered at the Elks Lodge to talk about the remarkable success of Santa’s Open House. “I’ve already learned it’s a daily effort.” Emanuel, who will be helped by fellow Elk Judy Jenkins in maintaining the holiday event, lives in Cool — and when the phone rings she and husband Frank know that it could be yet another call to come pick up “stuff.”   Rummaging around Mercedes explained that to raise money for such endeavors, the Elks hold big rummage sales twice a year and it is her duty, with help from her husband, to pick up any “leftovers” from area yard sales. And there are lots of yard sales, in all the far reaches of the county, meaning long miles and plenty of boxes in storage at the couple’s home. The Elks Lodge not only is the venue for the merry Christmas breakfast bash, but the lodge helps defray some of the event’s expenses and its members love helping the children shop on the special day. It wasn’t always that way, Hilliard and McKinney reflected, and the women’s eyes caught one other as they talked about how it all started.   Did it anyway It seems Hilliard had gone to Sedona, Ariz., one holiday season and saw that community putting on a program for foster kids. She liked the idea and told her friend McKinney about it. McKinney quickly jumped on board and they took their fledgling thoughts to their husbands’ lodge — but the head Elk at the time said no, the ladies recalled, lips pursed. “He said it was not a good idea,” recalled Hilliard, and now she and McKinney were smiling slightly as they caught eyes. “We did it anyway.” The gals did all the shopping themselves for that initial Santa’s Open House, with the kids coming out to the lodge where they and their foster families enjoyed not only breakfast but crafts tables and other entertainment.   A success The idea caught on, obviously, and today some 100 foster children are participating in the Walmart spree followed by breakfast at the Elks’. (That’s roughly one-third of all the foster children in the county, estimated to number 300.) The children are given gift cards to shop at Walmart and volunteers from the Elks Lodge help the kids pick out their presents. It’s a moving and memorable experience, according to Elks PR maven Barbara Dockter. Dockter said one of the most memorable events of the year in which the Elks, and she personally, participate is Santa’s Open House.   Having heart “It’s one of the most tearful, that’s for sure,” smiled Dockter, on hand to introduce the ladies who created the special day. “Like the time a little 8-year-old girl was asked what she wanted for Christmas — and she said, ‘A heart.’ It turned out that she had had eight surgeries already and was on a waiting list for a new heart.” Dockter said the foster child managed to impact several hearts that day and the Elks were happy to have her and the other kids, along with their families, back to the lodge to keep the holiday spirit alive. Another, older foster kid had an interesting request when it was his turn to speak to Santa. He wanted to be able to pay the family phone bill. Several of the kids at the shopping event have requests every year for Santa that might surprise folks, according to all the ladies. “A lot of them get gifts for others, either their siblings or other family members,” said Dockter as the other ladies nodded knowingly. A bright spot from the past, all agreed, was the time the 8-year-old boy who had just been able to purchase a Walmart bicycle couldn’t wait to try out his new wheels. “He rode his new bike all around Walmart all morning,” said Mercedes. “He had a new bike, helmet and tennis shoes.” Good to go — right on back to the Elks Lodge where Santa had already beaten them there, flying overhead, apparently, from Walmart. Mrs. Claus was at the lodge, too, helping the Elks elves cook up a fantastic breakfast for all. It was noted that occasionally foster kids who are siblings are not only removed from their troubled family environment but too often are separated from each other because they are assigned to different foster homes. Months may have gone by before they have been able to see one other, with the reunion at Walmart a poignant one for all. Looking back on what they have accomplished, giving so much of themselves in an effort that has flourished for 10 years, Fran McKinney said she is slightly amazed.   An impressive decade “I am so impressed that it has been 10 years,” said the woman whose colleagues call her the Energizer Bunny. “I love that the foster children are able to have something because of what we have done. When you see those children’s happy faces you know it has been worth the effort. “I’ll miss it.” Pat Hilliard, the woman whose idea was sparked in Sedona, smiled at the memories and then her demeanor became wistful. She noted that health issues prevent her from going any farther in leading what has proven to be a wonderful holiday program.   Community effort In addition to Walmart, several other groups and organizations, including the Cameron Park Newcomers and the Gold Nugget Quilters, support the effort. Donations keep the project going and the amount of money each child may be given varies; last year each foster received gift cards worth $125. Mercedes Emanuel listened as the women recounted their success, then she turned an eye toward the future. Although she must wash and hang all the clothing donated by every yard sale on the planet, she said she has no problem taking on the tremendous organizational challenge of Santa’s Open House. And she has a quite compelling reason for that positive attitude. “My husband and I have a special-needs son,” Mercedes explained. “He was adopted when he was 1 week old. “I completely understand how the community can impact a family. When you have a community pitching in, showing that you stand with us …” her voice trailed as her words sank in. Mercedes said her son Andrew today is 20 years old and thriving. Those wishing to donate to Santa’s Open House may contact Mercedes Emanuel at (916) 712-8842.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Wal-Mart Works To Close Gap Between Itself and Amazon By Anne DInnocenzio PUBLISHED: MAY 31 2017 Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore's led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of consulting firm ChannelAdvisors, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we got a customer base -- those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup helped bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is helping, since people realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook and furniture pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensor track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about -- low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

By ANNE D'INNOCENZIOAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon. But Amazon keeps innovating, too, such as with its experimental Amazon Go convenience stores, currently open only to its employees in Seattle. Associated Press/Jeff Chiu, File HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers such as ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” Lore said. “We think we (have) a customer base – those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart because they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But Amazon keeps innovating. It’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick them up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors. Want the news vital to Maine?

Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.” ——— Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio     Tags: amazon, online, prime, shoppers, percent, shipping, Other stories from today: Banks pull stocks away from records as seven-day streak ends Uber fires autonomous car researcher involved in lawsuit Wal-Mart works to close gap between itself and Amazon     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of legislation passed by the state Senate and heading to the Assembly that would create single-payer health care system in California?

I too have an ATM only card, but not from KeyBank. I am curious as to why T.R. of North Olmsted would have presented his ATM-only card at Walmart for a purchase, knowing that it is was "ATM-only"? Was it a mistake? If not, what did T.R. expect to happen? Adding to my curiosity is the fact that it happened twice.   I would never even consider trying to use my "ATM Only" card anywhere but at an ATM machine.   C.H., Cleveland Heights   A: Yes, it was apparently a mistake by T.R., the first and second times over the past year. It didn't strike me as an unreasonable mistake; I know I've pulled the wrong card out of my wallet before. A lot of my plastic tends to be gray or blue. I could understand, for example, that someone reaching for her Macy's card might instead pull out her Target card, because they're both bright red.   I believe T.R. thought that if he accidentally pulled out a card that needed a PIN to work, then it wouldn't work without his PIN. If the transaction had exceeded $25, then it would not have gone through. It's like when I'm at the gas pump and slide my credit card and then accidentally hit debit instead of credit. The transaction won't proceed without a PIN, which I don't have. I have to back out of the transaction and start over.   I'm going to try out one of my ATM/PIN-only cards at a handful of stores in the next few weeks to see if I can use it without the PIN. If you try yours for a small transaction under $25, let me know whether you're successful or not.   Q: What can I do about the imposter IRS numbers that call my cell phone. They leave a voice message saying that they are from the IRS and that there is a pending lawsuit against me.  I obviously do not contact them back. Just on a whim, on a Saturday, I pressed "call back" and someone answered "IRS," I of course hung up.   I have kept the numbers in my phone log. I feel bad that there are some people that fall prey to this scam.  Is there a way to report these numbers?   B.G., Twinsburg   A: First, please don't call them back again. Just don't. It only alerts the scam artists that they may have a live one. Calling back won't decrease the number of calls you get from people trying to defraud you. It will only increase them, because these low-lifes run in the same circles and share information.   Assuming you know or believe you don't owe any taxes, here's what the IRS says you should do:   1. Do not give out any information. Hang up immediately. Don't confirm your name. Don't tell them you know it's a scam. Don't tell them you believe the Cavs are going to win a second NBA title. Don't say anything. Just hang up.   2. Contact the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) by phone or online. Call TIGTA at 800-366-4484. Or you can report the call and the offending phone number by going to https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml   3. Report the attempted scam to the Federal Trade Commission. Go to https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#%26panel1-1 Make note that your query concerns an "IRS telephone scam." If you're not sure whether you owe taxes, or think you might, call the real IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you figure out your situation and discuss how you will pay anything you might owe.     View Comments About Us About Cleveland.com About Advance Ohio Advertise with us Audience FAQ Contact Us Career Opportunities Community FAQ Subscribe The Plain Dealer Sun News eNewsletters Subscriber Service Media Insider Rewards View My Profile Report a Delivery Issue Place a Vacation Hold Make a Payment Cleveland.com Sections News Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Politics Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Shopping Deals and Coupons Local Businesses Deals in Your Area Your Regional News Pages Beachwood Brunswick Lakewood Parma & Parma Heights Strongsville More Communities Mobile Mobile Apps More on Cleveland.com Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Instagram | Pinterest Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Advance Ohio All rights reserved (About Us).

By Allan Ellinger on May 31, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Gigi Hadid As the fashion and retail landscape continues to evolve at warp speed, “old guard” vendors and newer digitally native e-commerce companies are rapidly converging at an M&A intersection of mutual need. While online players offer the right combination of technology, data-driven consumer insights and social engagement as well as aesthetics, established, traditionally rooted firms bring operational excellence, product development and sourcing capabilities, in addition to sorely needed working capital. Veteran brands and labels would be wise to find a next-gen partner to intelligently enter the digital fray as it is often cheaper to buy it than to build it. It appears that patience in the venture capital and private equity communities for next-generation fashion and retail-tech companies is waning, given burn rates that are too high and success rates that are too low. As capital is beginning to dry up for still unprofitable e-commerce start-ups, opportunities for strategics will open up at prices worth negotiating. The core competencies of design, manufacturing and sourcing, logistics and importing remain intrinsic to the fashion industry and where — via the right strategic relationship — one can provide digital retailers with much-needed business acumen, a strong balance sheet and leverageable infrastructure. Allan Ellinger  Look at the evolving strategies at Wal-Mart, Tommy Hilfiger and PVH. These “old guard” retailers and brands are jumping into this new industry paradigm, risking capital and brand equity for the opportunity to remain viable with new consumers tomorrow. At Wal-Mart, the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition brought digital entrepreneur Marc Lore to the retailer, and he is quickly putting his fingerprint on the organization with new acquisitions and hires that position Wal-Mart to better compete digitally with Amazon et al. Lore has been given the necessary autonomy needed to drive a new business model supported by Wal-Mart’s world class logistics and infrastructure. Kudos to Wal-Mart for stepping out of its comfort zone and trying and testing new retail approaches. An intensive focus on social media and a new consumer is at play at PVH’s Tommy Hilfiger. Shifting its operating model to see-now-buy-now, creating the fashion event Tommyland at Venice Beach, leveraging Gigi Hadid’s celebrity power and youth appeal, and employing a digitally focused global media campaign all have amplified the voice and reach of the Tommy Hilfiger brand and altered its business model, better equipping the company to compete as a nimbler, just-in-time, fashion brand. PVH has been active on the acquisition front as well. In March 2017, this 137-year-old apparel company purchased True & Co. a five-year-old born on the web direct-to-consumer e-commerce bra brand, adding to its Calvin Klein, Warner’s and Olga intimates businesses. PVH will now have in-house data analytics that drive True & Co.’s success and can be leveraged across PVH’s brands while providing category expertise, global brand management and supply chain know-how that will support True & Co.’s next leg of growth. Success in today’s fashion industry is increasingly tenuous amid the growing number of store closures and bankruptcies in tandem with the seemingly daily arrival of yet another “fashion tech digital disruptor” and the continuing onslaught of Amazon. This year, many traditional apparel brands and labels will see sales volume decline in tandem with fewer points of distribution and competition from the newest flavor of the day. Even established brands with strong consumer loyalty are navigating a choppy landscape as consumer demands are changing faster than their ability to keep pace. The rate of change is unprecedented and it is working its way through the apparel ecosystem, from design, textile production to assembly and manufacturing, to logistics and distribution and finally to point of sale as digitization impacts the entire supply chain. These challenges and more will increase for the next few years as creative destruction continues. Over the long haul, the digital shift should generate efficiencies that yield enhanced profitability. Opportunities co-exist with these challenges. But, this requires a new framework, out-of-the-box thinking, and a willingness to test and try new business models. The need for a new vision replete with new goals, new brand and marketing strategies and as importantly, new level talent is a must. Internal, radical organizational and cultural change is extremely difficult, it often takes too long and can upset the corporate structure. An alternative route is to find a strategic partner that has the digital know-how and the social media savvy that your business lacks, while offering the depth of industry experience digital disruptors need in order to achieve, profitable growth. The right combinations can supercharge both partners and result in synergies benefiting both parties. This isn’t about next season, or next year. This is about long-term survival. The biggest risk today is to do nothing. Simply put, inactivity or indecision is not a strategy. Allan Ellinger is cofounder and senior managing director of MMG Advisors.

(Mike Segar/Reuters) Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery. (Mike Segar/Reuters) Amazon shares break through $1,000 mark for first time Add to ... SPENCER SOPER SEATTLE — Bloomberg News Published Tuesday, May 30, 2017 10:05AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, May 30, 2017 5:42PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 (U.S.) for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares touched $1,001.20 in intraday trading Tuesday, up about 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 index in the same period, before closing at $996.70. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Co. LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s $477-billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s Web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 per cent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first, and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the U.S. federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8-billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner Inc., up 18 per cent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s second-wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show Shark Tank. “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Mr. Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells.

Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Walmart to escape the Amazon in the room. Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Walmart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, N.J. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Walmart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Walmart wants to grow faster. As Walmart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Walmart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some it has become ingrained they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Walmart wasn't putting an emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Walmart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Walmart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Walmart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is bringing shoppers in. Walmart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall.

Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world buys books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday: Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Walmart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 on Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It is 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City.

Amazon hit an intraday high of US$1,001.20 in New York before ending the day little changed at US$996.70. The stock is up almost 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its US success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said Mr John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Co, who recently upped his Amazon price target to US$1,125 a share. "There's a long runway there," he said. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up The Seattle company's US$478 billion (S$660 billion) market value is double that of Walmart Stores even though the world's biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon's this year. Investors put more value in Amazon's Web traffic and delivery network than they do in Walmart's vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer. The world's largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its US$99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the US as of March 31, an increase of 38 per cent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Walmart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon's momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy's and Sears Holdings, which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix and Airbnb, as well as Capital One Financial Corp and the federal government. Amazon's rise has made its founding chief executive officer Jeff Bezos the world's second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. "Amazon is worth far more than US$1,000 a share," said Mr Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and an Amazon investor. "Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world."

The European Union's top climate change official says Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it "a sad day for the global community." ___ Despite Trump, cleaner energy growth expected to carry on WASHINGTON (AP) — The push to use cleaner forms of energy is unlikely to slow down, even after President Donald Trump says he'll abandon U.S. pledges to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Around the world, coal-fired power plants are being shuttered as governments and private companies invest billions in wind turbines and solar farms. ___ US job market looks solid 8 years after recession ended WASHINGTON (AP) — Exactly eight years after the Great Recession ended, the U.S. job market has settled into a sweet spot of steadily solid growth. On Friday, when the government releases the jobs report for May, the pattern is likely to extend itself. ___ Investors pick Tesla's promise over GM's steady profits DETROIT (AP) — Tesla and General Motors have a budding rivalry that could help determine whether Detroit or Silicon Valley sets the course for the future of the auto industry. Right now Wall Street is favouring the upstart led by flamboyant Elon Musk to the established icon headed by the more restrained Mary Barra. ___ US auto sales fall for fifth straight month in May DETROIT (AP) — U.S. auto sales fell for the fifth straight month in May, bolstering expectations for the first annual sales decline since 2009. Some industry analysts lowered predictions for the year as General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai and Toyota reported May decreases compared with a year ago. ___ Fund investing is cheaper than ever, and it's because of you NEW YORK (AP) — Investors paid lower expenses last year than ever before for their mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and all the credit goes to investors themselves. Investors are plowing their money into the cheapest funds, which puts pressure on the rest of the industry to cut their own expenses or risk losing even more dollars. ___ Walmart testing store employee delivery of US online orders BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) — Walmart says it's testing a delivery service using its own store associates, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The "associate delivery" program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs. It's the retailer's latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon. ___ Trump's cellphone use worries security experts WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump, who blasted Hillary Clinton for using a personal email server, might be a walking magnet for eavesdropping and malware if he's using an unsecured cellphone to chat with foreign leaders. Trump has been handing out his cellphone number to counterparts around the world, urging them to call him directly to avoid the red tape of diplomatic communications. In today's world of cyber espionage, cellphone security experts say such a policy is not only unorthodox, but dangerous. ___ AP Interview: France warns of risk of war in cyberspace PARIS (AP) — A French cybersecurity official warns there could be a "permanent war" between states and criminal or extremist groups because of hacking attacks. The head of the French government's cybersecurity agency, Guillaume Poupard, tells the Associated Press that a "nightmare scenario" would be "chaos" in which "everyone will attack each other, without really knowing who did what." Last month, the head of the U.S. National Security Agency told senators that cyber war is "real and here to stay." ___ US stocks back at record highs after better jobs data NEW YORK (AP) — A broad push higher for stocks sent indexes to records on Thursday following yet more signs that the job market continues to improve. ___ Uber posts $708 million loss and says finance head left HONG KONG (AP) — Uber posted a $708 million loss in the most recent quarter and said its head of finance is leaving, the latest executive to depart. It's been a rough year for the San Francisco company. It lost its head of communications, president and other senior executives in recent months as it faces allegations of sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index ended at 2,430.06, up 18.26 points, or 0.8 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 135.53, or 0.6 per cent, to 21,144.18, and the Nasdaq composite rose 48.31, or 0.8 per cent, to 6,246.83. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 4 cents to settle at $48.36 per barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 13 cents to settle at $50.63 a barrel. Natural gas fell 6 cents to settle at $3.01 per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.50 per gallon and wholesale gasoline was close to flat at $1.60 per gallon.

Casey Ferrand Reporter NEW ORLEANS — Working women in New Orleans are asking for equal pay for equal work, but Louisiana lawmakers have killed several bills aimed at closing the state's gender pay gap during the current legislative session. Advertisement Women in Louisiana are paid 68 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and the disparity is worse for African-American and Latin women. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, the median annual pay for a woman in Louisiana who holds a full-time, year-round job is $31,586. For men, it's $48,382, a wage gap of about $16,000. Women who gathered to protest and spread the word about their cause on Tuesday said lower wages mean less money to save for the future or to spend on basic goods and services. Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, raised its starting wage early this year from $9 per hour to $10 per hour for new employees. "The position I'm in, the starting wage is $10.80. So until these past raises in March, I was only making 20 cents more after eight years than a brand-new associate walking in the door," said Betsey Marler, who has worked at Walmart for eight years. She and other women are asking Walmart to be transparent and reveal the average wages for women vs. men. "When Walmart raised their starting wage, so did Target, Marshalls and other places. We feel if Walmart will be more transparent and disclose this information, then the other major companies in the nation will do so also," Marler said. Blake Jackson, a Walmart spokesman, provided a statement: "We believe that associates with the same qualifications, making the same effort to achieve the same result, should receive the same rate of pay for performing the same work. We've invested $2.7 billion in training, education and higher wages to create paths of opportunity, and we're proud that 57 percent of the hourly associates who received promotions during the past year were women." Walmart provided additional information about the company: As reported in Walmart's 2017 GRR (global responsibility report), women comprise 55 percent of the company's total U.S. associate population, as well as 57 percent of the hourly-associates associates who were promoted during the last year. Walmart also reported in its 2017 GPR that people of color represented about 43 percent of its total U.S. associate population and about 45 percent of the hourly associates in the U.S. who were promoted last year. People of color also represented about 53 percent of all newly hired associates in the U.S. The group said it is relying on Louisiana lawmakers to create more legislation to help even the playing field for women, but several bills introduced this session have been blocked. "We voted for them to have our back, and they're pretty much failing us because this is something we want and need," Melinda Yonta said. Legislators this session have failed to pass three bills, including Senate Bill 2, authored by Sen. J.P. Morrell, that would have extended protections under the Louisiana Pay Act to men and women and clarified how and when workers can sue their employers. Morell said the bill would have provided workers with the tools to address inequities. He plans to file a version of the bill again next year. Earlier this month, lawmakers shot down two other bills that would have narrowed the wage gap. House Bill 112 required companies that have public government contracts to comply with existing equal pay laws. House Bill 222 would have prohibited private employers from retaliating against employees who discuss their wages. "It takes us as women and our community people to come out and support us and fight for this so we can win equal pay for equal work," Yonta said.

By ANNE D'INNOCENZIOAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon. But Amazon keeps innovating, too, such as with its experimental Amazon Go convenience stores, currently open only to its employees in Seattle. Associated Press/Jeff Chiu, File HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers such as ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” Lore said. “We think we (have) a customer base – those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart because they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But Amazon keeps innovating. It’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick them up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors. Want the news vital to Maine?

Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

You'll catch a lot of hate for saying something like that. But that hate shows how hypocritical people are. For years wee-boos have been crying about Walmart paying low wages, and putting mom-and-pop stores out of business. Amazon in comparison was wiped out far more mom-and-pop stores, and being automated, with no sales staff, has simply eliminated huge numbers of jobs and their pay. The Walmart haters are curiously silent on Amazon. Just sell your cheap stuff to poor people or you will end up like Sears, JC Penny and Radio Shack At least poor people have a place where they can get more for what little money they have. As for Sears and Penny's, their decline is completely self-inflicted. These companies have been destroyed by their executives, who tend to be private-sector politicians with MBA's, but who know less about running a business than a cub scout knows about running a lemonade stand. 0 ( +0 / -0 ) Login to leave a comment Facebook users Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

China manufacturing and services PMI allay fears of slowing economic momentum CS upgrades Myer and Super Retail, but consumer spending slump expected to continue British pound drops as polls indicate Labour is trimming gains of Conservatives Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:38pm on 31 May 2017 That's all for today - thanks everyone for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. Have a good evening. 4:26pm on 31 May 2017 Shares have closed slightly higher, thanks to some buying in oversold sectors such as banks and retail, but overall it was a dismal month for equity investors. The ASX ended the session up 0.1 per cent at 5724.6 but was down 3.4 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market meltdown of January 2016 and biggest May drop since 2013. NAB's 1.3 per cent gain was the standout among the big four today, which otherwise just edged higher. Aristocrat Leisure was another big winner of the day, rising 3.8 per cent. CSL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index, falling 1.8 per cent, followed by a 2.9 per cent drop in Origin Energy. A dip in iron ore prices this week and headlines regarding the stockpiles of ore waiting in Chinese ports weighed on the big miners. Resource giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto slumped 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. With the iron ore price trading flat at $US58.50 a tonne, Fortescue Metals bucked the trend and closed up 1.3 per cent.  Retail stocks Myer and Super Retail Group received some buying support, after Credit Suisse announced the un-loved sector might be oversold in those instances. The bank upgraded both stocks to "neutral" and the stocks jumped 2.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.  Weighing heaviest on the market over the month was a steep 9.2 per cent fall in the financials sector, due to heavy selling in the big banks. 3:59pm on 31 May 2017 Bitcoin's rollercoaster ride over the past week has cryptocurrency sceptics feeling vindicated. Bitcoin is down 1.5 per cent at $2216 in Asian trade, nearly 20 per cent below its record high of $US2798.97 hit last week. The digital currency's more than 100 per cent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $US1000 for the first time. By Valentine's Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $US500. Then it absolutely exploded, jumping more than $US1400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival into the mainstream of blockchain, the coin's underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient. But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $US300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $US600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 per cent the next day. 3:35pm on 31 May 2017 Hong Kong's private home prices hit a record high for the sixth month in a row in April, reflecting a market fervour that the authorities are eager to tame. The Asian financial hub is one of the least affordable places on earth, where a nano-apartment of less than 20 square metres can cost as much as $US500,000. The dearth of supply, low interest rates, and the flow of capital from mainland China pushed prices up over 137 per cent since the financial crisis in 2008. In April, home prices rose 2.12 per cent from the previous month, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. The figure, at 327.4, surged nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. The latest index does not reflect the latest mortgage tightening measures announced by the city's de facto central bank earlier in May. "If property prices keep breaking records in the next month or two, I expect the government to introduce new cooling measures," said property consultancy Knight Frank's Senior Director Thomas Lam.

The pizza maker said today that the audit of more than 700 franchised and corporate stores is taking longer than anticipated and that it won't be able to meet its June deadline. The company now expects the audit to be finished within six months. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is also investigating a number of Domino's stores after media reports this year of widespread underpaying of staff and a visa scam at one franchisee-owned store. Shares in Domino's are down 1.4 per cent at $57.57, taking this week's losses to more than 6 per cent. Domino's shares have dropped more than 6 per cent this week. Photo: Kate Leith Back to top 2:49pm on 31 May 2017 Investors hoping for a quick rebound in June after May's ASX declines may be disappointed, with history suggesting they shouldn't count on a June recovery. The old adage to 'sell in May and go away' proved prescient in 2017, with the S&P/ASX200 down 3.4 per cent as concern over Australia's housing boom and weak retail spending combined with falling commodity prices to lead to a nasty coordinated sell-off in the big banks, miners and big-name retailers. And for now, perhaps investors looking for quick gains would do well to heed the last part of the saying. In the nine times the ASX has fallen in May since 2000 it has gone even further into the red in June for five of those years, and recovered some ground in only four years. And the trend has grown more negative of late - in the last seven years, five have seen the market trade in the red in June, with an average drop of 4.2 per cent. Tax-selling can keep stocks suppressed in June, said Argonaut executive director of corporate stockbroking James McGlew. This is particularly the case with illiquid small-caps. But this can also be a fantastic buying opportunity for investors willing to bear some short-term turbulence, he said. "This is the time of year when the herd mentality does start to show," McGlew said. You've got to be aware of that, and of which sectors benefit from that." Here's more Where to in June? Some traders are tipping a rebound. Photo: Louie Douvis 2:17pm on 31 May 2017 Seek shares have dropped 1.6 per cent after Citi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell and cut its price target from $16.20 to $15.30 because of the impact the end of the housing boom would have on job listing volumes. It also cited weakness in Seek's Asian divisions and overexposure locally as reasons for the ratings cut.  The shares have declined 3.6 per cent over the last three days, falling to $16.89.  Citi says there has been rapid growth in ads for construction, trade, manufacturing and related jobs since 2014 even as the unemployment rate remained flat, but that those jobs are set to fall away following the peak of the housing market. Moves by regulators to tighten lending standards appear to have successfully cooled the runaway housing market, with property prices falling 1.1 per cent in May and apartment building approvals down 26 per cent over the past 12 months.  Citi predicts housing construction starts will fall by a quarter over the next two years and that job ad growth will fall to 1.5 per cent a year in 2018 and 2019, after growing at 10 per cent between 2014 and 2017.  While job ad numbers are usually connected to the unemployment rate, Citi told clients in a research note that half the outperformance of Seek was because of the housing construction boom and employee turnover in that industry.  "Even just a modest pullback in churn rates could lead to a large decline in the number of job ads, even if the change in the total number of people employed in the industry is negligible," analysts wrote.  1:53pm on 31 May 2017 Shares in iron ore miners have turned south as Chinese futures in the bulk commodity resume their selloff following a two-day holiday. Fortescue is now down 0.6 per cent after earlier trading more than 1 per cent higher, while Rio Tinto has dropped 1.3 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures have slid 3.3 per cent to 436.5 yuan ($US64), on track for a fifth session in the red. Spot iron ore is at $US58.50 a tonne, close to its lowest since October. Analysts have been noting that while iron ore prices are falling, steel is trading close to five-year highs. This comes as Platts reports that Chinese gross steel margins for exported steel rebar has touched a 2017 high – nearly 80 per cent higher than lows touched on April 13. "The rise in steel mill profitability, which mostly reflects weaker iron ore and coking coal prices, should give way to stronger steel output and iron ore demand in coming weeks," says CBA analyst Vivek Dhar. 1:31pm on 31 May 2017 The slump in consumer spending is expected to continue throughout the year as a major headwind for retailers across the country. In a note - 'What is going on in Australia's retail sector? - CBA blames weak wages growth as the single biggest factor weighing on the sector as households devote a greater portion of their wallet to health, utilities and education. "Consumers have a fine amount of disposable income and even with the assistance of a falling savings rate, record low wages growth has weighed significantly on the discretionary parts of retail trade," senior economist Gareth Aird said. "Soft total retail trade growth is largely down to a lack of spending growth on consumer durables and clothing." Demand for clothing and other discretionary goods has been weak for the past two years, as seen in falling department store sales and the collapse of a string of apparel retailers. Herringbone, Marcs and David Lawrence, Pumpkin Patch, Rhodes and Beckett are among a recent spate of largely high-end clothing retailers to have fallen into voluntary administration. Department store chain Myer has been warning "challenging trading conditions" continue to hurt its sales. The market value of retailers on the ASX have also come under pressure as investors sell down retail stocks following sales warnings and profit downgrades. Online giant Amazon's impending arrival in Australia will also put more pressure on retailers to sacrifice more profits for lower prices. Myer shares are at 86 cents, very close to all-time lows hit earlier this week, while JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman have suffered sell-downs largely linked to the Amazon threat. CBA also warned that the effectiveness of lower interest rates is close to being exhausted and only a lift in wages' growth will lead to an increase in retail spending. "Given the significant amount of slack in the labour market we don't see that happening in 2017 and we therefore conclude that the retail trade sector, in particular the discretionary parts of retail trade, will continue to be under pressure throughout the year," Aird said.  1:04pm on 31 May 2017 When auction clearance rates fall to around 65 per cent in Sydney, a housing downturn will be official, property analyst SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher says. Christopher, who correctly called the start of the current housing boom in 2012, said that when Sydney auction clearance rates - one of the key measures of housing market performance - hit the mid-60 per cent level and clearances in Melbourne fall to the high 60 per cent level, then "a new downturn can be called." The preliminary auction clearance rate for Sydney last week was 76.2 per cent while Melbourne was on 77.3 per cent, according to Corelogic. Both were higher than the same period a year ago. "We do believe we are getting close to a top and perhaps the major banks passing on the bank levy might just be the point which creates a trigger for a slowdown. We will wait and see," Christopher said. He also said a downturn could be closer after observing a rise in unreported auctions in 2017 against the bumper level of 2015. Keep an eye on auction clearance rates.  Back to top 12:39pm on 31 May 2017 The reactions to Altiar Asset Management's shock decision, taken by chairman and investment officer Philip Parker, to sell its equities fund an return the money to investors continues to be a key topic of discussion among Australia's investment professionals. The warning issued by Parker, which in large part rested on his concerns about the overheated property market, has been largely dismissed by senior property industry executives.

Joe Aston writes in Rear Window on "what has to have been the greatest money pit in Australian corporate history": In good news for investors in Network Ten, the free-to-air broadcaster is having a good week so far, closing at 19¢, off its Friday low of 17¢. Everything's relative, right? Remember this is after the 1-for-10 consolidation of Ten shares in January 2016. So when WIN proprietor Bruce Gordon was buying millions of these last decade for $2.58 a pop, he was effectively paying nearly $26 in a like-for-like comparison to the scrip you could pick up today for less than a silver coin. According to an ASX filing of July 2006, Gordon-related entities owned 48.8 million Ten shares, worth $126.2 million. If he'd done nothing since, he'd now own 4.88 million shares worth a princely $927,200. But instead he kept buying and buying and buying, including newly-issued capital. Gordon now owns 55.5 million post-consolidation Ten shares, worth $10.4 million. Yep, that's $9.5 million for, in effect, half a billion of shares. No wonder he catches the bus to Wollongong.  Chairman of archrival Seven, Kerry Stokes, quietly amassed a stake in late 2012 worth around $40 million. According to Ten's 2016 annual report, Stokes' Network Investments had 11.5 million shares as at October, now worth $2.2 million, which wouldn't buy you a bedsit in Darling Point.  Foxtel's $77 million placement just 18 months ago is now worth $9.75 million – which isn't inconsistent with the direction of Foxtel's own value to News Corp and Telstra. News co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and then Consolidated Media chair James Packer paid around $130 million each (before the multiple raisings) at $1.50 (or, in effect, $15) in 2010 for a combined 14.9 per cent position now worth just $10.6 million And having sunk near enough to $200 million into Ten since 2011, Gina Rinehart's 8.2 per cent stake is now worth $5.8 million.  Read the full piece on the AFR. The biggest shareholder of Ten Network is Bruce Gordon, with 15 per cent of shares. He also owns regional broadcaster WIN.  Photo: Sylvia Liber 11:41am on 31 May 2017 One of the nation's biggest mutual lenders has cut interest-only loans in half and hiked interest rates by 40 basis points, heralding a tough new phase in attempts to cut back on risky borrowing. It means borrowers will have to take out two loans for a single property – a minimum principal and interest loan and a maximum interest-only. Teachers Mutual Bank, which includes UniBank and Firefighters Mutual Bank, is requiring a minimum of 50 per cent principal and interest for all home loans, which means the maximum interest-only is also 50 per cent. A new borrower seeking $300,000 will have two loans – a minimum of $150,000 on principal and interest and a maximum of $150,000 on interest-only. In addition, borrowers cannot draw down any cash from any loan where part of the total borrowing is interest-only and scrutiny of ability to pay has been toughened. It comes as latest APRA numbers reveal that interest-only loans still account for more than 36 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter, down from 37.5 per cent previously. APRA issued an order at the end of March requiring banks to cut interest-only loans to 30 per cent of new residential lending. Since then most lenders have increased minimum deposits to at least 20 per cent, raised interest rates, toughened scrutiny of borrowers' ability to pay and banned overseas' lenders. Here's more at the AFR Banks are cracking down on interest-only loans. Photo: Supplied. 11:11am on 31 May 2017 Growth in China's manufacturing sector in May kept pace with the previous month, an official survey shows, beating expectations in a reassuring sign the world's second-biggest economy is not losing too much steam after a solid first quarter performance. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in May, compared with the previous month's 51.2 and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Continuing momentum gives policy makers room to rein in increased leverage and financial risks. Analysts last month upgraded forecasts for China's economic growth this year after an unexpected pick-up to 6.9 per cent in the first quarter. The data has put a bit of a spring into the Australian market, with both shares and the Aussie rising to the day's highs (albeit not a huge gain). 10:50am on 31 May 2017 Australia's yield advantage over the US is shrinking fast, which has stirred the Aussie dollar bears, but ANZ head of FX exchange Daniel Been notes that rate differentials are only one driver of the currency. The 10-year yield spread has narrowed to just 18 basis points, and last week even fell to just 16 basis points, the lowest in 16 years. The last time the yield gap was at these levels, the Aussie was fetching less than US50¢, but Been doesn't believe that the currency will fall below even US70¢, pointing out that when the spread was negative in 1998 the Aussie was 10¢ higher than in 2001. "This suggests that the absolute level of yield was not the only important factor for the AUD, even when it was very narrow," Been says, adding that even when you include changes in the terms of trade it doesn't tell the whole story. Instead, forex traders should include risk factors and the US dollar index to explain the performance of currencies such as the Aussie. As examples of risk driving market performance in 2001, Been cites the tech bubble bursting and the Enron scandal The subsequent rally in the US dollar was on its own worth about 5 cents of underperformance in the Aussie, he has calculated. So what does that mean for today? Been says it's much more helpful to look at the Aussie through this broader frame, which makes the situation for the currency look far less dire on a number of fronts. Here are a few reasons why he believes the Aussie isn't headed for 2001 levels: The terms of trade are significantly stronger than it was in 2000. In fact China was not even a part of the WTO last time the spread was at this level; The risk premium is already negative, implying the negative effect of a tighter spread is already integrated into the markets expectations for the AUD; The probability of a significant deterioration in risk appetite remains lower than it did in 2001, at least in the near term As such, Been doesn't believe that the fall in the interest rate spread is about to drive a slump in the AUD, or that the AUD at current levels is fundamentally misaligned with the level of rates given the broader environment. Quite the contrary, Been says the recent improvement in the current account should dampen the negative impact of the narrow rate differential, as the Australian economy's funding need has shrunk significantly.  "We think that the biggest risk to the AUD is ultimately going to be a sharp deterioration in risk appetite, rather than the narrowing in spreads, however we continue to think that, at least over the next 12 months, this remains a tail risk," Been says. "Until this kind of risk event can become integrated into a central scenario rather than a tail, we think that the AUD will remain stable above US70¢." Back to top 10:37am on 31 May 2017 Shares have opened fairly flat, with some buying in the oversold retail sector offset by drops in energy stocks. The ASX is down 0.1 per cent at 5714.2, putting it on track for a loss of 3.5 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market mayhem of January last year. "Sentiment on Australian markets today could be influenced by how China's steel and iron ore markets perform when trading gets under way after a two-day holiday," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "Prices were sliding at the end of last week and sentiment will not be helped if strong downward momentum continues today." Spooner added that investors will be hoping that today's release of China's manufacturing PMI can also hold the line after a softer read in April, which showed a decline in employment conditions. Blue chips are all over the shop, with the big banks trading flat to slightly higher, BHP down 0.2 per cent but Rio up 0.1 per cent and Fortescue gaining 1.25 per cent. One of the biggest winners is Aristocrat Leisure, up another 3.1 per cent as the pokies maker moves from strength to strength. Market dogs in the retail sector are catching some relief, with Myer gaining 1.8 per cent and Super Retail up 1.3 per cent after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks to 'neutral'. 9:53am on 31 May 2017 SPONSORED POST The ASX's worst month since January 2016 will soon be in the rearview mirrow, and IG strategist Chris Weston wonders whether June has anything better in store: For some the idea of turning the page and closing what has been a fairly bleak month to be long the Aussie equity market will be welcomed. That being said, being long certain industrial and telco names has seen strong outperformance in the portfolio. What won't be welcomed is the idea that June is actually the worst month to be long or tracking the Aussie equity market, with the average loss over the past decade at 2.2%. We have seen the past four months of June down by an average of 3.1% and while past performance obvious doesn't predict future returns it is a consideration. Certainly, something to think about and the technical set-up on the ASX 200 is interesting, with the bulls happy to defend the 5775/77 level yesterday which we can see from the daily chart seems a quite pivotal support level representing swing lows in March and May. A break of this level and we should be talking sub-5600, but for now, we are watching to see if the bulls can build on the platform set yesterday. Turning to Asia and it will be interesting to watch China come back on line today after its two-day holiday. Of course, while the spot iron ore market has been open (as price is fixed in Singapore), we get the re-open of the Dalian iron ore and steel futures exchanges today and who knows where that will trade. The market will keep a beady eye on official manufacturing and services PMI data (at 11:00 AEST) for further signs of an economic downturn and we should expect a very modest slowdown in the pace of expansion here, with the manufacturing PMI data expected in at 51. Whether we are talking copper or AUD, the market hasn't been overly sensitive to this print of late, but that could change if the data comes in far lower or higher than forecast. Again, the prospect of the latter materialising seems very low.

"New Zealand's financial system remains sound and the risks facing the system have reduced in the past six months," Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler said in the bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Report on Wednesday in Wellington. Still, he warned that global uncertainty remains elevated and that New Zealand would be vulnerable if a sharp reversal in risk sentiment drove up borrowing costs for banks. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly. Wheeler has cut his benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent to spur weak general inflation, requiring him to introduce lending restrictions in an attempt to curb housing demand. He said today that those restrictions have caused house-price growth to slow over the past eight months. However, "house prices remain elevated relative to incomes and rents, and any resurgence would be of concern", Wheeler said. A recovery in dairy prices over the past year had reduced risks faced by the dairy sector, though some parts of carry excessive debt and remain vulnerable, the RBNZ said. New Zealand's banking system "maintains strong capital and funding buffers, and profitability remains robust", the central bank said. Still, banks had increased reliance on offshore funding for credit growth and remain exposed to a shift in global sentiment. "A sharp reversal in risk sentiment could lead to higher funding costs for New Zealand banks and an increase in domestic borrowing costs," the RBNZ said. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly.  9:44am on 31 May 2017 Here are the overnight market highlights: SPI futures down 4 points to 5718 AUD +0.4% to 74.66 US cents (Overnight range: 74.16-74.69) On Wall St, Dow -0.2%, S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq -0.1% In New York, BHP +0.4%, Rio +0.8% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.5%, FTSE -0.3%, CAC -0.5%, DAX -0.2% Spot gold -0.4% to $US1262.95 an ounce Brent crude -0.9% to $US51.82 a barrel Iron ore unchanged at $US58.50 a tonne Dalian exchange closed LME aluminium -1.3% to $US1926 a tonne LME copper little changed at $US5656 a tonne 10-year bond yield: US 2.21%, Germany 0.29%, Australia 2.39% Plus a few analyst recommendation changes: Henderson Group (HGGDA): New buy at UBS, PT $35.25; New market perform at KBW, PT $32 Myer Holdings (MYR): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $0.82 Seek (SEK): Cut to sell at Citi Super Retail (SUL): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $7.56 What to watch today: April private sector credit; China May manufacturing PMI, non manufacturing PMI; Japan April industrial production, housing starts; Euro zone April unemployment rate; Fed Beige Book And not to forget, Orica is trading ex-dividend. 9:37am on 31 May 2017 The British pound came under pressure overnight after a new poll found that PM Theresa May's Conservative Party risks falling short of an overall majority in next month's national election. The pound fell to $US1.2791, near a one-month low of $US1.2775 touched on Friday. The pound also slipped to 0.8738 pound per euro, near Friday's eight-week low of 0.8750, while the Aussie strengthened about 0.5 per cent to 58.3 pence. New constituency-by-constituency modelling by YouGov showed the Conservative Party might lose 20 of the 330 seats it holds while the opposition Labour Party could gain nearly 30 seats.

The US dollar fell to two-week lows against the safe-haven yen as investors turned cautious amid political worries in Europe as well as weaker stock and commodity markets after a long US holiday weekend. Worries that US political stalemate due to investigations into President Donald Trump's ties with Russia could hamper progress on tax cuts and other stimulus measures from Washington has been undermining the dollar. The dollar fell to near two-week low of 110.665 yen and last traded at 110.85 yen, while the Aussie lifted to US74.61¢. The US dollar index dipped to 97.396, around the levels it was trading at before Trump was elected in November.

We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. Have a good evening. 4:26pm on 31 May 2017 Shares have closed slightly higher, thanks to some buying in oversold sectors such as banks and retail, but overall it was a dismal month for equity investors. The ASX ended the session up 0.1 per cent at 5724.6 but was down 3.4 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market meltdown of January 2016 and biggest May drop since 2013. NAB's 1.3 per cent gain was the standout among the big four today, which otherwise just edged higher. Aristocrat Leisure was another big winner of the day, rising 3.8 per cent. CSL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index, falling 1.8 per cent, followed by a 2.9 per cent drop in Origin Energy. A dip in iron ore prices this week and headlines regarding the stockpiles of ore waiting in Chinese ports weighed on the big miners. Resource giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto slumped 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. With the iron ore price trading flat at $US58.50 a tonne, Fortescue Metals bucked the trend and closed up 1.3 per cent.  Retail stocks Myer and Super Retail Group received some buying support, after Credit Suisse announced the un-loved sector might be oversold in those instances. The bank upgraded both stocks to "neutral" and the stocks jumped 2.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.  Weighing heaviest on the market over the month was a steep 9.2 per cent fall in the financials sector, due to heavy selling in the big banks. 3:59pm on 31 May 2017 Bitcoin's rollercoaster ride over the past week has cryptocurrency sceptics feeling vindicated. Bitcoin is down 1.5 per cent at $2216 in Asian trade, nearly 20 per cent below its record high of $US2798.97 hit last week. The digital currency's more than 100 per cent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $US1000 for the first time. By Valentine's Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $US500. Then it absolutely exploded, jumping more than $US1400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival into the mainstream of blockchain, the coin's underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient. But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $US300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $US600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 per cent the next day. 3:35pm on 31 May 2017 Hong Kong's private home prices hit a record high for the sixth month in a row in April, reflecting a market fervour that the authorities are eager to tame. The Asian financial hub is one of the least affordable places on earth, where a nano-apartment of less than 20 square metres can cost as much as $US500,000. The dearth of supply, low interest rates, and the flow of capital from mainland China pushed prices up over 137 per cent since the financial crisis in 2008. In April, home prices rose 2.12 per cent from the previous month, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. The figure, at 327.4, surged nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. The latest index does not reflect the latest mortgage tightening measures announced by the city's de facto central bank earlier in May. "If property prices keep breaking records in the next month or two, I expect the government to introduce new cooling measures," said property consultancy Knight Frank's Senior Director Thomas Lam. He expects prices to rise 5 to 10 per cent this year. Some of the least affordable property in the world.  3:15pm on 31 May 2017 Domino's audit of its Australian stores in response to allegations of widespread staff underpayments has slipped six months behind schedule. The pizza maker said today that the audit of more than 700 franchised and corporate stores is taking longer than anticipated and that it won't be able to meet its June deadline. The company now expects the audit to be finished within six months. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is also investigating a number of Domino's stores after media reports this year of widespread underpaying of staff and a visa scam at one franchisee-owned store. Shares in Domino's are down 1.4 per cent at $57.57, taking this week's losses to more than 6 per cent. Domino's shares have dropped more than 6 per cent this week. Photo: Kate Leith Back to top 2:49pm on 31 May 2017 Investors hoping for a quick rebound in June after May's ASX declines may be disappointed, with history suggesting they shouldn't count on a June recovery. The old adage to 'sell in May and go away' proved prescient in 2017, with the S&P/ASX200 down 3.4 per cent as concern over Australia's housing boom and weak retail spending combined with falling commodity prices to lead to a nasty coordinated sell-off in the big banks, miners and big-name retailers. And for now, perhaps investors looking for quick gains would do well to heed the last part of the saying. In the nine times the ASX has fallen in May since 2000 it has gone even further into the red in June for five of those years, and recovered some ground in only four years. And the trend has grown more negative of late - in the last seven years, five have seen the market trade in the red in June, with an average drop of 4.2 per cent. Tax-selling can keep stocks suppressed in June, said Argonaut executive director of corporate stockbroking James McGlew. This is particularly the case with illiquid small-caps. But this can also be a fantastic buying opportunity for investors willing to bear some short-term turbulence, he said. "This is the time of year when the herd mentality does start to show," McGlew said. You've got to be aware of that, and of which sectors benefit from that." Here's more Where to in June? Some traders are tipping a rebound. Photo: Louie Douvis 2:17pm on 31 May 2017 Seek shares have dropped 1.6 per cent after Citi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell and cut its price target from $16.20 to $15.30 because of the impact the end of the housing boom would have on job listing volumes. It also cited weakness in Seek's Asian divisions and overexposure locally as reasons for the ratings cut.  The shares have declined 3.6 per cent over the last three days, falling to $16.89.  Citi says there has been rapid growth in ads for construction, trade, manufacturing and related jobs since 2014 even as the unemployment rate remained flat, but that those jobs are set to fall away following the peak of the housing market. Moves by regulators to tighten lending standards appear to have successfully cooled the runaway housing market, with property prices falling 1.1 per cent in May and apartment building approvals down 26 per cent over the past 12 months.  Citi predicts housing construction starts will fall by a quarter over the next two years and that job ad growth will fall to 1.5 per cent a year in 2018 and 2019, after growing at 10 per cent between 2014 and 2017.  While job ad numbers are usually connected to the unemployment rate, Citi told clients in a research note that half the outperformance of Seek was because of the housing construction boom and employee turnover in that industry.  "Even just a modest pullback in churn rates could lead to a large decline in the number of job ads, even if the change in the total number of people employed in the industry is negligible," analysts wrote.  1:53pm on 31 May 2017 Shares in iron ore miners have turned south as Chinese futures in the bulk commodity resume their selloff following a two-day holiday. Fortescue is now down 0.6 per cent after earlier trading more than 1 per cent higher, while Rio Tinto has dropped 1.3 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures have slid 3.3 per cent to 436.5 yuan ($US64), on track for a fifth session in the red. Spot iron ore is at $US58.50 a tonne, close to its lowest since October. Analysts have been noting that while iron ore prices are falling, steel is trading close to five-year highs. This comes as Platts reports that Chinese gross steel margins for exported steel rebar has touched a 2017 high – nearly 80 per cent higher than lows touched on April 13. "The rise in steel mill profitability, which mostly reflects weaker iron ore and coking coal prices, should give way to stronger steel output and iron ore demand in coming weeks," says CBA analyst Vivek Dhar. 1:31pm on 31 May 2017 The slump in consumer spending is expected to continue throughout the year as a major headwind for retailers across the country. In a note - 'What is going on in Australia's retail sector? - CBA blames weak wages growth as the single biggest factor weighing on the sector as households devote a greater portion of their wallet to health, utilities and education. "Consumers have a fine amount of disposable income and even with the assistance of a falling savings rate, record low wages growth has weighed significantly on the discretionary parts of retail trade," senior economist Gareth Aird said. "Soft total retail trade growth is largely down to a lack of spending growth on consumer durables and clothing." Demand for clothing and other discretionary goods has been weak for the past two years, as seen in falling department store sales and the collapse of a string of apparel retailers. Herringbone, Marcs and David Lawrence, Pumpkin Patch, Rhodes and Beckett are among a recent spate of largely high-end clothing retailers to have fallen into voluntary administration. Department store chain Myer has been warning "challenging trading conditions" continue to hurt its sales. The market value of retailers on the ASX have also come under pressure as investors sell down retail stocks following sales warnings and profit downgrades. Online giant Amazon's impending arrival in Australia will also put more pressure on retailers to sacrifice more profits for lower prices. Myer shares are at 86 cents, very close to all-time lows hit earlier this week, while JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman have suffered sell-downs largely linked to the Amazon threat. CBA also warned that the effectiveness of lower interest rates is close to being exhausted and only a lift in wages' growth will lead to an increase in retail spending. "Given the significant amount of slack in the labour market we don't see that happening in 2017 and we therefore conclude that the retail trade sector, in particular the discretionary parts of retail trade, will continue to be under pressure throughout the year," Aird said.  1:04pm on 31 May 2017 When auction clearance rates fall to around 65 per cent in Sydney, a housing downturn will be official, property analyst SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher says. Christopher, who correctly called the start of the current housing boom in 2012, said that when Sydney auction clearance rates - one of the key measures of housing market performance - hit the mid-60 per cent level and clearances in Melbourne fall to the high 60 per cent level, then "a new downturn can be called." The preliminary auction clearance rate for Sydney last week was 76.2 per cent while Melbourne was on 77.3 per cent, according to Corelogic. Both were higher than the same period a year ago. "We do believe we are getting close to a top and perhaps the major banks passing on the bank levy might just be the point which creates a trigger for a slowdown. We will wait and see," Christopher said. He also said a downturn could be closer after observing a rise in unreported auctions in 2017 against the bumper level of 2015. Keep an eye on auction clearance rates.  Back to top 12:39pm on 31 May 2017 The reactions to Altiar Asset Management's shock decision, taken by chairman and investment officer Philip Parker, to sell its equities fund an return the money to investors continues to be a key topic of discussion among Australia's investment professionals. The warning issued by Parker, which in large part rested on his concerns about the overheated property market, has been largely dismissed by senior property industry executives.

Joe Aston writes in Rear Window on "what has to have been the greatest money pit in Australian corporate history": In good news for investors in Network Ten, the free-to-air broadcaster is having a good week so far, closing at 19¢, off its Friday low of 17¢. Everything's relative, right? Remember this is after the 1-for-10 consolidation of Ten shares in January 2016. So when WIN proprietor Bruce Gordon was buying millions of these last decade for $2.58 a pop, he was effectively paying nearly $26 in a like-for-like comparison to the scrip you could pick up today for less than a silver coin. According to an ASX filing of July 2006, Gordon-related entities owned 48.8 million Ten shares, worth $126.2 million. If he'd done nothing since, he'd now own 4.88 million shares worth a princely $927,200. But instead he kept buying and buying and buying, including newly-issued capital. Gordon now owns 55.5 million post-consolidation Ten shares, worth $10.4 million. Yep, that's $9.5 million for, in effect, half a billion of shares. No wonder he catches the bus to Wollongong.  Chairman of archrival Seven, Kerry Stokes, quietly amassed a stake in late 2012 worth around $40 million. According to Ten's 2016 annual report, Stokes' Network Investments had 11.5 million shares as at October, now worth $2.2 million, which wouldn't buy you a bedsit in Darling Point.  Foxtel's $77 million placement just 18 months ago is now worth $9.75 million – which isn't inconsistent with the direction of Foxtel's own value to News Corp and Telstra. News co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and then Consolidated Media chair James Packer paid around $130 million each (before the multiple raisings) at $1.50 (or, in effect, $15) in 2010 for a combined 14.9 per cent position now worth just $10.6 million And having sunk near enough to $200 million into Ten since 2011, Gina Rinehart's 8.2 per cent stake is now worth $5.8 million.  Read the full piece on the AFR. The biggest shareholder of Ten Network is Bruce Gordon, with 15 per cent of shares. He also owns regional broadcaster WIN.  Photo: Sylvia Liber 11:41am on 31 May 2017 One of the nation's biggest mutual lenders has cut interest-only loans in half and hiked interest rates by 40 basis points, heralding a tough new phase in attempts to cut back on risky borrowing. It means borrowers will have to take out two loans for a single property – a minimum principal and interest loan and a maximum interest-only. Teachers Mutual Bank, which includes UniBank and Firefighters Mutual Bank, is requiring a minimum of 50 per cent principal and interest for all home loans, which means the maximum interest-only is also 50 per cent. A new borrower seeking $300,000 will have two loans – a minimum of $150,000 on principal and interest and a maximum of $150,000 on interest-only. In addition, borrowers cannot draw down any cash from any loan where part of the total borrowing is interest-only and scrutiny of ability to pay has been toughened. It comes as latest APRA numbers reveal that interest-only loans still account for more than 36 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter, down from 37.5 per cent previously. APRA issued an order at the end of March requiring banks to cut interest-only loans to 30 per cent of new residential lending. Since then most lenders have increased minimum deposits to at least 20 per cent, raised interest rates, toughened scrutiny of borrowers' ability to pay and banned overseas' lenders. Here's more at the AFR Banks are cracking down on interest-only loans. Photo: Supplied. 11:11am on 31 May 2017 Growth in China's manufacturing sector in May kept pace with the previous month, an official survey shows, beating expectations in a reassuring sign the world's second-biggest economy is not losing too much steam after a solid first quarter performance. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in May, compared with the previous month's 51.2 and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Continuing momentum gives policy makers room to rein in increased leverage and financial risks. Analysts last month upgraded forecasts for China's economic growth this year after an unexpected pick-up to 6.9 per cent in the first quarter. The data has put a bit of a spring into the Australian market, with both shares and the Aussie rising to the day's highs (albeit not a huge gain). 10:50am on 31 May 2017 Australia's yield advantage over the US is shrinking fast, which has stirred the Aussie dollar bears, but ANZ head of FX exchange Daniel Been notes that rate differentials are only one driver of the currency. The 10-year yield spread has narrowed to just 18 basis points, and last week even fell to just 16 basis points, the lowest in 16 years. The last time the yield gap was at these levels, the Aussie was fetching less than US50¢, but Been doesn't believe that the currency will fall below even US70¢, pointing out that when the spread was negative in 1998 the Aussie was 10¢ higher than in 2001. "This suggests that the absolute level of yield was not the only important factor for the AUD, even when it was very narrow," Been says, adding that even when you include changes in the terms of trade it doesn't tell the whole story. Instead, forex traders should include risk factors and the US dollar index to explain the performance of currencies such as the Aussie. As examples of risk driving market performance in 2001, Been cites the tech bubble bursting and the Enron scandal The subsequent rally in the US dollar was on its own worth about 5 cents of underperformance in the Aussie, he has calculated. So what does that mean for today? Been says it's much more helpful to look at the Aussie through this broader frame, which makes the situation for the currency look far less dire on a number of fronts. Here are a few reasons why he believes the Aussie isn't headed for 2001 levels: The terms of trade are significantly stronger than it was in 2000. In fact China was not even a part of the WTO last time the spread was at this level; The risk premium is already negative, implying the negative effect of a tighter spread is already integrated into the markets expectations for the AUD; The probability of a significant deterioration in risk appetite remains lower than it did in 2001, at least in the near term As such, Been doesn't believe that the fall in the interest rate spread is about to drive a slump in the AUD, or that the AUD at current levels is fundamentally misaligned with the level of rates given the broader environment. Quite the contrary, Been says the recent improvement in the current account should dampen the negative impact of the narrow rate differential, as the Australian economy's funding need has shrunk significantly.  "We think that the biggest risk to the AUD is ultimately going to be a sharp deterioration in risk appetite, rather than the narrowing in spreads, however we continue to think that, at least over the next 12 months, this remains a tail risk," Been says. "Until this kind of risk event can become integrated into a central scenario rather than a tail, we think that the AUD will remain stable above US70¢." Back to top 10:37am on 31 May 2017 Shares have opened fairly flat, with some buying in the oversold retail sector offset by drops in energy stocks. The ASX is down 0.1 per cent at 5714.2, putting it on track for a loss of 3.5 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market mayhem of January last year. "Sentiment on Australian markets today could be influenced by how China's steel and iron ore markets perform when trading gets under way after a two-day holiday," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "Prices were sliding at the end of last week and sentiment will not be helped if strong downward momentum continues today." Spooner added that investors will be hoping that today's release of China's manufacturing PMI can also hold the line after a softer read in April, which showed a decline in employment conditions. Blue chips are all over the shop, with the big banks trading flat to slightly higher, BHP down 0.2 per cent but Rio up 0.1 per cent and Fortescue gaining 1.25 per cent. One of the biggest winners is Aristocrat Leisure, up another 3.1 per cent as the pokies maker moves from strength to strength. Market dogs in the retail sector are catching some relief, with Myer gaining 1.8 per cent and Super Retail up 1.3 per cent after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks to 'neutral'. 9:53am on 31 May 2017 SPONSORED POST The ASX's worst month since January 2016 will soon be in the rearview mirrow, and IG strategist Chris Weston wonders whether June has anything better in store: For some the idea of turning the page and closing what has been a fairly bleak month to be long the Aussie equity market will be welcomed. That being said, being long certain industrial and telco names has seen strong outperformance in the portfolio. What won't be welcomed is the idea that June is actually the worst month to be long or tracking the Aussie equity market, with the average loss over the past decade at 2.2%. We have seen the past four months of June down by an average of 3.1% and while past performance obvious doesn't predict future returns it is a consideration. Certainly, something to think about and the technical set-up on the ASX 200 is interesting, with the bulls happy to defend the 5775/77 level yesterday which we can see from the daily chart seems a quite pivotal support level representing swing lows in March and May. A break of this level and we should be talking sub-5600, but for now, we are watching to see if the bulls can build on the platform set yesterday. Turning to Asia and it will be interesting to watch China come back on line today after its two-day holiday. Of course, while the spot iron ore market has been open (as price is fixed in Singapore), we get the re-open of the Dalian iron ore and steel futures exchanges today and who knows where that will trade. The market will keep a beady eye on official manufacturing and services PMI data (at 11:00 AEST) for further signs of an economic downturn and we should expect a very modest slowdown in the pace of expansion here, with the manufacturing PMI data expected in at 51. Whether we are talking copper or AUD, the market hasn't been overly sensitive to this print of late, but that could change if the data comes in far lower or higher than forecast. Again, the prospect of the latter materialising seems very low.

"New Zealand's financial system remains sound and the risks facing the system have reduced in the past six months," Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler said in the bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Report on Wednesday in Wellington. Still, he warned that global uncertainty remains elevated and that New Zealand would be vulnerable if a sharp reversal in risk sentiment drove up borrowing costs for banks. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly. Wheeler has cut his benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent to spur weak general inflation, requiring him to introduce lending restrictions in an attempt to curb housing demand. He said today that those restrictions have caused house-price growth to slow over the past eight months. However, "house prices remain elevated relative to incomes and rents, and any resurgence would be of concern", Wheeler said. A recovery in dairy prices over the past year had reduced risks faced by the dairy sector, though some parts of carry excessive debt and remain vulnerable, the RBNZ said. New Zealand's banking system "maintains strong capital and funding buffers, and profitability remains robust", the central bank said. Still, banks had increased reliance on offshore funding for credit growth and remain exposed to a shift in global sentiment. "A sharp reversal in risk sentiment could lead to higher funding costs for New Zealand banks and an increase in domestic borrowing costs," the RBNZ said. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly.  9:44am on 31 May 2017 Here are the overnight market highlights: SPI futures down 4 points to 5718 AUD +0.4% to 74.66 US cents (Overnight range: 74.16-74.69) On Wall St, Dow -0.2%, S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq -0.1% In New York, BHP +0.4%, Rio +0.8% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.5%, FTSE -0.3%, CAC -0.5%, DAX -0.2% Spot gold -0.4% to $US1262.95 an ounce Brent crude -0.9% to $US51.82 a barrel Iron ore unchanged at $US58.50 a tonne Dalian exchange closed LME aluminium -1.3% to $US1926 a tonne LME copper little changed at $US5656 a tonne 10-year bond yield: US 2.21%, Germany 0.29%, Australia 2.39% Plus a few analyst recommendation changes: Henderson Group (HGGDA): New buy at UBS, PT $35.25; New market perform at KBW, PT $32 Myer Holdings (MYR): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $0.82 Seek (SEK): Cut to sell at Citi Super Retail (SUL): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $7.56 What to watch today: April private sector credit; China May manufacturing PMI, non manufacturing PMI; Japan April industrial production, housing starts; Euro zone April unemployment rate; Fed Beige Book And not to forget, Orica is trading ex-dividend. 9:37am on 31 May 2017 The British pound came under pressure overnight after a new poll found that PM Theresa May's Conservative Party risks falling short of an overall majority in next month's national election. The pound fell to $US1.2791, near a one-month low of $US1.2775 touched on Friday. The pound also slipped to 0.8738 pound per euro, near Friday's eight-week low of 0.8750, while the Aussie strengthened about 0.5 per cent to 58.3 pence.

The US dollar fell to two-week lows against the safe-haven yen as investors turned cautious amid political worries in Europe as well as weaker stock and commodity markets after a long US holiday weekend. Worries that US political stalemate due to investigations into President Donald Trump's ties with Russia could hamper progress on tax cuts and other stimulus measures from Washington has been undermining the dollar. The dollar fell to near two-week low of 110.665 yen and last traded at 110.85 yen, while the Aussie lifted to US74.61¢. The US dollar index dipped to 97.396, around the levels it was trading at before Trump was elected in November.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint HOBOKEN, N.J. – Even after an online spending spree, it might be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, said he's confident about the company's momentum and there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing at 15 percent per year. Lore has led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, said for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, said research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store."

If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. » Next page...

Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Walmart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Walmart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Walmart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Walmart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Walmart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Walmart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.”    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.”   Most Read Neighbors worried about development next to former Everett dump EVERETT — Two groups of homeowners are asking the Snohomish County hearing… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Noah Haglund 2 charged after scuffle over stolen meat and a stab in the eye MARYSVILLE — A Snohomish woman was indignant that a grocery store manager… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Diana Hefley Anchor Pub hosts nontraditional church services once a month EVERETT — Their beliefs are traditional, but not much else.

A pedestrian passes in front of the new Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle, Wash., on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. Credit: David Ryder/Bloomberg Most Popular Amazon.com Inc.'s shares topped $1,000 for the first time this morning, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York Tuesday, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. "There's a long runway there," he said. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." The Seattle company's $478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world's biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon's this year. Investors put more value in Amazon's web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart's vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world's largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon's momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy's and Sears, which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016. Amazon's rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world's second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show "Shark Tank." "Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share," said Cuban, an Amazon investor. "Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world." --Spencer Soper, Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Digital Retail Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Careers On Campus Site by AREA 17

Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster.

Instead of just delivering goods to your doorstep, drones would drop packages into secure boxes (lockers) that communicate with the drone. The application describes a smorgasbord of technology that could be used to ensure secure drop-off, including geofencing and a blockchain for package tracking and identification. Just like most patent applications, Walmart's "Unmanned Aerial Delivery to Secure Location" is jam-packed with redundant language, ambiguous line drawings, buzz words, and ample legal jargon. Still, the basic premise is clear: a delivery system that includes a robotic vehicle that communicates with a secure locker. While many retailers and logistics providers are scrambling to patent drone delivery systems, bitcoin news site Coindesk points out that this plan stands out because it uses blockchain technology. special report Download the Blockchain Guide You can this executive guide as a PDF (free registration required). Read More We keep hearing how a blockchain -- the secure digital ledger that underpins bitcoin -- will disrupt office work and eliminate the middle man in many industries by shifting the trust from an entity to software. (See: Blockchain explained in plain English for more). In this case, Walmart proposes using blockchains to streamline operations by tracking physical items. Drones would carry packages, and once they come close enough to the delivery box (as defined by geofencing or wireless communication), the box would automatically unlock itself and open robotically. For an added level of security and more precise tracking, blockchain technology could also be included. This could be especially helpful for sensitive or fragile shipments such as food, flowers, and medical samples. According to the patent application: Package tracking by blockchain may include elements including but not limited to location, supply chain transition, authentication of the courier and customer, ambient temperature of the container, temperature of the product if available, acceptable thresholds for ambient temperature of the product, package contents placed in the container system (products & goods), or a combination thereof. This is just one small example of how blockchains could be used for logistics. While the patent application's title and abstract describe a broader drone delivery system, blockchain technology is mentioned 21 times throughout the document.

Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. By: Associated Press | Hoboken | Published: May 31, 2017 12:59 AM The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. You may also like to watch: ”I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. ”It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore’s led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. ”If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. ”Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is ”reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. ”We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. ”We think we got a customer base -those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup helped bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is helping, since people realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook and furniture pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensor track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. ”We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. ”We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about – low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s ”smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. ”We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. ”The assortment is growing fast,” he said. ”But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.”   No Comments.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 79.62 -0.19 -0.24% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 1,006.73 +10.78 +1.08% The world's largest retailer is only the latest to drill down into categories by hiring hundreds of "category specialists" to sort through its offerings. For swimming, for example, Walmart just named Nathan Adrian, an American who won gold in the 2012 Olympic Games and bronze last year, to offer advice on everything from swim caps to goggles.   Adrian comes aboard at a time when Walmart has been aggressively buying up niche websites that specialize in shoes, outdoor gear, and other products to corner the market on specific segments of the online shopping public. “We want to be that place where the shopper can find anything that they need,’’ says Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Walmart U.S. eCommerce, “and that means we need to have specialty experience in every single shopping category.’’ Several retailers have taken steps to boost their expertise at a time when many store chains are struggling to woo shoppers amid increased competition from Amazon and other online sellers: •Target. The mass merchandiser found its own group of experts -- children between the ages of 7 and 14 -- to help shape its Art Class clothing collection, which debuted in January and was tailored to the 86 million teens and 'tweens who comprise Generation Z. •Toys R Us. The toy-selling giant, in revamping its website, will soon feature pages that not only sell car seats and strollers, but will educate new parents about which model or style best fits their needs. •Lowe’s. The nation's second-largest home improvement chain purchased online furniture and knick-knack seller ATG Stores in 2011. Walmart says that it will be hiring hundreds of specialists over the next two months in categories ranging from fishing gear to shoes. They will not only help select items, but have a say in the way that they are priced and displayed online. “The first step is all about the basics,’’ Adrian said in a statement. “I plan to review and expand the products we offer to make sure we have the right items for every type of swimmer, from the toddler learning how to swim . .. to the high school competitive swimmer needing a suit and equipment for training and meets.” To a big-box store chain like Walmart, which sells millions of products ranging from pants to peanut butter, depth of expertise is critical to make the best choices about what to offer in more specialized categories, Hilton says. The company has been on its own buying spree in recent months, starting with the purchase of online marketplace Jet, for $3 billion in August, which, in turn, bought footwear site ShoeBuy. Two months later, Walmart purchased Moosejaw, an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer. And in March, Walmart bought ModCloth, an online seller of women’s clothing and accessories that targets customers looking for full sizes. The sites maintained their same management teams, who were also put in charge of their particular product for Walmart's entire e-commerce network. Mike Sorabella, for instance, ShoeBuy's CEO, oversees footwear for all Walmart-owned sites. "They’re the experts,'' Hilton says. "They have all the brand relationships, so they’re managing footwear across the enterprise . . . This is the way we’re really accelerating that deeper knowledge in those specialty categories.''   Bringing in outsiders who understand a market niche could be a smart move, says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analysis firm, Global Data. "People brought in often have a good external perspective which helps them to identify opportunities that those more involved in the business may not be able to do,'' he says. "Market and customer knowledge are often better which helps decision making around issues like styling and marketing.'' Farla Efros, president of the retail strategic firm HRC Retail Advisory, says that purchasing other sites is a strategic way for a traditional retailer like Walmart to strengthen its online operations. But a chain can specialize in only so many categories.  "Retailers need to differentiate and pick their spots . .  . given the picky consumer,'' Efros says, "but you cannot be experts in everything and they need to pick spots and do so with strong conviction.'' .   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Ryan Matthew Parsons, 30, was arrested Sunday afternoon near the west-side Walmart on charges of interference, trespass after warning, and shoplifting in an amount over $20. Two police officers went to the Walmart off CY Avenue after Parsons, referred to in court documents as a "known shoplifting suspect," left the store on foot. Parsons saw an officer approach and took off, running toward the rear of Walmart. The two Casper Police officers went after Parsons. Meanwhile, an Evansville officer radioed the officers and said Parsons was known to carry knives. Parsons reportedly reached into his pockets several times as he fled, and a Casper officer used his taser to gain control of Parsons before he could jump the fence to Interstate 25. A search of Parsons turned up a set of headphones, an audio cable, a USB charging cable, black carry bag and associated paperwork. Police also found an opened bag of peanut butter cups in Parsons' jacket pocket, and discovered he was wearing three pairs of jogging shorts. Parsons also had an orange Gerber knife in one pocket. Walmart staff knew Parsons to be a shoplifter. He was banned from the store for life in 2010. An employee watched Parsons as he allegedly stole items from the store. Parsons reportedly admitted to stealing from Walmart because he needed money for his niece's birthday present. He was not very coherent, police say, and told officers they were not going to take him to jail. As police drove Parsons to jail, he reportedly said he was trying to get one officer to shoot him by taking his knife out of his shorts. Parsons said he was unable to reach the knife.

Making Change at Walmart said Walmart is not paying employees a living wage, which results in the company's employees needing to rely on government assistance programs to survive. The group said the focus is on low wages, high turnover, and taxpayer waste. A single, full-time Walmart employee working 34 hours a week with 2 kids, still qualifies for Medicaid and food stamps even if they make Walmart's average hourly wage claim of $13.75, according to Making Change at Walmart. The group said it chose to hold the demonstration outside the National Civil Rights Museum because Martin Luther King Jr. worked "50 years ago for the sanitation workers' rights and 50 years later we're taking workers' rights away." "It's costing us $6.2 billion as taxpayers to support a full-time worker at Walmart," one protester said. The group said salary employees at Walmart get 12 weeks of maternity leave and hourly employees do not receive any maternity leave.  "This is exactly what Dr. King would want us to do," one protester said. The group called Walmart "un-American" because of the low wages and benefits. I'm proud to be with folks that want to encourage living wages for our folks out there," State Representative Dwayne Johnson (D-96). "I'm in the state legislature in Nashville, and I go there and say we need to raise the minimum wage and we need to give companies incentives for them to raise the wages." Johnson said when he speaks with businesses about raising the wages, they tell him they can't afford that and it would bankrupt their company.  "I'm proud of this group here and I hope people who hear about this and know about this will be encouraged to contact their elected officials, local, their state officials, and their federal officials, and put pressure on them to do the right thing for our working people out there," Johnson said.  The movement has stopped in 31 cities so far and they said their next stop is Arkansas. The group said it is headed to the shareholders meeting to let Walmart know that workers are not being paid livable wages or working in favorable conditions. "Really contribute more to the economy. With better wages we have a stronger Memphis, stronger Memphis metro area," Thompson said. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News U.S. Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air ECONOMY Wal-Mart works to close gap between itself and Amazon By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO Published May 30, 2017 Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Print HOBOKEN, N.J. –  Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students.

Wal-Mart works to close gap between itself and Amazon World by Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Posted May 30, 2017 9:59 am MDT Last Updated May 30, 2017 at 2:20 pm MDT FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2013, file photo, two Wal-Mart employees walk past a sign in the lobby at the Walmart.com office in San Bruno, Calif. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) HOBOKEN, N.J. – Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 per cent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 per cent in the first quarter, up from 29 per cent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 per cent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 per cent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 per cent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 per cent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered.

The world's largest retailer is only the latest to drill down into categories by hiring hundreds of "category specialists" to sort through its offerings. For swimming, for example, Walmart just named Nathan Adrian, an American who won gold in the 2012 Olympic Games and bronze last year, to offer advice on everything from swim caps to goggles. Adrian comes aboard at a time when Walmart has been aggressively buying up niche websites that specialize in shoes, outdoor gear, and other products to corner the market on specific segments of the online shopping public. “We want to be that place where the shopper can find anything that they need,’’ says Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Walmart U.S. eCommerce, “and that means we need to have specialty experience in every single shopping category.’’ Several retailers have taken steps to boost their expertise at a time when many store chains are struggling to woo shoppers amid increased competition from Amazon and other online sellers: •Target. The mass merchandiser found its own group of experts -- children between the ages of 7 and 14 -- to help shape its Art Class clothing collection, which debuted in January and was tailored to the 86 million teens and 'tweens who comprise Generation Z. •Toys R Us. The toy-selling giant, in revamping its website, will soon feature pages that not only sell car seats and strollers, but will educate new parents about which model or style best fits their needs. •Lowe’s. The nation's second-largest home improvement chain purchased online furniture and knick-knack seller ATG Stores in 2011. Walmart says that it will be hiring hundreds of specialists over the next two months in categories ranging from fishing gear to shoes. They will not only help select items, but have a say in the way that they are priced and displayed online. “The first step is all about the basics,’’ Adrian said in a statement. “I plan to review and expand the products we offer to make sure we have the right items for every type of swimmer, from the toddler learning how to swim . .. to the high school competitive swimmer needing a suit and equipment for training and meets.” To a big-box store chain like Walmart, which sells millions of products ranging from pants to peanut butter, depth of expertise is critical to make the best choices about what to offer in more specialized categories, Hilton says. The company has been on its own buying spree in recent months, starting with the purchase of online marketplace Jet, for $3 billion in August, which, in turn, bought footwear site ShoeBuy. Two months later, Walmart purchased Moosejaw, an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer. And in March, Walmart bought ModCloth, an online seller of women’s clothing and accessories that targets customers looking for full sizes. The sites maintained their same management teams, who were also put in charge of their particular product for Walmart's entire e-commerce network. Mike Sorabella, for instance, ShoeBuy's CEO, oversees footwear for all Walmart-owned sites. "They’re the experts,'' Hilton says. "They have all the brand relationships, so they’re managing footwear across the enterprise . . . This is the way we’re really accelerating that deeper knowledge in those specialty categories.'' Bringing in outsiders who understand a market niche could be a smart move, says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analysis firm, Global Data. "People brought in often have a good external perspective which helps them to identify opportunities that those more involved in the business may not be able to do,'' he says. "Market and customer knowledge are often better which helps decision making around issues like styling and marketing.'' Farla Efros, president of the retail strategic firm HRC Retail Advisory, says that purchasing other sites is a strategic way for a traditional retailer like Walmart to strengthen its online operations. But a chain can specialize in only so many categories. "Retailers need to differentiate and pick their spots . .  . given the picky consumer,'' Efros says, "but you cannot be experts in everything and they need to pick spots and do so with strong conviction.'' . 10 CONNECTTWEET 346 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2siz2X7

Jeff Chiu, File AP Photo National Business May 30, 2017 3:20 PM Wal-Mart works to close gap between itself and Amazon By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO AP Retail Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story HOBOKEN, N.J. Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress."

Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” By various measures, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the second- or third-richest person in the world. Not bad for a tech guy who wanted to sell textbooks online. Alex Wong, Getty Images Advertisement Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 for the first time Tuesday, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York this morning, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” Popular Now How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization How to Set Up a Lean Factory That Works, Part 1 Smart Factories Could Add $500 Billion to Global Economy in 5 Years The Seattle company’s $478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99 Amazon Prime annual subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016.

His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and a judge on the television show “Shark Tank.” “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster.

"But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped US$1,000 for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares hit US$1,001.20 in New York Tuesday, up about 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to US$1,125 a share. Related As Amazon .com Inc continues its Canadian push, retailers are being forced to step up their e-commerce game Amazon is dominating Google in the U.S. voice-activated speaker race with 71% of the market: report “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s US$478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its US$99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 per cent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel US$246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18 percent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show “Shark Tank.” “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.”   Bloomberg News Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Advertisement Continue reading Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. Advertisement Continue reading If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.” ___ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Retail Suggested Stories: Wal-Mart completes $3 billion-plus purchase of Jet.com – Sep 19, 2016 Wal-Mart dumps its version of Amazon Prime for new path – Jan 31, 2017 Wal-Mart keeps working to make inroads against Amazon – Feb 21, 2017 Wal-Mart sees online sales surge, more shoppers at stores – May 18, 2017 Advertisement Load comments Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

"But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Print E–mail Tweet Report Error Rate this This article has not yet been rated.

Wal-Mart‚Äôs acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 per cent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 per cent in the first quarter, up from 29 per cent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 per cent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 per cent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 per cent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 per cent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2013, file photo, two Wal-Mart employees walk past a sign in the lobby at the Walmart.com office in San Bruno, Calif.

Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time. Photo: Richard Drew /Associated Press Amazon shares hit $1,000, showing dominance of e-commerce 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York Tuesday, up about 40 percent from a year ago and more than double the 15 percent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s $478 billion market value is double that of Walmart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 percent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Walmart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Business Channel Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18 percent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show “Shark Tank.” “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.”    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 per cent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 per cent . Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 per cent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 per cent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Editors' Picks Photos Photos Winnipeg Pride Festival ends, police open to consultations Black Graduation Celebration a new way of inspiring young generations Video: Frustrated Mr. Met flips off fans at Citi Field Pulling trucks and lifting boulders: Calgary women train for Strongman competition More on Metronews.ca Most Popular 5 simple ways to help the honey bees Canadian woman Christine Archibald identified as victim in London terror attack Alberta man mowing the lawn during twister takes social media by storm 'Push everyone to be better:' Legacy of Wade Smith to live on as city mourns his death Back to Mobile About About Us Contact Careers RSS Feeds Terms Advertising Terms Terms and Conditions Privacy Code Metronews.ca My Metro Store Contests Metro Panel Special Features FAQ © Copyright Free Daily News Group Inc. 2001-2017 Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy

Spencer Soper Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Bill Gates. Photo Credits : Alamy Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York Tuesday, up about 40 percent from a year ago and more than double the 15 percent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s $478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 percent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18 percent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show “Shark Tank.” “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.” Bloomberg Spencer Soper Topics: Amazon Amazon share price E commerce Cloud Computing Amazon Shares More From Livemint READ MORE Markets likely to consolidate, RBI policy to keep traders busy 22 killed as bus catches fire after collision with truck in Bareilly Markets Live: Sensex, Nifty open lower, Titan shares up 11% First Published: Tue, May 30 2017. 09 39 PM IST Editor's Picks Currency ban: The politics vs the economics Are nationalized banks the walking dead of the Indian banking system? $120 million-plus brand value just numbers for me: Virat Kohli Latest News 22 killed as bus catches fire after collision with truck in Bareilly Markets Live: Sensex, Nifty open lower, Titan shares up 11% Economy must play role in verdicts: Supreme Court The real challenge for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan Rupee hits near three-week high against US dollar Mint On Sunday The best food of Delhi’s state bhawans When parents step in to run schools The defenders of the skies of Roland Garros Beneath the beauty, Mauritius is an archive of human struggle and triumph The elusiveness of silence Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

(AP) — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. Register now to learn how DHS and Commerce are implementing CDM strategies. Advertisement “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Amazon.com Inc., the e-commerce giant that has changed how much of the world shops for books, toilet paper and TVs, has hit yet another milestone. Amazon stock hit $1,001.20 shortly after Tuesday's opening bell, up about 40 percent from a year ago and more than double the 15 percent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad, Bloomberg reported. The $1,000 share price also puts Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of rival Wal-Mart and more than 15 times the size of Target, the Associated Press reported. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. "There’s a long runway there," he told Bloomberg. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." Meanwhile, only 14 other U.S. stocks trade above $1,000 per share, FactSet reported, and the only other tech company in the club is Priceline Group, currently trading around $1,865. Amazon also is more than four times more valuable than those other 14 companies combined, CNBC.com explained. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s Class A shares are currently trading above $990. Amazon has come a long way since its start in 1995, when it mostly sold books. The Seattle company now sells just about anything, from groceries to small appliances, and has been blamed for taking business away from department stores, supermarkets and clothing retailers. “Amazon has split three times since its IPO in 1997. In 1998, it issued a two-for-one stock split. In January 1999, it issued a three-for-one stock split and, in September 1999, it issued a two-for-one split. When Amazon hit $1,000, it's technically the equivalent of a $12,000 share price in today's terms,” CNBC reported. For its part, Amazon's ventures far beyond online retail, from cloud computing to movie making, are raising questions among corporate strategy experts about its focus, Reuters reported. The Seattle-based company wowed Wall Street recently with a 23 percent jump in sales, pushing its shares to an all-time high. But there are concerns that if blockbuster growth stops, investors may come to regard the company more like a conglomerate stock - worth less than the sum of its pieces, Reuters reported. "High growth covers a lot of sins," said Harry Kraemer, a partner at private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners and a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. Investors also put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, Bloomberg reported, citing EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 percent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.

The milestone for the company, which dominates in online commerce and cloud computing, comes as its share price has climbed 40 percent from one year ago. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 on Tuesday morning before falling below the threshold; its 52-week low was $682.12. Investors are pondering how high the stock can climb as the company concentrates on replicating its U.S. success in other markets, Bloomberg News reported. Amazon, headquartered in Seattle, has a $478 billion market value, double that of Walmart Stores Inc., although Walmart sales are expected to have three times Amazon's sales in 2017. Investors value Amazon's web traffic and delivery network over Walmart's retail presence in stores across the country because online spending is expected to grow four times faster than overall retail spending, Bloomberg said. Amazon improved on expectations in April when it posted revenue of $35.7 billion, starting the upward climb of the stock price. Sales increased 23 percent and business sales by amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, increased 42 percent in the first quarter of 2017. With its market value, Amazon is larger company than the other 14 U.S. stocks currently trading above $1,000 per share, combined. The only other tech company on the list is Priceline Group.

By Spencer Soper. Added by Agency Staff on 30 May 2017. Saved under World Tags: Amazon Web Services, Amazon.com, AWS, Jeff Bezos Tweet Jeff Bezos Amazon.com’s shares topped US$1 000 for the first time on Tuesday, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing. Amazon shares hit $1 001,20 in New York, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its US success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Company, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1 125/share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s $478bn market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores, even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s Web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99/year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80m Prime subscribers in the US as of 31 March, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s and Sears Holdings, which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix and Airbnb as well as Capital One Financial and the US federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246,8bn to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO, Jeff Bezos, the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show Shark Tank. “Amazon is worth far more than $1 000/share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 15Nokia’s 3310 is great … if you live in 2002 5‘Kill 3G, not 2G’ 4LG needs a smarter bet than OLED 4Microsoft’s Eskom problem 3Podcast | MTN SA tech chief Giovanni Chiarelli Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Shares of Amazon surged above $1,000 for the first time Tuesday, marking another milestone in the rise of the American online retail giant. Near 14:10 GMT, the company's shares were selling at $997.97, up 0.2 percent after earlier getting as high as $1,001.20. Amazon's market capitalization stood at about $478 billion, more than twice that of Wal-Mart Stores. After going in public in May 1997 at $18 a share, Amazon has benefited from tectonic shifts in US technology and consumer shopping habits that are expected to continue to remake the retail industry. The company has evolved from its origins as an online bookseller into a broad-based retailer of apparel and household staples, from electronics to sausage casing. And with its "Prime" subscription service, it also has become a creative force in Hollywood and beyond. Amazon shares have appreciated especially rapidly over the last three years in anticipation that e-commerce will become a much bigger force in the retail sector. Online sales currently comprise about eight percent of the US retail market. Amazon alone accounts for about 43 percent of US online sales, according to consultancy Slice Intelligence. E-commerce is expected to grow between eight and 12 percent this year, according to the National Retail Federation, about three times as much as the rest of the industry, which has faced massive store and mall closures. Amazon, whose revenues grew to $35.7 billion in the first quarter, also has impressed Wall Street by laying out a plan to achieve greater profitability. It is in the process of investing $1.5 billion to establish its own delivery network and lessen its dependence on shipping giants FedEx and UPS. That will help contain delivery costs, which grew 30 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. The surge above $1,000 a share also raises questions about whether Amazon intends to pursue a stock split. At Amazon's annual meeting a week ago, chief executive Jeff Bezos said the matter was under consideration. The company had three previous stock splits, in June 1998 and in January and August 1999. Amazon currently is the fourth biggest company by market capitalization after Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.

A new report from Bentonville-based Harvest Revenue Group outlines several risks for suppliers now that Wal-Mart knows the price Jet paid suppliers for like products. Harvest Revenue President Boyd Evert, told Talk Business & Politics the suppliers facing the biggest audit risks could be those companies that have used distributors to unload remnant products at closeout prices. “Say a company has undergone a new packaging change at Wal-Mart’s asking and there are remnant products in the old packaging that the supplier uses a distributor to sell as close outs. If Jet purchased those items at closeout prices and that was better than the price Wal-Mart got, the third party auditors could see that as a violation of the supplier agreement and trigger an margin audit,” Evert said. He said anytime Jet got a better price for an item than Wal-Mart, an auditor will be likely to write a claim for the difference. Given the number of stores Wal-Mart has and the amount of volume it sells that could be a huge dent to suppliers’ accounts in the form of chargebacks. Just 50-cents difference in Jet’s favor for something like laundry detergent could be multiplied by thousands given the product volume Wal-Mart does each week. Wal-Mart’s 2015 policy changes that imposed a 1% surcharge on any merchandise moving through a distribution center, a 10% surcharge on all merchandise shipped to a new, expanded or newly remodeled store, and the 90-day payment option Wal-Mart has on invoices to still get a cash discount, are proof the retailer is being more adversarial when it comes to costs. The report estimates Tyson Foods, who does roughly $6.95 billion of business with Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, is paying as much as $35 million in added costs to do business with Wal-Mart since the 2015 surcharges began. The report also states that Wal-Mart continues to push suppliers to help underwrite its most recent price perception efforts with lower up front prices. At the supplier summit held in Bentonville earlier this year suppliers were reportedly told Wal-Mart expects them to help it beat competitors in head-to-head pricing 80% of the time. Evert said the dynamic pricing strategy and Wal-Mart eagerness to be the low cost leader in retail has subjected more suppliers to margin audits since 2015. He said some suppliers have been told to pay the claims or risk losing shelf space. He also said it’s the retailer that has sole responsibility for setting the selling price of items. Jet’s smart cart pricing formula essentially can take the final sales price lower than Wal-Mart and thus trigger an audit, according to the report. Evert said it’s unlikely Wal-Mart’s internal auditors would choose to pursue a cross-channel claim. However, he said, third party auditors are more “aggressive and “creative” in filing claims based on assumptions. He said when these claims are filed it’s up to the supplier to disprove. “In the Wal-Mart environment, the company can automatically deduct the amount in question, up to $100,000, until the supplier is able to prove its case,” Evert said. He said there is no foolproof way for suppliers to Wal-Mart and Jet to inoculate their company from an audit by adopting a defensive game plan. He said retailers and third parties can initiate those as they so chose, but he outlined steps suppliers can take to be in a better positions to defend their bottom lines. Following are some of the tips recommended by Harvest Revenue. • Research your company’s relationship with Jet.com prior to the acquisition by Wal-Mart. If you (supplier) had a contract with Jet, expect the terms most favorable to Wal-Mart to applied to all of your transactions of related merchandise. • Understand the combined buying function implemented across the online and brick and mortar channel. Seek out specifics from your buyer about how your product line is affected and what to expect going forward. • Redefine or negotiate the terms and conditions of your supplier contract. Carve out exclusions affecting sales via an online channel. • Be very specific when writing sales orders. Make sure that any pricing or profit guarantees are narrowly worded to reduce the likelihood of a creative interpretation. • Define all the variables in writing. Suppliers’ relationships with their buyers have changed with decisions increasingly being pushed to the Shared Service function when it comes to payment and pricing disputes. • Align with organizations that allow you to benchmark with other suppliers. Given Wal-Mart’s size it is easy for them to lean on an individual supplier but, with shared knowledge, suppliers can resist a heavy hand. • Require transparency. Hold Wal-Mart to the same standards to which it holds your company, requiring complete supporting documentation to decide if a claim is valid or invalid. • Revisit Form 100. Many suppliers filled out this request for information without recognizing the implied commitments contained within it. (In Form 100 suppliers were instructed to provide not only the cost and available discount information, but also divulge its funding allocations for co-ops, trade spending, supply chain reliability and post audit claims – any of which could used to formulate claims or demands seeking additional revenue from the supplier.) • Establish consensus between your sales and finance teams. Observe and define the balance between protecting what’s rightfully yours and enhancing your business with an important customer. • Consider seeking out professional deduction management expertise. –––––––––––––––––––––– Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

Who’s Taking Responsibility for Your Supply Chain? May 29, 2017 Dave Blanchard EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Manufacturers are being held to a higher standard of corporate social responsibility, and are developing new best practices to adapt their supply chain ecosystems accordingly. APP’s deforestation efforts begin at nurseries such as this one, where trees are grown from seedlings before being transplanted to the rainforest. APP Advertisement Economist Milton Friedman once said that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits,” but then again, Friedman spent his entire career in academia, not manufacturing. He never had to face down shareholders and customers demanding that his company establish sustainability goals and then regularly report on their progress toward reaching those goals. For manufacturers today, it definitely matters that companies include corporate social responsibility as part of their standard business practices. If a company appears to be lax on the CSR front, it can take a lot of time—and-money—to restore their reputation. Just ask Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), the third biggest paper manufacturer in the world. As a multi-national company whose products are agricultural-based, APP uses a lot of natural resources to create its paper-based products, including tissue and packaging materials. The paper production process involves the cutting down of a lot of trees, amounting to more than 20 million metric tons of pulp and paper per year. APP is headquartered in the island nation of Indonesia, which has the largest rainforest in Asia and the second largest in the world (after Brazil). There’s a fine line between the business of producing paper and reckless deforestation practices, and according to activist non-government organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund, APP crossed that line and then some, since the charges were leveled that the company was endangering both the flora as well as the fauna of the rainforest by stripping bare the habitats of tigers and orangutans, threatening the lifestyles of indigenous peoples living in the rainforest, and even contributing to climate change due to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The seriousness of the charges against APP was sufficient to convince several major customers, such as Mattel, Office Depot, Staples and Walmart, to end their relationships with the paper company. That fall from grace, coupled with the loss of a lot of business, prompted APP to embrace CSR in a big way, which resulted in its Forest Conservation Policy. The central premise behind the FCP is APP’s intent to dramatically reverse the effects of deforestation by halting the harvesting of natural forest timber throughout its entire supply chain. Among other things, APP’s stated plan is to be completely reliant on plantation-sourced (as opposed to rainforest-sourced) pulpwood, and that carbon emissions will be reduced by 26% by 2020. To prove to the world that it meant what it said, APP also invited the Rainforest Alliance, a prominent NGO, to independently evaluate the company’s progress. Popular Now Smart Factories Could Add $500 Billion to Global Economy in 5 Years How to Set Up a Lean Factory That Works, Part 1 12-Hour Shifts -- Are They the Best Fit for Your Organization? Early reports are promising, though the Rainforest Alliance’s finding concludes that APP has gotten off to a good start but still needs to do a lot more. At a media event in Indonesia, Aida Greenbury, APP’s managing director of sustainability, acknowledged that more work does indeed need to be done, but as she told IndustryWeek, “We can’t do it alone. We’re addressing our legacy, but to achieve zero deforestation with our suppliers and other producers, we have to work together to find solutions.” Speaking by way of analogy, she explained, “We’ve started with the foundation, and have started building the house, but we’re not to the roof yet. We’ve got a good blueprint and a good foundation, but we’re still early in the process.” Merely promising to eliminate deforestation wasn’t going to win back any business for APP; the company had to actually demonstrate how that was going to happen. On the island of Sumatra, within APP’s R&D center, forests are actually being created, one tree at a time. APP’s scientists have created a new and hardier crop of acacia and eucalyptus trees (the types of trees the company harvests for paper), which can grow to their full height of 65 feet in about five years. These trees, developed as seedlings in a lab setting, offer visual proof that APP has figured out a way to replenish the natural resources it depends on, one seedling at a time. And APP’s public commitment to deforestation has won back several of the customers it had lost, including Staples and Walmart.   Will It Go Round in Circles? Buzzwords are as prevalent in sustainability discussions as any other area of manufacturing, and the term circular economy has emerged recently to describe companies’ efforts to reuse and recycle as much raw material as possible, with the idea of keeping products from ever ending up in a landfill. The circular economy aims to turn waste into wealth by keeping resources in productive use—in effect, becoming a kind of closed-loop supply chain. More than 90% of companies told consulting firm Accenture that they are implementing circular business models in their supply chains, particularly for material recovery and recycling. However, it turns out that many manufacturers are adopting circular economy strategies due to competitive pressure, and not with the intent of putting circularity at the front and center of their supply chain operations, notes Sudipta Ghosh and Harry Morrison, managing directors with Accenture. In a recent study of 500 companies with revenues over $1 billion, Accenture discovered that companies are more likely to be motivated by low-cost rivals or warranty issues, and not the social responsibility aspect. “Most efforts don’t decouple production from primary resource use,” Ghosh and Morrison note. “Not only is this leading to sizable losses in cost-savings and efficiencies, but it is also resulting in missed opportunities to unleash growth and profitability across the business.” It’s also just as likely that companies are going green because, well, they don’t have much choice, particularly if they’re consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers who sell to big-box retail giant Walmart. In April 2017, Walmart launched Project Gigaton, which aims to reduce 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its global supply chain by 2030. The retailer is expected to urge the new project on its suppliers by following the same basic supply chain modus operandi it used in years past when pushing for EDI, RFID and labeling standards: Do it if you want to continue doing business with us. As Laura Phillips, Walmart’s senior vice president of sustainability, told Bloomberg, most of the carbon reductions will come from key CPG suppliers, such as General Mills, Campbell Soup and Unilever. In launching Project Gigaton, Walmart collaborated with some key NGOs, such as the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund, to develop an emissions reduction toolkit. As APP learned, having the NGO community supporting your efforts goes a long way in winning the all-important battle for good publicity.   Slaves to Their Jobs While environmental activists can often identify pollution by sight alone, as both water and air tend to take on unnatural hues when exposed to chemicals, it’s nowhere near as easy to spot the incidences of slavery and human trafficking in the workplace, despite the fact that slavery is a problem of global proportions, says consultant Robert Kuhn, chair of ISM’s Sustainability and Social Responsibility committee. Nearly 46 million people live subjected to some form of involuntary servitude, according to the Global Slavery Index, but rescuing those people will require the collective efforts of all manufacturers closely monitoring their own supply chains as well as the supply chains of their suppliers, both upstream (e.g., mining or agricultural workers) and downstream (e.g., apparel sweatshops). “Eradicating modern slavery is first and foremost a moral imperative, but it is also an issue of reputational risk and regulatory compliance,” Kuhn explains. In fact, the ISM’s guiding principles on human rights recommend, in part, that all supply chain professionals: • Communicate organizational human rights policies and expectations to suppliers and throughout the supply chain. • Be vigilant as to possible human rights violations in the supply chain. • Implement appropriate organizational policies and procedures upon learning of suspected abuse. Easier said than done, though. Although almost half of all slaves are in India, it’s a myth that modern slavery only occurs in Third World or emerging countries. For instance, more than 1.5 million people working in slavery-like conditions live in Europe, North America, Australia and Japan, points out Helen Carter, a consultant with Action Sustainability. Also, as the history of human misery has proven time and again, slavery is quite lucrative to the slaveholders. “Forced labor in the private economy generates $150 billion in illegal profits every year,” Carter notes. It’s also a myth, she adds, that sex trafficking represents the majority of all instances of modern slavery; in fact, sex trafficking makes up only about 20% of all cases. By far the majority occur in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, mining, textiles, utilities and domestic work. So how do you ensure that the raw materials your company sources or the piecework done to produce your final products weren’t the result of forced labor? For starters, it’s vital that a company spell out its specific policies toward slavery and forced labor standards, which should include a process for protecting whistleblowers and supporting victims of slavery practices, Carter says. It’s also important that the company’s leaders, extending to the very top of the corporate ladder, are in full support of your anti-slavery policies, and that all employees are trained on the company’s approach to thwarting labor exploitation. Then conduct a risk and opportunity assessment, she suggests, and determine the measures you’re going to use. She recommends that companies analyze their spend and map out their supply chain. You need to know where your biggest risk is for exploitation, and how to circumvent those risks. Ultimately, Kuhn admits, identifying and eliminating forced labor is a huge undertaking, as “bad actors have gotten quite good at hiding their subversive activities.” Nevertheless, through collaboration with supply chain partners and working with NGOs, substantial progress toward ending slavery can be made.   Plugging the Skills Gap While the incidence of forced labor can be undetectable, one labor practice that is most definitely front-and-center to manufacturing executives is the training and retention of skilled employees, particularly in an era that seems far more focused on furthering the advances of technology and automation than on the development of people to facilitate those advances. If a company’s first responsibility is to its own workforce, then it’s incumbent upon companies first and foremost to meet the needs of its employees. “U.S. manufacturing job openings are outpacing qualified candidates, resulting in a widening skills gap across the industry,” points out Philippe Cochet, chief productivity officer with global conglomerate General Electric. To plug that gap, GE has launched a program called Brilliant Learning that aims to train more than 150,000 global supply chain employees in the use of digital technologies and new manufacturing processes. “Brilliant Learning is our skills curriculum to train global supply chain employees for the new, highly valuable jobs that are needed in our evolving digital industrial workforce,” Cochet explains. “The initiative is based on GE’s Brilliant Factory strategy, which combines lean, advanced, additive and digital manufacturing to increase productivity.” While the program is initially being rolled out to the company’s supply chain employees, it will also be available to all employees, in multiple languages across all levels of manufacturing roles. “As a digital industrial company, we utilize digital technology across our businesses and work streams,” Cochet continues. “New technology is already augmenting the capabilities of our workers and elevating what it means to work in manufacturing. For example, we are leveraging Big Data to develop energy management insights through our Predix software platform, which is a huge productivity and resource efficiency opportunity. We are also paying close attention on how to best use these types of digital industrial applications in our sustainability program to lower energy costs and emissions.” On the environmental front, Cochet points out that sustainability isn’t considered an initiative at GE; rather, it is integrated into the company’s core business strategy. In energy management, for instance, GE has applied its own innovations in on-site solar and LED lighting at numerous facilities. Just as importantly, GE works very closely with its suppliers, with the emphasis on including them in sustainability efforts. “Our suppliers often come to us for best practice advice on how they can implement similar strategies,” Cochet observes. “We believe this is good business practice.”             Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

I had my cart completely full of pop and was going to the bus stop on South Robert to go home. I was in the parking lot between Jimmy John’s and Taco Bell going up the hill.  A dark blue car kept coming toward me and I tried to back up but I couldn’t — I wasn’t fast enough to avoid the car because the cart was full. The car hit my cart and broke off one of the wheels. The driver got out and asked me if I was OK. I said I was but my cart wasn’t. She offered to take me home and pay me for the cart. I mentioned calling the police. She asked me not to call the police. In fact, she got very angry about me wanting to call them. I finally called West St. Paul Police. After about five minutes, two police officers showed up. They questioned me and then the driver of the car. Then they said they would give me a ride home with my pop and broken cart. On the way home, I asked the officers if the driver had insurance. They said no. “That is illegal,” I said. They said, “That is why we gave her a ticket.” About an hour after the officers dropped me off at my home, someone came to my door. It was the two police officers. When I opened the door, they said, “We have something for you, a new cart.” That was totally unexpected and I want to say how happy I am with the West St. Paul Police Department.  I want to express my appreciation to these officers.

And the smell of second-hand smoke”): You are absolutely right about the dubious “privilege of sucking in second-hand smoke.” As to renters getting action in response to their complaints about smells of cigarettes, it is not necessarily so. Some renters I have talked with have said that when they have complained of cigarette smells in neighboring units, they were told that since the tenant in question had signed the “non-smoking rental lease,” of course, the tenant could not have been smoking. The same applies to marijuana smoking in rentals. The smell seeps into other apartments. Not everyone appreciates the stench (personal opinion). Inhaling weed should be a choice; unfortunately, apartment dwellers cannot make that choice. If the landlord doesn’t believe the complaining tenants, and if he or she seldom visits the properties, there is no proof of lease or health violations. Whether the smoking is outside or in an adjacent apartment, the renter has no more voice or action than the homeowner. The renter, though, may likely suffer retaliation for having made complaints to appropriate city departments. S. Holben, St. Paul   SAINTED Greg at the Eva Street postal facility in St. Paul didn’t let working the Saturday of a holiday weekend rain on his professionalism and good spirits. He was friendly and knowledgeable and went way beyond the expected for one of Life Wireless’s customers, who called in trying to locate a missing package. The number she gave us took us to Greg, who did absolutely everything he could to get her package for her as soon as possible, even visiting another office that was closed at the time. Our customer couldn’t get it that day, so Greg provided a specific time when she could pick it up after the holiday weekend. Greg’s positive, sunny disposition and friendly and efficient assistance made our customer’s day. He impressed us here at Life Wireless in Atlanta, Ga., and we wanted you to know it! The Eva Street facility has a winner in Greg. Leslie Roesler, Atlanta, Ga. The writer is customer service supervisor at Life Wireless.   SAINTED At about 5 p.m. on the Saturday before Mother’s Day, my sister and mom and I pulled up to the parking lot of the new Ichiddo Ramen near the corner of University and Grotto, determined to get a bowl of the savory noodles. We noticed a middle-age man, who we guessed to be severely inebriated, staggering from pole to pole on University. With every step forward, he took two steps back, and risked smashing his head on the sidewalk with each unsteady lurch forward. We decided he was at great risk of injuring himself and called 911 for assistance. Hats off to the professionalism of the 911 center and the officer who responded quickly in his squad car. I’m not one to blindly support police actions in every situation, but this officer handled himself extremely well. Jim Sanoden, St. Paul   SAINTED We would like to saint the Little Angels Preschool located at Guardian Angels Church in Oakdale, and the school’s staff, especially Miss Melissa, Miss Anne and the director, Nance Lyons. Our grandson Jasper attended the 4-year-olds’ class. Jasper had not been exposed to formal education but was ready to learn. The awesome experience that was Little Angles Preschool will serve him well as he heads to kindergarten this fall. Thank you for making his first school exposure such a positive, affordable learning experience.  It is true, it takes a village, and we are very grateful to have found this “village” for Jasper. Paul and Linda Chimzar, Woodbury   SAINTED My husband and I want to thank the hundreds of volunteers involved in the clean-up after the tornado that hit the Chetek, Wis., area and surrounding communities. The Red Cross, Team Rubicon, the Salvation Army, Barron County Services, churches, schools and so many more … the list goes on and on. Seeing, feeling and joining the strong sense of community is amazing, and we hope that all of this helps in the healing, mending and rebuilding process.  Thank you, all, for everything you’ve done and continue to do during this difficult time.

Local food pantries fight to feed as many hungry families as they can throughout the summer, despite their limited supply. "More families are in need and food insecurity is greater because a lot of those family rely on free and reduced breakfast and lunch or the snack pack program," Life Source director Jimmie Conduff said. Partnerships like Razorback Food Recovery help keep the pantries open. Truck loads of unused hot food from the Walmart shareholders meeting were dropped off at the pantry and donated to families. "Usually later in the week if there's things from the different locations they'll donate. But, those things usually come on Friday and that typically helps us get through the summer," Conduff said. He said the pantry will feed 4,000 to 5,000 thousand people this summer.

The Benefits are Starting to Accrue! One analyst sees good things coming from Wal-Mart's digital efforts. By Ben Levisohn Updated May 31, 2017 2:40 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large If anyone doubted Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT) commitment to online--and making itself into a legitimate competitor to Amazon.com (AMZN)--those doubts should have faded when the big box retailer bought Jet.com last year. Wal-Mart has spent billions to expand its distribution centers, upgrade its technology, and offer more products to its customers. Illustration: Getty Images Now, says Baird's Peter Benedict and team, the benefits from Wal-Mart's online investment are "starting to accrue." They explain: While an ongoing process, these efforts have positioned WMT to compete more effectively in today's increasingly omni-channel retail world. Encouraging signs of traction include early success with online grocery pickup (in ~670 stores, ~1,100 by year end), the recent acceleration in walmart.com's online assortment (50M+ SKUs today vs. 8M in 2015), and the increasingly positive impact ecommerce is having on Walmart-U.S. comps (~80bps in 1Q17). With Walmart-U.S. ecommerce sales/GMV rising 63%/69% y/y in 1Q17, the top-line payoff is starting to accrue, although segment profitability remains under pressure for now. Benedict and team are looking ahead to Friday's annual shareholders meeting for more details on Wal-Marts plans. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores have advanced 0.2% to $78.30 at 2:24 p.m. today, while Amazon.com has declined 0.6% to $990.93.

Photo / Facebook A 16-year-old girl was charged today as an adult with first-degree murder and accused of stabbing her Uber driver to death in suburban Chicago. Eliza Wasni allegedly stole a knife and machete from a Walmart in Skokie, asked for a ride using the Uber app and within minutes started attacking her driver, the Daily Mail reports. The driver, Grant Nelson, managed to stop his car and run into a condominium building lobby where he sought help but later died of his wounds. Wasni allegedly drove off in Nelson's car, struck a median and then ran off. She was apprehended moments later after removing a bloody shirt. Lincolnwood police said they responded to a report of a man screaming for help at about 3.20am Tuesday when they found Nelson, 34, of Wilmette with multiple stab wounds. Nelson told them he was a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber and that his passenger stabbed him, police said. He was dropping off the girl when the attack occurred, police said. Officers located Wasni - who lives with her single mother - behind a building near the crime scene in possession of two weapons they believe she used in the stabbing, Lincolnwood police said. They said she declined to make a statement. Uber states that customers must be 18 years or older to use the service. It's unclear how that is enforced. It's also unclear what prompted the attack. Nelson died at a nearby hospital a few hours later. Chicago-area TV stations reported that Nelson's blood-splattered silver sedan remained in the intersection as police investigated his killing. Continued below.

The car then exits the parking lot back out onto the main road where Nelson was attacked. Nelson was rushed to hospital where he later died. Photo / ABC7 Wasni was ordered held without bond at her first hearing Wednesday afternoon in Skokie court. Uber officials said the company was working with police to provide information relevant to the investigation. "We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners,' Uber said in a statement. 'Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Nelson lived with his parents and worked as a waiter, while driving for Uber and Lyft after his shifts. He had reportedly finished Memorial Day dinner with his family on Monday when he decided to go out and earn some extra cash by driving. Nelson's sister, Alex Nelson, told WMAQ-TV in Chicago that her brother was a good person. "He was not a vindictive person," Alex Nelson said. "He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate." Alex said that her brother was a pianist who loved classical music, films and the family dog Lilly. "You know, I think Grant was the kind of man who never knew his true life's calling," she told CBS Chicago. "Unfortunately, now he never will get to find that." "If he had been given the chance to live, he would have continued to fill the world with good thoughts, good music, and intelligent conversation. We will all miss that without him here," she added. Nelson is pictured on the far left with members of his family. Photo / Facebook Mike Foley, a friend who worked with Nelson in the restaurant industry, said he would sometimes speak about the dangers of ride-sharing. "I remember him mentioning that he once had to stop and get gas in a really sketchy neighbourhood. He might not have really thought anything of it," Foley told ABC 7. Colleen Milner, another former coworker, said that Nelson was the last person who would be in a deadly confrontation. "It's pretty heartbreaking to hear that. That guy is super nice. One of the nicest guys you'll know. Quiet, shy, but he wouldn't do anything to anybody," Milner said. A service has been planned for Friday at Chicago's Jewish Funerals in Skokie. The family has asked that donations be made to the National Alliance on Mental Illness's Cook County North Suburban chapter and the nNti-Cruelty Society. It is the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, police said. - Daily Mail Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Thrilling Lions match lights up city Fans on both sides of the match were unified in their enjoyment of the match.

Stewart Ledbetter NBC5 Senior Reporter WILLISTON, Vt. — Facing a sharp rise in consumer complaints over telephone scams, Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan says the best defense might be to start playing offense. Advertisement Donovan has enlisted help from Walmart and CVS Pharmacy to post new consumer warnings in all its Vermont stores. The signs urge Vermonters to be smart about sending money under duress to those who have telephoned them, no matter how convincing they might have seemed. Donovan said a new technology -- called spoofing -- allows scam artists to hack your 'caller ID' displaying a legitimate local company, such as your electric utility, to get you to answer the phone. Within seconds, you might face an aggressive demand for money. Felicia Charland was on duty at Holiday Inn Express in South Burlington in January when she answered a call she thought was from Green Mountain Power. At least that's what her caller ID suggested. "He said, 'you owe us money or we're shutting off your electric,'" Charland said. "I said, 'We don't owe any money.' He said 'you have half an hour to pay or we're shutting it off!'" Charland stood her ground, despite three calls from a man she describes as "very nasty." Instead, she reported the incident to GMP and to the Vermont Attorney General's consumer-assistance hotline -- 800-649-2424. "I knew something wasn't right. In my gut, I knew," she told NBC5. Donovan said that was exactly the right response and hopes others will do the same. He said virtually every Vermonter is potentially at risk from the utility ruse. His office reported 7,000 complaints last year about phone scams, a 25 percent increase over 2015. Now, Walmart and CVS are helping to get the word out about the severity of the problem. Walmart Director Jason Klipa said his customer service staffers are now trained to pay closer attention to customers interested in purchasing money orders and prepaid credit cards, to interact with customers to try to stop victims of a scam from losing their money. Because the moment the money is wired, it's gone, Donovan said. "Things (we'll) look for -- people acting strange, looking for things on their phone or being in certain phone conversations," Klipa said. His employees "are authorized to say no to the transaction, or alert a store manager." The idea, Donovan said, is to get consumers to stop, ask more questions about the validity of any demand for payment, and confirm whether it really came from the company they assumed it was. Donovan said educating consumers is the best approach because arresting fraudsters operating in other states or foreign countries is nearly impossible. He said he was unaware of a single successful prosecution. Donovan was joined by representatives of Washington Electric Co-op, Green Mountain Power and Washington Electric Cooperative -- which all endorsed the public education campaign.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu - RTX35CNO LINCOLNWOOD, Ill. –  A 16-year-old girl walked out of a suburban Chicago Walmart holding a machete and knife she'd stolen, climbed into an Uber car and began hacking at the driver, prosecutors said at a hearing on Wednesday. The driver died of his wounds Tuesday after giving police a description of the attacker that led to her arrest. A prosecutor read in court a description of the attack that said Eliza Wasni simply climbed into a car driven by 34-year-old Grant Nelson, and stabbed him and hacked him to death early Tuesday morning. The judge ordered the girl, who was charged as an adult with first-degree murder, held without bond. The 2-page description offers no reason for the attack, but portrays Wasni as a calm girl who "nonchalantly" could be seen walking through Walmart, the knives in hand, before she walked outside without paying. TRAIN STABBING SURVIVOR: PORTLAND HAS 'WHITE SAVIOR COMPLEX'  Prosecutors said that Nelson, a resident of Wilmette, picked the girl up shortly after 3 a.m. Tuesday in Lincolnwood. It was her third ride in an Uber vehicle in the early morning hours of Tuesday. Two minutes after he began driving, prosecutors said that Wasni began stabbing Nelson from the back seat. Nelson was able to pull over and ran into a nearby condominium building, where he screamed, "Help me, help me! I'm going to die!" until residents called 911. Wasni climbed into the front seat of Nelson's blood-splattered silver sedan and drove away, striking a median in the road. She jumped out of the vehicle and fled on foot. When Lincolnwood police arrived, they found the vehiclewith blood on both the inside and the outside, with Nelson's phone open to the Uber app. The app said that Nelson's passenger was someone named Eliza. Officers followed the trial of blood and found Nelson lying in grass. He was bleeding profusely from several wounds, and was able to tell the officers what had happened. He died at a nearby hospital a few hours later. Using the description given by Nelson, police found her nearby crouching behind an air conditioner — a machete in one hand and a knife in the other. Police warned her that she would be shot with a Taser if she did not drop the weapons, and when she did not comply an officer used the Taser. Wasni dropped the knives and was taken into custody. Police said she did not make a statement. POLICE: NEW CHARGES BROUGHT IN CASE OF IOWA TEEN'S DEATH According to prosecutors, police recovered a shirt the girl could be seen wearing in the Walmart. The shirt had blood on it. Uber officials said the company was working with police to provide information relevant to the investigation. "We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners," Uber said in a statement. "Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Nelson's sister, Alex Nelson, told WMAQ-TV in Chicago that her brother was a good person. "He was not a vindictive person," Alex Nelson said. "He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate." It is the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, police said.

Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. If you've been on social media anytime in the past few months, chances are you've come across a monsoon-like flood of Instagram advertisements and YouTube reviews for the Shills Black Peel-Off Face Mask. The product has earned viral fame and developed a cult-like following of beauty mavens who praise its ability to banish blackheads with just one use. This skin-purifying mask promises to unclog pores of their impurities, leaving your face feeling smooth, exfoliated, and, most importantly, blackhead-free. Sounds pretty glorious, right? As soon as I stumbled upon an ad about the Shills mask, so many questions came to mind: Does it actually work? How long does it take to show results? And on a scale of 1-10, how bad will it hurt? So I scoured YouTube to see what vloggers had to say about it, and it turned out the reviews were pretty evenly divided. Some admitted it was extremely painful and even caused a little inflammation, while others raved of its pore-cleansing effects and even featured up-close footage of their blackheads getting stripped of dirt and grime as the mask got ripped off. Related This Sailor Moon Sheet Mask Smells Just Like Tuxedo Mask's Roses It's those zoomed-in shots of the pore-stripping action that really drew me in. I'm not gonna lie: it's those zoomed-in shots of the pore-stripping action that really drew me in. There's something so oddly satisfying about watching it, kind of like seeing Dr. Pimple Popper's blackhead-blasting adventures. (I know, I know; I'm weird.) My curiosity eventually got the best of me, so I decided to take one for the team and try the mask myself (naturally documenting my journey with a plethora of obnoxious selfies and Boomerangs, of course). I have to preface things by honestly admitting I've been blessed with pretty decent skin. It's by no means a blackhead haven, but I do have tons of pesky clogged pores mostly concentrated around my nose that I've been itching to get rid of (and that I usually resort to squeezing out with my fingertips, despite my mom's best efforts to advise against doing so). Before you sacrifice your precious pores and hop on the bandwagon, read on for the 11 tips and tidbits you need to know about the infamous Shills mask. 1. There appear to be two different Shills products on the market that people are mixing up Shills isn't exactly a drugstore mainstay, so many of the brand's products are sold on Amazon. I ended up purchasing mine through a semisketchy website (see tip No. 2 for more details on that) and soon realized there are two different black peel-off masks that people are interchanging. The two versions are the Purifying Peel-Off Mask and the Acne Purifying Peel-Off Black Mask. The first claims to "increase vitality" and is used by many beauty vloggers who have reviewed it on YouTube. The second claims to "increase complexion" and is sold at Walmart and on the official Shills website. I chose the Purifying Peel-Off Mask, because it's the first one I came across on social media. The difference in how well each of these products removes blackheads is a tad unclear, but it's definitely something to keep in mind if you're planning to purchase one. 2. If you're impatient like me, don't buy it through an Instagram ad Being the millennial consumer I am, I simply couldn't resist clicking on an ad for the product on Instagram (especially when I saw the word "free" involved in the promotion). That ad took me to a website, which was offering the product for free (plus shipping costs). I paid $13 for it at the time — though the price appears to fluctuate daily because of the high demand. Purchasing it through a random website I'd never heard of was a rookie mistake on my end, because I had to wait three weeks for it to arrive, and when it did arrive, the packaging was pretty beat up. I suggest buying it from Walmart or Amazon, both of which offer quicker shipping times, if you're dying to try it ASAP. Channeling some hopeful vibes before applying my face mask. 3. Apply the mask using a brush, not your fingertips Whereas some gals on YouTube excitedly slathered on the goopy liquid with their fingers, others opted for using a makeup brush to do so. This resulted in much cleaner, accurate coverage. I went for a basic foundation brush from the local drugstore and found that I was able to properly cover my face. It also helped me get in those hard-to-reach spots (like between my eyebrows, near my nostrils, and by my hairline). A soft, semitapered foundation brush is definitely the way to go, rather than a large powder brush. Another upside of using a brush to apply the Shills mask? I didn't have to deal with furiously scrubbing my fingers to get any of the black color off afterward because the brush took the fall instead. I simply dabbed on some dish soap, rubbed it on my silicone brush cleaner, and voila! My brush was good as new again. Related If You Experience Hormonal Breakouts, You'll Thank God For This Mask 4. On that note, apply it very carefully — yet quickly I'm admittedly a tad of a perfectionist, so I wanted to apply my mask evenly to allow for the best selfies possible (yes, I know that was painfully millennial of me to say). But I realized that the liquid starts to dry pretty quickly, so you have to move fast when slathering it on. That doesn't mean sloppiness is welcomed, as getting that full coverage is what you should be going for. Just make sure you get yourself in ninja-mask-applying mode beforehand. 5. If you do mess something up, I've got the perfect solution A few times during application, I accidentally veered my brush too closely to my eyebrows and hairline (both of which should 100 percent be avoided). In a moment of panic, I glanced over at the Q-tips in my bathroom and the imaginary light bulb illuminated above my head. A damp cotton swab was the ideal tiny tool for easily wiping away excess mask goop before it was too late. Note: this is a helpful hack you can use with any face mask, not just the Shills one! 6. The mask goes on thick — like, super thick I was honestly a bit surprised at just how thick the liquid mask is when I first applied it to my face. I assumed I'd need to smear on a few layers, but all I needed was one coat of it, and I was good to go. Now you know! 7. Set aside nearly 30 minutes for it to dry The packaging advised leaving the mask for 20-30 minutes before getting down to peeling business. I set a timer for 25 minutes and found that to be the perfect sweet spot. By then, the mask was evenly hardened all around, whereas if I had started peeling away around the 20-minute mark, a few patches where I applied it in a slightly thicker coating wouldn't have been ready. 25 minutes to kill = excessively lame Boomerang selfies. 8. Take a deep breath before peeling — and prepare for some pain I suggest treating it like a bandage — just rip it as quickly as possible to get it over with. One of the major caveats for this mask is just how painful it is to remove. Although I think this aspect has been a tad overhyped all over the internet, I can confirm that it hurt pretty freakin' bad. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the worst), I'd give it a solid 8. By far the most painful area for removing the mask was near my eyes. I'll just go ahead and admit that unintentional tears may or may not have rolled down my face while ripping it off my skin. I suggest treating it like a bandage in that area — just pull it as quickly (and carefully!) as possible to get it over with. 9. It didn't actually remove any of my blackheads Lots of happy customers have walked away from their black mask experience with clean, unclogged pores, so I hoped for those results going into it. But I was pretty darn disappointed when I peered at my reflection only to see the same little dots all around my T-zone. (Maybe I should've played "Mask Off" while peeling it to summon Future's magical powers for good measure? Hah, kidding.) The mask did, however, have an unexpected result: it ripped away some of my "peach fuzz" and a few hairs from my upper lip, which you can slightly see in the photo below. So it was basically like a two-in-one facial wax . . . that I didn't exactly ask for. Many of the tiny white dots on the mask were itty-bitty peach-fuzz hairs. 10. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to avoid this one Like I said before, I prepped for the big day by binge-watching YouTube reviews of the Shills mask. One of the videos featured two fair-skinned gals whose faces were beet red in the aftermath. Personally, my face (mainly my cheeks) was red for about two hours after I removed it, and my skin felt all tingly for about 30 minutes after peeling it off. I'm no skin expert, but if yours is notably sensitive or prone to inflammation and flare-ups, I think it's probably best to skip out on the Shills hype. Something a little more mild may be more your style. Me and my rosy cheeks. 11. A few postmask tips you need to know All in all, the mask came off my face pretty seamlessly, mostly in two large pieces. There were a few remaining pieces stuck on near my hairline, which I suggest removing with a damp washcloth. The product's packaging advises following up your peel-off session with some toner to "tighten and cleanse the pores." Although my pores weren't exactly empty caverns by the end of it, I still applied toner for good measure, and it really soothed my slightly aching skin. My final thoughts Although I'm glad I finally quenched my undying curiosity over this mask once and for all, it definitely wasn't as effective as I had hoped it would be. At the end of the day, I wouldn't recommend succumbing to the hype — unless you're looking for a quick way to get rid of peach fuzz sans a razor, that is. Onward to my next face mask adventure!

Bruce Garrett Warren, 36, no known address, caused about $5,500 in damages during the 3 p.m. outburst in the store's electronics section but did not menace any customers before walking out of the store and pedaling around the store's parking lot on a bicycle, Medford police Lt. Kerry Curtis said. "One of the witnesses watched him ride around the parking lot and then return to the front of the store," Curtis said. "It didn’t appear he was trying to flee." Police arrived just about the same time Warren returned to the store's entrance, Curtis said. He was arrested on first-degree criminal mischief charges without incident, remaining mum about his reasons for destroying the electronics. "When the officers did try to talk to him he declined to comment," Curtis said, adding Warren provided arresting officers with a Michigan identification. The eight televisions he destroyed included brands such as Samsung, Vizio and LG, Curtis said. Warren was no longer listed Wednesday morning in the Jackson County Jail, according to jail records. He does not appear to have a criminal history in Oregon, court records show. — Reach reporter Ryan Pfeil at 541-776-4468 or rpfeil@mailtribune.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/ryanpfeil.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive UPDATE: One dead, one injured in officer-involved shooting outside Hesperia Walmart Wednesday May 31, 2017 at 9:51 AM Jun 1, 2017 at 9:18 AM Staff Reports HESPERIA — One man was killed and another wounded in an officer-involved shooting in the parking lot of the Hesperia Walmart Supercenter on Wednesday morning, authorities said. Officers assigned to the San Bernardino County Auto Theft Task Force (SANCATT) were involved in the incident, which occurred as the team attempted to stop three men from reportedly stealing a vehicle. The shooting occurred after an officer was nearly struck by the suspects’ vehicle, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said. Both officers were conducting a separate stolen vehicle investigation in the parking lot of the Walmart, at 13401 Main Street, at approximately 8 a.m. Wednesday when they first noticed the suspects. As the officers approached the men’s vehicle, Bachman said they used their unmarked vehicles to block in the suspects and prevent them from driving away. “The suspect driver accelerated, nearly striking one of the officers, and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” Bachman said. The vehicle continued accelerating until it crashed into one of the unmarked vehicles. The driver and passenger were wounded during the shooting, according to Bachman. The passenger in the back seat was uninjured. "The driver was transported to Desert Valley Medical Center where he was pronounced dead," Bachman said. "The passenger who was wounded was transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center and is expected to survive." The third suspect was detained and taken to the Hesperia Sheriff's Station for an interview, according to Bachman. The identities of the suspects weren’t available late Wednesday. The vehicle the suspects were driving was reported stolen early Wednesday morning from a home in Victorville, Bachman said. According to a tweet from the San Bernardino County Fire Department, emergency personnel were on scene for reported gunshot wounds at approximately 8:20 a.m. Two medical helicopters were requested, according to the tweet, although weather may have forced one to turn back, per scanner traffic. Hesperia resident Chiana Hunter, 34, told the Daily Press she was heading into the store to return something with her kids when she heard gunshots. Hunter said she turned around and saw a man in a Honda and what appeared to be an undercover officer exchange gunfire near the west side of the parking lot. Neither of the SANCATT officers — members of the California Highway Patrol and Fontana Police Department — were injured during the incident, Bachman said. It’s unclear if an exchange of gunfire between the suspects and the officers actually occurred as officials remained tight-lipped on further details. No other injuries were reported. Authorities taped off a section of the Walmart parking lot for the investigation, which is ongoing. Walmart remained open for business throughout the day, with sheriff's officials periodically redirecting customers away from the closed-off section.

Officers assigned to the San Bernardino County Auto Theft Task Force (SANCATT) were involved in the incident, which occurred as the team attempted to stop three men from reportedly stealing a vehicle. The shooting occurred after an officer was nearly struck by the suspects’ vehicle, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said. Both officers were conducting a separate stolen vehicle investigation in the parking lot of the Walmart, at 13401 Main Street, at approximately 8 a.m. Wednesday when they first noticed the suspects. As the officers approached the men’s vehicle, Bachman said they used their unmarked vehicles to block in the suspects and prevent them from driving away. “The suspect driver accelerated, nearly striking one of the officers, and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” Bachman said. The vehicle continued accelerating until it crashed into one of the unmarked vehicles. The driver and passenger were wounded during the shooting, according to Bachman. The passenger in the back seat was uninjured. "The driver was transported to Desert Valley Medical Center where he was pronounced dead," Bachman said. "The passenger who was wounded was transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center and is expected to survive." The third suspect was detained and taken to the Hesperia Sheriff's Station for an interview, according to Bachman. The identities of the suspects weren’t available late Wednesday. The vehicle the suspects were driving was reported stolen early Wednesday morning from a home in Victorville, Bachman said. According to a tweet from the San Bernardino County Fire Department, emergency personnel were on scene for reported gunshot wounds at approximately 8:20 a.m. Two medical helicopters were requested, according to the tweet, although weather may have forced one to turn back, per scanner traffic. Hesperia resident Chiana Hunter, 34, told the Daily Press she was heading into the store to return something with her kids when she heard gunshots. Hunter said she turned around and saw a man in a Honda and what appeared to be an undercover officer exchange gunfire near the west side of the parking lot. Neither of the SANCATT officers — members of the California Highway Patrol and Fontana Police Department — were injured during the incident, Bachman said. It’s unclear if an exchange of gunfire between the suspects and the officers actually occurred as officials remained tight-lipped on further details. No other injuries were reported. Authorities taped off a section of the Walmart parking lot for the investigation, which is ongoing. Walmart remained open for business throughout the day, with sheriff's officials periodically redirecting customers away from the closed-off section.

This is the highest average APR CreditCards.com has recorded since it began tracking rates in mid-2007. Bank of America helped kick off this week’s rate change with a 1-point rate increase on two of its basic, lower-rate cards. The BankAmericard and the BankAmericard for Students now charge a minimum APR of 12.74 percent and a maximum APR of 22.74 percent. Bank of America also modified the cards’ promotional terms. For example, it clipped the balance transfer periods on the two BankAmericards from 18 months to 15 months and added a 15-month interest-free promotion on purchases. Walmart also increased the APR on the Walmart Mastercard by a quarter of a percent this week, causing its minimum APR to rise to 17.65 percent. In addition, CreditCards.com swapped out two cards that are no longer promoted online with rewards cards that charge somewhat higher APRs.  Credit cards overtake debit cards as the most popular way to pay with plastic Debit cards are still one of the most popular ways to pay with plastic. But according to a new report from Nilson, credit cards are quickly closing in and beating debit cards in overall popularity. As card issuers sweeten rewards programs – many of which offer substantial amounts of cash back in exchange for everyday purchases, such as gas and groceries – consumers are increasingly turning to credit to pay for everyday expenses. According to a Nilson report released this month, more than half of all purchases in 2016 that used some type of plastic payment card – 53.64 percent – were made on a credit card. In 2015, by contrast, just 45.84 percent of card purchases used credit. The percentage of cardholders using credit instead of a debit card or prepaid card has increased every year since 2012, thanks in part to consumers’ increasing preference for using rewards cards. “Consumers are choosing credit cards over debit cards to gain rewards from banks and other issuers,” said Nilson’s David Robertson in a news release. Debit cards used to regularly offer rewards programs that competed with credit card rewards. But since federal rules enacted in 2011 limit debit card swipe fees, debit card reward programs have become increasingly scarce. Rewards-based credit cards, meanwhile, have surged in popularity. According to research released this month by the financial services firm Credit Suisse, 72 percent of the offers issuers mailed to consumer homes advertised some kind of rewards offer. As consumers use credit cards more heavily, they’ve also become more likely to carry a balance. According to research released in April by the American Bankers Association, the percentage of cardholders who revolve their balances from month-to-month rose by nearly half a percentage point in late 2016 to 43.7 percent of all bank-issued accounts. Meanwhile, the percentage of cardholders who pay off every balance dropped to 29.1 percent of all accounts. CreditCards.com's Weekly Rate Report   Avg.

Bruce Garrett Warren, 36, no known address, caused about $5,500 in damages during the 3 p.m. outburst in the store's electronics section but did not menace any customers before walking out of the store and pedaling around the store's parking lot on a bicycle, Medford police Lt. Kerry Curtis said. "One of the witnesses watched him ride around the parking lot and then return to the front of the store," Curtis said. "It didn’t appear he was trying to flee." Police arrived just about the same time Warren returned to the store's entrance, Curtis said. He was arrested on first-degree criminal mischief charges without incident, remaining mum about his reasons for destroying the electronics. "When the officers did try to talk to him he declined to comment," Curtis said, adding Warren provided arresting officers with a Michigan identification. The eight televisions he destroyed included brands such as Samsung, Vizio and LG, Curtis said. Warren was no longer listed Wednesday morning in the Jackson County Jail, according to jail records. He does not appear to have a criminal history in Oregon, court records show. — Reach reporter Ryan Pfeil at 541-776-4468 or rpfeil@mailtribune.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/ryanpfeil.

Morton If you live near Atlanta or other parts of the Southeast, chances are the shoes you bought from Amazon, the chandelier from Home Depot or the shower curtain from Wal-mart probably spent at least some of its life at a metro distribution center. Whether by click of a mouse or swipe of a credit card inside a store, consumer spending continues to propel growth in the region’s warehousing industry. According to real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield, businesses in the Atlanta area leased nearly 6.4 million square feet of industrial space in the first three months of this year, a record for space “absorption.” Another 15.5 million square feet is under construction, and the vacancy rate of industrial space — mainly warehouses — dipped three-tenths of a point to 8.7%, the Cushman & Wakefield report said. Metro Atlanta’s warehousing industry has boomed in recent years with tens of millions of square feet of new development and thousands of jobs from companies such as UPS, Amazon and traditional retailers. Consumer spending is a key driver, but so too is the desire of companies to upgrade their supply chains to keep up with buyers who can shop for anything at any time on a smartphone. UPS ranks No. 1 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest U.S. and Canadian for-hire carriers. Roger Tutterow, a Kennesaw State University economist, said that’s big for Georgia, one of the top logistics hubs in the nation. “One of the cornerstones of the state’s economic development plan is to be a logistics hub for the East Coast,” Tutterow said in a recent interview. The strength of the state’s economy and the economies of its Sun Belt neighbors’ have helped fuel that consumer spending growth, thanks to the prolonged recovery since the recession. Georgia’s logistics industry also has benefited from a shift in ocean going cargo coming to East Coast ports, such as the fast-growing Savannah port, rather than being hauled across the country by truck and rail from the West Coast. Materials coming off ships in Savannah and Brunswick, or American exports being loaded onto vessels there, often stop at distribution points near Atlanta or in Savannah before continuing the journey. Strength in exports Steve Grable, an executive vice president with real estate services firm JLL, said the state’s industrial market has been helped not just by consumer spending that’s drawing imports, but strength in Georgia and Southeastern exports as well. Manufacturers such as Caterpillar ship parts and finished heavy equipment within the United States, and they also export materials overseas. Georgia produce and chickens are in high demand in Asia. “Savannah has a 50-50 balance,” he said. “That’s a strength of the port because it is so balanced.” Griff Lynch, executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority, said the state’s ports had their best ever month of April by tonnage. The authority said it loaded and unloaded more than 333,000 TEUs, or twenty-foot equivalent container units, last month, up 11.7% from the same month a year earlier. For tonnage, the ports’ total grew by 13% to 2.94 million tons, the authority said. Some of that buoyancy in shipping business has come from the more competitive price of directly shipping to the East Coast. Labor strife and congestion on the West Coast in recent years helped trigger the shift. Larger and more cost-efficient vessels can transit the expanded Panama Canal, and ports watchers hope that will help sustain and grow the shift to the Atlantic coast. Earlier this month, the Savannah port greeted the largest container ship to ever call on an East Coast port. The Cosco Development, which can hold more than 13,000 TEUs, arrived May 11 after passing the Panama Canal and stopping in Virginia. More are expected to follow, including an even larger ship due at the port June 2. High tide passages The state and federal governments are working to deepen the Savannah River to 47 feet from 42 feet. The largest ships currently can only ply the river at high tide and not when fully loaded. But the project took a hit last week when the Trump Administration proposed putting less money into the deepening than boosters had hoped. The White House budget calls for $50 million for construction in fiscal 2018, following $42.7 million last year. Members of Georgia’s congressional delegation vowed to find additional federal funds to keep the project moving without delay. The deepening is needed to help Savannah compete with rival ports that also are expanding their facilities, backers argue. “Every major brand is using this port,” said Lynch, the Georgia ports chief. Once goods reach the Garden City Terminal, they’re shipped by truck or rail to trucking terminals or distribution centers across the Southeast, but particularly in metro Atlanta. During his State of the Ports speech last year, Lynch told the community the Savannah area needs more warehousing. Mainly, he said, the Savannah area needs more capacity to take products out of offloaded containers to repackage it inside different sized containers on trucks. That helps make the port more efficient having trucks and containers closer to the port. The ports authority is in the process of selling about 500 acres to developers near the port. That will translate into about 5 million square feet of new warehousing space, Lynch said. J. Scott Trubey The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Now Authorities identify man fatally shot by police at Wal-Mart parking lot in Hesperia One person was killed and a second was injured in a shooting involving San Bernardino County Sheriff’s deputies outside a Hesperia Walmart Wednesday morning.   One person was killed and a second was injured in a shooting involving San Bernardino County Sheriff’s deputies outside a Hesperia Walmart Wednesday morning.   Hailey Branson-Potts and Veronica Rocha Contact Reporters A man shot and killed by officers outside a Wal-Mart in Hesperia had stolen a car hours earlier, authorities said Thursday. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department identified the man as James Gleason, a 24-year-old Phelan resident. Gleason and two others — Alexander Herd, 31, and Austin Banuelos, 22— took the car from a home in Victorville in the early morning hours Wednesday, the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement. At 8 a.m., investigators with the San Bernardino County Auto Theft Task Force — which is comprised of officers from multiple state and local law enforcement agencies — caught up with the men in the Wal-Mart parking lot in the 13400 block of Main Street. Two officers from the Fontana Police Department and California Highway Patrol spotted the men trying to steal a vehicle, the Sheriff’s Department said. “The officers approached the suspect vehicle and used their unmarked vehicles to block in the suspects and prevent them from driving away,” the department said. Gleason, who was driving, accelerated and nearly struck one of the officers, authorities said. That’s when the officers fired on the vehicle. The car then crashed into one of the unmarked cars. The officers were not injured. Gleason was struck by the gunfire and pronounced dead at the scene. Herd, who was in the front passenger seat, was also shot, the Sheriff’s Department said. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released. Herd was later arrested on suspicion of burglary, authorities said. Banuelos was not injured. He was arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen property, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

Home office employees can buy the passes using payroll deduction, allowing them to be purchased pre-tax, said Jeff Hatley, mobility manager and public information officer for ORT. Employees will be able purchase the passes in June, Hatley said. The program is being made possible through Wage Works, which offers ways to help people save money by using pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare and commuter expenses. In January, ORT established the first express route in Northwest Arkansas in conjunction with NWA Emerging Leaders. The weekday route runs from the Northwest Arkansas Mall in Fayetteville to the Wal-Mart home office area in Bentonville. The route started with seven riders but has since fallen to one regular rider. About a week after the route was established, an overnight fire destroyed 20 buses including the 55-seat coach-style bus that was set to run the route. ORT’s paratransit vehicles are running the route now, but the company has two other coach-style buses, which could run the route if warranted. “It’s just not cost-effective at this point to run the motor coach for one passenger,” Hatley said. A monthly pass to ride the route is $130, and a one-way ride is $5 per seat, according to the company’s website. The route departs from the Fayetteville mall at 6:45 a.m. It departs from the home office at Eighth and F streets in Bentonville at 5:40 p.m. Comments comments Previous post Sen.

I did this offer and the 175 SB points credited right away. No credit card info is required. New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. Look below for a bonus sign up code! How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Just this week, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus.

(Source: KSLA News 12) BOSSIER CITY, LA (KSLA) - A Bossier City woman alleges two men were following her in a Walmart store. Jared Courtney Basham claims the men followed her from aisle to aisle and left without buying anything. She posted something about the encounter on Facebook. Jared Courtney Basham Others have since commented that they too have been followed. Those comments, part of more than 200 responses, appear to indicate it is happening at various Walmart store throughout the Shreveport-Bossier City area. "From time to time, we do get calls like this," Bossier City spokesman Mark Natale said. "As far as recently, I was unable to find any kind of documentation on it." That may be because not all of the encounters are being reported. Even if a crime is not committed, Natale said, authorities should be contacted. "They have a right to be comfortable. And in any situation where somebody suspects something is not quite right, don't be hesitant to call the police." There is no such thing as being too cautious, Natale added. There also are several steps people can take if they find themselves in such a situation. "First thing they should do is get to an area that's populated," Natale said. "Or, if it's nighttime, get to a well-lit area that's populated. He also advises: "If you're walking into a parking lot or coming out of a store and you think someone is following you, go back into the store and contact police." A manager at the Walmart where Basham says she encountered the two men said that store management was unaware of what happened and that, now that they do know, security will be increased.  Copyright 2017 KSLA.

Walmart shareholder's meeting 2017 Credit: Walmart Most Popular Good times or bad, Walmart's shareholder's meeting is always a huge celebration. In fact, it's not just a meeting, or a day. It's a Shareholder's Week, where employees (associates) from around the world gather. This year, the giant retailer has more to celebrate than usual – including a big spike in e-commerce sales last quarter, three years of same-store sales growth, and pats on the back from many analysts. The stock is up 11% the past year. That's a notch below the 15% for the S&P 500, and further below Costco (18%) and Amazon (39%). But it's way better than most legacy retailers like Target, Kroger and Dollar General, all down double digits. With that in mind, here four faces of Walmart expected to show up in Northwest Arkansas this week. Walmart the star power broker: Walmart draws A-list talent to every shareholder meeting, where they perform for free, albeit with expenses covered and the warm knowledge that it helps them, their employers, their studios or record labels sell stuff at Earth's largest retailer. Last year, James Corden and Katy Perry were there. Prior years have seen Will Smith, Taylor Swift, Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus and so many more. Who will headline Friday's meeting is a closely held secret. But Rascal Flatts and Sheryl Crow were tapped to perform for the associates earlier in the week. Walmart the benevolent: Shareholder Week is part of Walmart's vigorous PR effort to prove to media elites and others that union-backed groups bashing its wages, benefits and personnel practices are wrong. Nothing makes that point like Bud Walton Arena packed with screaming, enthusiastic employees. Cynics say it's easy to get several thousand deliriously happy employees out of 2.3 million to show up when they're hand selected by management for an all-expenses-paid trip to be entertained lavishly (see above). But Walmart will also showcase associates' upward mobility and enhanced training. And the reality is, in one-on-ones, many do seem genuinely satisfied. On Glassdoor, Walmart gets ranked the same or better than union-represented Kroger and Safeway, above non-union Dollar General, but below non-union Target and Costco. Walmart the tech company: During a 2014 Shareholder Week press conference, former Walmart E-commerce CEO Neil Ashe dismissed the potential impact of Jet.com. Now Walmart owns Jet.com, and its founder Marc Lore has Ashe's job. Walmart e-commerce actually outgrew Amazon last quarter, and Lore will be out to showcase more ways he can contend with what looks like the biggest existential threat to Earth's biggest retailer. Walmart paid Lore $244 million last year, more than 10 times what CEO Doug McMillon got, thanks to stock grants from the deal. And he's out to prove Walmart e-commerce business is a flexible platform that also can grow quickly while rapidly bolting on acquisitions like Jet.com, Moosejaw, ModCloth, and ShoeBuy, in the process adding many customers leery of Walmart. More broadly, McMillon has been positioning Walmart as a tech company, most recently in an interview with Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg. The in-store side of that tech includes things like the Scan & Go app at Sam's Club, a generally flawless way to scan and buy on the go. Despite the ease of use, though, most shoppers at stores in, say, Cincinnati don't seem to use it. And applying the app to the bigger universe of Walmart stores without unacceptable pilferage could be even more challenging. Walmart the product developer: Walmart built its business on selling branded products for less than the competition. But its emerging competition from Aldi, Trader Joe's and Lidl mainly sell private-label goods, and big rivals Costco and Kroger also have more fully developed private-label offerings. So, in the worst news for brand marketers, a big part of what Walmart is likely to showcase is its growing prowess at developing its own brands. Last year, Walmart unveiled its private-label craft beer. What wonders await this year?

Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Signs point to progress. ASSOCIATED PRESS Lore ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart Stores to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, said he’s confident about the firm’s momentum, and it has a lot of room to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Mr. Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, N.J. He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Mr. Lore has led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw, and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at firms with expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, signs indicate that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the growth was through Walmart.com, fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for those who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products, including from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, the research firm Euromonitor found. Wal-Mart is now in second ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich of research firm Evercore estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 a year on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others.

Photo courtesy of the Sneed family Crime May 30, 2017 7:31 PM Relatives await release of video in man’s fatal shooting by deputy at Raytown Wal-Mart By Ian Cummings icummings@kcstar.com and Matt Campbell mcampbell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A Jackson County sheriff’s deputy’s fatal shooting of an accused shoplifter Sunday night at a Raytown Wal-Mart was captured by store security cameras and remains under investigation, according to authorities. The video has not been released pending the sheriff’s office investigation into the shooting of Donald Sneed III, 31, who died following a struggle with the deputy outside the front doors of the store at 10300 E. U.S. 350. The deputy was working off-duty security at the store and was trying to help store employees who had stopped Sneed for allegedly shoplifting when Sneed disarmed the deputy of her stun gun and shocked her in the neck with it, according to Sgt. John Payne, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office. The deputy shot Sneed to protect herself and others in the store, Payne said in a statement. Following the investigation, the case will be submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor’s office for a decision on whether charges should be filed. Sneed’s relatives have said they are eager for more information about the shooting, and about how the alleged theft turned into a deadly physical confrontation. The sheriff’s office has declined to say how many shots were fired, how many times Sneed was hit, what Sneed was accused of shoplifting or how long the deputy has been on the force. Sneed’s wife, Rachel Sneed, said she was shocked at Sneed’s death but also knew he had been in trouble recently. At the time of the shooting, Sneed was wanted for felony arrest warrants on charges of robbery and tampering with a motor vehicle. The couple had a 10-year-old daughter and had been separated for some time while Sneed struggled with substance abuse problems and spent time in Colorado and Florida. Sneed, a carpenter by trade, had also been a parent to Rachel Sneed’s three children from a previous relationship. “They are pretty shook up,” Rachel Sneed said of the children. “He was really good with kids,” she said. “He was actually a really good person once upon a time. He was very, very sweet. He loved to make people laugh. He would carry an older lady’s groceries to her car at the store. He just went down the wrong road.” Sneed had been an accomplished athlete and had earned a black belt in taekwondo, Rachel Sneed said. “He was trying to get his life back,” she said. “He was trying to put himself back together for his daughter, he really was.” According to the sheriff’s office, the incident at the Wal-Mart began shortly before 10 p.m. when the deputy recognized Sneed as being wanted on arrest warrants. She alerted store employees, who allegedly watched Sneed shoplift some merchandise. Two store employees contacted Sneed as he exited the store, and a struggle ensued. The deputy began to help the employees, and Sneed reportedly fought with the deputy. The deputy discharged her stun gun at Sneed, but to no effect. Then Sneed allegedly took the stun gun away from the deputy and used it on her. The deputy shot Sneed with her duty weapon. Emergency medical personnel arrived and rendered aid to both Sneed and the deputy. The deputy was treated at a hospital and released. The sheriff’s office has not described her injuries. The deputy will be on administrative leave while the shooting is under investigation by the sheriff’s office criminal investigations unit.

Last Memorial Day I became a little upset that Chipley did not display flags. I admired Wausau for their flags and stated that on my Facebook page. I was then challenged to do something about it and I took the challenge. By July 4th I had 100 flags, 75 sponsored in Honor of or in Memory of someone’s loved one. A blue ribbon, with the loved one’s name embroidered on it, was attached to each flag pole. Next was how to display them. One day it just came to me that we could use umbrella bases. After going to every Walmart and every Lowes, my family had 100 bases for the 100 flags. Now it came to what to put in the base to weight them down. For July 4th I used water but between leaks and the hot weather (evaporating) it just did not work as well as we wanted. Sand/dirt came next. The problem was that the bases had to have a flap cut into them so that the dirt could go in and this weakened the base. We used these for Veterans Day but the dirt clomped because moisture seeped into it. This made the flags tilt. After much thought, me and my husband came up with using mortar/cement with bases that are wider on the bottom and gradually become small to the top, pyramid shape. We labored to fill 62 bases and the results were great, no leakage, no clomping. This Memorial Day I had over 140 flags to display and the flags had to go out early because my husband was going to be out of town and it can not be done without him. Tuesday night I did not sleep, I had just seen on the news that we were going to have wind gust up to 25 miles and I was not sure the bases would hold. At 5am Wednesday we put the flags out and because there was little wind they looked great. As I finished and was heading home one of the flags fell over. I rushed to Walmart and bought 25 gallon jugs of water and added water to each of the bases to help weight them down. No luck. Between the wind gust and the tractor trailers rushing down 90, the bases could not hold the flags up. I don’t think I could have done anything to the bases to make them hold under the circumstances. I ended up meeting Chipley’s Chief of Police, who was nice enough to gather up the down flags and helped me load them into my van. I waited till that evening, when the winds died down, to set them back up. I am thankful to say the winds stayed under 10 MPH and the flags were fine. Yes, everyday a few flags had to be adjusted but not bad out of 142 flags. Now, I would do nothing to show disrespect to our flag and so I need to face two concerns. One concern was that the flags hang close to the ground.. Let me explain. I use 6 foot flag poles with 3ft by 5ft flags. The bases are 6 inches high and we use PVC pipe to fastened the pole into the base, which adds about an inch in height. Longer poles will make the flag too top heavy, which would make it easier to tip over. The flag does not touch the ground unless the pole becomes very tilted in the base. This can easily be fixed, just straighten it back up. Second concern is that the flags that get blown over and lay on the ground should be destroyed. I panicked on this one, Mother Nature has a mind of her own and the flags will tip over. I looked up flag etiquette and thankfully the flag can continue to be displayed and can even be washed. My family has put over 100 hours of love and labor into the flags and we are still learning. We will strengthen the bases once again before July 4 and will hopefully find an alternative by Veterans Day. We love Chipley, this country and the American flag and we humbly apologize to those that think we have been disrespectful in any way. The Veit Family Like this: Like Loading...

I get very emotional when I see all the flags displayed and am so thankful for all your time and effort! Thank you very much. Reply Dawn Veit says: May 30, 2017 at 1:32 pm Thank you Katherine. Your kind words are very much appreciated. Reply editor says: May 30, 2017 at 3:24 pm Dawn, Could you please provide some contact info for those wanting to sponsor a flag? Reply Dawn Veit says: May 30, 2017 at 5:14 pm To sponsor a flag just call or message me at 850-774-3564. You can sponsor a flag in Honor or in Memory of a love one, a family or a business. The cost is $75. I have 30 flags that need sponsors. Thank you! Reply Donna says: May 30, 2017 at 2:51 pm Thank you over and over again for the extreme effort in showing that Chipley, Florida is proud to be apart of the United States of America. Long has the respect been deteriorating across the country and we need to be careful to not lose the wonderful gift that so many lost their lives defending. Thank you and never apologize for your patriotic pride and love. Reply Dawn Veit says: May 30, 2017 at 5:22 pm Thank you Donna! If we all can work together we can once again bring back the respect for our beautiful flag and our wonderful country that has been, as you have said, deteriorating. Reply Karen Weeks says: June 1, 2017 at 1:50 pm Thanks to the Veit family for your love of country. Thank you for all the hard work that was put into the wonderful display!

Tech Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic Walmart Wal-Mart Explores Blockchain for Delivery Drones Robert Hackett May 30, 2017 Walmart has its eye on blockchain technology. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently published a patent filed by the mega-retailer for a "delivery management system" that aims to improve upon last mile shipping—the final stretch extending to consumers' homes—by using robotics, sensors, and yes, blockchains, also often referred to as distributed ledgers. Blockchains are a kind of data structure that's dispersed across a network of computers in a way that proponents say is more secure than traditional means of record-keeping. Some companies, like the Danish shipping giant Maersk, are banking on the tech potentially reducing fraud and inaccuracies in their supply chains. The patent application, entitled "Unmanned aerial delivery to secure location," describes a process by which Wal-Mart (wmt) could automate the logistics of delivery drones. Coindesk, a Bitcoin and blockchain-tracking trade site, first spotted the filing on Tuesday. Although the patent application is vague on specifics, its authors lay out the general mechanics of a hypothetical delivery. Here's how it works: As a drone approaches a delivery box, it authenticates itself with a "blockchain identifier," a type of numeric or encrypted key. If the code is valid, then the box unlocks, opens, and accepts the package. When a package arrives at its destination, its receipt could trigger a notification to be sent to a consumers' mobile device. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Wal-Mart can use a blockchain not only to authenticate identity, but to also track other useful information about a package as it moves through a supply chain, too. For instance, a blockchain-based database could log information such as time, location, handlers, delivery date, temperature, pickup protocols, and other data in a tamper-resistant format that's accessible to—and able to be trusted by—couriers, customers, and any other intermediaries along a package's route. Here's a diagram of the system. (You can read the details in the filing.) Wal-Mart has been exploring blockchain technology for some time. In October 2016, the company announced that it would partner with IBM (ibm) to digitally track shipments of pork in China using a blockchain. Wal-Mart filed a patent application for this delivery management system a year prior to the IBM announcement on November 25, 2015. (Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for more information about the filing.) Wal-Mart's initiative represents just one potential application of the still nascent technology. Blockchains continue to be hyped for their potential to disrupt many areas of business, including financial services, supply chains, media, and governance.

NBC By Kate Beckman May 30, 2017 From customers dressed in bizarre costumes to incidents involving bodily functions, Walmart workers — like their counterparts at Target — have to deal with some pretty WTF moments. Here, employees shared some of their craziest stories on condition of anonymity. 1. "There was a man using the hose we use to water our plants showering naked in the parking lot. He had put up a sheet to block one side but people could still see everything. When the manager told him to leave, he acted like there was nothing weird about it. He was extremely nonchalant, like he did this all the time, and he just packed up his sheet, got in his car, and left." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 2. "A lady came in with coupons that she clearly photocopied, and tried to use them to get majorly reduced prices on products like laundry detergent or paper towels. She got away with it because we had a new cashier, and with all of the coupons she used and the amount of money she saved on each item, the store ended up owing her money on what would have been a $600 purchase." 3. "A customer was buying some iced tea and it rang up for $4.68. She started arguing with me, saying that it was $3.33. I went back to where the tea was to check the signs, and it clearly said $4.68. I came back to tell her it rang up at the correct price and she goes to see for herself. Then she accused us of changing the prices while she was in line and started yelling about how we’re liars and stupid, and she’s going to call Walmart customer service to complain. The funny thing is, the price tags have the dates they were printed on them so she [should] have seen we were telling the truth." 4. "There was a group of two guys and three girls. They were in the kids' section, and the girls were throwing these big bouncy balls over the shelves to the other side, trying to hit the boys, who were riding bikes down the aisle. Then they grabbed skateboards and were riding them around the store, throwing random things into customers’ carts. They wouldn’t stop so we had to call the cops to escort them out."

He told her he couldn’t let her in because the floor was wet but she could use the bathroom near the front of the store. She went to the infants' clothing department and peed and pooped on the floor. She also managed to hide her face from the camera the entire time so we couldn’t even identify her to press charges." 6. "I was working register around 11:30 at night. I gave a lady her change and she threw it on the floor. I ask her why she threw it on the floor and she told me she wanted any children in the store to pick it up. I told her that there are no children around because it’s so late, and that maintenance would clean it up anyway. She told me to leave it on the ground." 7. "A woman came to guest services saying she wanted to return a basket because it was haunted. I asked her what she meant, and she said her boyfriend took a picture of it, and there was electrical frequency surrounding it, and she couldn’t keep it in her house. She had the receipt, so she was able to return it, but I still don’t understand how a basket could be haunted." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 8. "I was working at the service desk, and a woman rushes up and says she needs to talk to my manager. I sometimes can fix the problem so I asked her what she needed help with. Then she started yelling at me at the top of her lungs saying that the bathroom was closed and she peed on herself because it was closed. I explained that there was another bathroom in a different part of the store that was open. In the middle of me explaining that, she runs out of the store before I could get my manager and I never saw her again." 9. "There’s a guy who comes into the store regularly and always has a beer can suctioned to his forehead. We found out it’s some kind of advertising for a company but it’s still pretty weird to see him walking around the store like that." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 10. "A man came into the store wearing a clown outfit and gory clown makeup. It was around Halloween, so he probably worked at a haunted house, but it was pretty scary. He was just walking around, shopping for his dinner." 11. "When I first started as a cashier, I was always at the register near one of the bathrooms. People would always come to me and tell me that maintenance needed to go to the bathroom because someone wrote on the wall in poop. It weirdly was a semi-regular occurrence. I’m not sure if it was one person coming back or multiple people, but it stopped after a few months." 12. "I was working the checkout line, and I’m not sure if one woman cut another one in line or bumped her with her cart, but these two women start arguing. Both of them had their preteen children with them. It ended with one woman telling the other that she hoped she got in a car accident on her way home." 13. "A guy came into the store in a full gorilla suit. He was just doing his shopping like normal. At some point, we asked him to take the mask off for security reasons. He did and just continued his shopping." 14. "I saw a grown man walking around the store one night wearing one-piece purple pajamas with cartoon characters on it. He was probably in his late 30s or early 40s. A group of teenagers was laughing at him as he walked around but he seemed pretty unfazed." 15. "Not many customers realize that Walmart does price matching. One customer totally went to the extreme and designed his own ads with extremely discounted prices on name brands. I would have totally bought it, but the prices were ridiculous. For example, Tide laundry detergent usually goes between $9 to $12 and this person had it down to $3. I played it off like everything was cool and called my manager. Next thing you know, this person is calling me every name in the book, threatening to sue me, and he literally called the police on me. Once the police arrived, my manager and I explained the situation to them and ended up having the customer sign a 'No trespassing on premises' form to avoid any more scenes with him. He ended up getting escorted out of the building by the cops. Funny thing is, I saw him at another store doing the same exact thing but with coupons." Follow Kate on Twitter.

Witnesses spotted the black bear outside the Somerset store at around 1:30 a.m., and called police and Kentucky Fish and Wildlife officials to help remove it. "We seen it running down the sidewalk in front of the outdoor living center outside of Walmart, and me and six other cars tried to keep the bear from going towards the customer entrance," customer Malcolm Stephens told LEX 18. Avid hunters Tyler and Travis Smith captured footage of the bear while maintaining a safe distance, but said a large crowd eventually formed around the animal. "They realized what was going on, everyone walked over here and saw that there was a bear and it drew a huge crowd of people. I bet there [were]...70 or 80 people standing around with their phones out, cameras, pictures, videos, and the bear showed no fear whatsoever and laid there like a dog would," Tyler Smith said. Officials used their sirens to scare the bear into a safe area. They believe the animal eventually made its way back into the woods.

Amazon stock hit 1,001.20 shortly after Tuesday’s opening bell, up about 40% from a year ago and more than 2X the 15% gainer of the S&P 500 Index in the same frame. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its US success abroad. The 1,000 share price also puts Amazon’s market value at about $478-B, 2X that of rival Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and more than 15X the size of Target (NYSE:TGT). The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said an analyst at Cowen, who recently upped his Amazon price target to 1,125 a share. Amazon has come a long way since its start in Y 1995, when it mostly sold books. The Seattle company now sells just about anything, from groceries to small appliances, and has been blamed for taking business away from department stores, supermarkets and clothing retailers. Amazon’s ventures far beyond online retail, from cloud computing to movie making, are raising questions among corporate strategy experts about its focus. The company wowed Wall Street recently with a 23% jump in sales, pushing its shares to an all-time high. But there are concerns that if blockbuster growth stops, investors may come to regard the company more like a conglomerate stock, usually worth less than the sum of its pieces. Investors also put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than 4X faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-Commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80-M Prime subscribers in the US as of 31 March, an increase of 38% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-Commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. (NYSE:M) and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s 2nd wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-Founder Bill Gates, according to the Billionaires Index. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world,” said on shareholder.

Shoppers at a Wal-Mart in Riverdale, Utah, noticed that something was wrong with a car that was parked on the lot, and a few of them came closer to investigate the matter. It did not take long to realize that two kids were apparently locked in the trunk. If leaving pets or children in the backseat of an automobile during extreme temperatures is dangerous, placing any living being in the trunk is insane. The action would not even be fun as a prank between friends, as someone could suffer from a panic attack or just die because of heat stroke or freeze to death if locked in the luggage compartment. We did not even mention getting asphyxiated, which is also a possibility in extreme conditions. According to Deseret News, the woman went shopping at the store nearby and faced the officers waiting by the unspecified car after her daughter was instructed to pull the safety latch of the trunk. The police were called by a witness who remained nameless, and he or she claimed seeing the 39-year-old locking two kids in the trunk. It is unclear if the statement reflects reality, or if the children, aged two and five, managed to enter the luggage compartment after being left on the back seats. Most hatchbacks, sedans, and wagons have a mechanism that makes it easy to fold the backrests of the rear seats to access the trunk, and it would not be impossible for a curious five-year-old to open the said compartment. However, if there is a credible witness that claims that the mother did put her kids in the trunk, things are entirely different from a legal and moral standpoint. Even if her kids managed to enter the trunk themselves, the woman is still at blame, because it is not wise to lock living beings in a vehicle. heatstroke hot cars negligence USA Utah   The End of Sedans is Nigh!

Amazon shares hit $1,001.20 in New York on May 30, up about 40% from a year ago and more than double the 15% gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen and Co., who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. "There’s a long runway there," he said. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." RELATED: Amazon's delivery-drone research focuses on avoiding birds The Seattle company’s $478 billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to eMarketer Inc.

Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. RELATED: Analysis - will Amazon revolutionize shipping? Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centers and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8 billion into Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner, up 18% from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and judge on the television show "Shark Tank." “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster.

Rachel Jacoby ZoldanMay 30, 2017 10:05AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest When it comes to the best drugstore foundations, Maybelline FIT Me foundation is both a winner in terms of its actual product payoff (not to mention staying power), but also for its wallet-friendly price tag of $5.94 per bottle. Now, Maybelline has expanded its shade range, adding 16 new hues to the line, all available online at any of the brand's retailers or in-store exclusively at Wal-Mart. While the news of the new shades of Maybelline Fit Me Foundation literally just dropped yesterday on Twitter and on Instagram, it looks like Wal-Mart's already sold out of many of the new colors online, particularly the shades for darker complexions. (Twitter users have also called out the shades not being available on Amazon yet, either.) But Maybelline promised that even if they've sold out of some of the range online at various e-tailers, they'll be hitting Wal-Mart stores in June (aka, later this week). Which led to a huge sigh of relief on the social network — after all, Fit Me is one of the all-time foundation greats for oily skin. Not only is it free of any oils itself, but it has that ~blurring~ effect that makes your skin look all velvety and smooth, even when you're sweaty. https://twitter.com/Maybelline/status/869218247677165568 What's more, Maybelline Fit Me was already known for its wide shade range, with a slew of different undertones offered — so its highly likely that the brand may have just won legions of new foundation fans. Take a look at a few of the best Twitter responses to Maybelline's swatch update below, then head over to walmart.com to see if your shade is in stock. https://twitter.com/antoniobtwo/status/869219984156889089 https://twitter.com/bedofroses2001/status/869221143349252096 https://twitter.com/Maybelline/status/869287595993202689 Related: These Are the Best Foundations for Oily Skin You might also like: follow us Facebook Twitter Pinterest Recommended for You Follow:FacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestWe Heart ItTumblrYouTubeGoogle Plustoggle social menu Condé Nast Condé Nast Websites Allure Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Style Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Site MapContact usNewsletter SignupSubscriptionsIn this issue CareersCondé Nast StoreReprints/PermissionsParsons x TeenVogue Accessibility Help Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (Revised 1/2/2014).  Teen Vogue may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.  Your California Privacy Rights.

The NRDC’s new report, entitled “Crying Fowl: Major Grocers Stumble in Promoting Antibiotic Stewardship in Retail Chicken,” was released yesterday and investigates if and how Costco, Albertson’s/Safeway, Publix, Walmart, and Kroger market and sell antibiotic-free chicken brands.   These five chains represent more than 50 percent of the market share in North America. Overall scores attributed to each of the retailers in the report were as follows: Costco (40%), Albertson’s/Safeway (39%), Publix (38%), Walmart (38%), and Kroger (33%). “The grades reflect the fact that none of the top five retailers have made a strong public commitment to addressing antibiotic overuse in the supply chains for chicken sold in their stores,” notes a news release for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The top five grocery store chains in the country feed millions of Americans, so their actions have a big impact on public health — for better or worse,” said Carmen Cordova, staff scientist with the NRDC. “Supermarkets can either continue to ignore the spread of drug-resistant infections, or they can answer their customers’ call to be a part of the solution.” While this is certainly a hurdle to overcome, many retailers and restaurants in the United States have committed to addressing antibiotic overuse in livestock, particularly in recent months. Whole Foods, for example, has a storewide policy for antibiotic-free meat, and several fast food restaurants including KFC, McDonald’s, Burger King, Jack in the Box, and Subway have committed to move toward antibiotic-free chicken over the next few months or years. “In the absence of action at the federal level, consumers have been driving the move toward meat raised with responsible antibiotics use,” said Cordova. “The fast food industry has been leading the way—but people want to be able to eat better meat at home too. Our report shows that grocery stores have a lot of catching up to do.” More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics sold in the United States are destined for livestock use. In an overwhelming majority of these cases, antibiotics are distributed in regular low doses to promote fast growth of animals and prevent, rather than cure, diseases brought about by unsanitary living conditions. This practice promotes the development of dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can be extremely harmful to both humans and animals.

By Nicole Aschoff / The Guardian May 29, 2017, 12:24 PM GMT Print Comments Photo Credit: Wikimedia It’s hard to think of a better poster child for “conscious capitalism” than Whole Foods Market, the high-end grocery store that made a name for itself selling organic produce in feel-good, mood-lit stores. These days, the chain is floundering and a potential buyout is on the horizon. What does that say about the conscious capitalism it championed?  Same-store sales have declined for six straight quarters, and Barclay analyst Karen Short estimates that 14 million Whole Foods customers walked away during the same period. Last month activist hedge fund Jana Partners swooped in, buying up 8.3% of the company’s shares and demanding an overhaul. Whole Foods responded by reshuffling its board, bringing in a handful of big box retail stars and promoting Gabrielle Sulzberger, who hails from private equity, to chairwoman. A failing firm isn’t exactly news. In the dog-eat-dog world of global capitalism lots of companies have their moment in the sun only to crash and burn a few years later. But Whole Foods was supposed to be different.  John Mackey, the company’s chief executive, has long argued that Whole Foods is wired differently — that it runs on a “conscious capitalism” model that outsmarts the competitive pressures of our for-profit system through creativity and innovation.  In his book, Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business: Conscious Capitalism, Mackey argues that his conscious capitalism model achieves success by honoring not just shareholders, but all stakeholders, including workers, communities, and the environment. The Whole Foods founder penned his treatise in response to the growing consensus that capitalism is doing irreparable harm to the planet and the people who live on it. Our for-profit system is increasingly viewed as a zero sum game in which ecological destruction, climate change, and rising inequality are firmly linked to the rapacious behavior of multi-national corporations. Mackey agrees that humans are harming the planet, but he doesn’t think the problem lies in capitalism. Free market capitalism, according to Mackey, is actually a “beautiful,” “heroic,” system that, properly harnessed, can operate “in harmony with the fundamentals of human nature” and the planet.  We don’t need to rein in corporations through onerous labor and environmental regulations, he writes, because the virtuous feedback loop of honoring stakeholders plus innovation will leave “unconscious” firms like Walmart in the dust. The conscious capitalism model is appealing. It’s simple, easy. We can avert looming environmental catastrophe by becoming conscious consumers who frequent conscious companies. After all, shopping at Whole Foods is a heck of a lot more fun than lobbying for regulations on corporations or convincing people to consume less. More Whole Foods, less Walmart. Problem solved. Mackey was right about one thing. People do love to shop at Whole Foods, or at least they used to. These days that demon called competition has caught up with the Austin-based company. Behemoths like Kroger, Safeway, Target, and even Walmart now offer a wide-range of organic produce for considerably less than “Whole Paycheck.” Mackey’s conscious company has gone from Wall Street darling to Wall Street basket case in the blink of an eye. The future of conscious capitalism appears equally bleak. To placate shareholders and mitigate declining same-store sales, last year the company jettisoned its unique purchasing model that wove together a network of autonomous regional production hubs of small farmers and mom-and-pop food startups.  It’s now prioritizing a centralized, bulk-buying strategy that looks a lot like, well, Walmart. It also initiated a $1.25bn share buyback program and has promised to cut costs by $300 million and raise same-store sales 2% by 2020. But according to its 13D filing, Jana Partners — whose founder and fund manager Barry Rosenstein recently bought the most expensive home in America — wants even more. Like Whole Foods, Jana is experiencing a slump, suffering negative returns in 12 of the last 19 months; it’s expecting to cash in on its investment in the organics chain. A potential forced sale, most likely to private equity investors known for slash and burn tactics, remains on the near-term horizon. The point of this dour appraisal is not to crow over Whole Foods’ misfortune. It’s to take a hard look at models that claim to solve the ills of capitalism without challenging the in-built drives of our for-profit system.  Mackey has loudly declared unions akin to herpes and state regulation little more than “crony capitalism” — that all we need to solve things like the climate crisis are better, smarter, “conscious” capitalists. The crisis of Whole Foods belies this notion. There’s no way to “fix” corporations’ compulsion to produce ever more, ever more cheaply. It’s written into the DNA of global capitalism. Attractive as the conscious capitalism model may be, we simply can’t rely on companies to deliver dignified workplaces, equitable models of food production or a better relationship between consumers and the planet.  All stakeholders are not equal in our global economy, and even the best-intentioned businesses run up against the implacable foes of profit and competition. Ultimately, the thorny problem of sustaining both decent livelihoods and a livable planet won’t be solved by buying better things. It’ll be solved through political struggle and demands that put people before profit.         Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Sign Up!

The first-quarter earnings reporting season is all but over, and the president was abroad for his first international trip as sitting head of state. Still, Benzinga has featured a look at many investor favorite stocks in recent days. Here is a look at just a few of them, as Americans travel, gather and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Somewhere To Go "Analysts Cautiously Optimistic On Ford CEO Shakeup" by Shanthi Rexaline takes a look at the surprising management changes at Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) announced last week. Is it a step in the right direction, and how effective will the new chief executive be? Are there spin-offs in the offing? In "Tesla's Safety Record Called Into Question, And The Market Couldn't Care Less," Shanthi Rexaline examines the effect that a recent report about safety issues at its flagship plant in California has had on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares. The stock has pulled back from an all-time high earlier this month. Something To Eat Ezra Schwarzbaum's "Wal-Mart Puts Pressure On Grocers, But Kroger Could Resist" discusses why even though recent gains at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) may mean there is less for its supermarket competitors, Kroger Co (NYSE: KR) may be better positioned than other peers to suffer. Also check out "Nobody Told Costco About The Retail Slump." Years of interaction with Shake Shack Inc (NYSE: SHAK) have convinced one key analyst that it is a company that is "standing for something good," according to "Analyst Says Long-Term Investors In Shake Shack Should Continue Buying Shares" by Merrick Weingarten. Will profits really increase "at a double-digit pace"? Something To Watch In Elizabeth Balboa's "Which Media Firms Are Benefiting Most From President Trump?" see who the winners and losers are in the often combative relationship between the media and the current administration: from CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS) to New York Times Co (NYSE: NYT) and from Fox News to Saturday Night Live.

The suspect was identified as Donald Sneed, 31 years old, of the Kansas City area. Sneed had active felony warrants for robbery and tampering with a motor vehicle. Sgt. John Payne says the shooting happened about 9:30 p.m., Sunday. He says the off-duty deputy was working security at the Wal-Mart at 10300 E. Missouri 350 when she recognized a wanted man. She notified the store's loss prevention department, which then watched as the suspect shoplifted some merchandise. Two store employees contacted the man as he left the store, and a struggle began. Payne says that when the deputy began helping with apprehending the man, he started fighting with her. She stunned him with her Taser, but it apparently had no effect on him as he continued resisting. The deputy then applied the stun gun directly to his body but it still had no effect. As they struggled, the suspect got control of the Taser and stunned the deputy in the neck. At that point, she shot the suspect, fearing for her life and others' lives, Payne says. Payne says the suspect was taken to a hospital, where he later died. The deputy was treated for injuries and released.

Trump himself kept everyone in suspense on the question of staying or leaving, saying he was still listening to “a lot of people both ways” but promising a decision “very soon.” The White House signaled that Trump was likely to decide on exiting the global pact – fulfilling one of his principal campaign pledges – though top aides were deeply divided. And the final decision may not be entirely clear-cut: Aides were still deliberating on “caveats in the language,” one official said. Everyone cautioned that no decision was final until Trump announced it. The president has been known to change his thinking on major decisions and tends to seek counsel from both inside and outside advisers, many with differing agendas, until the last minute. Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from a raft of international allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution by reducing carbon emissions in nearly 200 nations. While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and the Vatican. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world’s industrialized economies. American corporate leaders have also appealed to the businessman-turned-president to stay. They include Apple, Google and Walmart. Even fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the United States should abide by the deal. Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama enacted the deal without U.S. Senate ratification. A formal withdrawal would take years, experts say, a situation that led the president of the European Commission to speak dismissively of Trump on Wednesday. Trump doesn’t “comprehensively understand” the terms of the accord, though European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him “in clear, simple sentences” during summit meetings last week, Jean-Claude Juncker said in Berlin. “It looks like that attempt failed,” Juncker said. “This notion, ‘I am Trump, I am American, America first and I am getting out,’ that is not going to happen.” Some of Trump’s aides have been searching for a middle ground – perhaps by renegotiating the terms of the agreement – in an effort to thread the needle between his base of supporters who oppose the deal and those warning that a U.S. exit would deal a blow to the fight against global warming as well as to worldwide U.S. leadership. That fight has played out within Trump’s administration in an extraordinarily public deliberation. Trump met Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has favored remaining in the agreement. Chief strategist Steve Bannon supports an exit, as does Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has discussed the possibility of changing the U.S. carbon reduction targets instead of pulling out of the deal completely. Senior adviser Jared Kushner generally thinks the deal is bad but still would like to see if emissions targets can be changed. Trump’s influential daughter Ivanka Trump’s preference is to stay, but she has made it a priority to establish a review process so her father would hear from all sides, said a senior administration official. Like the other officials, that person was not authorized to describe the private discussions by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Trump has several options, climate experts said. The emissions goals are voluntary with no real consequences for countries that fail to meet them. That means the U.S. could stay in the accord and choose not to hit its goals or stay in the pact but adjust its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has agreed to reduce its emissions by 2025 to 26 percent to 28 percent of 2005 levels – about 1.6 billion tons. “Paris more than anything is a symbol,” said Nigel Purvis, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations Another option, said University of California, Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, would be for Trump to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty on which the Paris accord was based, which would take only a year. News of Trump’s expected decision drew swift reaction from the United Nations. The organization’s main Twitter page quoted Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as saying, “Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.” Scientists say that Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year – enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather. The Sierra Club’s executive director, Michael Brune, called the expected move a “historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality.” Trump claimed before taking office that climate change was a “hoax” created by the Chinese to hurt the U.S. economy, an assertion that stands in defiance of broad scientific consensus. He has spent his first months in office working to delay and roll back federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions while pledging to revive long-struggling U.S. coal mines. But Cohn, Trump’s chief White House economic adviser, told reporters during the trip abroad that the president’s views on climate change were “evolving” following the discussions with European leaders. Still, Cohn said that the carbon levels agreed to by the prior administration “would be highly crippling to the U.S. economic growth,” and if the president had to choose between limiting carbon and economic growth, “growing our economy is going to win.” Supporters of the deal say it’s not an either-or choice.

Framing his decision as "a reassertion of America's sovereignty," Trump said he was "elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." He said the U.S. could try to re-enter the deal under more favourable terms or work to establish "an entirely new transaction." But he indicated that was hardly a priority. "If we can, great. If we can't, that's fine," he said. Scientists say Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner as a result of the president's decision because America's pollution contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide a year — enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather. By abandoning the world's chief effort to slow the tide of planetary warming, Trump was fulfilling a top campaign pledge after weeks of building up suspense over his decision. The White House indicated it would follow the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal. That means the U.S. would remain in the agreement, at least formally, for another three-and-a-half years, ensuring the issue remains alive in the next presidential election. However, Trump declared, emphasizing every word: "As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord." He is breaking from many of America's staunchest allies, who have expressed alarm about the decision. Several of his top aides also opposed the action, including his daughter Ivanka Trump. Under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. had agreed under the accord to reduce polluting emissions by more than a quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. But the national targets are voluntary, leaving room for the U.S. and the nearly 200 other countries in the agreement to alter their commitments. The leaders of France, Germany and Italy joined to "note with regret" the Trump decision and express doubts about any change in the accord. "We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible, and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies," wrote French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni. The White House said Trump spoke with the leaders of Germany, France, Canada and Britain Thursday to explain his decision and reassured them that the U.S. is committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and "robust efforts to protect the environment." At home, the U.S. Conference of Mayors strongly opposed the decision and said the nation's mayors will continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. Responding to Trump's pointing to his city, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called the decision "disastrous for our planet, for cities such as Pittsburgh," and a step that "has made America weaker and the world less safe." In a rare statement on his successor's policies, Obama said: "Even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future, I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got." Business leaders, normally strong supporters of Republican initiatives, had vigorously appealed to Trump not to abandon the agreement. Many economists believe the accord would likely help create about as many jobs in renewable energy as it might cost in polluting industries. The president, however, argued the agreement had disadvantaged the U.S. "to the exclusive benefit of other countries," leaving American businesses and taxpayers to absorb the cost. The immediate impact of Trump's move could be largely symbolic. The White House said the U.S. will stop contributing to the United Nations Green Climate Fund and will stop reporting carbon data as required by the Paris accord, although domestic regulations require that reporting anyway. The decision has no direct impact on major U.S. regulations on power plants and car rules currently aimed at reducing carbon emissions, although those are currently under review by Trump as well. "This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States," Trump said. Congressional Republicans applauded the decision, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky saying Trump had "put families and jobs ahead of left-wing ideology and should be commended." But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called it "a stunning abdication of American leadership and a grave threat to our planet's future." Trump spoke from the White House Rose Garden on a warm, sunny day. Seated in the front row were aides who had advocated for the withdrawal, including EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon. During Trump's speech, the faint sounds of protesters could be heard in the distance banging drums. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had urged Trump to stay in the Paris deal, did not attend the ceremony, nor did Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, both close advisers to the president who supported staying in the agreement. A White House official said the couple instead attended service at synagogue for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Business investors seemed pleased, with stock prices, already up for the day, bumping higher as he spoke and the Dow Jones industrial average rising 135 points for the day. As for the mechanics of withdrawal, international treaties have a four-year cooling off period from the time they go into effect. Trump promised to stop implementation of the "non-binding" parts of the deal immediately. The U.S. is the world's second-largest emitter of carbon, following only China. Beijing, however, has reaffirmed its commitment to meeting its targets under the Paris accord, recently cancelling construction of about 100 coal-fired power plants and investing billions in massive wind and solar projects. White House aides have been divided on the question of staying or leaving the accord and had been deliberating on "caveats in the language" as late as Wednesday, one official said. But Trump's statement was clear and direct. So was opposition from environmental groups. "Generations from now, Americans will look back at Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris Agreement as one of the most ignorant and dangerous actions ever taken by any president," Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune said in a statement. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas, Erica Werner, Vivian Salama, Julie Pace, Michael Biesecker, Seth Borenstein and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.

Trump himself kept everyone in suspense on the question of staying or leaving, saying he was still listening to “a lot of people both ways” but promising a decision “very soon.” The White House signalled that Trump was likely to decide on exiting the global pact – fulfilling one of his principal campaign pledges – though top aides were deeply divided. And the final decision may not be entirely clear-cut: Aides were still deliberating on “caveats in the language,” one official said. Everyone cautioned that no decision was final until Trump announced it. The president has been known to change his thinking on major decisions and tends to seek counsel from both inside and outside advisers, many with differing agendas, until the last minute. Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from a raft of international allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution by reducing carbon emissions in nearly 200 nations. While travelling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and the Vatican. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world’s industrialized economies. American corporate leaders have also appealed to the businessman-turned-president to stay. They include Apple, Google and Walmart. Even fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the United States should abide by the deal. Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama enacted the deal without U.S. Senate ratification. A formal withdrawal would take years, experts say, a situation that led the president of the European Commission to speak dismissively of Trump on Wednesday. Trump doesn’t “comprehensively understand” the terms of the accord, though European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him “in clear, simple sentences” during summit meetings last week, Jean-Claude Juncker said in Berlin. “It looks like that attempt failed,” Juncker said. “This notion, ‘I am Trump, I am American, America first and I am getting out,’ that is not going to happen.” Some of Trump’s aides have been searching for a middle ground – perhaps by renegotiating the terms of the agreement – in an effort to thread the needle between his base of supporters who oppose the deal and those warning that a U.S. exit would deal a blow to the fight against global warming as well as to worldwide U.S. leadership. That fight has played out within Trump’s administration in an extraordinarily public deliberation. Trump met Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has favoured remaining in the agreement. Chief strategist Steve Bannon supports an exit, as does Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has discussed the possibility of changing the U.S. carbon reduction targets instead of pulling out of the deal completely. Senior adviser Jared Kushner generally thinks the deal is bad but still would like to see if emissions targets can be changed. Trump’s influential daughter Ivanka Trump’s preference is to stay, but she has made it a priority to establish a review process so her father would hear from all sides, said a senior administration official. Like the other officials, that person was not authorized to describe the private discussions by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Trump has several options, climate experts said. The emissions goals are voluntary with no real consequences for countries that fail to meet them. That means the U.S. could stay in the accord and choose not to hit its goals or stay in the pact but adjust its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has agreed to reduce its emissions by 2025 to 26 per cent to 28 per cent of 2005 levels – about 1.6 billion tons. “Paris more than anything is a symbol,” said Nigel Purvis, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations Another option, said University of California, Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, would be for Trump to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty on which the Paris accord was based, which would take only a year. News of Trump’s expected decision drew swift reaction from the United Nations. The organization’s main Twitter page quoted Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as saying, “Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.” Scientists say that Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year – enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather. The Sierra Club’s executive director, Michael Brune, called the expected move a “historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality.” Trump claimed before taking office that climate change was a “hoax” created by the Chinese to hurt the U.S. economy, an assertion that stands in defiance of broad scientific consensus. He has spent his first months in office working to delay and roll back federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions while pledging to revive long-struggling U.S. coal mines. But Cohn, Trump’s chief White House economic adviser, told reporters during the trip abroad that the president’s views on climate change were “evolving” following the discussions with European leaders. Still, Cohn said that the carbon levels agreed to by the prior administration “would be highly crippling to the U.S. economic growth,” and if the president had to choose between limiting carbon and economic growth, “growing our economy is going to win.” Supporters of the deal say it’s not an either-or choice. ___ Associated Press writers Catherine Lucy, Michael Biesecker and Seth Borenstein in Washington, and Lorne Cook in Brussels, contributed to this report. 00000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called President Donald Trump’s budget a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called President Donald Trump’s budget a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1 percent. "Why is it more important to give a $100 billion tax break to 3 of the wealthiest families than to feed, house and educate 15 million people?" Sanders tweeted May 25. Why is it more important to give a $100 billion tax break to 3 of the wealthiest families than to feed, house and educate 15 million people?— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 25, 2017 We decided to fact-check whether the Trump budget indeed bestows a $100 billion tax break on three of the wealthiest families in the United States. The accusation runs into trouble by running away with a flawed analysis of Trump’s tax plan. Sanders’ source is a report prepared by Democrats on the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. The report shows the maximum estate tax liability for a group of wealthy Americans, including billionaires and some members of the Trump administration, and how much they would stand to gain if the estate tax were repealed. The three billionaire families listed on the chart are the Walton family of Wal-Mart, Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries, and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. According to the report, these families stand to gain $52 billion, $38 billion and $12 billion respectively in tax breaks under Trump’s proposal, or $102 billion all together. How? The rules for the estate tax allow a person to inherit almost $5.5 million tax free. Above that, Washington collects 40 percent. Senate Democrats took the total net worth of those three households, reduced it by the tax-exempt amount, and assumed the remainder would be taxed at the 40 percent rate. The problem is, experts said, Sanders miscast Trump’s tax plan, and the Democratic calculations are overly simple. Trump’s actual tax plan Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Brookings-Urban Institute Tax Policy Center, said Sanders is not fully capturing Trump's proposal for the estate tax. "Trump has proposed replacing the estate tax with a requirement that estates pay income tax on all of an estate's unrealized capital gains," Williams said. Unrealized capital gains are the profits made when an investment, such as a building or shares of stock, is sold.   "If a high-value estate had unrealized gains, it would pay income tax on those gains at the top rate of 20 percent rather than an estate tax at a 40 percent rate," he said. He gave an example: An estate worth $50 billion with $25 billion of unrealized gains would pay income tax of $5 billion under Trump’s plan -- a lot less than the $20 billion that would be owed in today’s tax system, but "not zero." Sanders assumed those wealthy family members would pay nothing, and that’s not certain. It should be noted that Trump has not said anything about unrealized capital gains in his budget, although he makes a mention of doing away with most special interest tax breaks without clarifying what those tax breaks are. But even in the absence of any tax on unrealized capital gains, the three wealthy families still wouldn’t net $100 billion under the estate tax abolition plan. Here’s why. Estates rarely pay the 40 percent estate tax Although the estate tax is 40 percent, a slew of deductions bring down the taxable value of the estate reduce the effective tax rate. Those deductions include charitable bequests, among other loopholes. There’s a big gap between the size of the estates the Democrats relied on and the size in the eyes of the IRS, said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. The Democrats relied on estimates from Forbes magazine, and Pomerleau said by one estimate, the actual number is about half that. "And then according to the IRS, taxable estate is about 30 percent of gross estate," he said. "Taking these together, taxable estate -- what the IRS applies the 40 percent rate to -- is about 15 percent of what is publicly reported on average." Pomerleau said by his estimate, the total value of the estate tax bill for those three families would be closer to $16 billion. Williams at the Tax Policy Center agreed. Any person with a very large estate would bring on an estate tax lawyer to structure his or her estate in ways that would reduce estate tax. "It is hard to imagine that those families would ever be taxed on the full value of their wealth, given the many ways available to reduce estate valuations, pass wealth to subsequent generations at reduced value, and use other techniques to delay or cut estate tax liabilities," he said. This means it is highly unlikely that wealthy families would ever pay 40 percent tax on their wealth under the current estate tax law. Eliminating the estate tax thus would not save them 40 percent of their wealth relative to current law. Other tax changes Trump’s budget also proposes other tax measures, including doing away with the alternate minimum tax, lowering the top individual tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, and repealing taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Affordable Care Act. While Sanders’ office only pointed to the estate tax, his tweet was more expansive, so we asked our experts to assess the impact. They said while these factors would indeed help the wealthy save money it would be difficult to estimate it in dollars in the absence of tax returns. We raised this issue with Sanders’ office and did not hear back. Our ruling Sanders said Trump’s budget gives a $100 billion tax break to three of the wealthiest families. His office pointed to a Democratic analysis that assumed the total elimination of the estate tax. But Trump’s proposal would retain a measure to tax some portion of inherited wealth. On top of that, the experts we reached told us that careful tax planning reduces the government’s take under current law. They said the Democrats greatly exaggerated the potential tax bills these families face, and the real cost would be considerably less than $100 billion. Trump’s tax plan has other features that would cut taxes on the super wealthy, but it isn’t possible to quantify the impact with any accuracy. The three wealthy families Sanders had in mind would benefit handsomely under Trump’s plan, but his office did not provide evidence that held up, and experts said the total would likely be less than the $100 billion he said. We rate this claim Mostly False.

A White House official says President Donald Trump is expected to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. Susan Walsh, File AP Photo Business June 01, 2017 1:12 AM Trump to announce decision on Paris climate pact Thursday By JILL COLVIN and JULIE PACE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON President Donald Trump says he will announce his decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord during a Rose Garden event Thursday afternoon. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." The White House signaled that Trump was likely to decide on exiting the global pact — fulfilling one of his principal campaign pledges — though top aides were divided. And the final decision may not be entirely clear-cut: Aides were still deliberating on "caveats in the language," one official said. Everyone cautioned that no decision was final until Trump announced it. The president has been known to change his thinking on major decisions and tends to seek counsel from both inside and outside advisers, many with differing agendas, until the last minute. Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from a raft of international allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution by reducing carbon emissions in nearly 200 nations. While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and the Vatican. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. American corporate leaders have also appealed to the businessman-turned-president to stay. They include Apple, Google and Walmart. Even fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the United States should abide by the deal. Trump's predecessor Barack Obama enacted the deal without U.S. Senate ratification. A formal withdrawal would take years, experts say, a situation that led the president of the European Commission to speak dismissively of Trump on Wednesday. Trump doesn't "comprehensively understand" the terms of the accord, though European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him "in clear, simple sentences" during summit meetings last week, Jean-Claude Juncker said in Berlin. "It looks like that attempt failed," Juncker said. "This notion, 'I am Trump, I am American, America first and I am getting out,' that is not going to happen." Some of Trump's aides have been searching for a middle ground — perhaps by renegotiating the terms of the agreement — in an effort to thread the needle between his base of supporters who oppose the deal and those warning that a U.S. exit would deal a blow to the fight against global warming as well as to worldwide U.S. leadership. That fight has played out within Trump's administration. Trump met Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has favored remaining in the agreement. Chief strategist Steve Bannon supports an exit, as does Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has discussed the possibility of changing the U.S. carbon reduction targets instead of pulling out of the deal completely. Senior adviser Jared Kushner generally thinks the deal is bad but still would like to see if emissions targets can be changed. Trump's influential daughter Ivanka Trump's preference is to stay, but she has made it a priority to establish a review process so her father would hear from all sides, said a senior administration official. Like the other officials, that person was not authorized to describe the private discussions by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Wednesday in Alaska that he had "yet to read what the actual Paris Agreement is," and would have to read it before weighing in. Trump has several options, climate experts said. The emissions goals are voluntary with no real consequences for countries that fail to meet them. That means the U.S. could stay in the accord and choose not to hit its goals or stay in the pact but adjust its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has agreed to reduce its emissions by 2025 to 26 percent to 28 percent of 2005 levels — about 1.6 billion tons. "Paris more than anything is a symbol," said Nigel Purvis, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations Another option, said University of California, Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, would be for Trump to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty on which the Paris accord was based, which would take only a year. News of Trump's expected decision drew swift reaction from the United Nations. The organization's main Twitter page quoted Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as saying, "Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable." Scientists say that Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year — enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather. The Sierra Club's executive director, Michael Brune, called the expected move a "historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality." Trump claimed before taking office that climate change was a "hoax" created by the Chinese to hurt the U.S. economy, an assertion that stands in defiance of broad scientific consensus. He has spent his first months in office working to delay and roll back federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions while pledging to revive long-struggling U.S. coal mines. But Cohn, Trump's chief White House economic adviser, told reporters during the trip abroad that the president's views on climate change were "evolving" following the discussions with European leaders. Still, Cohn said that the carbon levels agreed to by the prior administration "would be highly crippling to the U.S. economic growth," and if the president had to choose between limiting carbon and economic growth, "growing our economy is going to win." Supporters of the deal say it's not an either-or choice. In this photo taken May 30, 2016, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif. speaks in San Francisco.

FILE - In this May 18, 2017 file photo, President Donald Trump speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) WASHINGTON – U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms Wednesday as President Donald Trump seemed close to pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris climate accord. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense on the question of staying or leaving, saying he was still listening to “a lot of people both ways” but promising a decision “very soon.” The White House signalled that Trump was likely to decide on exiting the global pact – fulfilling one of his principal campaign pledges – though top aides were deeply divided. And the final decision may not be entirely clear-cut: Aides were still deliberating on “caveats in the language,” one official said. Everyone cautioned that no decision was final until Trump announced it. The president has been known to change his thinking on major decisions and tends to seek counsel from both inside and outside advisers, many with differing agendas, until the last minute. Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from a raft of international allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution by reducing carbon emissions in nearly 200 nations. While travelling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and the Vatican. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world’s industrialized economies. American corporate leaders have also appealed to the businessman-turned-president to stay. They include Apple, Google and Walmart. Even fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the United States should abide by the deal. Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama enacted the deal without U.S. Senate ratification. A formal withdrawal would take years, experts say, a situation that led the president of the European Commission to speak dismissively of Trump on Wednesday. Trump doesn’t “comprehensively understand” the terms of the accord, though European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him “in clear, simple sentences” during summit meetings last week, Jean-Claude Juncker said in Berlin. “It looks like that attempt failed,” Juncker said. “This notion, ‘I am Trump, I am American, America first and I am getting out,’ that is not going to happen.” Some of Trump’s aides have been searching for a middle ground – perhaps by renegotiating the terms of the agreement – in an effort to thread the needle between his base of supporters who oppose the deal and those warning that a U.S. exit would deal a blow to the fight against global warming as well as to worldwide U.S. leadership. That fight has played out within Trump’s administration in an extraordinarily public deliberation. Trump met Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has favoured remaining in the agreement. Chief strategist Steve Bannon supports an exit, as does Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has discussed the possibility of changing the U.S. carbon reduction targets instead of pulling out of the deal completely. Senior adviser Jared Kushner generally thinks the deal is bad but still would like to see if emissions targets can be changed. Trump’s influential daughter Ivanka Trump’s preference is to stay, but she has made it a priority to establish a review process so her father would hear from all sides, said a senior administration official. Like the other officials, that person was not authorized to describe the private discussions by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Trump has several options, climate experts said. The emissions goals are voluntary with no real consequences for countries that fail to meet them. That means the U.S. could stay in the accord and choose not to hit its goals or stay in the pact but adjust its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has agreed to reduce its emissions by 2025 to 26 per cent to 28 per cent of 2005 levels – about 1.6 billion tons. “Paris more than anything is a symbol,” said Nigel Purvis, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations Another option, said University of California, Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, would be for Trump to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty on which the Paris accord was based, which would take only a year. News of Trump’s expected decision drew swift reaction from the United Nations. The organization’s main Twitter page quoted Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as saying, “Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.” Scientists say that Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year – enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather. The Sierra Club’s executive director, Michael Brune, called the expected move a “historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality.” Trump claimed before taking office that climate change was a “hoax” created by the Chinese to hurt the U.S. economy, an assertion that stands in defiance of broad scientific consensus. He has spent his first months in office working to delay and roll back federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions while pledging to revive long-struggling U.S. coal mines. But Cohn, Trump’s chief White House economic adviser, told reporters during the trip abroad that the president’s views on climate change were “evolving” following the discussions with European leaders. Still, Cohn said that the carbon levels agreed to by the prior administration “would be highly crippling to the U.S. economic growth,” and if the president had to choose between limiting carbon and economic growth, “growing our economy is going to win.” Supporters of the deal say it’s not an either-or choice. ___ Associated Press writers Catherine Lucy, Michael Biesecker and Seth Borenstein in Washington, and Lorne Cook in Brussels, contributed to this report. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Economists doubt that withdrawal will create more jobs in the United States. (Photo by Susan Walsh, The Associated Press archive) By The Associated Press WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has declared that abandoning the Paris climate agreement would be a victory for the U.S. economy. Many economists have big doubts. They say the agreement would likely help create about as many jobs in renewable energy as it might cost in polluting industries. Should the United States pull out of the pact and seek to protect old-school jobs in coal and oil, it would risk losing the chance to lead the world in developing environmentally friendly technology -- and generate the jobs that come with it. What's more, over the long haul, climate change itself threatens to impose huge costs on the economy. "Withdrawing from the Paris agreement is hardly going to create jobs in the U.S.," says Cary Coglianese, professor at the University of Pennsylvania and editor of the book "Does Regulation Kill Jobs?" ''While specific environmental regulations can sometimes lead to job losses, they also can and do lead to job gains -- with the result being roughly a wash." The Paris agreement has drawn surprising support from major companies, from oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell to other corporate giants like Walmart and Apple. "We need a framework like that to address the challenge of climate change, the risk of climate change," Exxon Mobil chief executive officer Darren Woods said Wednesday (May 31). Likewise, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told NPR earlier this month that talk of leaving the Paris accord risked creating the "unpredictability" that makes business decisions harder. And Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, tweeted that he would leave two White House advisory councils if Trump went ahead with the threat to leave the Paris accord. Under the Paris accord, almost 200 countries agreed in 2015 to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a landmark agreement to fight climate change. The pact became one of President Barack Obama's signature achievements. But Trump campaigned on a promise to nix the deal, saying it would mean stricter environmental policies that would hobble the economy and cost jobs. A White House official said Wednesday that Trump was planning to pull out of the Paris deal, although a final decision had not been made. And Trump has reversed himself before on major policy pledges, including on whether to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement, a step the president no longer favors. Economists say that leaving the Paris deal and easing efforts to control emissions would hardly deliver a big payoff in jobs. A 2001 study by Eli Berman and Linda Bui, both then at Boston University, found "no evidence that local air quality regulation substantially reduced employment" when Los Angeles imposed stricter environmental restrictions. "There's no doubt that regulations have costs, but they are not the primary driver of employment," says Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago. Polluting industries such as oil and coal are highly automated and are unlikely to embark on a major hiring spree even if the United States dropped out of the Paris agreement, analysts say. "The potential number of jobs you can create in fossil fuels is limited, while the potential number of jobs in green technologies -- in principle the sky is the limit," says Bart van Ark, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business research group. Already, the United States employs more people in solar energy (almost 374,000) than in coal (barely 160,000), according to the U.S. Department of Energy. "The perception that we have to decide between creating jobs or tackling climate change is a false choice," said Dean Garfield, president of the tech trade group ITI. "Our clean energy industry is growing and employing millions of Americans in good-paying jobs in both red and blue states as it powers more of our businesses and communities. It is not too late to for the president to stay the course and work with the tech industry to ensure that more clean energy jobs continue to go to Americans and that U.S. leadership in innovation is second to none." Many big companies say they must make long-term investment decisions based on the assumption that most countries will stiffen environmental standards. Accordingly, they are increasingly investing more in green technology. "The business sector is moving ahead anyway," van Ark says. "Businesses that are into this are into it for the long haul. Not just for four years, the term of a president." General Electric, for example, plans to invest $25 billion in clean technology research and development by 2020. "We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," GE's chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, wrote to employees in March. "Our customers, partners and countries are demanding technology that generates power while reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and reducing cost." Economists also warn that climate change could inflict a devastating effect on the global economy. Drought and water shortages could sap growth. Rising sea levels could swamp low-lying cities and farmland. A 2015 report by Stanford University's Marshall Burke and Sol Hsiang and Ted Miguel of the University of California at Berkeley found the climate change could slash 20 percent from global economic output by 2100 -- more than five times previous estimates. "Global climate change is a threat to the economy," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "Anything that we do that works to curtail global warming is an economic plus." Anything that delays the fight against climate change is "an economic negative." . . . . . . . Story by Paul Wiseman with contributions from David Koenig in Dallas.

Hastings spoke on a variety of topics—from streaming video rivals to the recent kerfuffle over Netflix movies screening at the Cannes Film Festival—in a pair of interviews on Wednesday afternoon. The Netflix CEO first appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box for an interview before joining tech journalist Peter Kafka on-stage at Recode's Code Conference. Here are some takeaways from Hastings' conversations: On Amazon Hastings referred to Amazon as "awfully scary" on CNBC that because of Amazon's big spending on original content that is intended to make it more competitive with Netflix. Much like Netflix, Amazon has been acquiring rights to original TV shows and movies in recent years, though it's still expected to spend about $1.5 billion less on original content than Netflix's expected $6 billion this year. Both streaming services have certainly given traditional Hollywood studios runs for their money, including on the awards circuit, with Netflix and Amazon each winning their first Academy Awards earlier this year. In both interviews, Hastings described Amazon's streaming model as increasingly broad. "They're trying to be Walmart. We're trying to be Starbucks," Hastings told Recode's Kafka, arguing that Amazon is trying to deliver more types of content to a wider range of audiences. "We can’t try to be them. We’re never going to be as good as them at what they’re trying to be," Hastings said. "What we can be is the emotional connection brand, like HBO." Related AppleBozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report Says Apple Bozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report Says Hastings pointed specifically to Amazon's move into live sports, with the company signing a deal to stream Thursday night NFL games in the upcoming season. He said that Netflix has no plans to stream sporting events, even as rivals like Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook sign streaming deals with major sports leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB. "The Internet doesn't yet add much value to the sports experience," he said. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Net Neutrality It wasn't long ago that Netflix and Hastings were leading the charge among online content companies pushing for net neutrality rules to ensure that Internet providers can't throttle certain websites by creating so-called "fast lanes" online. Netflix and its ilk won a major battle last year when an appeals court upheld new FCC rules that would try to keep the Internet unfettered. But under President Donald Trump and new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, the FCC now seems intent on rolling back those rules. Meanwhile, Netflix's Hastings has suddenly become relatively quiet on the matter. Speaking with Recode on Wednesday, Hastings admitted that net neutrality is "not our primary battle at this point," as the Netflix CEO seemed to concede that the Trump administration will find a way "to unwind the rules no matter what anybody says." For Netflix specifically, though, the issue is not as much of a threat as it would have been a decade ago, thanks to the company's big base of subscribers. "It’s not narrowly important to us because we’re big enough to get the deals we want," Hastings admitted. He added that net neutrality is a much more important issue for "the Netflix of 10 years ago" and for innovators and entrepreneurs that have not reached Netflix's massive scale. Peak Content Much has been made about the increase in the amount of TV and film that's available to consumers, as streaming services churn out original programming to compete with traditional networks and studios. Hastings told Recode that he does not believe that the industry is anywhere near "saturation" in terms of the amount of available programming. Instead, he noted that various tech giants like Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook all have room to try different things as they determine what role they will play in the evolving entertainment landscape—hence those companies' decisions to snatch up live sports content, among other programming. "E verybody realizes in the next 20 years, [linear TV content] is all going to move to the Internet," Hastings said. "It’s all going to be on-demand. So, you’ve got this massive ecosystem that’s going to change and everybody’s trying to figure out what piece of that [they] might own and investing in various ways." Meanwhile, Netflix's ever-growing budget for original content is still growing after increasing from roughly $5 billion last year to a planned $6 billion in 2017. Hastings told CNBC that Netflix's content budget is going to keep increasing "a lot" as the company's membership keeps growing, with Netflix nearing 100 million global subscribers. Movie Theaters Hastings told Recode that the recent controversy over Netflix's first-time movie screenings at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival earlier this month was "fantastic" because it resulted in more exposure for the two films his company had competing at the event, Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories. Netflix has often butted heads with traditional movie studios and movie theater operators who are not fond of the streaming company's aversion to screening its original films in theaters before releasing them online. But, Hastings said the debate will not last forever, as he predicts the eventual demise of traditional theatrical "windows," the periods between a film's theatrical release and its availability for home-viewing online or in the form of a Blu-Ray/DVD. "We’re in a transition period where the movie theater chains around the world are not willing to allow consumers to choose, but eventually they will," Hastings said at the conference. Later, an audience member asked Hastings if Netflix would ever consider launching its own chain of movie theaters. Hastings replied that there are "no plans" for Netflix theaters, joking that televisions are so technologically advanced that it wouldn't make sense.

The driver died of his wounds Tuesday after giving police a description of the attacker that led to her arrest. A prosecutor read in court a description of the attack that said Eliza Wasni simply climbed into a car driven by 34-year-old Grant Nelson, and stabbed him and hacked him to death early Tuesday morning. The judge ordered the girl, who was charged as an adult with first-degree murder, held without bond. The 2-page description offers no reason for the attack, but portrays Wasni as a calm girl who “nonchalantly” could be seen walking through Walmart, the knives in hand, before she walked outside without paying. Prosecutors said that Nelson, a resident of Wilmette, picked the girl up shortly after 3 a.m. Tuesday in Lincolnwood. It was her third ride in an Uber vehicle in the early morning hours of Tuesday. Two minutes after he began driving, prosecutors said that Wasni began stabbing Nelson from the back seat. Nelson was able to pull over and ran into a nearby condominium building, where he screamed, “Help me, help me! I’m going to die!” until residents called 911.

She jumped out of the vehicle and fled on foot. When Lincolnwood police arrived, they found the vehiclewith blood on both the inside and the outside, with Nelson’s phone open to the Uber app. The app said that Nelson’s passenger was someone named Eliza. Officers followed the trial of blood and found Nelson lying in grass. He was bleeding profusely from several wounds, and was able to tell the officers what had happened. He died at a nearby hospital a few hours later. Using the description given by Nelson, police found her nearby crouching behind an air conditioner — a machete in one hand and a knife in the other. Police warned her that she would be shot with a Taser if she did not drop the weapons, and when she did not comply an officer used the Taser. Wasni dropped the knives and was taken into custody. Police said she did not make a statement. According to prosecutors, police recovered a shirt the girl could be seen wearing in the Walmart. The shirt had blood on it. Uber officials said the company was working with police to provide information relevant to the investigation. “We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners,” Uber said in a statement. “Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” Nelson’s sister, Alex Nelson, told WMAQ-TV in Chicago that her brother was a good person. “He was not a vindictive person,” Alex Nelson said. “He was not a cruel person. He didn’t deserve this fate.” It is the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, police said.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Analysis 7 takeaways from Mary Meeker’s 2017 Internet Trends report Kevin Kelleher@kpkelleher May 31, 2017 1:45 PM Above: Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker at the Code Conference. Image Credit: Dylan Tweney/VentureBeat Mary Meeker’s Internet Trends report has become an annual ritual for Silicon Valley. It’s as if the tech industry had an annual physical exam and received a health report in the form of a 355-page presentation. As in years past, Meeker’s 2017 report contained a few notable trends in its firehose of data points, which are interesting in how they show the tech industry evolving. Here are some of the key takeaways. Growth in Internet population is slowing, but growth in online ads is accelerating. The number of global users on the Internet reached 3.4 billion in 2016, equal to 46 percent of the world’s population. That’s more than double the figure in 2009, but the growth rate has flatlined around 10 percent a year for the past five years. Meanwhile, growth in online advertising is accelerating, at least in the U.S. Digital advertising rose 22 percent to $73 billion last year, up from 20 percent in 2015 and 15 percent in 2014. Unsurprisingly, the growth is coming from mobile ads, which is growing fast enough to more than offset a decline in desktop ads. Meeker said that the amount of money spent on digital ads will surpass spending on TV ads sometime in the next six months. Ecommerce growth is also accelerating. That online-retail sales is growing year after year is a given. But the pace of growth has been accelerating for the past three years, rising steadily from 14 percent in 2013 to 15 percent last year. Credit Amazon, of course, but Walmart is also seeing new online growth in the wake of its purchase of deep-discount site Jet.com. Meanwhile, physical retailers are expected to close nearly 1,700 shops in the U.S., the largest number in 20 years, the report says. Those closings have more to do with unwise overexpansion in recent years than Amazon or ecommerce in general. Gaming continues to lead and shape the online experience. Another unsurprising insight concerns the growth and popularity in gaming, but it’s interesting to see the figures Meeker has collected to show that growth. Meeker estimates that there are 2.6 billion gamers around the world, up from 100 million in 1995. The gaming industry generated $100 billion in global revenue last year, with nearly half of that, $47 billion, coming from Asia. Games are central to defining the overall online experience. In her presentation, Meeker speculated that they may be preparing society for the rise of human-computer interaction. Revenue in the music industry is rising again. The Internet has not been kind to the music recording industry. For the past 16 years, revenue has declined by an average of 4 percent a year. The rate of decline had slowed in the past several years as downloaded and streaming music began to offset the vanishing sales of CDs. Last year, overall music revenue grew by 11% to more than $12 billion, its highest figure since 2009. Subscription and streaming revenue made up more than half of the total figure for the first time. Digital health care is approaching an inflection point. Health care is at once a data-driven industry and one that is perhaps the worst at managing data. Meeker says health care “is at a digital inflection point,” one of those terms that act as red meat for investors because it signals strong growth ahead. The rise of fitness trackers and health apps are collecting more user data than ever, while hospitals are sharing more health care information with patients. The average hospital holds 50 petabytes of health care data, and the total amount of that data is growing by 48 percent a year, Meeker says. The bottleneck to analyzing that data is patient privacy. Health care data can be used to the benefit and the detriment of patients. A survey of consumers asking which tech companies they’d share their health data with shows 60 percent trust Google and 56 percent trust Microsoft. Less trusted are Amazon and Facebook — only 39 percent of consumers would share health data with them. China is growing as a tech rival to the U.S. The biggest market caps in tech belong to none other than the Big Four: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook. Together, they are worth a collective $2.4 trillion. But seven of the next 16 on the list are Chinese companies like Tencent and Alibaba. Those seven are worth $929 billion in aggregate. U.S. companies may still dominate the money invested in tech, but China’s rivals are quickly catching up. Immigrants are core to the Valley’s DNA. The story of Silicon Valley is in good part the story of immigrants who have played a part in building and shaping its technology. Meeker looked at the 25 most highly valued tech companies and found that 15 of them had founders who were first- or second-generation Americans. The shift in the Trump Administration’s “America first” stance on work visas may put that in jeopardy. To underscore the importance of foreign workers and founders in tech, Meeker showed that half of the most highly valued private tech companies were founded by first-generation immigrants. Those companies — including Uber, SpaceX, and Slack — have created 48,000 jobs.

Updated: June 4, 2017 @ 10:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP The Latest: Sister calls Uber driver's death horrifying, sad May 31, 2017 Updated May 31, 2017 0 LINCOLNWOOD, Ill. (AP) — The Latest on charges filed against teenager in death of Uber driver. (all times local): 8 p.m. Horrifying and saddening is how the sister of an Uber driver is describing his death, allegedly at the hands of a teenage Chicago girl who is charged as an adult with first-degree murder. Prosecutors said Wednesday 16-year-old Eliza Wasni walked out of a suburban Chicago Walmart holding a machete and knife she'd stolen, climbed into an Uber car and began hacking at Grant Nelson. The 34-year-old Nelson of Wilmette died of his wounds Tuesday after giving police a description of the attacker. Police say they tracked down Wasni after she crashed Nelson's car and tried to flee on foot. She was in possession of the machete and knife. Nelson's sister, Alexandra, says his death is a loss of intelligence, conversation, nuance and thoughtfulness that he brought to into many lives. Assistant Public Defender David McMahon says Wasni has no previous criminal record, attends high school and lives with her mother. ___ 3:15 p.m. Prosecutors say a teenage girl used a stolen machete and a knife during a fatal attack on a suburban Chicago Uber driver. Eliza Wasni is charged as an adult with first-degree murder in the death of Grant Nelson of Wilmette. A Cook County judge on Wednesday ordered the 16-year-old Wasni of Chicago held without bond. Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham says the 34-year-old Nelson picked up the girl near a Walmart in Skokie, from which she stole the machete. Within minutes, she was attacking Nelson. He managed to stop his car and run into a condominium building lobby where he sought help. Cunningham says Wasni drove off in Nelson's car, struck a median and then ran off. She was apprehended moments later after removing a bloody shirt. Authorities say Nelson was able to describe his attacker to police before dying at a nearby hospital. A public defender would only say Wasni attended a Chicago high school and lives with a single mother. ___ 1:26 p.m. Authorities say a 16-year-old girl has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder and accused of stabbing her Uber driver to death in suburban Chicago. Lincolnwood police say they responded to a report of a man screaming for help at about 3:20 a.m. Tuesday when they found 34-year-old Grant Nelson of Wilmette with multiple stab wounds. They say Nelson told them he was a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber and that his passenger stabbed him. Police say they located Eliza Wasni near the crime scene in possession of two weapons they believe she used in the stabbing. Nelson died later at a nearby hospital. The Cook County state's attorney's office says Wasni is scheduled to appear in bond court Wednesday afternoon in Skokie. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

He even praised Mr Trump's appointment of former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State because Mr Tillerson said he believed climate change is real and he also supported a carbon tax on companies to discourage high emissions.  Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017 Mr Musk, whose Tesla vehicles do not use gasoline or diesel fuel, is committed to moving away from fossil fuels and towards cleaners sources of energy. Tesla also manufacturers solar panels. The US is currently one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world, so if Mr Trump was to pull the country out of the pact signed by nearly 200 countries to reduce such carbon emissions it would be a major blow to a deal that aims to help avert the worst effects of climate change. Other major companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Walmart, and electronics retailer Best Buy have committed to reducing carbon footprints of their supply chains in part due to consumer demand.  Following a number of reports in US media about the move, Mr Trump tweeted that he would be announcing “my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days” followed by his campaign slogan “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later said to expect Mr Trump's decision "very soon".

He continued the rhetoric in the White House that he would grow the US coal sector and bring back those and manufacturing jobs to the US.  Many developing countries rely on cheap sources of fossil fuels to help grow their economies to catch up with developed economies like those of the EU, Japan, Canada, and the US.  However, India and China have begun to rapidly scale up their solar power investments and capabilities in response to the Paris Agreement and to minimise the negative effects of climate change-related natural disasters like drought and flood.  President Barack Obama ratified the agreement in 2016 through executive order, bypassing the approval process in what the administration felt was a hostile Congress influenced heavily by climate-deniers and oil and gas industry lobbyists.  This is what gives Mr Trump the authority to withdraw the US from the agreement in a three-year process or take the US out of the underlying United Nations climate accord all together - a process that would be much faster and in line with Mr Trump’s ire towards the UN.  Read more Elon Musk suggests that Trump may be good for climate change Elon Musk starts digging huge holes underneath America Tesla delivers new record of 25,000 electric cars in three months Elon Musk to raise objections to Trump's 'Muslim ban' at meeting Many Tesla consumers and supporters criticised Mr Musk for maintaining his relationship with the White House in light of all this, but he has said he could influence policy from within if he remained in good standing on the 19-member business council.  If Mr Trump withdraws from the Paris Agreement he would put the US in the company of Nicaragua and Syria. Russia is the only one of the top emitters not to even ratify the Paris accord.  More about: Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX climate change Paris Agreement Donald Trump Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Many economists have big doubts. They say the agreement would likely help create about as many jobs in renewable energy as it might cost in polluting industries. Should the United States pull out of the pact and seek to protect old-school jobs in coal and oil, it would risk losing the chance to lead the world in developing environmentally friendly technology — and generate the jobs that come with it. What’s more, over the haul, climate change itself threatens to impose huge costs on the economy. “Withdrawing from the Paris agreement is hardly going to create jobs in the U.S.,” says Cary Coglianese, professor at the University of Pennsylvania and editor of the book “Does Regulation Kill Jobs?” ”While specific environmental regulations can sometimes lead to job losses, they also can and do lead to job gains — with the result being roughly a wash.” Download our Expert Edition e-book, Cyber: Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation. Advertisement The Paris agreement has drawn surprising support from major companies, from oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell to other corporate giants like Walmart and Apple. “We need a framework like that to address the challenge of climate change, the risk of climate change,” Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon Mobil, said Wednesday. Likewise, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told NPR earlier this month that talk of leaving the Paris accord risked creating the “unpredictability” that makes business decisions harder. Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, tweeted that he would leave two White House advisory councils if Trump went ahead with this threat to leave the Paris accord. Under the Paris accord, nearly 200 nations agreed in 2015 to voluntarily cut greenhouse gas emissions in a landmark agreement to fight climate change. The pact became one of President Barack Obama’s signature achievements. But Trump campaigned on a promise to nix the deal, saying it would mean stricter environmental policies that would hobble the economy and cost jobs. A White House official said Wednesday that Trump was planning to pull out of the Paris deal, although a final decision had not been made. And Trump has reversed himself before on major policy pledges, including on whether to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement, a step the president no longer favors. The true impact of cutting EPA's budget. Economists say that leaving the Paris deal and easing efforts to control emissions would hardly deliver a big payoff in jobs. A 2001 study by Eli Berman and Linda Bui, both then at Boston University, found “no evidence that local air quality regulation substantially reduced employment” when Los Angeles imposed stricter environmental restrictions. “There’s no doubt that regulations have costs, but they are not the primary driver of employment,” says Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago. Polluting industries such as oil and coal are highly automated and are unlikely to embark on a major hiring spree even if the United States dropped out of the Paris agreement, experts say. “The potential number of jobs you can create in fossil fuels is limited, while the potential number of jobs in green technologies — in principle the sky is the limit,” says Bart van Ark, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business research group. Already, the United States employs more people in solar energy (nearly 374,000) than in coal (a little over 160,000), according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The perception that we have to decide between creating jobs or tackling climate change is a false choice,” said Dean Garfield, president of the tech trade group ITI. “Our clean energy industry is growing and employing millions of Americans in good-paying jobs in both red and blue states as it powers more of our businesses and communities. It is not too late to for the president to stay the course and work with the tech industry to ensure that more clean energy jobs continue to go to Americans and that U.S. leadership in innovation is second to none.” Many big companies say they must make long-term investment decisions based on the assumption that most countries will stiffen environmental standards. Accordingly, they are increasingly investing more in green technology. “The business sector is moving ahead anyway,” van Ark says. “Businesses that are into this are into it for the long haul. Not just for four years, the term of a president.” General Electric, for instance, plans to invest $25 billion in clean technology research and development by 2020. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” GE’s chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, wrote to employees in a blog post in March. “Our customers, partners and countries are demanding technology that generates power while reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and reducing cost.” Economists also warn that climate change could inflict a devastating impact on the global economy. Drought and water shortages could sap growth. Rising sea levels could swamp low-lying cities and farmland. A 2015 report by Stanford University’s Marshall Burke and the University of California, Berkeley’s Sol Hsiang and Ted Miguel found the climate change could slash 20 percent from global economic output by 2100 — more than five times previous estimates. “Global climate change is a threat to the economy,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Anything that we do that works to curtail global warming is an economic plus.” Anything that delays the fight against climate change is “an economic negative.” ___ AP Business Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this story.
